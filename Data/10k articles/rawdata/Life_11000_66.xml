      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4935">'''Abd al-Razzaq Maymandi''' ({{lang-fa|عبدالرزاق میمندی}}; died 11th-century) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|pp=578-583}} ''[[vizier]]'' of the [[Ghaznavid]] Sultan [[Maw'dud Ghaznavi]] and [[Abd al-Rashid of Ghazna|Abd al-Rashid]].

== Biography ==
Abd al-Razzaq was the son of [[Ahmad Maymandi]], a prominent Persian nobleman who served as the vizier of the Ghaznavid Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=5}} and the latter's son [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]].{{sfn|Richards|2014|p=48}} During his early life, Abd al-Razzaq, along with his brothers were tutored by [[Abu Sahl Zawzani]].{{sfn|Yusofi|1983|pp=373-374}}

He started his career during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni, but when his father fell into disgrace in 1024, he along with Abd al-Razzaq were imprisoned at [[Nandana]] in [[Punjab]]. Mahmud died six years later, which threw the Ghaznavid Empire into a civil war; Mahmud's two sons Mas'ud I and [[Mohammad Ghaznavi]] both claimed the Ghaznavid throne. However, it was Mas'ud who managed to emerge victorious during the civil war. He then ordered the release of Abd al-Razzaq and Ahmad.

Abd al-Razzaq later participated in the [[battle of Dandanaqan]] against the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq Turks]]. The Ghaznavid army, was, however, defeated and thus the Ghaznavid Empire lost all of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. During the reign of Ma'sud's successor, [[Maw'dud Ghaznavi]], Abd al-Razzaq became a prominent figure in the Ghaznavid Empire and was appointed as his vizier in 1043.{{sfn|Bosworth|2010|pp=157-158}} Abd al-Razzaq then served as the vizier of the Empire over seven years until the death of Mawdud in 1050. After the death of Maw'dud, civil war began once again. During the civil war, Abd al-Razzaq freed [[Abd al-Rashid of Ghazna|Abd al-Rashid]] from prison and proclaimed him as the Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire.

In 1052, [[Toghrul of Ghazna]], a Turkish slave general, deposed Abd al-Rashid and proclaimed himself as the Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire. One year later, [[Farrukh-Zad of Ghazna]], a Ghaznavid prince, defeated Toghrul and made order in the Ghaznavid Empire. Abd al-Razzaq also occupied high officies during the reign of Farrukh-Zad, but not as a vizier. Not much more is known about Abd al-Razzaq, he is last mentioned in 1058, and probably died a few years later. He had a nephew named Mansur ibn Sa'id, who also continued to occupy high offices under Ghaznavids.{{sfn|Bosworth|2010|pp=157-158}}

The '''Absolution of the dead''' (or '''Absoute''' from the [[French language|French]]) is a series of [[prayers]] for [[pardon]] and remission of [[sin]]s that are a practice observed in some [[Christian]] religions over the body of a deceased believer before [[Christian burial|disposition]]. The practice is found in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] as well as the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Both religions use this practice to ask God not to have the deceased suffer for transgressions during life that they have repented or have been forgiven.

==Roman Catholic practice==
In the [[Catholic Church]] the ''Absolute'' are said over a deceased Catholic following a [[Requiem Mass]] and before [[burial]]. The absolution of the dead does not forgive sins or confer the sacramental [[absolution]] of the [[Sacrament of Penance]]. Rather, it is a series of prayers to God that the person's soul will not have to suffer the temporal punishment in [[purgatory]] due for sins which were forgiven during the person's life.

The absolution of the dead is only performed in context of the [[Extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|Extraordinary or Tridentine form Mass]], but is absent from the funeral liturgy of the renewed [[Ordinary form of the Roman Rite|Ordinary form Mass]].

===Liturgy===
After the Requiem Mass has concluded, the celebrant removes the [[chasuble]] and puts on the black [[cope]]. The [[subdeacon]], bearing the [[processional cross]] and accompanied by the [[acolyte]]s, goes to the head of the coffin (i.e. facing the altar in the case of a layman, but between the coffin and the altar in the case of a priest), while the celebrant stands opposite at the foot. The assisting clergy are grouped around and the celebrant, who at once begin the prayer ''Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo'', praying that the deceased "may deserve to escape the avenging judgment, who, whilst he lived, was marked with the seal of the holy Trinity". This is followed by the responsory ''[[Libera me Domine]]'', which is sung by the choir.&lt;ref name="Thurston"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03071a.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Christian Burial." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 5 Apr. 2009 &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03071a.htm&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the celebrant says the ''[[Kyrie eleison]]'' aloud followed by the [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]]. While the Our Father is repeated in silence by all, the celebrant walks around the coffin, sprinkling it with [[holy water]] and bowing profoundly before the processional cross when he passes it. He then takes the [[thurible]] and incenses the coffin. Finally after finishing the Our Father and repeating one or two short versicles to which answer is made by the clergy, the celebrant pronounces the prayer of absolution, most commonly in the following form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"O God, Whose attribute it is always to have mercy and to spare, we humbly present our prayers to Thee for the soul of Thy servant N. which Thou has this day called out of this world, beseeching Thee not to deliver it into the hands of the enemy, nor to forget it for ever, but to command Thy holy angels to receive it, and to bear it into paradise; that as it has believed and hoped in Thee it may be delivered from the pains of hell and inherit eternal life through Christ our Lord. Amen."&lt;ref name="Thurston"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the absolution, the body is taken out of the church while the choir sings the ''[[In paradisum]]''.

If the body is not present, or on other occasions such as [[All Souls' Day]] or Requiem Masses on the anniversary of death, a [[catafalque]] or [[bier]] covered by a black [[Pall (cloth)|pall]] may stand in the place of the body for the absolution. If a catafalque is not available, a black pall may be laid on the floor to stand in place the body.

==Eastern Orthodox practice==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the ''Prayer of Absolution'' is written out on a piece of paper. After the singing of [[Memory eternal]] at the end of an [[Christian burial|Orthodox funeral]], the prayer is read by the [[bishop]] or [[priest]] presiding over the funeral, or by the deceased's [[spiritual father]]. He stands near the coffin and, facing the deceased, reads the prayer:

:Our Lord Jesus Christ, by His divine grace, as also by the gift of the power vouchsafed unto His holy [[Disciple (Christianity)|Disciples]] and [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s, that they should bind and loose the sins of men: (For He said unto them: Receive ye the Holy Spirit: Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whosesoever sins ye retain they are retained. And whatsoever ye shall bind or loose upon earth shall be bound or loosed also in heaven.) By that same power, also, transmitted unto us from them, this my spiritual child, ''N.'', is absolved, through me, unworthy though I be, from all things wherein, as mortal, he (''she'') hath sinned against God, whether in word, or deed, or thought, and with all his (''her'') senses, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, whether wittingly or through ignorance. If he (''she'') be under the ban or excommunication of a bishop, or of a Priest; or hath incurred the curse of his (''her'') father or mother; or hath fallen under his (''her'') own curse; or hath sinned by any oath; or hath been bound, as man, by any sins whatsoever, but hath repented him (''her'') thereof, with contrition of heart: he (''she'') is now absolved from all those faults and bonds. May all those things which have proceeded from the weakness of his (''her'') mortal nature be consigned to oblivion and be remitted unto him (''her''); Through His loving-kindness; through the prayers of our most holy, and blessed, and glorious Lady, the [[Theotokos|Mother of our Lord]] and [[Perpetual virginity of Mary|ever-virgin Mary]]; of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles and of all the Saints. Amen.

The paper is then rolled up and placed in the hand of the departed.

The Prayer of Absolution is understood as the means by which "the Church remits all the departed's transgressions, absolves him from all obligations, all pledges or oaths, and sends him off in peace into life everlasting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The reading of the Prayer of Absolution is a more recent practice and replaces the older (and shorter) ''Parting Prayer'':&lt;ref name="Hapggod"&gt;{{Citation

:May the Lord Jesus Christ our God, Who gave His divine commands to His holy Disciples and Apostles, that they should bind and loose the sins of the fallen (we, in turn, having received from them the right to do the same) pardon thee, O spiritual child, all thy deeds done amiss in this life, both voluntary and involuntary: Now, and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

===Funerals of children===
The Prayer of Absolution is not read in the Funeral for a Child (a special funeral used for children under the age of seven), since such young children are not generally held to be morally responsible for their sins, but is replaced by the following prayer:

:O Lord, Who guardest little children in this present life, and hast prepared for them in the life which is to come a spacious place, even [[Bosom of Abraham|Abraham's bosom]], and angelic abodes brightly radiant which befit their purity, wherein the souls of the righteous dwell: Do Thou, the same Lord Christ, receive the soul of Thy servant, the child, ''N.'', with peace. For thou hast said: Suffer the little children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven. For unto Thee are due all glory, honour and worship, with the [[God the Father|Father]] and the [[Holy Spirit]], now, and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.&lt;ref name="Hapggod" /&gt;{{rp|433–4}}

'''Akrasia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|r|eɪ|z|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀκρασία|ἀκρασία]]}}, "lacking command"), occasionally transliterated as '''acrasia''' or Anglicised as '''acrasy''' or '''acracy''', is described as a lack of self-control or the state of acting against one's better judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ad6grll-ak&amp;t=339s?t=5m49s | title=College Info Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjectival form is "akratic".&lt;ref&gt;Although this philosopher's technical term is usually employed in its Greek form (i.e., '''akrasia'''/'''akratic''') in English texts, it was once the philosophers' English language convention to use the precise English equivalent of '''akrasia/akratic''', '''[[wikt:incontinence|incontinence]]'''/'''incontinent'''. However, it now seems that the correct, widely established convention is to use the term '''akrasia'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical approaches==
[[Image:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|Portrait in marble of [[Socrates]], who was an early investigator of akrasia]]
The problem goes back at least as far as Plato. In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' [[Socrates]] asks precisely how it is possible that, ''if'' one judges action A to be the best course of action, one would do anything other than A?

In the [[dialogue]] ''Protagoras'', Socrates attests that akrasia does not exist, claiming "No one goes willingly toward the bad" (358d). If a person examines a situation and decides to act in the way he determines to be best, he will pursue this action, as the best course is also the good course, i.e. man's natural goal.  An all-things-considered assessment of the situation will bring full knowledge of a decision's outcome and worth linked to well-developed principles of the good. A person, according to Socrates, never chooses to act poorly or against his better judgment; and, therefore, actions that go against what is best are simply a product of being ignorant of facts or knowledge of what is best or good.

[[Aristotle]], on the other hand, took a more empirical approach to the question, acknowledging that we intuitively believe in akrasia. He distances himself from the Socratic position by locating the breakdown of reasoning in an agent’s opinion, not his [[appetition]]. Now, without recourse to appetitive desires, Aristotle reasons that akrasia occurs as a result of opinion. Opinion is formulated mentally in a way that may or may not imitate truth, while appetites are merely desires of the body. Thus, opinion is only incidentally aligned with or opposed to the good, making an akratic action the product of opinion instead of reason. For Aristotle, the antonym of ''akrasia'' is ''[[enkrateia]]'', which means "in power" (over oneself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Akr|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Kraut|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=14 July 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''akrasia'' occurs twice in the [[Koine Greek]] [[New Testament]]. In {{Bibleverse|Matthew|23:25}} [[Jesus]] uses it to describe hypocritical religious leaders, translated "self-indulgence" in several translations, including the English Standard version. [[Paul the Apostle]] also gives the threat of temptation through akrasia as a reason for a husband and wife to not deprive each other of sex ({{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|7:5}}). In another passage (Rom. 7:15–25) Paul, without actually using the term ''akrasia'', seems to reference the same psychological phenomenon in discussing the internal conflict between, on the one hand, "the law of God," which he equates with "the law of my mind"; and "another law in my members," identified with "the flesh, the law of sin." "For the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do." (v.19)

In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', book II, Acrasia, the embodiment of intemperance dwelling in the "Bower of Bliss", had the [[Circe]]-like capacity of transforming her lovers into monstrous animal shapes.

==Contemporary approaches==
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1969–1980) attempted to solve the problem by first criticizing earlier thinkers who wanted to limit the scope of akrasia to agents who despite having reached a [[Rational choice theory|rational decision]] were somehow swerved off their "desired" tracks.  Indeed, Davidson expands akrasia to include any judgment that is reached but not fulfilled, whether it be as a result of an opinion, a real or imagined good, or a moral belief. "[T]he puzzle I shall discuss depends only on the attitude or belief of the agent…my subject concerns evaluative judgments, whether they are analyzed cognitively, prescriptively, or otherwise."  Thus, he expands akrasia to include cases in which the agent seeks to fulfill desires, for example, but ends up denying himself the pleasure he has deemed most choice-worthy.

Davidson sees the problem as one of reconciling the following apparently [[inconsistent triad]]:
* If an agent believes A to be better than B, then they want to do A more than B.
* If an agent wants to do A more than B, then they will do A rather than B if they only do one.
* Sometimes an agent acts against their better judgment.

Davidson solves the problem by saying that, when people act in this way, they temporarily believe that the worse course of action is better, because they have not made an all-things-considered judgment, but only a judgment based on a subset of possible considerations.

Another contemporary philosopher, [[Amélie Rorty]] (1980) has tackled the problem by distilling out akrasia's many forms.  She contends that akrasia is manifested in different stages of the [[practical reasoning]] process. She enumerates four types of akrasia: akrasia of direction or aim, of interpretation, of irrationality, and of character.  She separates the practical reasoning process into four steps, showing the breakdown that may occur between each step and how each constitutes an akratic state.

Another explanation is that there are different forms of [[motivation]] which can conflict with each other. Throughout the ages, many have identified a conflict between [[reason]] and [[emotion]], which might make it possible to believe that one should do A rather than B, but still end up wanting to do B more than A.

Psychologist [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] argues that akrasia results from the empirically verified phenomenon of [[hyperbolic discounting]], which causes us to make different judgements close to a reward than we will when further from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Weakness of will==
Richard Holton (1999), argues that weakness of the will involves revising one's [[wikt:resolution|resolution]]s too easily. Under this view, it is possible to act against one's better judgment (that is, be akratic), but without being weak-willed. Suppose, for example, Sarah ''judges'' that taking revenge upon a murderer is not the best course of action, but makes the resolution to take revenge anyway and sticks to that resolution.  According to Holton, Sarah behaves akratically but does not show weakness of will. &lt;!-- holds to that intention? As in she does actually make an attempt on the murderer? --&gt;

'''Ali Morteza Samsam Bakhtiari''' (1945 – October 30, 2007) was an Iranian author and oil expert employed by the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC).  He held a number of senior positions with this organization beginning in 1971. He was also an adviser to the [[Oil Depletion Analysis Centre]].

==Biography==
Bakhtiari was a member of the [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] tribe.

He held a Ph.D. in [[chemical engineering]] from the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].  He had been a part-time lecturer for the Technical Faculty at [[Tehran University]] for many years.  Bakhtiari wrote a number of short essays and is the author of ''Peaks and Troughs'' which is about the modern [[history of Iran]].

Bakhtiari suggested that it would require an act of god for the world to avoid warring over depleting [[energy]] [[Natural resource|resources]].  He also believed that a peak in [[natural gas]] would be more shocking than [[peak oil]] because natural gas is less fluid and requires [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and [[LNG]] facilities to export overseas.

Bakhtiari was featured in the 2004 documentary ''[[The End of Suburbia]]''.

Bakhtiari died suddenly of a heart attack in 2007. His funeral and burial were in Tehran.  He was survived by his children, Amir Bahman and Golbenaz Samsam Bakhtiari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Steve|title=Remembering and Learning from a Legend|url=http://www.aspo-usa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=264&amp;Itemid=91|accessdate=9 August 2017|publisher=Association for the Study of Peak Oil &amp; Gas (ASPO-USA)|date=4 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215172525/http://www.aspo-usa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=264&amp;Itemid=91|archivedate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
*"The big risk in Saudi Arabia is that [[Ghawar]]'s rate of decline increases to an alarming point.  That will set bells ringing all over the oil world because Ghawar underpins Saudi output and Saudi undergirds worldwide production." 
*"As for Iran, the usually accepted official {{convert|132|Goilbbl|m3}} is almost {{convert|100|Goilbbl|m3}} over any realistic assay."

'''Artificial life''' (often abbreviated '''ALife''' or '''A-Life''') is a field of study wherein researchers examine [[system]]s related to natural [[life]], its processes, and its evolution, through the use of [[simulation]]s with [[computer models]], [[robotics]], and [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/artificial%20life|title=Dictionary.com definition|accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline was named by [[Christopher Langton]], an American theoretical biologist, in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;cd=1#v=onepage The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences], The MIT Press, p.37. {{ISBN|978-0-262-73144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main kinds of alife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/~mab/publications/papers/BedauTICS03.pdf|title=Artificial life: organization, adaptation and complexity from the bottom up|author=Mark A.

== Overview ==
Artificial life studies the fundamental processes of [[living system]]s in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that define such systems.  These topics are broad, but often include [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary dynamics]], [[Emergence|emergent properties of collective systems]], [[Biomimetics|biomimicry]], as well as related issues about the [[Philosophy of biology|philosophy of the nature of life]] and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works.

== Philosophy ==

The modeling philosophy of artificial life strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only "life-as-we-know-it" but also "life-as-it-might-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Langton, C. G. 1992. [http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf Artificial Life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225322/http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf |date=March 11, 2007 }}. Addison-Wesley. ., section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.

Vladimir Georgievich Red'ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process, leading to the more general distinction of "processes-as-we-know-them" and "processes-as-they-could-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Red'ko, V. G. 1999. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MATHME.html Mathematical Modeling of Evolution]. in: F. Heylighen, C. Joslyn and V. Turchin (editors): Principia Cybernetica Web (Principia Cybernetica, Brussels). For the importance of ALife modeling from a cosmic perspective, see also Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death, ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) p. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the commonly accepted [[Life#Definitions|definition of life]] does not consider any current alife simulations or [[software]] to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any [[ecosystem]]. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:

* The ''strong alife'' (cf. [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|Strong AI]]) position states that "life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium" ([[John von Neumann]]) {{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=There seems to be no original source for this quote, and in fact if you restrict a web search to pages that don't contain the phrase artificial life, there are only a handful left.}}. Notably, [[Thomas S. Ray|Tom Ray]] declared that his program [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas S. Ray|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=C. C.|editor2-last=Farmer|editor2-first=J. D.|editor3-last=Rasmussen|editor3-first=S|title=An approach to the synthesis of life|journal=Artificial Life II, Santa Fe Institute Studies in the Sciences of Complexity|date=1991|volume=XI|pages=371–408|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Redwood City, CA|language=English|quote=The intent of this work is to synthesize rather than simulate life.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711051305/http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|archivedate=2015-07-11|accessdate=24 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''weak alife'' position denies the possibility of generating a "living process" outside of a chemical solution. Its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena.

==Software-based ("soft")==

=== Techniques ===
*[[cellular automaton|Cellular automata]] were used in the early days of artificial life, and are still often used for ease of [[scalability]] and [[parallelization]].  Alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history.
*[[Artificial neural network]]s are sometimes used to model the brain of an agent.  Although traditionally more of an [[artificial intelligence]] technique, neural nets can be important for simulating [[population dynamics]] of organisms that can ''learn''.  The symbiosis between learning and evolution is central to theories about the development of instincts in organisms with higher neurological complexity, as in, for instance, the [[Baldwin effect]].

====Program-based====
{{Further|programming game}}
Program-based simulations contain organisms with a complex DNA language, usually [[Turing complete]].  This language is more often in the form of a computer program than actual biological DNA.  Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism "lives" when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing [[self-replication]]. Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of [[cellular automata]] is common but not required. Another example could be an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent system/program]].

====Module-based====
Individual modules are added to a creature.  These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion).  Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.

====Parameter-based====
Organisms are generally constructed with pre-defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate.  That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other ''finite'' parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well-defined way.

====Neural net–based====
These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative.  Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers  use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

==Hardware-based ("hard")==
{{Further|Robot}}
Hardware-based artificial life mainly consist of ''robots'', that is, [[automation|automatically]] guided [[machine]]s able to do tasks on their own.

==Biochemical-based ("wet")==
{{Further|Synthetic biology}}
Biochemical-based life is studied in the field of [[synthetic biology]]. It involves e.g. the creation of [[synthetic DNA]]. The term "wet" is an extension of the term "[[wetware (brain)|wetware]]".

The '''Aurora programme''' (sometimes called '''Aurora Exploration Programme''', or simply '''Exploration Programme''') is a [[human spaceflight]] [[List of human spaceflight programs|programme]] of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) established in 2001. The objective is to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for [[Space exploration|exploration]] of the [[Solar System]] using [[robotic spacecraft]] and [[human spaceflight]] to investigate bodies holding promise for traces of [[Astrobiology|life beyond the Earth]].&lt;ref name='Overview'&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora| title = The European Space Exploration Programme Aurora | publisher = [[ESA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/topic/exploration/moon-to-mars/assessing-aurora/ |title=Assessing Aurora |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=April 7, 2007 |accessdate=2015-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Member states commit to participation in the Aurora programme for five-year periods, after which they can change their level of participation or pull out entirely. In the early years the Aurora programme planned for flagship missions and arrow missions for key technology demonstrations, such as Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule and Mars aerocapture demonstrator. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the [[ExoMars]] mission and preparations for an international [[Mars sample return mission]].&lt;ref name='Overview'/&gt;

{{quote|The objective of the Aurora Programme is first to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for the robotic and human exploration of solar system bodies holding promise for traces of life. |ESA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Aurora programme was a response to Europe's Strategy for space which  was endorsed by [[European Union Council of Research]] and the ESA Council.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Aurora_s_origins]&lt;/ref&gt; Europe strategy for space had three main points including:"explore the solar system and the Universe", "stimulate new technology", and "inspire the young people of Europe to take a greater interest in science and technology".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the foundational principles of the Aurora program is recognising the interdependence of technology and exploration;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt;

==Missions==
[[Image:ExoMars model at ILA 2006.jpg|thumb|ExoMars rover model (for the 2020 launch)]]
The first decade is planned to focus on [[robot]]ic missions.

===Flagship missions===
[[File:ExoMars 2016 Launch.jpg|thumb|ExoMars launches in 2016]]
ESA describes some Aurora programme missions as "Flagship" missions. The first Flagship mission is [[ExoMars]], a dual robotic mission to [[Mars]] made in cooperation with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roskosmos). It will involve development of a Mars orbiter ([[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]]), a technology demonstrator [[lander (spacecraft)|descent module]] (Schiaparelli lander) and the [[ExoMars rover]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEM1NVZKQAD_0.html | title = ExoMars | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship missions considered for the Aurora programme include:
* ''[[ExoMars]]'', consisting of an uncrewed Mars orbiter and lander launched jointly with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2016 on Proton rocket with Fregat upper stage.
* [[ExoMars rover]] launch to be conducted jointly the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2020
* a robotic ''[[Mars Sample Return Mission]]'' by the mid-2020s 
* a human space mission to be launched in the mid-2030s

===Arrow missions===
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
''Arrow missions'' are technology demonstrator missions focused on developing a certain technology needed for the Flagship missions. Approved Arrow missions so far (as of January 30, 2003):
*''Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule'', a step in the preparations for the ''Mars Sample Return'' mission.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*''Mars aerocapture demonstrator'', to further develop the technologies for using a planet's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] to brake into orbit. This particular mission seems to have been revised into an expanded mission to demonstrate "aerobraking/aerocapture, solar electric propulsion and soft landing" to be launched in 2020. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
{{see also|Schiaparelli EDM lander}}

==Timeline==
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
The proposed Aurora roadmap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMXZY274OD_index_0.html |title=Aurora’s roadmap to Mars / Exploration / Human Spaceflight / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |date=2003-12-19 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as of September 30, 2005. This roadmap can, and most likely will, go through revisions):
* 2014 – Human mission technologies demonstrator(s) to validate technologies for orbital assembly and docking, life support and human habitation{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2016 and 2020 – [[ExoMars rover]] to Mars. The scientific objectives include exobiological studies as well as study of the surface of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study ExoMars|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/exomars|publisher=UK Government Space Agency|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2024 – Human mission to the Moon{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2026 – Automatic mission to Mars{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2030s – First human mission to Mars, as a split mission. The proposed Ariane M rocket may be used for this landing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The human part of the programme has been challenged by the main ESA contributors (France, Germany and Italy), making it quite possible that the whole Aurora Programme will be refocused on robotic-only exploration of Mars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Isabelle Bruce "Belle" Reid''' (21 December 1883 – 13 December 1945) was an Australian [[veterinarian]]. She was the first woman to qualify as a veterinarian in Australia, and established a practice in [[Balwyn, Victoria]].

==Early life==
Reid was born in 1883 in [[Melbourne, Victoria]], and was the youngest of ten children. Her mother was Mary Jane Clancy and her father [[Robert Reid (Australian politician)|Robert Reid]], born in Scotland, was a wealthy merchant and Victorian politician. She grew up in the Melbourne suburb of [[Balwyn, Victoria|Balwyn]] where she developed an interest in the care of animals, especially horses, and attended school at [[Genazzano FCJ College]]. She originally aspired to pursue a career in singing, but her parents considered such a pursuit inappropriate for a woman of her class, so Reid enrolled in the Melbourne Veterinary College instead in 1902.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last= Wirth |first= Hugh J. |author-link= Hugh Wirth |year= 2002 |volume= 16 |id2=reid-isabelle-bruce-belle-11503 |title=Reid, Isabelle Bruce (Belle) (1883–1945) |accessdate= 30 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veterinary career==
Reid graduated from the Melbourne Veterinary College in 1906—she was one of five students who sat the final-year examinations and was the only one to pass. She was registered with the Veterinary Board of Victoria the same year, and was considered the first woman in the world to formally qualify as a veterinary surgeon.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; She was the first Australian woman to train as a veterinarian, and one of only three women to be receive a veterinary education in Australia in the first 50 years after the Victorian Veterinary Register was established in 1888.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-0813.2006.tb12756.x/abstract|title=Centenary of first Australian female veterinarian|journal=Australian Veterinary Journal|volume=84|issue=5|year=2006|first=Ivan|last=Caple|accessdate=19 March 2015|pages=18-19|doi=10.1111/j.1751-0813.2006.tb12756.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her graduation, Reid established a private veterinary practice, the Balwyn Veterinary Surgery, near her childhood home in the house where the Reid family's chauffeur had once lived. She continued to run the practice until her retirement in 1923.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt;

==Later life==
Reid moved from Balwyn to [[Bundoora, Victoria|Bundoora]], another suburb of Melbourne, in 1925. She lived on a farm that she called "Blossom Park" on an estate which she and her sister had purchased in 1911. There she bred horses, cattle and dogs, and constructed stables and a dairy to accommodate them. She regularly exhibited her animals at shows run by the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. She died from [[coronary thrombosis]] on 13 December 1945 in [[Canterbury, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1996, Reid was inducted into the National Pioneer Women's Hall of Fame in [[Alice Springs]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; In 2006, the centenary of her registration as a veterinary practitioner, the [[University of Melbourne]] Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences—which succeeded the Melbourne Veterinary College in 1908—awarded the Belle Bruce Reid Medal to 100 notable women veterinarians.&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== American Wrestling Association (1985–1987) ===
While working out at a gym, White was spotted by a man who remembered him from his college football days who suggested he look into professional wrestling. Trained by [[Brad Rheingans]], White got his first national exposure in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). He went by the moniker '''Baby Bull''', which was later changed to Bull Power. White honed his skills during this time, and his ring work improved significantly to the point that he was booked in a match with [[Stan Hansen]] for the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]], where he was defeated.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pwinsider.com/article/118273/looking-at-the-life-and-career-of-leon-vader-white.html?p=1 |title=Looking At The Life of Leon 'Vader' White |work=Pro Wrestling Insider |last=Johnson |first=Mike |date=June 20, 2018 |accessdate=June 21, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621094700/https://pwinsider.com/article/118273/looking-at-the-life-and-career-of-leon-vader-white.html?p=1 |archivedate=June 21, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catch Wrestling Association (1986–1991) ===
In May 1986, White went to Europe to compete for [[Otto Wanz]] and his promotion, [[Catch Wrestling Association]], touring Austria and Germany, using the name Bull Power. That summer, he took part in the three-day tournament for the Vienna Catch Cup, in Austria.  He made it to the finals, before losing to [[Klaus Wallas]]. On March 22, 1987, he won his first championship, the [[CWA World Heavyweight Championship]], defeating Otto Wanz in Denver, Colorado, ending Wanz's reign of nearly nine years in its only title change in the United States. He held onto the title for nearly four months, before losing to back to Wanz on July 11 in Graz, Austria. In December 1987, he participated in his second tournament, the Bremen Catch Cup, in Germany. He defeated [[Luc Poirier|Rambo]] in the finals, to win his first tournament.

In 1989, Bull Power returned to the CWA, to challenge Otto Wanz for the CWA World Heavyweight Championship. On August 21 in Vienna, Austria, he defeated Wanz to win his second CWA World title. He held onto the title for a little over four months before losing it back to Wanz in Bremen, Germany, on December 22. A year later, Otto Wanz retired and the CWA World title was held up. Bull Power defeated Rambo to win the vacant title for the third and final time. He held to the title for over six months, before losing it to Rambo in Graz, Austria on July 6, 1991. Five months later, he defeated [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] to become the inaugural [[CWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship|CWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]]. He vacated the title in 1992 after signing with [[World Championship Wrestling]].

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling ===
==== Early years (1987–1989) ====
Although originally signed to [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), AJPW owner [[Giant Baba]] traded White's contract over to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) in 1987 after consideration.&lt;ref name=rej/&gt; Upon joining NJPW, White was given the ring name '''Big Van Vader''' and began to wear a black [[wrestling mask]]. His new identity was based on a strong warrior of the same name from [[Japanese folklore]].&lt;ref name="vader-folklore"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-6DoPuiRkEC&amp;pg=PA243|chapter=The Monsters|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|last=Oliver|first=Greg|last2=Johnson|first2=Steven|location=[[Toronto]]|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|page=243|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-759-8|quote=Derived from Japanese folklore, where Vader was a top warrior who once fought for his village seventy-two hours straight, White was given a huge, black device for his head that shot smoke. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|last=Steve|first=Austin|title=The Steve Austin Show – EP122 – Big Van Vader Pt 2|publisher=Podcast One|date=June 5, 2014|url=http://www.podcastone.com/embed?progID=436&amp;pid=417258|accessdate=June 9, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714164829/http://www.podcastone.com/embed?progID=436&amp;pid=417258|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was introduced as the crown jewel of the Takeshi Puroresu Gundan [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] that was [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[Takeshi Kitano]]. Vader challenged [[Antonio Inoki]], who had already defeated [[Riki Choshu]], and defeated the worn-down Inoki. The pro-Inoki audience rioted, resulting in NJPW being banned from the Sumo Hall, its home arena. The ban remained in effect until 1989, when NJPW did their first show back in Sumo Hall on February 22.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt;

==== IWGP Heavyweight Champion (1989–1991) ====
After winning the final match of an eight-man tournament against [[Shinya Hashimoto]], Vader was declared the new [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]]. He was the first gaijin (non-Japanese) wrestler to hold the title.&lt;ref name="rej"/&gt; On May 25, one month after being crowned champion, Vader lost the title to Russian [[suplex]] master [[Salman Hashimikov]]. Hashimikov dropped the title to Vader's old rival, Riki Choshu, on July 12. On August 10, Vader defeated Choshu to become a two-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion.

On February 10, 1990, Vader faced [[Stan Hansen]] at an AJPW versus NJPW supercard show. Before Vader entered the ring, Hansen accidentally broke Vader's nose with the bullrope Hansen carried to the ring for his matches. During an exchange of stiff punches, Hansen unintentionally poked Vader's left eye with his thumb during their brawl, which caused the eye to pop out of its socket.&lt;ref name=HansenBio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/hansen.html|title=Stan Hansen's Puroresu Central profile|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022063956/http://www.puroresucentral.com/hansen.html|archivedate=October 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After removing his mask, pushing the eye back into its socket and holding it in place with his eyelid, Vader continued wrestling Hansen until the match was rendered a no contest.&lt;ref name=HansenBio/&gt; As a result of the injury, Vader required a metal plate to be surgically placed under his eye.&lt;ref name=HansenBio/&gt; Vader's success garnered the attention of [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), who convinced him to work for them while still the IWGP Heavyweight Champion and an active competitor in NJPW.

In January 1991, Vader defeated Tatsumi Fujinami to earn himself a third IWGP Heavyweight Title reign. This reign was short-lived however, as Vader lost the title back to Fujinami on March 4. At this point, WCW and NJPW were reaching a tentative working agreement. This benefited Vader, as he could now have his schedule coordinated far more easily. This helped alleviate his difficulty in gaining notoriety in WCW, as his previously infrequent appearances did not allow the audience to see him very often.

==== Big, Bad, and Dangerous (1992) ====
On March 1, 1992, he and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] began teaming as "Big, Bad, and Dangerous". The duo went on to win the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] from [[Hiroshi Hase]] and [[Keiji Mutoh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=28&amp;nr=166|title=Bam Bam Bigelow and Vader's tag team profile|publisher=CageMatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Vader faced Mutoh, now known as The Great Muta, one on one and suffered a legitimate knee injury. This injury was a factor in he and Bigelow losing the title to the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|WCW World Tag Team Champions]], [[The Steiner Brothers]] after a near four-month reign. This also marked a decrease in his NJPW appearances, as Vader began to focus almost entirely on WCW and the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]].

=== Universal Wrestling Association (1989–1990) ===
In November 1989, White, as Big Van Vader, made his debut in Mexico for [[Universal Wrestling Association]]. On November 12, he defeated [[El Canek]] to win the [[UWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Five days later, he would make a couple shows for [[Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] in trios matches, teaming with [[Ken Timbs|Fabuloso Blondy]]. He would hold onto the UWA World title for over a year, before losing it back to Canek on December 9.

=== World Championship Wrestling ===
====Early run (1990–1991)====
Vader was originally signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1990, but was only used sparingly until 1991.&lt;ref name=rej/&gt; Vader's first match in WCW took place on July 7, 1990 at [[The Great American Bash (1990)|The Great American Bash]], where he defeated [[Tom Zenk]] in a little over two minutes. Seven months later, he returned for [[WrestleWar (1991)|WrestleWar]], where he battled Stan Hansen to a double disqualification. Eight months later, he returned at [[Halloween Havoc (1991)|Halloween Havoc]] and took part in the Chamber of Horrors match, in which Vader's team lost due to [[Abdullah the Butcher]] being electrocuted by their partner, [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]]. Two months later, he would take part of [[Starrcade (1991)|Starrcade]]'s Lethal Lottery, where he teamed with [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]] and defeated [[Rick Steiner]] and [[Bryan Clark|The Nightstalker]] (who was subbing for an injured [[Scott Hall|Diamond Studd]]) to advance to the Battlebowl battle royal, in which he was eliminated.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (1992–1993) ====
When he began working for WCW full-time, Vader was paired with a manager, [[Harley Race]], and received a shot at [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]'s [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] on April 12, 1992, and was disqualified. Sting suffered a pair of cracked ribs and a ruptured spleen in the match after taking a ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Corner slingshot splash|Vader Bomb]]'' from Vader, though he continued to compete infrequently while recuperating. Vader received a rematch with Sting on July 12 at [[The Great American Bash (1992)|The Great American Bash]], which he won to become the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion. His reign was short-lived, as he re-injured his knee, forcing him to lose the title three weeks later to [[Ron Simmons]], who substituted for Sting after he was attacked by [[Jake Roberts]] earlier that night.&lt;ref name="mf225"&gt;Foley, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Vader was out of action after Clash of the Champions in September as he underwent knee surgery. Upon his return at [[Halloween Havoc (1992)|Halloween Havoc]], Vader sent Nikita Koloff into retirement and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#L|legitimately]] broke the back of [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]] Joe Thurman, paralyzing him for a few hours.&lt;ref name="mf3"&gt;Foley, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Starrcade (1992)|Starrcade]], Vader lost to Sting in the finals of the King of Cable tournament. Two days later, Vader defeated Simmons by taking advantage of a shoulder injury of Simmons's to regain the World Heavyweight Championship. On March 11, 1993, Vader lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to Sting but regained it six days later.

Upon returning to WCW, [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] defeated Vader via countout on the April 17 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]''.&lt;ref name="mf240"&gt;Foley, p. 239–241.&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, Jack suffered a broken nose and needed 27 stitches on his face.&lt;ref name="mf240" /&gt; The match was heavily edited for broadcast, as WCW did not wish to show the severe bleeding.&lt;ref name="mf240" /&gt; In a rematch on April 24, Vader [[powerbomb]]ed Jack onto the concrete floor outside the ring,&lt;ref name="mf243"&gt;Foley, p. 243–244.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Jack suffering a concussion and temporary loss of feeling in his left hand and leg.&lt;ref name="mf243" /&gt; In the meantime, Vader began to feud with a new arrival to WCW, [[Davey Boy Smith]]. They met at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]] in May for the World Heavyweight Championship. Vader lost by disqualification when he hit Smith with a chair, though he retained the title. Vader and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] then formed a partnership and called themselves The Masters of the Powerbomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=28&amp;nr=591|title=The Masters of the Powerbomb's profile|publisher=CageMatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were defeated by Smith and his new partner, Sting, at [[Beach Blast (1993)|Beach Blast]] in July. Following this, Vader and Cactus Jack's feud was restarted as Jack was cleared to return for [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]] to face Vader in a [[Last Man Standing match|Texas Death match]].&lt;ref name="mf265"&gt;Foley, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Vader won when Harley Race stunned Jack with a cattle prod that kept him down for a ten count. On March 16, 1994, Foley lost his right ear in a match with Vader in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]; Foley's head became trapped in the ropes, which were under excessive tension, causing his ear to be torn off.&lt;ref name="mf6"&gt;Foley, p. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vader was originally scheduled to face Sid Vicious at [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]]. The real-life dismissal of Vicious after Arn Anderson stabbed him in England, however, forced WCW to find a quick replacement. Executive producer [[Eric Bischoff]] placed [[Ric Flair]] in the match, which was scheduled in Flair's hometown of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. In the storyline, Vader did not take Flair seriously until he agreed to put his career on the line against Vader's title. Vader dominated the match, but Flair capitalized on failed interference by Race and Vader's weakened knees to win the match with a rollup and end Vader's third World Heavyweight Championship reign.

====United States Champion and Dungeon of Doom (1994–1995)====
Vader continued to feud with Flair until [[SuperBrawl IV]], when Flair once again defeated Vader, this time in a "[[Thundercage]]" match, with the help of the special guest referee [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|The Boss]]. As a result, Vader began feuding with Boss, whom he defeated at [[Spring Stampede (1994)|Spring Stampede]]. He also faced Sting at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]] for the vacant [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship|International World Heavyweight Championship]]. Sting requested the match rather than be awarded the title after an injury to his original opponent, [[Rick Rude]], and defeated Vader. At [[Bash at the Beach]], he defeated the former Boss, now known as The Guardian Angel by disqualification. Two months later at [[Fall Brawl]], he defeated Angel and Sting in a triangle match to determine the number one contender for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]], now held by [[Hulk Hogan]]. A month later at [[Halloween Havoc]], he defeated the Guardian Angel in a rematch. At [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIX|Clash of the Champions XXIX]], Vader defeated Dustin Rhodes and earned the opportunity to face the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Jim Duggan]] at [[Starrcade (1994)|Starrcade]], where Vader defeated Duggan with the aid of Duggan's 2x4 to win the United States Heavyweight Championship.

In January 1995, Vader had to end his alliance with Harley Race, because in real life, Race was involved in an automobile crash and Race left WCW. Vader confronted the World Heavyweight Champion [[Hulk Hogan]], and informed him that he could not avoid the monster. The two met at [[SuperBrawl V]], with Vader managing to kick out of Hogan's [[leg drop]] after a count of one. The referee was knocked out before Vader hit the ''Vader Bomb'' on Hogan. Ric Flair ran to the ring, made the three count, and attacked Hogan, resulting in Vader's disqualification. A rematch was signed, a strap match for the inaugural [[Uncensored (1995)|Uncensored]] pay-per-view. Flair once again intervened (this time in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] to avoid revealing his presence) and managed to cost Vader the match by getting himself carried by Hogan as he touched all four turnbuckle pads. Vader was stripped of the United States Heavyweight Championship on April 23, 1995 for multiple violent offenses. However, Vader gained another opportunity to win the World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan at [[Bash at the Beach (1995)|Bash at the Beach]] in a [[Steel Cage match]]. He conspired with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and the [[The Dungeon of Doom|Dungeon of Doom]] to gain a psychological edge before the encounter, which Vader lost when Hogan escaped the cage. He then restarted his feud with Flair, based on his frustration at Flair's constant interference in his title matches and Flair's annoyance at his inability to defeat Hogan. At [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXXI|Clash of the Champions XXXI]], Vader defeated Flair and Arn Anderson in a 2-on-1 handicap match. Following the event, Hogan grew interested in Vader and asked for his assistance in his developing feud with the Dungeon of Doom by asking him to join him, [[Randy Savage]], and Sting for WarGames. Vader complied but the storyline never developed as, shortly after, Vader was fired from WCW after he was involved in a locker room brawl with [[Paul Orndorff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story|author=Guerrero, Eddie|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2005|isbn=0-7434-9353-2|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title video for the September 4 debut edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' featured multiple shots of Vader (one of four wrestlers featured, along with Hogan, Sting and Savage),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Title video|series=WCW Monday Nitro|series-link=WCW Monday Nitro|network=[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]|station=[[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS, Inc]]|date=September 4, 1995|season=1|number=1|minutes=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; who parted ways with WCW shortly thereafter. Absent from the first episode, he had been scheduled to face Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the September 11 episode, but was replaced by [[Lex Luger]], who issued a challenge to Hogan on the debut show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Today_2/article_73083.shtml |title=SEPT. 4 IN HISTORY: WCW Nitro launches|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116094000/http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Today_2/article_73083.shtml |archivedate=January 16, 2014|publisher=PWTorch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UWF International (1993–1995)===
In late February 1993, White signed an eight-date agreement with the [[UWF International|Union of Wrestling Forces International]] (UWFi), where he competed as Super Vader due to legal issues concerning the Big Van Vader name. By September 1993, he was simply known as Vader in the United States. He worked with UWFi for over two years, winning the Best of the World Tournament, which started April 3 and ended August 18, 1994. Vader first defeated [[Salman Hashimikov]] and then [[Masahito Kakihara]] in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, Vader defeated [[Kiyoshi Tamura]], and beat [[Nobuhiko Takada]] in the finals to win the tournament and the UWFi World Title. He would hold onto the title for over eight months, before losing the title to Takada on April 20, 1995. He left shortly thereafter.

=== Return to NJPW (1996) ===
At [[Wrestling World 1996|Wrestling World]] on January 4, Vader had his first post-WCW match, facing the man whose four-year winning streak Vader had ended over eight years ago, Antonio Inoki. Inoki was over 50 years old at the time, but the match lasted nearly fourteen minutes before Inoki won the match.

=== World Wrestling Federation  ===
==== Camp Cornette (1996–1997) ====
{{Main|Camp Cornette|l1=Camp Cornette}}
[[File:Big Van Vader (1996).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Vader in 1996]]
In the weeks leading up to the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]], Vader's debut was heavily hyped on television as he was billed as "The Man They Call Vader" (though [[Vince McMahon]] had originally wanted to rename him "The Mastodon"). He made his first [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) appearance as a participant in the Royal Rumble match, as he entered at number 13 and eliminated [[Jake Roberts]], [[Doug Gilbert]], one member of the [[The Headhunters (professional wrestling)|Squat Team]], and [[Savio Vega]]; he also fought with his ally [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], but Vader was eliminated by [[Shawn Michaels]] before he re-entered the ring and started assaulting everyone, including Michaels. Vader defeated Vega on the following ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', before assaulting WWF officials and eventually, WWF President [[Gorilla Monsoon]] demanded that Vader cease his attacks, and received a Vader Bomb for his efforts. As a result, Vader was suspended for his actions, though in reality he needed time off for shoulder surgery.

[[Jim Cornette]] campaigned for Vader's reinstatement, and by the time Vader returned, Yokozuna had left Cornette's management. At February's [[In Your House 6]], Vader appeared during Yokozuna's match against [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], and as Yokozuna was about to [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]] The Bulldog, Vader attacked him, handcuffed him, and delivered a severe beating. This led to what was supposed to be a one-on-one encounter between Vader and Yokozuna at [[WrestleMania XII]]. However, the match became a six-man [[tag team]] match pitting Vader, [[Owen Hart]], and The British Bulldog against Yokozuna, [[Ahmed Johnson]], and Jake Roberts, with the stipulation that if Yokozuna's team won the match, he would have five minutes alone with Cornette in the ring; this never occurred as Vader's team won the match when Vader pinned Roberts.

Vader then attacked the [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]] Shawn Michaels after one of Michaels' matches, which earned him a spot in a six-man tag team match at [[In Your House 9: International Incident]], where Vader, Owen Hart, and The British Bulldog teamed up against Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, and [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]]; Vader pinned Michaels to win the match for his team. Vader faced Michaels again at [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]], where Vader won by [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]; Cornette, however, realized that the title could not change hands through a countout and got the match restarted, but this time, Michaels used Cornette's [[tennis]] [[Racquet|racket]] and was disqualified, so again, Cornette managed to get the match started over, which Michaels won by pinfall.

Following his feud with Michaels, Vader faced off against [[The Undertaker]] in a singles match at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]], and during the match, The Undertaker's former manager, [[Percy Pringle|Paul Bearer]], attacked him and helped Vader win; Bearer then became Vader's manager. Both Vader and Undertaker went on to compete in the [[Royal Rumble match]], during which Stone Cold Steve Austin was eliminated by [[Bret Hart]]; however, the referees did not see this, as they were attending to Terry Funk and [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] on the floor, allowing Austin to sneak back into the ring and eliminate both Vader and Undertaker, then Bret Hart, who was busy eliminating [[Kane (wrestler)|Fake Diesel]], and win the Royal Rumble. As a result of this, Vader and the other men eliminated by Austin, Bret Hart and The Undertaker, were put into the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four-way main event]] of February's [[In Your House 13: Final Four]] for the WWF Championship, in which Vader, after bleeding profusely, was eliminated by The Undertaker. Bearer then persuaded his two proteges, Vader and Mankind, to go after the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], despite the fact that the two men often brawled between themselves. They failed in their bid to win the tag team gold at [[WrestleMania 13]].

==== Various feuds (1997–1998) ====
[[File:Vader One Night Only.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Vader in September 1997]]
Vader again received an opportunity to face The Undertaker, this time for the WWF Championship at [[In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede]], but lost. On the following night's ''Raw is War'', Vader wrestled [[The Patriot (wrestler)|The Patriot]], who won the match and then went after Bret Hart, who came to ringside during the match; Vader attacked The Patriot, and then brought him back into the ring, where he went for the Vader Bomb, but Hart came into the ring and laid the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] over The Patriot, so Vader got down, picked up the Canadian flag, broke it, and started a brawl with Hart. This [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] Vader [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] and served to bring Vader into the USA vs. Canada [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]], which culminated at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]], where Vader was the leader of Team USA, with [[Goldust]], [[Marc Mero]], and [[Steve Blackman]] (replacing the injured Patriot) as they faced Team Canada, composed of The British Bulldog, [[Jim Neidhart]], [[Doug Furnas]], and [[Philip Lafond|Phil LaFon]]; during the match, Goldust walked out on his team and Team USA lost the match after The Bulldog pinned Vader after hitting him with the ring bell. Goldust and Vader feuded throughout the fall and finally faced off at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]], in a match which Vader won. Goldust eliminated Vader from the Royal Rumble match later that night (Vader entered at number 30).

Following his feud with Goldust, Vader began feuding with Kane, and both faced off for the first time at [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House|No Way Out of Texas]], where Vader lost after a [[chokeslam]] and a [[Tombstone Piledriver]] before Kane subsequently attacked him with a large steel wrench, resulting in Vader being taken away on a stretcher and was kept off of television for a while. Two months later, at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]], Vader returned during Kane's [[Inferno match]] against The Undertaker; as Kane was attempting to leave the match, Vader appeared and fought him back to the ring to continue the match, which Kane lost. Vader and Kane had a rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]] in a [[Hair vs. Hair match|Mask vs. Mask match]], in which Vader attempted to use a wrench on Kane like the one used on him months before, but Kane managed to recover and defeat Vader, costing him his mask in the process. In a post-match interview with [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], Vader said, "I made the biggest mistake of my life. Maybe Vader time is over. I'm a piece of shit. A big fat piece of shit".&lt;ref name=shit&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=John|title=Stone Cold Beats the Odds|url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive/jun1_overtheedge.html|publisher=Slam Wrestling|accessdate=July 9, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925180546/http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive/jun1_overtheedge.html|archivedate=September 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Vader had a series of losses and was reduced to the status of a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber to the stars]], having a feud with [[Mark Henry]] which Vader lost. After considering retirement, Vader instead negotiated his own release from the WWF so he could once again wrestle in Japan.&lt;ref name=rej&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingEditorial/jan5_molinaro.html|title=Vader rejuvenated in Japan|author=Molinaro, John F.|publisher=SLAM!

He lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] on the October 11 episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' in his final televised WWF match. His last match in a WWF ring was on October 25 at a Madison Square Garden [[house show]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Mankind and Ken Shamrock, which Vader lost after he tapped out to Shamrock's ankle lock. In a shoot interview, Jim Cornette said part of the reason that Vader's WWF run was not as successful as what was hoped was due to the failure to properly book Vader.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|kUZizMxgSlY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah (1998–2002) ===
After leaving the WWF, Vader went to AJPW.&lt;ref name=rej/&gt; He formed a team with his old foe [[Stan Hansen]], with whom he made it to the finals of the [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League#1998|1998]] [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League]], where they were defeated by [[Kenta Kobashi]] and [[Jun Akiyama]].&lt;ref name=rej/&gt; At the beginning of 1999, he became the number one contender to the Triple Crown by defeating Kobashi. He then won the (vacant) Triple Crown Title on March 6, 1999 by defeating [[Akira Taue]].&lt;ref name=rej/&gt; He then won the 1999 [[Champion Carnival]].&lt;ref name=rej/&gt; After Vader lost the Triple Crown to Misawa on May 2, he regained it on October 31.&lt;ref name=rej/&gt; He then again lost it to Kobashi and took some time off.

After returning from his hiatus, Vader joined the new Japanese [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], where he won the [[GHC Tag Team Championship]] with [[2 Cold Scorpio]].

=== Total Nonstop Action (2003, 2015) ===
On February 19, 2003, Vader appeared in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA-TNA) to defend [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], who was fighting with [[The Harris Brothers]]. He and Dusty won a tag team match the next week against the Harris Brothers via disqualification. He then began a feud with [[Nikita Koloff]], whose career Vader ended long ago. However, TNA and Vader soon parted ways.

On June 24, 2015, Vader returned to [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) television on ''Impact Wrestling'' for a singles match against [[Bram (wrestler)|Bram]]. Vader won the match via disqualification after Bram used a ring wrench to hit Vader in the head. [[Matt Morgan]] then entered the ring to save Vader and take out Bram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pritchard|first=Bill|title=TNA Impact Wrestling Results (6/24) – New X Division Champion, Full Metal Mayhem, Jeff Jarrett Returns!|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/590949-tna-impact-wrestling-results-062415|work=Wrestlezone|accessdate=June 25, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626003439/http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/590949-tna-impact-wrestling-results-062415|archivedate=June 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to WWE (2005, 2012, 2016) ===
Vader returned to [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) on the October 31, 2005 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' when [[Jonathan Coachman]] announced that Vader and [[Goldust]] would be in his corner for his street fight against Stone Cold Steve Austin the next night at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]].&lt;ref name=Oct3105&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/raw2005/1130824906.shtml|title=Raw – October 31, 2005|accessdate=June 23, 2009|publisher=Wrestle View|first=Martin|last=Adam|date=November 1, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BCi9x3nb?url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/raw2005/1130824906.shtml|archivedate=October 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Austin decided not to participate, he was replaced by [[Dave Bautista|Batista]]. Vader and Goldust interfered in the match on Coachman's behalf and received [[professional wrestling throws#spinebuster|spinebusters]] for their efforts.

[[File:VaderWWE2012.png|thumb|upright|Vader at ''[[WWE Raw 1000]]'' in July 2012]]
On the June 11, 2012 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Vader defeated [[Heath Slater]] in a singles match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2012-06-11/wwe-raw-results/page-6|title=WWE Raw SuperShow results: Big Show knocked out Mr. McMahon!|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BCiBFqCi?url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2012-06-11/wwe-raw-results/page-6 |archivedate=October 6, 2012|publisher=WWE|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23 on the [[WWE Raw 1000|1000th episode of ''Raw'']], Vader and several other legends prevented Slater from leaving in his match against [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]], which she won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=CALDWELL'S WWE RAW RESULTS 7/23: Complete "virtual-time" coverage of live Raw #999 – WWE recognizes 1,000 episodes, WWE Title match, Lesnar, Rock, DX, wedding|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwerawreport/article_63621.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=July 29, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726225443/http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwerawreport/article_63621.shtml|archivedate=July 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Vader made a one-night appearance at the [[WWE Hall of Fame (2016)|2016 WWE Hall of Fame]] ceremony to induct [[Stan Hansen]] into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].

=== Independent circuit (2005–2007, 2010–2012, 2016–2017) ===
Vader returned to Japan, wrestling at a NJPW Wrestle Land show. He also worked in the independent circuit as Big Van Vader, including a tag match against [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Dan Maff]] in [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] with [[Mike Awesome]] as his tag team partner. On May 12, 2007, Vader faced [[Brutus Beefcake]] at Spartan Slamfest, a World Wrestling Coalition charity show. The match was held at the Kingston Armory in [[Kingston, Pennsylvania]].

'''Biotechnology risk''' is a form of [[existential risk]] that could come from biological sources, such as [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] [[biological agent]]s.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Nickbostrom.com_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html |title=Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios |newspaper=Nickbostrom.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" &gt;{{cite book|author1=Ali Noun|author2=Christopher F. Chyba|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global Catastrophic Risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Chapter 20: Biotechnology and biosecurity}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can come either intentionally (in the form of [[bioterrorism]]/[[biological weapons]]) or unintentionally (through the accidental release of engineerer viruses). A chapter in biotechnology and biosecurity was published in [[Nick Bostrom]]'s ''[[Global Catastrophic Risks (book)|Global Catastrophic Risks]]'', which covered risks such as viral agents.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Amazon.com_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Global-Catastrophic-Risks-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199606501 |title=Global Catastrophic Risks: Nick Bostrom, Milan M. Cirkovic: 9780199606504: Amazon.com: Books |newspaper=Amazon.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, new technologies like [[CRISPR]] and [[gene drives]] have been introduced.

While the ability to deliberately engineer pathogens has been constrained to high-end labs run by top researchers, the technology to achieve this (and other astonishing feats of bioengineering) is rapidly becoming cheaper and more widespread. Such examples include the diminishing cost of sequencing the human genome (from $10M USD to $1000), the accumulation of large datasets of genetic information, the discovery of [[gene drives]], and the discovery of [[CRISPR]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_Futureoflife.org_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://futureoflife.org/background/risk-of-biotechnology/ |title=FLI – Future of Life Institute |newspaper=Futureoflife.org |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gain of Function Mutations==

===Research===
{{See also | Genetically modified virus}}
Pathogens may be intentionally or unintentionally genetically modified to change their characteristics, including virulence or toxicity.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt; When intentional, these mutations can serve to adapt the pathogen to a laboratory setting, understand the mechanism of transmission or pathogenesis, or in the development of therapeutics. Such mutations have also been used in the development of [[biological weapons]], and [[dual-use]] risk continues to be a concern in the research of pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kloblentz|first=GD|title=From biodefence to biosecurity: the Obama administration's strategy for countering biological threats.|journal=Int Aff.|year=2012|volume=88|pages=131–48|pmid=22400153|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest concern is frequently associated with gain of function mutations, which confer novel or increased functionality, and the risk of their release.

====Mousepox====
A group of Australian researchers unintentionally changed characteristics of the [[mousepox]] virus while trying to develop a virus to sterilize rodents as a means of [[biological pest control]].&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=R|last2=Ramshaw|first2=I|title=The mousepox experience.

====Influenza====
In 2011, two laboratories published reports of mutational screens of avian [[influenza]] viruses, identifying variant which become transmissible through the air between ferrets. These viruses seem to overcome an obstacle which limits the global impact of natural [[H5N1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Imai|first1=M|last2=Watanabe|first2=T|last3=Hatta|first3=M|last4=Das|first4=SC|last5=Ozawa|first5=M|last6=Shinya|first6=K|last7=Zhong|first7=G|last8=Hanson|first8=A|last9=Katsura|first9=H|last10=Watanabe|first10=S|last11=Li|first11=C|last12=Kawakami|first12=E|last13=Yamada|first13=S|last14=Kiso|first14=M|last15=Suzuki|first15=Y|last16=Maher|first16=EA|last17=Neumann|first17=G|last18=Kawaoka|first18=Y|title=Experimental adaptation of an influenza H5 HA confers respiratory droplet transmission to a reassortant H5 HA/H1N1 virus in ferrets.|journal=Nature|date=2 May 2012|volume=486|issue=7403|pages=420–8|pmid=22722205|doi=10.1038/nature10831|pmc=3388103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Theeuropean-magazine.com_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theeuropean-magazine.com/marc-lipsitch--2/6691-the-risk-from-super-viruses |title=The Risk from Super-Viruses – The European |newspaper=Theeuropean-magazine.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, scientists further screened point mutations of the [[H5N1]] virus genome to identify mutations which allowed airborne spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herfst|first1=S|last2=Schrauwen|first2=EJ|last3=Linster|first3=M|last4=Chutinimitkul|first4=S|last5=de Wit|first5=E|last6=Munster|first6=VJ|last7=Sorrell|first7=EM|last8=Bestebroer|first8=TM|last9=Burke|first9=DF|last10=Smith|first10=DJ|last11=Rimmelzwaan|first11=GF|last12=Osterhaus|first12=AD|last13=Fouchier|first13=RA|title=Airborne transmission of influenza A/H5N1 virus between ferrets.|journal=Science|date=22 June 2012|volume=336|issue=6088|pages=1534–41|pmid=22723413|doi=10.1126/science.1213362|pmc=4810786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_The-scientist.com_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/32247/title/Five-Mutations-Make-H5N1-Airborne/ |title=Five Mutations Make H5N1 Airborne |newspaper=The-scientist.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the stated goal of this research was to improve surveillance and prepare for influenza viruses which are of particular risk in causing a pandemic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deliberating Over Danger|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31876/title/Deliberating-Over-Danger/|accessdate=28 July 2016|publisher=The Scientist|date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was significant concern that the laboratory strains themselves could escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Steve|title='Untrue statements' anger over work to make H5N1 bird-flu virus MORE dangerous to humans|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/untrue-statements-anger-over-work-to-make-h5n1-bird-flu-virus-more-dangerous-to-humans-9018666.html|accessdate=28 July 2016|publisher=The Independent|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Lipsitch and [[Alison P. Galvani]] coauthored a paper in [[PLoS Medicine]] arguing that experiments in which scientists manipulate bird influenza viruses to make them transmissible in mammals deserve more intense scrutiny as to whether or not their risks outweigh their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipsitch|first1=M|last2=Galvani|first2=AP|title=Ethical alternatives to experiments with novel potential pandemic pathogens.|journal=PLOS Medicine|date=May 2014|volume=11|issue=5|pages=e1001646|pmid=24844931|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001646|pmc=4028196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipsitch also described influenza as the most frightening "potential pandemic pathogen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q &amp; A: When lab research threatens humanity|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/when-lab-research-threatens-humanity/|website=Harvard T.H. Chan|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
In 2014, the [[United States]] instituted a moratorium on gain of function research into [[influenza]], [[MERS]], and [[SARS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaiser|first1=Jocelyn|last2=Malakoff|first2=David|title=U.S. halts funding for new risky virus studies, calls for voluntary moratorium|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/us-halts-funding-new-risky-virus-studies-calls-voluntary-moratorium|accessdate=28 July 2016|publisher=Science|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in response to the particular risks these airborne pathogens pose. However, many scientists opposed the moratorium, arguing that this limited their ability to develop [[antiviral]] therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaiser|first1=Jocelyn|title=Researchers rail against moratorium on risky virus experiments|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/researchers-rail-against-moratorium-risky-virus-experiments|accessdate=28 July 2016|publisher=Science|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientists argued gain of function mutations were necessary, such as adapting MERS to [[laboratory mouse|laboratory mice]] so it could be studied.

The [[National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity]] also has instituted rules for research proposals using gain of function research of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaiser|first1=Jocelyn|title=U.S. advisers sign off on plan for reviewing risky virus studies|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/us-advisers-sign-plan-reviewing-risky-virus-studies|accessdate=28 July 2016|publisher=Science|date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules outline how experiments to be evaluated for risks, safety measures, and potential benefits; prior to funding.

In order to limit access to minimize the risk of easy access to genetic material from pathogens, including viruses, the members of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium screen orders for regulated pathogen and other dangerous sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC)  - Harmonized Screening Protocol - Gene Sequence &amp; Customer Screening to Promote Biosecurity|url=http://www.genesynthesisconsortium.org/images/pdf/IGSC-Harmonized-Screening-Protocol-11_18_09.pdf|website=International Gene Synthesis Consortium|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orders for pathogenic or dangerous DNA are verified for customer identity, barring customers on governmental watch lists, and only to institutions "demonstrably engaged in legitimate research".

==CRISPR==
{{See also | CRISPR}}
Following surprisingly fast advances in [[CRISPR]] editing, an international summit proclaimed in December 2015 that it was "irresponsible" to proceed with human gene editing until issues in safety and efficacy were addressed.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Techtimes.com_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/113401/20151206/scientist-call-for-moratorium-on-human-genome-editing-the-dangers-of-using-crispr-to-create-designer-babies.htm |title=Scientist Call For Moratorium on Human Genome Editing: The Dangers Of Using CRISPR To Create 'Designer Babies' : LIFE : Tech Times |newspaper=Techtimes.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the mechanisms that CRISPR can cause existential risk is through [[gene drives]], which are said to have potential to "revolutionize" ecosystem management.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Blogs.scientificamerican.com_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/gene-drives-and-crispr-could-revolutionize-ecosystem-management/ |title="Gene Drives" And CRISPR Could Revolutionize Ecosystem Management – Scientific American Blog Network |newspaper=Blogs.scientificamerican.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene drives are a novel technology that have potential to make genes spread through wild populations like wildfire. They have the potential to quickly spread resistance genes against malaria in order to rebuff the malaria parasite [[P. falciparum]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_Nature.com_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/gene-drive-mosquitoes-engineered-to-fight-malaria-1.18858 |title='Gene drive' mosquitoes engineered to fight malaria : Nature News &amp; Comment |newspaper=Nature.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gene drives were originally engineered in January 2015 by Ethan Bier and Valentino Gatz – this editing was spurred by the discovery of [[CRISPR-Cas9]]. In late 2015, [[DARPA]] started to study approaches that could halt gene drives if they went out of control and threatened biological species.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_April_3_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/12/gene-drive-bioterror-risk/ |title=Why FBI and the Pentagon are afraid of gene drives |newspaper=Https: |date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celestine Ukwu''' (1940–1977) was an [[Igbo highlife]] musician best known for his hit songs "Ije Enu", "Igede" and "Money Palava". Described as a "prolific and outstanding composer" by music critic [[Benson Idonije]] of ''Radio Nigeria Two'',{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Ukwu's works has been featured on various [[world music]] [[compilation album|compilations]] including ''[[The Rough Guide to Highlife (2003 album)|The Rough Guide to Highlife]]'' and ''[[The Rough Guide to Psychedelic Africa]]''.

==Life==
Ukwu was born in [[Enugu]], [[Enugu State]], Nigeria to music-oriented parents. His father was a local performer of the igede, ikpa and ode genres of Igbo music while his mother was lead singer in a women's musical group. At a young age, he began learning how to read music and play the [[harmonium]] with the help of his uncle. Upon completing his primary school education, he went to teacher training school for two years but dropped out in order to pursue music as a career. He went on to join [[Mike Ejeagha]]'s group "Paradise Rhythm Orchestra" in 1962 as a vocalist and maraca player before he left to join Mr. Picolo's band who were touring the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Collins1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Collins|title=Musicmakers of West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIHfybGz5HoC&amp;pg=PA51|year=1985|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-0-89410-075-8|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Nigeria to form his own band known as Celestine Ukwu &amp; His Music Royals of Nigeria which was later disbanded in 1967 following the outbreak of the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. After the war, Ukwu formed another group, Celestine Ukwu &amp; His Philosophers National; with whom he released ''Igede Fantasia'' which did well commercially.&lt;ref name="Ogbechie2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Uriel Ogbechie|title=ECLIPSE AT NOONDAY: Biafra, DIARIES OF UNWRITTEN STORIES|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRdRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4691-3809-1|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

==Artistry==
His songs were primarily composed in [[Igbo language]] with a bit of [[Efik language|Efik]]. In a 1986 edition of ''Thisweek'', a writer once wrote that his songs "gave a food for thought to its listeners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thisweek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30QuAQAAIAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Thisweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir David Paradine Frost''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (7 April 1939 – 31 August 2013) was an English television host, media personality, journalist, comedian, and writer.

After graduating from the [[University of Cambridge]], Frost rose to prominence in the United Kingdom when he was chosen to host the satirical programme ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' in 1962. His success on this show led to work as a host on U.S. television. He became known for his television interviews with senior political figures, among them the [[Nixon Interviews]] with former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1977, which were adapted into a [[Frost/Nixon (play)|stage play]] and [[Frost/Nixon (film)|film]].

Frost was one of the "Famous Five" who was behind the launch of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] breakfast station [[TV-am]] in 1983. For the [[BBC]], he hosted the Sunday morning interview programme ''[[Breakfast with Frost]]'' from 1993 to 2005. He spent two decades as host of ''[[Through the Keyhole]]''. From 2006 to 2012 he hosted the weekly programme ''[[Frost Over the World]]'' on [[Al Jazeera English]] and from 2012, the weekly programme ''The Frost Interview''.

Frost died on 31 August 2013, aged 74, on board the cruise ship {{ship|MS|Queen Elizabeth}}, on which he had been engaged as a speaker.&lt;ref name="bbc_obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23920336|title=Sir David Frost, broadcaster and writer, dies at 74|work=BBC|date=1 September 2013|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, his memorial stone was unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]] for his contribution to [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir David Frost's memorial at Westminster's Poets' Corner |publisher=BBC News |date=13 March 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26560669 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
David Paradine Frost was born in [[Tenterden]], [[Kent]], on 7 April 1939, the son of a [[Methodist]] minister of [[Huguenot]] descent,&lt;ref name="Jeffries"&gt;Stuart Jeffries [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost Obituary: Sir David Frost], ''The Guardian'', 1 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the Rev. Wilfred John "W. J." Paradine Frost, and his wife, Mona (Aldrich); he had two elder sisters.&lt;ref name="TimeLine"&gt;[http://www.timelinetheatre.com/frost_nixon/FrostNixon_StudyGuide.pdf TimeLine Theatre Company, Chicago: Frost/Nixon Study Guide] Retrieved 2 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20130902/NEWS04/309029979/1006/NEWS Frost, famous for Nixon interview, dies | The Journal Gazette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While living in [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]], Kent, he was taught in the Bible class of the Sunday school at his father's church (Byron Road Methodist) by David Gilmore Harvey, and subsequently started training as a Methodist [[local preacher]], which he did not complete.&lt;ref name="bbc_obituary2"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13528279 Obituary: Sir David Frost], ''BBC News'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost attended Barnsole Road Primary School in Gillingham, [[St Hugh's School, Woodhall Spa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martineau|first1=Hugh|title=Half a Century of St Hugh's School, Woodhall Spa|date=1975|publisher=Cupit and Hindley|location=Horncastle|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Napier School|Gillingham Grammar School]] and finally – while residing in [[Raunds]] – [[Wrenn School|Wellingborough Grammar School]]. Throughout his school years he was an avid [[association football|football]] and cricket player,&lt;ref name="TimeLine" /&gt; and was offered a contract with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest F.C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duff|first=Oliver|title=My Life in Media: Sir David Frost|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-life-in-media-sir-david-frost-6146971.html|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For two years before going to university he was a lay preacher following his witnessing of an event presided over by the Christian evangelist [[Billy Graham]].&lt;ref name="Jeffries" /&gt;

Frost studied at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Gonville &amp; Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville &amp; Caius College]], from 1958, graduating with a Third in English.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hughes-Onslow, "Sir David Frost", ''The Oldie'', May 2014, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; He was editor of both the university's student paper, ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'', and the literary magazine ''[[Granta]]''. He was also secretary of the [[Footlights]] Drama Society,&lt;ref name="TimeLine" /&gt; which included actors such as [[Peter Cook]] and [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]]. During this period, Frost appeared on television for the first time in an edition of [[Anglia Television]]'s ''Town And Gown'', performing several comic characters. "The first time I stepped into a television studio", he once remembered, "it felt like home. It didn't scare me. Talking to the camera seemed the most natural thing in the world."&lt;ref name="Telegraphobit"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10278859/Sir-David-Frost.html Obituary: Sir David Frost], ''The Telegraph'', 1 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some accounts, Frost was the victim of snobbery from the group with which he associated at Cambridge, which has been confirmed by [[Barry Humphries]].&lt;ref name="Carpenter207"&gt;Humphrey Carpenter ''That Was Satire That Was: The Satire Boom of the 1960s'', London: Victor Gollancz, 2000, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Booker]], while asserting that Frost's one defining characteristic was ambition, commented that he was impossible to dislike.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, pp. 207-8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the satirist [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]], the Old [[Eton College|Etonian]] actor [[Jonathan Cecil]] congratulated Frost around this time for "that wonderfully silly voice" he used while performing, but then discovered that it was Frost's real voice.&lt;ref name="Carpenter207" /&gt;&lt;!-- Carpenter cites Wells as though this occurred while Frost was at Cambridge, but it seems more likely to have been after his graduation as both Wells and Cecil attended Oxford colleges. It is an awkward end to this section though if placed in strict chronology. This anecdote is also cited in Stuart Jeffries Guardian obituary. --&gt;

After leaving university, Frost became a trainee at [[Associated-Rediffusion]]. Meanwhile, having already gained an agent, Frost performed in cabaret at the Blue Angel nightclub in [[Berkeley Square]], London during the evenings.&lt;ref name="Jeffries" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, pp. 208-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''That Was the Week That Was''==
Frost was chosen by writer and producer [[Ned Sherrin]] to host the satirical programme ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'', alias ''TW3'' after Frost's flatmate John Bird suggested Sherrin should see his act at The Blue Angel. The series, which ran for less than 18 months during 1962–63, was part of the [[satire boom]] in early 1960s Britain and became a popular programme.

The involvement of Frost in ''TW3'' led to an intensification of the rivalry with Peter Cook who accused him of stealing material and dubbed Frost "the bubonic plagiarist".&lt;ref name="Hattenstone"&gt;Simon Hattenstone [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/02/david-frost-interview-frost-nixon "The Saturday interview: David Frost"], ''The Guardian'', 2 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The new satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' also mocked him at this time. Frost visited the U.S. during the break between the two series of ''TW3'' in the summer of 1963 and stayed with the producer of the New York City production of ''Beyond The Fringe''. Frost was unable to swim, but still jumped into the pool, and nearly drowned until he was saved by Peter Cook. At the memorial service for Cook in 1995, [[Alan Bennett]] recalled that rescuing Frost was the one regret Cook frequently expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, ''That Was Satire That Was'', p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first three editions of the second series in 1963, the BBC attempted to limit the team by scheduling repeats of ''[[The Third Man#Adaptations|The Third Man]]'' television series after the programme, thus preventing overruns. Frost took to reading synopses of the episodes at the end of the programme as a means of sabotage. After the BBC's Director General [[Hugh Greene]]&lt;!-- Not knighted until 1964. --&gt; instructed that the repeats should be abandoned, ''TW3'' returned to being open-ended.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, ''That Was Satire That Was'', pp. 270-1&lt;/ref&gt; More sombrely, on 23 November 1963, a tribute to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated President John F. Kennedy]], an event which had occurred the previous day, formed an entire edition of ''That Was the Week That Was''.&lt;ref name="Leapman" /&gt;

An American version of ''TW3'' ran after the original British series had ended. Following a pilot episode on 10 November 1963, the 30-minute US series, also featuring Frost, ran on [[NBC]] from 10 January 1964 to May 1965. In 1985, Frost produced and hosted a television special in the same format, ''That Was the Year That Was'', on NBC.

==Post-''TW3''==
Frost fronted various programmes following the success of ''TW3'', including its immediate successor, ''[[Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life]]'', which he co-chaired with [[Willie Rushton]] and poet [[P. J. Kavanagh]]. Screened on three evenings each week, this series was dropped after a sketch was found to be offensive to Catholics and another to the British royal family.&lt;ref name="Leapman"/&gt; {{citation needed span|More successful was ''[[The Frost Report]]'', broadcast between 1966 and 1967. The show launched the television careers of [[John Cleese]], [[Ronnie Barker]], and [[Ronnie Corbett]], who appeared together in the [[Class sketch]].|date=August 2018}}

Frost signed for [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] weekday contractor in London, to produce a "heavier" interview-based show called ''The Frost Programme''. Guests included [[Oswald Mosley]] and [[Rhodesia]]n premier [[Ian Smith]]. His memorable dressing-down of insurance fraudster [[Emil Savundra]], regarded as the first example of "[[Emil Savundra#Frost Programme controversy|trial by television]]" in the U.K., led to concern from ITV executives that it might affect Savundra's right to a fair trial.&lt;ref name="Jeffries"/&gt; Frost's introductory words for his television programmes during this period, "Hello, good evening and welcome", became his [[catchphrase]] and were often mimicked.&lt;ref name="bbc_obit"/&gt;

Frost was a member of a successful consortium, including former executives from the BBC, that bid for an ITV franchise in 1967. This became [[London Weekend Television]], which began broadcasting in July 1968. The station began with a programming policy that was considered "[[highbrow]]" and suffered launch problems with low audience ratings and financial problems. A September 1968 meeting of the Network Programme Committee, which made decisions about the channel's scheduling, was particularly fraught, with [[Lew Grade]] expressing hatred of Frost in his presence.&lt;!-- the two sources following are at variance as to precisely what Grade said, but neither dispute that he used the word "hate". --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Frost ''An Autobiography: Part One From Congregation to Audiences'', London: HarperCollins, 1993, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teletronic10"&gt;[http://www.teletronic.co.uk/itv_story_10.htm "British TV History: The ITV Story: Part 10: The New Franchises"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724030723/http://teletronic.co.uk/itv_story_10.htm |date=24 July 2013 }}, Teletronic&lt;/ref&gt; Frost, according to [[Kitty Muggeridge]] in 1967, had "risen without a trace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=40417&amp;icid=4&amp;d_str=20130902 "Broadcaster Frost rose from satire to friendly interviewer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905134755/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=40417&amp;icid=4&amp;d_str=20130902 |date=5 September 2015 }}, ''The Standard'' (Hong Kong), 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was involved in the station's early years as a presenter. On 20 and 21 July 1969, during the [[British television Apollo 11 coverage]], he presented ''David Frost's Moon Party'' for LWT, a ten-hour discussion and entertainment marathon from LWT's [[The Fountain Studios|Wembley Studios]], on the night [[Neil Armstrong]] walked on the moon. Two of his guests on this programme were British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] and entertainer [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="ITV"&gt;{{cite web | title=ITV Moon Landing Coverage | publisher=British TV History | url=http://www.tvhistory.btinternet.co.uk/html/moon_itv.html | accessdate=18 February 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723002934/http://www.tvhistory.btinternet.co.uk/html/moon_itv.html | archivedate=23 July 2011 | df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time Frost interviewed [[Rupert Murdoch]] whose recently acquired Sunday newspaper, the ''[[News of the World]]'', had just serialised the memoirs of [[Christine Keeler]], a central figure in the [[Profumo Affair|Profumo scandal]] of 1963. For the Australian publisher, this was a bruising encounter, although Frost said that he had not intended it to be.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Tuccille [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mj1FcArTE8C&amp;pg=PA29 ''Rupert Murdoch: Creator of a Worldwide Media Empire''], Washington: Beard Books, 2003 [1989], pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch confessed to his biographer [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]] that the incident had convinced him that Frost was "an arrogant bastard, [and] a bloody bugger".&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Haigh [http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2009/march/1274508026/gideon-haigh/vanity-fare "Vanity Fair: Michael Wolff's ''The Man Who Owns the News''"], The Monthly'' (Australia), March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, he began an intermittent involvement in the film industry. Setting up [[David Paradine Productions|David Paradine Ltd]] in 1966,&lt;ref name="Leapman"&gt;Michael Leapman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-david-frost-pioneering-journalist-and-broadcaster-whose-fame-often-equalled-that-of-his-interviewees-8793246.html "Sir David Frost: Pioneering journalist and broadcaster whose fame often equalled that of his interviewees"], ''The Independent'', 1 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'' obituary says 'David Paradine Productions' was established in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; he part-financed ''[[The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer]]'' (1970), in which the lead character was based partly on Frost, and gained an executive producer credit. In 1976, Frost was the executive producer of the British [[musical film]] ''[[The Slipper and the Rose]]'', retelling the story of [[Cinderella]].

Frost was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in January 1972 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at London's Quaglino's restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigredbook.info/article13.02.html Big Red Book]. Retrieved 13 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==American career from 1968 to 1980==
In 1968, he signed a contract worth £125,000 to appear on American television in his own show on three evenings each week, the largest such arrangement for a British television personality&lt;ref name="Telegraphobit"/&gt; at the time. From 1969 to 1972, Frost kept his London shows and fronted ''The David Frost Show'' on the [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] (U.S. Westinghouse Corporation) television stations in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020820154917/http://www.thedavidfrostshow.com/guests.htm The David Frost Show]&lt;/ref&gt; His 1970 TV special, ''Frost on America'', featured guests such as [[Jack Benny]] and [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref name="museumtv"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/frostdavid/frostdavid.htm | title=FROST, DAVID | last=Zajacz | first=Rita | work=The [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a declassified transcript of a 1972 telephone call between Frost and [[Henry Kissinger]], President Nixon's [[United States National Security Advisor|national security advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], Frost urged Kissinger to call [[Grandmaster (chess)|chess Grandmaster]] [[Bobby Fischer]] and urge him to compete in that year's [[World Chess Championship 1972|World Chess Championship]].&lt;ref name=harper-2013&gt;{{cite web | author=Lauren Harper | title=Henry Kissinger Jokes About Making a Pawn of Bobby Fischer | url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/henry-kissinger-jokes-about-making-a-pawn-of-bobby-fischer/ | publisher=National Security Archive | accessdate=2 August 2013 | date=19 July 2013 | quote=The tournament was dramatic enough thanks to Fischer's antics, but telephone conversation on 3 July 1972, capturing British journalist David Frost asking Kissinger to persuade the grandmaster to attend the championship adds more to the story. Kissinger had an intellectual interest in chess, and the Spassky-Fischer head-to-head alone would have likely piqued his interest in the match, but Frost wanted Kissinger to get involved to ensure Fischer's participation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frost-kissinger-1972&gt;{{cite web | title=Declassified transcript of phone call from David Frost to Henry Kissinger | url=http://nsarchive.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kissinger-fischer.pdf | publisher=National Security Archive | date=3 July 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this call, Frost revealed that he was working on a novel.&lt;ref name=frost-kissinger-1972/&gt;

Frost interviewed heavyweight boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1974 at his training camp in [[Deer Lake, Pennsylvania]] before "[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]" with [[George Foreman]]. Ali remarked, "Listen David, when I meet this man, if you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I whip Foreman's behind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Chris Harvey | title=Sir David Frost: his five best interviews | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10278961/Sir-David-Frost-his-five-best-interviews.html | accessdate=25 December 2013 | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[Nixon Interviews]], which were five 90-minute interviews with former U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], were broadcast. Nixon was paid $600,000 plus a share of the profits for the interviews, which had to be funded by Frost himself after the U.S. television networks turned down the programme, describing it as "[[checkbook journalism]]". Frost's company negotiated its own deals to syndicate the interviews with local stations across the U.S. and internationally, creating what [[Ron Howard]] described as "the first fourth network".&lt;ref name=StanleyTimes&gt;{{cite news | author=Alessandra Stanley | title=AN APPRAISAL David Frost: Newsman, Showman, and Suave at Both | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/arts/television/david-frost-newsman-showman-and-suave-at-both.html | accessdate=2 September 2013 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frost taped around 29 hours of interviews with Nixon over four weeks. Nixon, who had previously avoided discussing his role in the [[Watergate scandal]] that had led to his resignation as president in 1974, expressed contrition saying, "I let the American people down and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324886704579048602335557942 | title=David Frost Dies Aged 74 | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=1 September 2013 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stelter"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/world/europe/david-frost-known-for-nixon-interview-dead-at-74.html | title=David Frost, Who Interviewed Nixon, Is Dead at 74 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1 September 2013 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], Frost was the last person to interview [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the deposed [[Shah]] of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sky.com/story/1135738/sir-david-frost-dies-of-heart-attack-on-ship | title=Sir David Frost Dies Of Heart Attack On Ship | publisher=[[Sky News]] | date=1 September 2011 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview took place onn [[Contadora Island]] in [[Panama]] in January 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/4089823.stm "On Iran"], (''Breakfast with Frost'') BBC News, 12 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and was broadcast by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] in the U.S. on 17 January.&lt;ref&gt;Gholam Reza Afkham [https://books.google.com/books?id=pTVSPmyvtkAC&amp;pg=PA655&amp;lpg=PA655 ''The Life and Times of the Shah''], Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008, p. 655 n.17:7&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost was an organiser of the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1979. Ten years later, he was hired as the anchor of the new American tabloid news program ''[[Inside Edition]]''. He was dismissed after only three weeks because of poor ratings. It seems he was "considered too high-brow for the show's low-brow format."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yN4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5000%2C1276209 | title='Inside Edition' Boss has Chilling News for David Frost | newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] | date=3 February 1989 | accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After 1980==
Frost was one of the "Famous Five" who launched [[TV-am]] in February 1983 but, like LWT in the late 1960s, the station began with an unsustainable "highbrow" approach. Frost remained a presenter after restructuring. ''Frost on Sunday'' began in September 1983 and continued until the station lost its franchise at the end of 1992. Frost had been part of an unsuccessful consortium, [[CPV-TV]], with [[Richard Branson]] and other interests, which had attempted to acquire three ITV contractor franchises prior to the changes made by the [[Independent Television Commission]] in 1991. After transferring from ITV, his Sunday morning interview programme ''[[Breakfast with Frost]]'' ran on the BBC from January 1993 until 29 May 2005. For a time it ran on [[British Satellite Broadcasting|BSB]] before moving to [[BBC One|BBC 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir David Frost: the most illustrious TV inquisitor of his generation|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sir-david-frost-the-most-illustrious-tv-inquisitor-of-his-generation-8793240.html|work=Evening Standard|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost hosted ''[[Through the Keyhole]]'', which ran on several UK channels from 1987 until 2008 and also featured [[Loyd Grossman]]. Produced by his own production company, the programme was first shown in prime time and on daytime television in its later years.&lt;ref name="Leapman" /&gt;

Frost worked for [[Al Jazeera English]], presenting a live weekly hour-long current affairs programme, ''[[Frost Over The World]]'', which started when the network launched in November 2006. The programme regularly made headlines with interviewees such as [[Tony Blair]], President [[Omar al-Bashir]] of Sudan, Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] of Pakistan and President [[Daniel Ortega]] of Nicaragua. The programme was produced by the former ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' editor and ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' journalist Charlie Courtauld. Frost was one of the first to interview the man who authored the [[Fatwa on Terrorism]], [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS5w-HVLA8 |title=Frost over the World – Rafael Moreno and Muhammad Tahir al-Qadri |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career as a broadcaster Frost became one of [[Concorde]]'s most frequent fliers, having flown between London and New York an average of 20 times per year for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orlebar|first=Christopher|title=The Concorde Story|page=181|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1-85532-667-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Quest|first=Richard|title=Why Concorde mattered|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/why-concorde-mattered-583699.html|work=The Independent|date=3 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Frost hosted a discussion with Libya's leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] as part of the [[Monitor Group]]'s involvement in the country.&lt;ref name="nprorg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/134411798/mass-firms-libya-work-may-have-violated-fara-act |title=U.S. Firm Under Fire For Gadhafi Makeover Contract|first= Peter|last= Overby|publisher=Npr.org |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Frost presented ''Frost on Satire'', an hour-long [[BBC Four]] documentary looking at the history of television satire.

==''Frost/Nixon''==
{{Main|The Nixon Interviews|Frost/Nixon (play)|Frost/Nixon (film)}}

''Frost/Nixon'' was originally a play written by [[Peter Morgan]], developed from the Nixon Interviews that Frost had conducted with Richard Nixon in 1977. ''[[Frost/Nixon (play)|Frost/Nixon]]'' was presented as a stage production in London in 2006 and on Broadway in 2007. [[Frank Langella]] won a Leading Actor [[Tony Award]] for his portrayal of Nixon, the play also received nominations for Best Play and Best Direction.

The play was adapted into a Hollywood motion picture entitled [[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]] and starring [[Michael Sheen]] as Frost and Langella as Nixon, both reprising their stage roles. The film was released in 2008 and directed by [[Ron Howard]]. It was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Award]]s, winning none: Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director-Drama, Best Actor-Drama (Langella), Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ifcdf033a039397d33af1e1010cab7e66?pn=2] {{subscription required}} {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214141351/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ifcdf033a039397d33af1e1010cab7e66?pn=2 | date=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also nominated  for five [[Academy Award]]s, again winning none: Best Picture, Best Actor (Langella), Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.

In February 2009, Frost was featured on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s  international affairs programme ''[[Foreign Correspondent (TV series)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' in a report titled "The World According To Frost", reflecting on his long career and portrayal in the film ''Frost/Nixon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2009/s2494109.htm | title=The World According to Frost | author=Mark Corcoran | date=17 February 2009 | work=[[ABC Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Frost was known for several relationships with high-profile women. In the mid-1960s, he dated British actress [[Janette Scott]], between her marriages to songwriter [[Jackie Rae]] and singer [[Mel Tormé]]; in the early 1970s he was engaged to American actress [[Diahann Carroll]]; between 1972 and 1977 he had a relationship with British socialite Caroline Cushing; in 1981 he married [[Lynne Frederick]], widow of [[Peter Sellers]], but they divorced the following year.&lt;ref name="TimeLine" /&gt; He also had an 18-year intermittent affair with American actress [[Carol Lynley]].&lt;ref&gt;W.

On 19 March 1983, Frost married Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, daughter of the [[Miles Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk|17th Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref name="TimeLine" /&gt; Three sons were born to the couple over the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10278859/Sir-David-Frost.html |title=Obituary: David Frost |date=1 September 2013 |publisher=''The Telegraph'' |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second [[Wilfred Frost]] followed in his father's footsteps and currently works as an anchor at CNBC.

On 29 August 2016, '''Elijah Doughty''', a fourteen-year-old [[Indigenous Australian]], was involved in a fatal [[traffic collision]] with a [[Utility vehicle|ute]] whilst riding a  motorbike. There is no evidence that Elijah had stolen the motorbike,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Graham|title=Elijah Doughty, 14, who was killed in Boulder near Kalgoorlie in August 2016.

The driver was subsequently charged with [[manslaughter]] but was acquitted by a jury on 21 July 2017 after a trial at the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]]; however he was found guilty of the lesser charge of dangerous driving causing death.

==Incident==
On 28 August 2016, the man and his wife had been out visiting friends and arrived at their front gate at 8.15pm — she drove home, as they had earlier agreed that she would, so while they were out he drank six Carlton Dry beers. The man suspected immediately that they had been burgled because the key he said he always left at the front gate was gone. Break-ins were not unusual at the time in the twin cities of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, where thefts were the main topic of conversation on the popular Facebook group ''Kalgoorlie Crimes Whinge and Whine''. His wife posted about the thefts on the Facebook page dedicated to local crimes, a friend offered a $1500 reward for the return of the Honda and members of the ''Whinge and Whine'' Facebook group began sending information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paige|last=Taylor|title=Elijah Doughty lost and Kalgoorlie simmers|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/elijah-doughty-lost-and-kalgoorlie-simmers/news-story/7265e77acaa0e01f696ff4ac0ffcdb72|publisher=The Australian|date=22 July 2017|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police had told the man that dirtbikes often end up at Gribble Creek Reserve and suggested he check under bushes for the Honda. He searched the streets near his home by torchlight on foot until 10.30pm. He told his boss he would not be in the next day and started searching again soon after 6am on August 29. He was parked at the edge of Gribble Creek shortly after 8.30am, listening for motorbikes, when he saw a hoodie-clad figure riding the bike his kids used, started his car and gave chase. The pursuit lasted no more than 26 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paige|last=Taylor|title=Elijah Doughty lost and Kalgoorlie simmers|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/elijah-doughty-lost-and-kalgoorlie-simmers/news-story/7265e77acaa0e01f696ff4ac0ffcdb72|publisher=The Australian|date=22 July 2017|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driver was of the belief it is alleged it was the missing motorcycle which Doughty was riding. He had followed Doughty in his [[Nissan Navara]] ute along a dirt-track in the Gribble Creek area of [[Boulder, Western Australia|Boulder]]. Crash investigators stated the man travelled at an average speed of 67 km/h as he gained ground on Elijah at a rate of 21 km/h. Elijah was on a 70 cc bike — widely marketed as suitable for eight- to 11-year-olds — and travelled at an average speed of 46 km/h. A collision subsequently took place in which Doughty suffered fatal injuries. The forensic pathologist explained to the jury that Elijah's injuries included his skull being split in half, brain stem snapped, spinal cord severed, most of his ribs broken, pelvis fractured, and leg and ankle mangled. Elijah's body was found 9.5 metres from the largest piece of dirtbike wreckage, whereas the ute had continued in a straight line for 34 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paige|last=Taylor|title=Elijah Doughty lost and Kalgoorlie simmers|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/elijah-doughty-lost-and-kalgoorlie-simmers/news-story/7265e77acaa0e01f696ff4ac0ffcdb72|publisher=The Australian|date=22 July 2017|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Elijah's friends, he had been handed the bike in the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Calla|last=Wahlquist|title='Tell the world we want justice.'

==Immediate aftermath==
The following day, a protest occurred outside the [[Kalgoorlie]] Courthouse. Approximately 200 people, some armed with rocks and bottles, broke down the gates of the court and surrounded police; who used pepper spray and riot shields in response. Twelve police officers were injured during the disorder, with one requiring stitches, while several demonstrators were arrested. Five police cars and a local business were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kalgoorlie protest: Arrests made, officers injured in violent riot over teen's death|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-30/protesters-arrested-in-kalgoorlie-riot-after-teens-death/7797804|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|date=31 August 2016|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darryl Doughty, the father of Elijah Doughty, explained that the trouble started when court guards decided to lock the front door. Relatives and friends had wanted to hear the other side of the story, however they were refused entry to the court. The police prosecutor informed Darryl that the matter would be put off until that afternoon and completed by video link, and obtained Darryl's phone number. However Darryl was not contacted and the accused was flown to Perth instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Calla|last=Wahlquist|title='Tell the world we want justice.'

With tensions rising, Darryl addressed the gathered crowd asking them to calm down, however by then a small group had already damaged a police vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Calla|last=Wahlquist|title='Tell the world we want justice.'

Local Indigenous broadcaster Debbie Carmody accused local anti-crime [[Facebook]] groups of "inciting violence and murder" against Indigenous youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Allan-Petale|title=Indigenous journalist blames Kalgoorlie riots on Facebook crime pages|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/indigenous-journalist-blames-kalgoorlie-riots-on-facebook-crime-pages-20160830-gr4x1h.html|publisher=[[WAtoday]]|date=30 August 2016|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a vigil set-up at the site of Elijah's death, Kalgoorlie Police Superintendent Darryl Gaunt says his officers have witnessed non-Aboriginal residents driving fast and close to the bush vigil where Elijah died, yelling abuse at mourners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paige|last=Taylor|title=‘Come back, unbreak our hearts,’ says Elijah Doughty’s mum

==Investigation and trial==
The driver was interviewed by police the same day as Elijah's death and said he was "“trying to catch up with a motorbike that I know, I think, is mine, and hoping that the rider would go into the bush and fall off”. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Calla|last=Wahlquist|title=Man who killed Indigenous teenager Elijah Doughty given parole|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/27/man-who-killed-indigenous-teenager-elijah-doughty-given-parole|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 March 2018|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ute driver was charged with manslaughter and pleaded not guilty after his offer to plead guilty to the lesser charge of dangerous driving causing death was rejected by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Heather|last=McNeill|title=Man accused of killing Kalgoorlie teen Elijah Doughty seeks trial|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/man-accused-of-killing-kalgoorlie-teen-elijahs-doughty-seeks-trial-20170206-gu6db4.html|publisher=WAtoday|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trial was held in the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] from July 17 to July 21 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ele|last=Farcic|title=Elijah Doughty: Trial over Kalgoorlie teen's death set for July|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/elijah-doughty-trial-over-kalgoorlie-teens-death-set-for-july/news-story/dad2c83a678fedcb47c07a4ff6758c9e|publisher=PerthNow|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, the ute driver, who cannot legally be identified, stated he had not intended to hit Doughty and claimed that Doughty had "veered in front of him". The driver admitted however he could not prevent the collision because he was driving too close to the motorbike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joanna|last=Menagh|title=Elijah Doughty death: Kalgoorlie man claims teenager's motorbike 'veered' in front of him|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-17/elijah-doughty-death-kalgoorlie-man-on-trial-for-manslaughter/8715560|publisher=ABC Online|date=17 July 2016|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2017, the jury in the trial found the driver not guilty of manslaughter but convicted him of dangerous driving occasioning death. Following the verdict, members of the public gallery screamed abuse at the defendant and the jury; the court was briefly adjourned to allow their removal by security. 

Supporters of Doughty, watching the proceedings in Kalgoorlie via [[Videotelephony|video link]], protested the verdict, many wearing t-shirts with the [[Black Lives Matter]] slogan. The protest was described by journalists as vocal but peaceful.

==Aftermath==
Following the jury verdict on July 21, a number of rallies and vigils were held across Australia to call for justice for Elijah Doughty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nakari|last=Thorpe|title=Rallies across the country call for justice for Elijah Doughty|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/07/24/rallies-across-country-call-justice-elijah-doughty|publisher=SBS Online|date=25 July 2017|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crowd of approximately 150 protesters gathered outside the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] on 24 July 2017 while chanting "What do we want?

On 30 July, comedian [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] apologised for reposting a controversial video a few days after the verdict. It was a music video titled "[[Squashed Nigga]]" and was part of his 2011 TV comedy series, [[Angry Boys]]. It featured his fictional character [[S.mouse]] singing about an Aboriginal boy who had died from being run over by a truck and the video included a boy lying on a road. Many criticised the timing of the posting, however Lilley insisted there was no relation to "current news stories".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-29/lilley-says-blackface-video-not-connected-to-doughty-verdict/8756850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Natalie|last=Wolfe||title=Chris Lilley under fire for re-posting video ‘Squashed N***a’ less than a week after Elijah Doughty case|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrities-gone-bad/chris-lilley-under-fire-for-his-new-video-squashed-na-less-than-a-week-after/news-story/ead2645477f9fb436328a85a8f953694|publisher=News.com.au|date=30 July 2017|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2017, police charged Elijah's father, Darryl, over an incident at the Kalgoorlie Magistrates Court. The distraught father was selected for a security search with a metal detector wand by a male Court Security and Custodial Officer, but police allege he failed to comply and left the building. Police claim Darryl was seen 'acting aggressively' towards a member of the public and allegedly assaulted a court officer causing minor injuries. He was charged with assault and released on bail after appearing at court where he pleaded not guilty. He is due to appear in court again on September 6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/nitv-news/article/2017/08/29/emotions-run-high-one-year-death-elijah&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sudipto Gupta''' was a 22-year-old student who died on 2 April 2013 while in police custody following his arrest at a demonstration in [[Kolkata]], [[India]].

Sudipto was a student of [[political science]] at [[Rabindra Bharati University]], and a  state committee member in the [[Students' Federation of India]] (SFI), the student wing of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. He was injured while being transported to jail by bus. Police claim he was hanging his head out of window and hit a lampost, while students maintain he was beaten by police. The bus driver was arrested and charged with negligent driving.&lt;ref name="ndtv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands gather in Kolkata for Sudipto Gupta, student who died|url=http://www.ndtv.com/kolkata-news/thousands-gather-in-kolkata-for-sudipto-gupta-student-who-died-517952|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post mortem examination found multiple injuries on his body, heart, lung and brain, along with internal bleeding and [[pulmonary contusion]] consistent with assault.&lt;ref name="ie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sengupta|first1=Sulagna|title=SFI student leader Sudipto Gupta beaten to death, shows post mortem report|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/sfi-student-leader-sudipto-gupta-beaten-to-death-shows-post-mortem-report/1097459/|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a magisterial inquiry ruled out any role or negligence of the police in the death stating it was caused due to an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kundu|first1=Indrajit|title=SFI leader Sudipto Gupta death case: Bengal government gives clean chit to Kolkata Police|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sfi-sudipto-gupta-death-case-kolkata-police-west-bengal-government-presidency-jail/1/326262.html|website=India Today|publisher=Living Media India Limited|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Bosqui''' (1832 - 1917) was a Canadian artist, printer, and pioneer in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Involved in the [[Bohemian Club]] he was a patron of the arts.

Bosqui was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://ch.ucpress.edu/content/21/4/321 | doi=10.2307/25161023| jstor=25161023| title=Edward Bosqui, Printer and Man of Affairs| journal=California History| volume=21| issue=4| pages=321–332| year=1942| last1=Wagner| first1=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7700">The '''European Parliamentary Technology Assessment''' (EPTA) is a network of [[technology assessment]] (TA) institutions specialising in advising parliamentary bodies in Europe.

[[Image:epta.jpg|thumb|EPTA-Logo]]

== Objectives ==

The EPTA partners advise parliaments on the possible social, economic and environmental impact of new sciences and technologies. The common aim is to provide impartial and high quality analysis and reports of developments in issues such as for example [[bioethics]] and [[biotechnology]], [[public health]], environment and energy, [[information and communication technologies|ICTs]], and R&amp;D policy. Such work is seen as an aid to the democratic control of scientific and technological innovations, and was pioneered in the 1970s by the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) of the [[US Congress]]. EPTA aims to advance the establishment of [[technology assessment]] (TA) as an integral part of policy formation in parliamentary decision-making processes in Europe, and to strengthen the links between TA units in Europe.

== History and Organisation ==

The EPTA network was formally established in 1990, on a recommendation by the UK’s parliamentary TA office – [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]], under the patronage of the President of the [[European Parliament]], Mr [[Enrique Baron Crespo]]. The network has a light structure, guided by the EPTA ''Council'' and by meetings of the ''Directors'' of the EPTA partner organisations. The EPTA Council is the steering committee of the EPTA network, and consists of Members of Parliament or representatives of the advisory boards for the respective EPTA organisation. The Council decides on organisational matters such as co-operation within the network and the status of members and associates. The ''Presidency'' of EPTA rotates among full members each year. The tasks of the EPTA member organisation holding the presidency are to coordinate the EPTA network activities and to host the annual EPTA conference, Council meeting and Directors' meeting.

== Members ==

Parliamentary TA is institutionalised in different ways, ranging from permanent parliamentary committees for TA; separate TA units as part of the parliamentary administration; to independent institutions with a mandate to serve as a permanent consulting institution for the parliament. The members of the EPTA network are European organisations, which carry out TA studies on behalf of parliaments. Full membership can be obtained by a unit that operates in Europe, is devoted to TA or related activities, serves a (supra-national, national or regional) parliament, has its own budget and secretariat and has an active work programme including publications on issues with a scientific and technological component. Associate membership can be granted to other TA units that have a TA programme and the resources to realise it, but that do not fulfil other criteria for full membership.

'''Foot binding''' was the custom of applying tight binding to the feet of young girls to modify the shape and size of their feet. It was practised in China from the [[Song dynasty]] until the early 20th century, and bound feet were considered a status symbol as well as a mark of beauty. Foot binding limited the mobility of women, and resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects, although some women with bound feet working outdoors have also been reported. Feet altered by binding were called '''lotus feet'''.

The practice possibly originated among upper class court dancers during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in 10th century China, then became popular among the elite during the [[Song dynasty]], eventually spreading to all social classes by the [[Qing dynasty]]. Foot binding was practiced in different forms, and the more severe form of binding may have been developed in the 16th century. It has been estimated that by the 19th century, 40–50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, and up to almost 100% among upper class Chinese women.&lt;ref name="lim" &gt;{{cite web |last=Lim |first=Louisa |title=Painful Memories for China's Footbinding Survivors |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8966942 |work=Morning Edition |publisher=National Public Radio |date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence and practice of foot binding however varied in different parts of the country.

There had been attempts to end the practice during the Qing dynasty; Manchu [[Kangxi Emperor]] tried to ban foot binding in 1664 but failed.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In the later part of the 19th century, Chinese reformers challenged the practice but it was not until the early 20th century that foot binding began to die out as a result of anti-foot-binding campaigns.  Only a few elderly Chinese women still survive today with bound feet.&lt;ref name="lim"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Yaoniang binding feet.jpg|thumb|200px|18th-century illustration showing Yao Niang binding her own feet]]

There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these involves the story of a favorite consort of the [[Southern Qi]] emperor [[Xiao Baojuan]], [[Pan Yunu]] (died 501 AD), who had delicate feet and danced barefoot on a floor decorated with golden lotus flower design. The emperor expressed admiration and said that "lotus springs from her every step!" (步步生蓮), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms "golden lotus" or "lotus feet" used to describe bound feet; there is, however, no evidence that Consort Pan ever bound her feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=32–34 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated from the time of the 10th-century [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Emperor Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]], just before the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ptop/alabaster/A1155872 |title=Chinese Foot Binding |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine {{Interlanguage link multi|Yao Niang|zh|3=窅娘}} to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and perform a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=42 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=66u24WAyO_YC&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body |page=203 |editor=Victoria Pitts-Taylor |publisher=Greenwood |date= 2008 |isbn=978-0-313-34145-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/index.php/component/k2/item/10758-han-chinese-footbinding |title=Han Chinese Footbinding |work=Textile Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu Ji 徐積 《詠蔡家婦》： 「但知勒四支，不知裹两足。」(translation: "knowing about arranging the four limbs, but not about binding her two feet); [[Su Shi]] 蘇軾 《菩薩蠻》：「塗香莫惜蓮承步，長愁羅襪凌波去；只見舞回風，都無行處踪。偷穿宮樣穩，並立雙趺困，纖妙說應難，須從掌上看。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |title=The Inner Quarters: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period|author= Patricia Buckley  Ebrey|pages=37–39 |isbn= 9780520913486 |publisher=University of California Press |date=1 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; Soon after 1148,&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Bangji|zh|3=張邦基}} wrote that a bound foot should be arch-shape and small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=111–115 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wenxian.fanren8.com/08/05/5/8.htm |title=墨庄漫录-宋-张邦基  8-卷八 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that "women's footbinding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras."&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Morris (historian)|title=Why the West Rules - For Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNVrfoSubmIC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2011|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=978-1-55199-581-6|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Che Ruoshui|zh|3=车若水}} wrote the first known criticism of the practice: "Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small.

The earliest archaeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each had her feet bound with 6-foot-long gauze strips. Zhou's skeleton was well preserved and showed that her feet fit the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her.&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the "three-inch golden lotus", may be a later development in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=187–191 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJHUFRTYpA4C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |pages=21–24 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the [[Yuan dynasty]], some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called "toast to the golden lotus" and lasted until the late [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="shoe"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2Ifj9h4Z4YQC&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Art of the Shoe |author= Marie-Josèphe Bossan |page=164 |publisher=Parkstone Press Ltd |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-85995-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European to mention footbinding was the Italian missionary [[Odoric of Pordenone]] in the fourteenth century during the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History |first=Patricia|last= Ebrey |page=196|publisher=Routledge |isbn= 9781134442935 |date=2003-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other foreign visitors to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] China mentioned the practice, including [[Ibn Battuta]] and [[Marco Polo]] (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Marco Polo's China: A Venetian in the Realm of Khubilai Khan |first= Stephen G. |last=Haw |pages=55–56 |publisher=Routledge| isbn=9781134275427|date=2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice however was encouraged by the Mongol rulers on their Chinese subjects.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"/&gt; The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general population, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted footbinding. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming period]], the practice was no longer the preserve of the gentry, but it was considered a status symbol.&lt;ref name="Rosenlee2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee|title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA141|date=1 February 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8179-0|pages=141–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=37 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S.

[[File:Chaussure chinoise Saverne 02 05 2012 1.jpg|thumb|230px|A lotus shoe for bound feet. The ideal length for a bound foot was 3 Chinese inches (寸), which is around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in western measurement.]]

The Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader [[Hong Taiji]] declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYgQWAfHjmsC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|author= Li-Hsiang, Lisa Rosenlee |page=144 |publisher= State University of New York Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-7914-6750-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few Han Chinese complied with the edicts and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. 
By the 19th century, it was estimated that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt; Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to [[Hypergamy|marry into money]] in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to never have the need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the "Golden Lotus", being about three [[Cun (unit)|Chinese inches]] long (around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in Western measurement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=8 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Mary Ellen|title=China's "Golden Lotus Feet" - Foot-binding Practice|url=http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=10 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031927/http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity |author= Janell L. Carroll |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9X8EAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=8 |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0-495-60499-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women with bound feet may not walk without the support of their shoes and were severely limited in their mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NieEnuWegkoC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;lpg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Film Review - Footbinding: Search for the Three Inch Golden Lotus |journal=Anthropologica |date=2004 |volume=48|issue=2|first=Laurel |last=Bossen |pages=301–303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women with bound feet were still able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitation than their non-bound counterparts.  In the 19th and early 20th century, dancers with bound feet were popular, as were circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in [[Yunnan]] Province even formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s could be found providing limited assistance to the workers in the rice fields well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt;

=== Demise ===
Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] were of Hakka background whose womenfolk did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYjGN4UM1mMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=27–29 |title=The Taiping Ideology: Its Sources, Interpretations, and Influences|author1=Vincent Yu-Chung Shih |author2=Yu-chung Shi |publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1968 |isbn=978-0-295-73957-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBqr_MEn4m4C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=For Our Daughters: How Outstanding Women Worldwide Have Balanced Home and Career|author= Olivia Cox-Fill|page=57|publisher=Praeger Publishers |year= 1996|isbn= 978-0-275-95199-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, [[pamphleteering]], and lobbying of the Qing court.&lt;ref name="blake 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cross-cultural Study of Women: A Comprehensive Guide|author= Mary I.

"  Besides improvements in civil engineering, progress was made in social areas as well. The traditional Chinese practice of foot binding was widespread in Taiwan's early years. Traditional Chinese society perceived women with smaller feet as being more beautiful. Women would bind their feet with long bandages to stunt growth.
Even housemaids were divided into those with bound feet and those without. The former served the daughters of the house, while the latter were assigned heavier work. This practice was later regarded as barbaric. In the early years of the Japanese colonial period, the Foot-binding Liberation Society was established to promote the idea of natural feet, but its influence was limited.
The fact that women suffered higher casualties in the 1906 Meishan quake with 551 men and 700 women dead, and 1,099 men and 1,334 women injured--very different from the situation in Japan--raised public concern. Foot binding was blamed and this gave impetus to the drive to stamp out the practice."&lt;/ref&gt; The practice however lingered on in some regions in China; in 1928, a census in rural [[Shanxi]] found that 18% of women had bound feet,&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125800116737444883  |title=Bound by History: The Last of China's 'Lotus-Feet' Ladies |author= Simon Montlake |date = November 13, 2009 |work=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some remote rural areas such as [[Yunnan Province]] it continued to be practiced until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Favazza, Armando R.

Foot binding was practiced in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called "cucumber foot" (''huanggua jiao'') due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel and taper the ankle.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=7 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some working women in [[Jiangsu]] made a pretense of binding while keeping their feet natural.&lt;ref name="blake 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History |author=C Fred Blake|pages=327–329|editor= Bonnie G.

[[Manchu people|Manchu]] women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the [[Eight Banners]], did not bind their feet, and the most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance.&lt;ref name="manchu"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Elliott|first=Mark C.|title=The Manchu Way: the Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-3606-0|pages=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These "flower bowl" (花盆鞋) or "horse-hoof" shoes (馬蹄鞋) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.&lt;ref name="manchu" /&gt;

}}

The process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb, and therefore the pain would not be as extreme.&lt;ref name="slippers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Beverley|title=Splendid Slippers: A Thousand Years of an Erotic Tradition |publisher=Ten Speed Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-89815-957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3&amp;nbsp;m long and 5&amp;nbsp;cm wide (10&amp;nbsp;ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.

The broken toes were held tightly against the sole of the foot while the foot was then drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.
[[File:Bound feet (X-ray).jpg|thumb|An X-ray of two bound feet]]
[[File:FootBindingRxSchema2.gif|thumb|Schema of an x-ray comparison between an unbound and bound foot]]

The girl's broken feet required a great deal of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

Immediately after this procedure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;

For most the bound feet eventually became numb.  However, once a foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful,&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|author= Margo DeMello |pages=116–117 |publisher=Greenwood Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-313-33695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain all over again.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

=== Health issues ===
The most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl's toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/21/china.gender |title= The ties that bind |first=Fraser|last= Newham|date= 21 March 2005 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=

At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, S. &amp; Stone, K. (1997) "Consequences of Foot Binding Among Older Women in Beijing China", in: ''American Journal of Public Health'' EBSCO Host.

===Beauty and erotic appeal===
[[File:Woman with bound feet reclining on chaise lounge, China LCCN2001705601.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Bound feet were considered by some to be highly appealing]]
Before footbinding was practiced in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the [[Tang dynasty]] tale of [[Ye Xian]] written around 850 by [[Duan Chengshi]]. This tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of [[Cinderella]], and is thought to be one of its antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jruLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding: A Jungian Engagement with Chinese Culture and Psychology |author= Shirley See Yan Ma |pages=75&amp;ndash;78 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd |date=4 December 2009 |isbn=9781135190071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/25ii/10_25.2.pdf |title=Asian Origins of Cinderella: The Zhuang Storyteller of Guangxi |journal=Oral Tradition|volume=25|number=2 |first=Fay |last=Beauchamp |pages=447–496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman's beauty and made her movement more dainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vr81YoYK0c4C&amp;pg=PA160 |title='Cambridge Illustrated History of China|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=160–161|edition=2nd|isbn=9780521124331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. The desirability varies with the size of the feet &amp;ndash; the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called "golden lotuses") would be around 3 Chinese inches (around 4 inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in Western measurement) or smaller, while those larger may be called "silver lotuses" (4 Chinese inches) or "iron lotuses" (5 Chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbJ3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |title=The Aesthetics of Dress |first= Ian |last=King |page=59 |isbn=9783319543222 |publisher=Springer|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that footbinding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of footbinding.&lt;ref name="hill 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |page=56 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic, and Qing Dynasty sex manuals listed 48 different ways of playing with women's bound feet. Some men preferred never to see a woman's bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny "lotus shoes" and wrappings.  According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman's body; in erotic art of the Qing to Song periods where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Sexual life in ancient China:A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C. Till 1644 A.D |page=218|author=Robert Hans van Gulik |year=1961 |publisher= Brill |isbn= 9004039171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Levy however suggests that the barely revealed bound foot may also only function as an initial tease.&lt;ref name="hill 1"/&gt;

An erotic effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. As a result, women who had undergone foot-binding would walk in a cautious and unsteady manner.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;  Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive, and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmdKklZM9-kC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Bodies under Siege: Self-mutilation, Nonsuicidal Self-injury, and Body Modification in Culture and Psychiatry|author= Armando R. Favazza | page=117|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|edition= third |date=2 May 2011|isbn=9781421401119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] considered footbinding to be a "perversion that corresponds to [[foot fetishism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacker|first1=Authur|title=China Illustrated|date=2012|publisher=Turtle Publishing|isbn=9781462906901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5JyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Confucianism===
[[File:A HIGH CASTE LADYS DAINTY LILY FEET.jpg|thumb|220px|A woman with her feet unwrapped]]

A common argument is that the revival of [[Confucianism]] as [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the Song dynasty resulted in the decline of the status of women, and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the [[cult of widow chastity]], it also contributed to the development of footbinding.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"/&gt; According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the prominent Song Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by [[Lin Yutang]] among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that [[Zhu Xi]] also promoted footbinding in [[Fujian]] as a way of encouraging chastity among women, that by restricting their movement it would help keep men and women separate.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Patricia Buckley Ebrey|Patricia Ebrey]] suggests that this story might be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139|title= Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |author= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |date= April 2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6749-7 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of footbinding, and unbound women were also praised.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie G. Smith|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA358|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|pages=358–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neo-Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] was said to be against footbinding and his family and descendants did not bind their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=丁传靖 编|title=《宋人轶事汇编》|location=北京|publisher=中华书局|date=1981|page=卷9，第2册，页455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/foot-binding-and-ruism-confucianism_us_58c86e8fe4b01d0d473bceed |title=Foot-binding and Ruism (Confucianism)|date=16 March 2017 |author= Bin Song|work=Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern Confucian scholars such as [[Tu Weiming]] also dispute any causal link between neo-Confucianism and footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Confucian thought: selfhood as creative transformation|author= Tu Wei-ming|publisher= State University of New York Press|date= 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that Confucian doctrine in fact prohibits mutilation of the body as people should not "injure even the hair and skin of the body received from mother and father". It is however argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice.&lt;ref name="blake"/&gt; Confucian instructions on the moral behaviour of women would include examples of women who were prepared to die or suffer mutilation to show their commitment to the Confucian ethos.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

Historian [[Dorothy Y. Ko|Dorothy Ko]] proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized.  Footbinding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation; one from 1591 for example placed footbinding in a section on "Female Adornments" that included hairdos, powders, and ear-piercings.  According to Ko, the perception of footbinding as a civilised practice may be evinced from a [[Ming dynasty]] account that mentioned a proposal to "entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs" by encouraging footbinding among their womenfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://womenshistory.osu.edu/sites/womenshistory.osu.edu/files/The%20Body%20as%20Attire.pdf |title=The Body as Attire: The Shifting Meanings of Footbinding in Seventeenth-Century China |journal=Journal of Women's History|volume =8|number= 4 |date= 1997 |pages= 8–27 |doi= 10.1353/jowh.2010.0171 |first=Dorothy|last= Ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was also carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age.&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ko1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Ko|title=Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women and Culture in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nNcRiE-TKsC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2359-6|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo-Confucian way of being civilized.&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Blake/pdfs/1994%20%20Foot-binding%20in%20Neo-Confucian%20China.pdf|title=Foot-Binding in Neo-Confucian China and the Appropriation of Female Labor | author=C.

===Feminist perspective===
{{Violence against women|sp=uk}}

===Other interpretations===

Some scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the theories that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well. They argued that foot binding was important in work, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork and keep them close at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/12/unraveling-a-brutal-custom/ |title=Unraveling a brutal custom |author=Colleen Walsh |work=Harvard Gazette |date=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus' conquest in 1644, as it was then practiced only by Han women.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA40 |pages=40–41 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S. Major |publisher=Yale University Press |year= 2000 |isbn=978-0-300-07931-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Qing Dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |page=266 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature, film and television ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
&lt;!-- This is not a place to list every novel that mentions footbinding, or a film or TV shows that happens to have a character with bound feet. --&gt;

The bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral, implying a respect for Chinese culture and assuming that it is not the role of outsiders to promote reform. Sometimes the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply [[wikt:condescension|condescension]] or [[wikt:contempt|contempt]] for China.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ebrey, "Gender and Sinology: Shifting Western Interpretations of Footbinding, 1300–1890", ''Late Imperial China'' 20.2  (1999): 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

He opened his own Abell's Star Gallery in Stockton in 1866 before moving back to San Francisco in 1867. The following year he traveled back up north through the Grass Valley, Red Bluff, and Yreka to Roseburg, Oregon in 1877.&lt;ref name="oldoregonphotos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oldoregonphotos.com/photographers/fabell.html#|title=Frank G.

'''Gareth Richard Vaughan Jones''' (13 August 1905 – 12 August 1935) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[journalist]] who first publicized in the [[Western world]] the existence of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–33]].

==Life and career==
[[File:Gareth-jones.jpg|250px|thumb]]
Jones was born in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[Glamorgan]]. His father Major Edgar Jones was headmaster of Barry County School which Gareth attended. His mother had spent the period 1889–1892 as tutor to the children of Arthur Hughes, the son of Welsh steel industrialist [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]], who had founded the town of ''Yuzovka'' or ''Hughesovka'', modern day [[Donetsk]], in [[Ukraine]], and her stories inspired in Jones a desire to visit the [[Soviet Union]], and particularly Ukraine.

Jones graduated from the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] in 1926 with a first class degree in [[French language|French]], and from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1929 with a first class honours degree in French, [[German language|German]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title='Unsung hero' reporter remembered|date=2006-05-02|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/mid_/4964784.stm|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1930 he began work as Foreign Affairs Advisor to former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]], and that summer made his first brief "pilgrimage" to [[Donetsk|Yuzovka]] (by then renamed Stalino).

In 1931 he was offered employment in [[New York City]] by Dr [[Ivy Lee]], public relations advisor to organisations such as the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]], the [[Chrysler Foundation]], and [[Standard Oil]], to research a book about the Soviet Union. In the summer of 1931 he toured the Soviet Union with [[H.J. Heinz II]] of the [[H.J. Heinz Company|food company dynasty]], producing a diary published by Heinz as ''Experiences in Russia 1931'', a diary which probably contains the first usage of the word "starve" in relation to the [[collectivisation]] of Soviet agriculture. In 1932 Jones returned to work for Lloyd George and helped the wartime Prime Minister write his ''War Memoirs''.

During the 1930s, he was a reporter for the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]''.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news | last=Brown | first=Mark | title=1930s journalist Gareth Jones to have story retold: Correspondent who exposed Soviet Ukraine's manmade famine to be focus of new documentary | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/13/gareth-jones-story-retold-documentary | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | date=12 November 2009 | accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late January and early February 1933 Jones was in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] covering the accession to power of the [[Nazi Party]], and was in [[Leipzig]] on the day [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]]. A few days later on 23 February in the ''Richthofen'', the fastest and most powerful three-motored aeroplane in Germany, Jones became the first foreign journalist to fly with Hitler as he accompanied Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels]] to [[Frankfurt]] where he reported for the ''Western Mail'' on the new Chancellor's tumultuous acclamation in that city.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richthofen&gt;{{cite news | last = Jones | first = Gareth | title = With Hitler across Europe | url = http://www.garethjones.org/german_articles/welshman_looks_at_europe_10.htm | newspaper = [[Western Mail (Wales)|The Western Mail and South Wales News]] | location = Cardiff | date = 28 February 1933 | accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SovietArticles&gt;{{cite web | title = Famine Exposure: Newspaper Articles relating to Gareth Jones' trips to The Soviet Union (1930–35) | url = http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/soviet_articles.htm | work = www.garethjones.org | accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if the ''Richthofen'' had crashed the history of Europe would have changed.&lt;ref name=Richthofen/&gt; The next month, he travelled to the [[Soviet Union]] and eluded authorities to slip into [[Ukraine SSR|Ukraine]], where he kept diaries of [[Holodomor|the man-made starvation]] he witnessed.&lt;ref name=SovietArticles/&gt;&lt;ref name=WalesOnline&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Welsh journalist who exposed a Soviet tragedy | url = http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/welsh-journalist-who-exposed-soviet-2069992 | work = walesonline.com | date = 13 November 2009 | accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to [[Berlin]] on 29 March 1933, he issued his press release, which was published by many newspapers, including ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' and the ''[[New York Post|New York Evening Post]]'':

{{Quote|I walked along through villages and twelve collective farms. Everywhere was the cry, 'There is no bread. We are dying'. This cry came from every part of Russia, from the [[Volga]], [[Siberia]], [[Belorussia|White Russia]], the [[North Caucasus]], and [[Central Asia]]. I tramped through the [[black earth region]] because that was once the richest farmland in Russia and because the correspondents have been forbidden to go there to see for themselves what is happening.

In the train a [[Communist]] denied to me that there was a famine. I flung a crust of bread which I had been eating from my own supply into a spittoon. A peasant fellow-passenger fished it out and ravenously ate it. I threw an orange peel into the spittoon and the peasant again grabbed it and devoured it. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] subsided. I stayed overnight in a village where there used to be two hundred oxen and where there now are six. The peasants were eating the cattle [[fodder]] and had only a month's supply left. They told me that many had already died of hunger. Two soldiers came to arrest a thief. They warned me against travel by night, as there were too many 'starving' desperate men.

'We are waiting for death' was my welcome, but see, we still, have our cattle fodder. Go farther south. There they have nothing. Many houses are empty of people already dead,' they cried.}}

This report was unwelcome in a great many of the media, as the [[intelligentsia]] of the time was still in sympathy with the Soviet regime.&lt;ref name=SovietArticles/&gt; On 31 March, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a denial of Jones' statement by [[Walter Duranty]] under the headline "RUSSIANS HUNGRY, BUT NOT STARVING".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=[[Walter Duranty]] |title=RUSSIANS HUNGRY, BUT NOT STARVING; Deaths From Diseases Due to Malnutrition High, Yet the Soviet Is Entrenched |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=31 March 1933 |page=13 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/03/31/archives/russians-hungry-but-not-starving-deaths-from-diseases-due-to.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030330120042/http://colley.co.uk/garethjones/soviet_articles/russians_hungry_not_starving.htm |archivedate=2003-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, [[Kremlin]] sources denied the existence of a famine, and said, "Russian and foreign observers in country could see no grounds for predications of disaster". On 13 May, Jones published a strong rebuttal to Duranty in ''The New York Times'', standing by his report:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Gareth Jones |title=Mr. Jones Replies; Former Secretary of Lloyd George Tells of Observations in Russia |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 May 1933 |page=12 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16F63D5E1A7A93C1A8178ED85F478385F9 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030324021639/http://colley.co.uk/garethjones/soviet_articles/jones_replies.htm |archivedate=2003-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|My first evidence was gathered from foreign observers. Since Mr. Duranty introduces [[consul (representative)|consuls]] into the discussion, a thing I am loath to do, for they are official representatives of their countries and should not be quoted, may I say that I discussed the Russian situation with between twenty and thirty consuls and diplomatic representatives of various nations and that their evidence supported my point of view. But they are not allowed to express their views in the press, and therefore remain silent.

Journalists, on the other hand, are allowed to write, but the [[censorship]] has turned them into masters of euphemism and understatement. Hence they give "famine" the polite name of 'food shortage' and 'starving to death' is softened down to read as 'widespread mortality from diseases due to [[malnutrition]]'. Consuls are not so reticent in private conversation.}}

In a personal letter from Soviet [[List of Russian foreign ministers|Foreign Commissar]] [[Maxim Litvinov]] (whom Jones had interviewed while in [[Moscow]]) to Lloyd George, Jones was informed that he was banned from ever visiting the Soviet Union again.

==Death==

Banned from Russia, Jones turned his attention to the [[Far East]] and in late 1934 he left Britain on a "Round-the-World Fact-Finding Tour". He spent about six weeks in [[Japan]], interviewing important generals and politicians, and he eventually reached [[Beijing]]. From here he traveled to [[Inner Mongolia]] in newly Japanese-occupied [[Manchukuo]] in the company of a German journalist. Detained by Japanese forces, the pair were told that there were three routes back to the Chinese town of [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]], only one of which was safe; they took this route but were captured by bandits who demanded a ransom of 100,000 [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Silver coin|silver]] [[Mexican peso|pesos]]. The German journalist was released after two days, but 16&amp;nbsp;days later the bandits shot Jones under mysterious circumstances, on the eve of his 30th birthday. There were strong suspicions that Jones' murder was engineered by the Soviet [[NKVD]], as revenge for the embarrassment he had previously caused the Soviet regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Journalist Gareth Jones' 1935 murder examined by BBC Four|date=2012-07-05|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-18691109|accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 1935, the [[London]] ''[[Evening Standard]]'' quoted Lloyd George paying tribute to Jones:

{{Quote|That part of the world is a cauldron of conflicting intrigue and one or other interests concerned probably knew that Mr Gareth Jones knew too much of what was going on... He had a passion for finding out what was happening in foreign lands wherever there was trouble, and in pursuit of his investigations he shrank from no risk... I had always been afraid that he would take one risk too many. Nothing escaped his observation, and he allowed no obstacle to turn from his course when he thought that there was some fact, which he could obtain. He had the almost unfailing knack of getting at things that mattered.}}

In November 2009, his diaries recording the man-made genocide of the Great Soviet Famine of 1932–33 went on display for the first time at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name=WalesOnline/&gt;

In 2015, a feature film titled ''Gareth Jones'', based on Jones' famine reporting, was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Obenson | first=Tambay A. | title=140 New Projects Selected for the IFP's 2015 Project Forum Slate | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/140-new-projects-selected-for-the-ifps-2015-project-forum-slate-20150723 | work=[[IndieWire]] | date=23 July 2015 | accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016 it was announced that the Oscar-nominated Polish director [[Agnieszka Holland]] would direct ''Gareth Jones''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/american-honey-rams-execs-among-efp-producers-on-the-move/5102848.article "'American Honey', 'Rams' execs among EFP Producers On The Move"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804072028/http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/american-honey-rams-execs-among-efp-producers-on-the-move/5102848.article |date=4 August 2016 }}.

==Memorial==
On 2 May 2006, a trilingual ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]/[[English language|English]]/[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) plaque was unveiled in Gareth Jones' memory in the Old College at Aberystwyth University, in the presence of his niece Margaret Siriol Colley, and the [[Ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom|Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK]], [[Ihor Kharchenko]], who described him as an "unsung hero of Ukraine". The idea for a plaque and funding were provided by the [[Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association]], working in conjunction with the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain. Dr [[Lubomyr Luciuk]], UCCLA's director of research, spoke at the unveiling ceremony.

In November 2008, Jones and fellow Holodomor journalist [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] were posthumously awarded the [[Order of Merit (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Order of Merit]] at a ceremony in [[Westminster Central Hall]], by Dr Kharchenko, on behalf of the [[President of Ukraine]] for their exceptional service to the country and its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/7742330.stm|title=Ukraine to honour Welsh reporter|publisher=BBC Wales|date=2008-11-22|accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/story.html?id=983236 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090112050211/http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=983236 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-01-12 |title=Telling the truth about the Ukrainian famine |publisher=[[National Post]] (Canada) |date=2008-11-22 |accessdate=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3832">The production of two type of gametes is called '''heterogamy'''. It is the type of sexual reproduction in which male gametes are small and motile while female gamete are large and non-motile. Female gametes contain stored food which is used in the early stage of development of new offspring.

==Science==
===Reproductive biology===
In reproductive biology, heterogamy is the alternation of differently organized generations, applied to the alternation between [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] and a [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Walter de Gruyter| isbn = 978-3-11-010661-9| last = Scott| first = Thomas| title = Concise encyclopedia biology| year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0165-5752 | volume = 52| issue = 3| pages = 219–225 | last = Poinar| first = George O, Jr |author2=Trevor A Jackson |author3=Nigel L Bell |author4=Mohd B-asri Wahid| title = Elaeolenchus parthenonema n. g., n. sp.

Alternately, ''heterogamy'' or ''heterogamous'' is often used as a synonym of [[heterogametic]], meaning the presence of two unlike chromosomes in a sex.&lt;ref name=Lokki&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 79| issue = 3| pages = 513–525| last = Lokki| first = Juhani|author2=Esko Suomalainen |author3=Anssi Saura |author4=Pekka Lankinen | title = Genetic Polymorphism and Evolution in Parthenogenetic Animals.

===Cell biology===
{{main|Anisogamy}}
In [[cell biology]], heterogamy is a synonym  of [[anisogamy]], the condition of having differently sized male and female [[gamete]]s produced by different sexes or mating types in a species.

===Botany===
In [[botany]], a plant is heterogamous when it carries at least two different types of flowers in regard to their reproductive structures, for example male and female flowers or bisexual and female flowers. [[Stamen]]s and [[carpel]]s are not regularly present in each flower or floret.

==Social science==
In [[sociology]], heterogamy refers to a [[marriage]] between two individuals that differ in a certain criterion, and is contrasted with [[Endogamy|homogamy]] for a marriage or union between partners that match according to that criterion. For example, ethnic heterogamy refers to marriages involving individuals of different ethnic groups. Age heterogamy refers to marriages involving partners of significantly different ages. Heterogamy and homogamy are also used to describe marriage or union between people of unlike and like sex (or gender) respectively.

'''James Larkin White''' (July 11, 1882 &amp;ndash; April 26, 1946), better known as '''Jim White''', was a [[cowboy]], [[guano]] miner, [[cave]] explorer, and [[park ranger]] for the [[National Park Service]].  He is best remembered as the discoverer, early promoter and explorer of what is known today as ''Carlsbad Caverns'' in [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]], [[New Mexico]].

==Birth==
{{quote|I want to be a cowboy.|Jim White|One Man's Dream}}

Jim White was born on July 11, 1882, on a ranch in [[Mason County, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Borderlands"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epcc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=309255&amp;sid=2603429 |title=Jim White Explored Carlsbad Caverns for Years |accessdate=October 11, 2010 |author1=Ruth Reyes |author2=Kyndle Tooke |author3=Audra Graziano |author4=Casandra Jimenez |work=Borderlands |publisher=[[El Paso Community College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started working in the cattle business at a very early age and preferred it to the school his father forced him to attend.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; He preferred "bustin' broncos to books and blackboards".&lt;ref name="Borderlands"/&gt; One day, when Jim had had enough of school, he begged his father to let him do something else. "I want to be a cowboy", he said.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; So, when he was 10 years old, his father agreed to take him to the southeastern corner of the [[New Mexico Territory]].&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt;  He left him at the ranch of John and Dan Lucas (''XXX Ranch''&lt;ref name="Borderlands"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt;  His father bought land at Lonetree, just west of the developing town of Eddy (Carlsbad today), and moved the rest of the family there three years later.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt;  Jim occasionally stayed at his family's small horse farm, but mostly lived and worked at the Lucas ranch.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt;

==Discovery==
{{quote|... any hole in the ground which could house such a gigantic army of bats must be a whale of a big cave.|Jim White|Jim White's Own Story}}

An inscription reading "J White 1898"&lt;ref name="CHU9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/cave/planyourvisit/upload/CHU_20040225.pdf |title=Cave History Update; CHU #9&amp;ndash;February 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |author=Neal R. Bullington |work=Cave History Update |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was discovered deep within Carlsbad Caverns in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="CHU9"/&gt; It provides witness to the presence of a 15- or 16-year-old Jim White.

While riding his horse through the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] looking for stray cattle&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; with a fence mending crew&lt;ref name="The Early Years"/&gt; for the Lucas brothers, Jim saw a plume of [[bat]]s rising from the desert hills.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; It appeared to be a [[volcano]], or a [[Whirlwind (atmospheric phenomenon)|whirlwind]] but did not behave quite like either.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jim White's Own Story, the Discovery and History of Carlsbad Caverns |last=White |first=Jim |year=1932 |publisher=Jim White and Charley Lee White |editor=Frank Ernest Nicholson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tied his horse to a nearby tree and worked his way through the brush to the edge of a large opening in the ground.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; Jim described the moment by saying, "I found myself gazing into the biggest and blackest hole I had ever seen, out of which the bats seemed literally to boil".&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt;

==First exploration==
{{quote|Standing at the entrance of the tunnel I could see ahead of me a darkness so absolutely black it seemed a solid.|Jim White|Jim White's Own Story}}

A few days later,&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Cave History Update; April 27, 2005'' paraphrases Jim White Jr. in saying that his father "... probably took about a month getting ready to go into the cave the first time".&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to the cave with some rope, fence wire and a [[hatchet]].&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt; He cut wood from some nearby shrubs and assembled a makeshift [[ladder]].&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt; He lowered the ladder into the opening and using a homemade [[kerosene]] [[lantern]], descended approximately {{convert|50|ft}} to the first serviceable ledge.&lt;ref name="The Early Years" /&gt; He climbed down an additional {{convert|20|ft}} to a floor.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt; Using the "sickly glow"&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt; of his lantern, he made his way into the cave. He felt as if he "... was wandering into the very core of the Guadalupe Mountains."&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt;

After reaching a chamber, he noted two tunnels leading off in opposite directions, one downward and to the right and one, more level, to the left.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt; He decided to go left first and discovered the [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park#Bat Cave|Bat Cave]].&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt; He explored it for a while then proceeded down the other tunnel.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story" /&gt;

{{quote|I followed on until I found myself in a wilderness of mighty stalagmites. It was the first cave I was ever in, and the first stalagmites I had ever seen, but instinctively I knew, for some intuitive reason, that there was no other scene in the world which could be justly compared with my surroundings.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt;}}

By the time he reached the first [[speleothem|formations]], he had "... crept cat-like across a dozen dangerous ledges and past many tremendous openings ...".&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; He saw more [[stalagmites]], "... each seemingly larger and more beautifully formed than the ones I'd passed".&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; He encountered chandeliers, [[stalactite]]s, [[soda straw]]s, [[flowstone]], pools of water, [[rimstone|rimstone dams]] and other formations.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; He dropped rocks into pits to determine their depth.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; He rolled one boulder into a pit and it fell for a couple of seconds and then "... kept rolling and rolling until its sound became an echo".&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt;

Then the light from his homemade kerosene lantern went out.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; The darkness seemed to smother him.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; Jim described the incident by saying, "It seemed as though a million tons of black wool descended upon me."&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt;

After refilling his lantern from a spare [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] of oil, he made his way back to the surface.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt;

==The kid==
{{quote|... it would be impossible to even exaggerate our experiences during those three days.|Jim White|Jim White's Own Story}}

Jim returned to the cave with a 15-year-old [[Mexico|Mexican]] boy.&lt;ref name="The Early Years"/&gt; His real name is unknown—he was known only as ''Muchacho'', ''The Kid'', or ''Pothead''.&lt;ref name="The Early Years"/&gt;

Five days after Jim's first trip into the cave, he and Pothead made an exploration.&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; Carrying food, water, fuel and homemade [[torch]]es, they began an exploration which lasted three days.&lt;ref name="The Early Years"/&gt; They took a large ball of string to use to ensure their exit.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt;

They explored approximately the same areas of the cave that the modern tourist trails cover&lt;ref name="Jim Whites Own Story"/&gt; including the [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park#Big Room or The Hall of the Giants|Big Room]], and the [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park#King's Palace|King's Palace]] and [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park#Queen's Chamber|Queen's Chamber]].&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt;

==Jim White's Own Story==
The original record of the early events surrounding Jim White and Carlsbad Caverns comes from a booklet, self-published in 1932, titled ''Jim White's Own Story''. The booklet was [[ghostwriter|ghost written]] by [[Frank Ernest Nicholson]] in exchange for payment of a boarding bill.&lt;ref name="The Early Years"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nymeyer |first1=Robert |last2=Halliday|first2=William R.|year=1991 |title=Carlsbad Cavern The Early Years: A Photographic History of the Cave and Its People |editor-last=Houk |editor-first=Rose|publisher=Carlsbad Caverns, Guadalupe Mountains Association |isbn=0-0916907-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson was a journalist and led the ill-fated ''Nicholson Expedition'' to Carlsbad Caverns in 1929 sponsored by [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="The Early Years" /&gt;

Jim White had a permit with the National Park Service to sell the booklet from the [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park#Underground Lunchroom|Underground Lunchroom]].&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt; [[Dennis Chavez]], a [[U.S. Senator]] helped obtain the permit by putting pressure on the park.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt; At first, the agreement was oral but later, it became more formal.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt; Sales of the booklet ceased two months after Jim White's death.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt;

==The guano bucket==
[[File:Jim White Guano Bucket.jpg|thumb|right|Jim White standing next to a [[guano]] bucket atop the guano shaft at [[Carlsbad Caverns]]. The bucket was used to carry the first tourists into the caverns. He is holding one of his homemade [[kerosene]] [[lanterns]].]]

One of the early guano companies dug a shaft making a more direct route to the guano deposits in the Bat Cave.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; It was serviced by a large iron bucket operated by a gasoline winch.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; This system was used to haul bags of guano out of the cave for use as [[fertilizer]] in places like the [[California]] [[Orchard|fruit orchards]].&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; The guano was sold for 90 [[United States dollar|dollars]] a [[Short ton|ton]] ({{convert|2000|lbs|kg|sp=us}}).&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; Jim White used the guano bucket to transport hundreds of tourists into and out of the cave.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt;

The original guano bucket was used as the stand in the Underground Lunchroom from which Jim White sold his booklets.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt; Jim White Jr. later gave it to a man named Charlie Dugger and it was stored in his garage.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt;

==Family==
Jim White married Fannie Hill on January 1, 1912.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; She was eighteen and a longtime friend from the town of Lonetree.&lt;ref name="The Early Years"/&gt; Their first house was provided by the guano company.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; It was a "... two room shack, set practically on top of the small bat cave, which was several hundred yards from the main cavern entrance."&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; Jim and Fannie had a son named James Larkin White, Jr. on March 23, 1919.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; Jim moved his family into a four-room house provided by the guano company when Jim Jr. was about two years old.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; It was a few hundred feet farther from the cave entrance.&lt;ref name="One Mans Dream"/&gt; They did not have running water at the house; instead, Jim would take a [[burro]] to Oak Springs and let it loose to find its way home with two cans of water on its back.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/cave/planyourvisit/upload/CHU_20050427.pdf |title=Cave History Update; April 27, 2005 |accessdate=February 25, 2009 |author=Bob Hoff |work=Cave History Update |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fannie would empty the water into a barrel when the burro returned.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt; They did not get electricity until 1929 or 1930 and it was only on during the day.&lt;ref name="CHU April 27, 2005"/&gt;

After his death, a movement was started to have a statue of Jim White erected at the cavern entrance.&lt;ref name="The Early Years"/&gt; Instead, a bronze plaque was placed in the lobby at the park visitor center which reads:

{{poemquote|
JAMES L. WHITE
1882-1946
Beginning in 1901, Jim White made the first known
extensive explorations of the Carlsbad Caverns.
He was chiefly responsible for bringing the attention
of the public, scientific groups and the federal
government to the importance and significance
of the caverns.&lt;ref name="The Early Years"/&gt;}}

In 2011, a large, bronze statue of Jim White descending a wire ladder was unveiled at the National Cave and Karst Research Institute (NCKRI) building in Carlsbad, New Mexico.

'''Johann Peter Salomon''' (20 February 1745 [baptized] &amp;ndash; 28 November 1815) was a German [[violin]]ist, [[composer]], [[conducting|conductor]] and musical [[impresario]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Bonn]] and was the second son of Philipp Salomon, an oboist at the court in Bonn. His birth home was at Bonngasse 515, coincidentally the later birth home of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins Landon (1976, 24)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of thirteen, he became a violinist in the court orchestra and six years later became the concert master of the orchestra of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726-1802)|Prince Heinrich of Prussia]]. He composed several works for the court, including four [[operas]] and an [[oratorio]]. He moved to [[London]] in the early 1780s, where he worked as a composer and played violin both as a celebrated soloist and in a [[string quartet]]. He made his first public appearance at [[Covent Garden]] on 23 March 1781.

While in England, Salomon composed two operas for the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera]],&lt;ref&gt;Of his 1795 opera ''Windsor Castle'', [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote "ganz passabel"; "quite passable".  Haydn wrote an overture for the opera (Robbins Landon 1976: 24, 483).&lt;/ref&gt; several art songs, a number of [[concertos]], and [[chamber music]] pieces. He is perhaps best known today, however, as a concert organiser and conductor.

Salomon brought [[Joseph Haydn]] to London in 1791–92 and 1794–95, and together with Haydn led the first performances of many of the works that Haydn composed while in England.&lt;ref&gt;At the performances, both Haydn and Salomon were seated center stage.  Haydn (who according to [[Charles Burney|Burney]] "presided" seated at a piano while Salomon led with his violin, a common practice of the time.  The tempos were set by Salomon.  See Robbins Landon (1976:  52, 56–57).&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn wrote his symphonies numbers 93 to 104 for these trips, which are sometimes known as the ''Salomon'' symphonies (they are more widely known as the [[London symphonies]]). Haydn's esteem for his impresario and orchestral leader can sometimes be seen in the symphonies: for example, the cadenza in the slow movement of the [[Symphony No. 96 (Haydn)|96th]] and the phrase marked ''Salomon solo ma piano'' in the trio of the [[Symphony No. 97 (Haydn)|97th]]; the [[Sinfonia Concertante (Haydn)|Sinfonia Concertante in B-flat major]] was composed for Salomon, who played the solo violin part; and the [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn|six string quartets opp. 71 and 74]], written between the two London visits in 1793, though dedicated to Count Apponyi, were clearly designed for the public performances that Salomon's quartet gave in London. Salomon is also said to have had a hand in providing Haydn with the original model for the text of ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]''. He was one of the founder-members of the [[Philharmonic Society]] and led the orchestra at its first concert on 8 March 1813.

Salomon is also believed to have given the ''Jupiter'' nickname to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 41]]''.&lt;ref name=heartz1781-1802&gt;Heartz, Daniel, ''Mozart, Haydn and Early Beethoven 1781–1802'', p. 210, Norton (2009), {{ISBN|978-0-393-06634-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst his protégés was the English composer and soloist [[George Pinto]].

Salomon died in [[London, England|London]] in 1815, of injuries suffered when he was thrown from his horse.&lt;ref name="Robbins Landon 1976, 27"&gt;Robbins Landon (1976, 27)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is buried in the [[cloister]]s of [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Assessment==
[[File:Memorial stone William Shield and Johann Peter Salomon.jpg|right|thumb|Memorial in south cloister of Westminster Abbey]]
Salomon's violin playing was highly regarded in his day; for a collection of reviews, see Robbins Landon (1976, 24–27).  Robbins Landon also praises his personal qualities:  "Salomon was not only a clever and sensitive impresario, he was also generous, scrupulously honest, and very efficient in business matters."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins Landon (1976, 24–27)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who knew Salomon from his days in Bonn, wrote to [[Ferdinand Ries|Ries]] on hearing of his death, "Salomon's death grieves me much, for he was a noble man, and I remember him since I was a child."&lt;ref name="Robbins Landon 1976, 27"/&gt;

Since 2011 the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] has awarded the ''Salomon Prize'' to highlight talent and dedication within UK orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/index.php/awards/Salomon/|title=The Salomon Prize|website=Royal Philharmonic Society|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110215603/http://royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/index.php/awards/Salomon/|archivedate=2014-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">'''Johann Philipp Abelin''' was a  [[Germany|German]] chronicler whose career straddled the 16th and 17th centuries. He was born, probably, at [[Strasbourg]], and died there between 1634 and 1637. He wrote numerous histories under the pseudonyms of '''Abeleus''', '''Philipp Arlanibäus''', '''Johann Ludwig Gottfried''' and '''Gotofredus'''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abelin, Johann Philipp|volume=1|pages=41-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
He worked mainly as a translator for the publishing house of [[Lucas Jennisius]], [[Matthäus Merian]] and [[Friedrich Hulsius]] in [[Frankfurt]]. Some of his works, such as a history of [[India]], proved later to be translations of other works. His own works consisted mainly of compilations of historical records.

===Own works===
Abelin produced compilations of contemporary records and letters about the events of the wars of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] without further historical commentary:
*''Arma Suecica'', 1631–1634, in 12 parts
*''Inventarium Sueciae'', 1632&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
In the same style, his best known work was ''[[Theatrum Europaeum]]'', a series of chronicles of the chief events in the history of the world down to 1619, reedited, updated and republished several times, including a translation into [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Its coincidence with the needs and tastes of the time, made it a very popular work.  Abelin was responsible for the first two volumes. It was continued by various writers and grew to 21 volumes (1633–1738). However, the main interest of the volumes are the beautiful [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] engraved illustrations of Matthäus Merian (1593–1650).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''Lewis Charles Levin''' (November 10, 1808 – March 14, 1860) was an American politician, [[Know Nothing]], and [[anti-Catholic]] social activist of the 1840s and 1850s. He served three terms in the United States Congress (U.S. House of Representatives, 1845–51), representing Pennsylvania's 1st District.

==Biography==

Lewis Charles Levin was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and graduated from South Carolina College (later the [[University of South Carolina]]) in 1828. He then briefly taught school in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], but had to quit town after being wounded in a duel.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of Philadelphia'', Henry Samuel Morais, 1894. It is elsewhere reported that Levin's second in the duel was Jefferson Davis {{cite web |url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/woodville.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005093847/http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/woodville.htm |archivedate=2007-10-05 |df= }}, whose family owned plantations near Woodville.&lt;/ref&gt; Levin then practiced law in Maryland and Kentucky.

==Philadelphia riots and election to Congress==
By 1838 Levin was in Philadelphia and giving public lectures on the evils of alcohol. He founded and edited a journal called the ''Temperance Advocate''. In 1842 he staged an immense public "bonfire of booze" to draw attention to his campaign against taverns and for local control of liquor licensing.&lt;ref&gt;"The Shuttle and the Cross," by David Montgomery, in the ''Journal of Social History'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Levin's anti-alcohol crusade proved to be excellent preparation for his next cause, a campaign against Catholic political power, which he carried on in two papers, the ''Native American'' and ''The Daily Sun''. Initially the main political issue was an 1843 public school ruling permitting Catholic children to be excused from Bible-reading class (because the Protestant [[King James Version]] was being used). Levin became the leader and chief spokesman for a start-up political movement calling itself the [[American Republican Party]] (later the Native American Party).  On May 3, 1844 Levin attempted to give a speech in the center of the Irish-Catholic neighborhood of [[Kensington, Philadelphia|Kensington]].  The locals ended up chasing all of the protesters out of the neighborhood.  The following Monday, May 6, Levin returned with 3,000 protesters.  The ensuing fighting led to dozens of people killed, hundreds injured, and hundreds more left homeless as most of the neighborhood homes were burned by rioters.  In addition the Catholic Churches [[St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church, Philadelphia|St. Michael]] and [[St. Augustine Church, Philadelphia|St. Augustine]] were demolished completely by fire.&lt;ref&gt;http://unlearnedhistory.blogspot.com/2015/09/philadelphia-bible-riots-of-1844.html&lt;/ref&gt;

New riots broke out in [[Southwark, Philadelphia|Southwark]] in July of that same year when a group of protesters threatened to destroy [http://www.phillychurchproject.com/st-philip-neri/ St. Philip Neri Catholic Church] in the [[Southwark, Philadelphia|Southwark]] District.  This time Levin used his influence to prevent the mob from burning the Church.  Following the July riots, Levin and his colleague Samuel R. Kramer (publisher of the ''Native American'') were arrested for "exciting to riot and treason" in inciting locals to invade and burn several Catholic churches and a convent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/glc/archive/953.htm The Pennsylvania Freeman, 1844] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509071240/http://www.yale.edu/glc/archive/953.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the case never went to trial.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/17/news/obituary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the 1844 Philadelphia riots, Levin ran for Congress and was elected on his party's platform: (1) to extend the period of naturalization to twenty-one years;
(2) to elect only native born to all offices; (3) to reject foreign interference in all institutions, social, religious, and political.

Levin was returned to Congress in 1846 and 1848.  He served as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Engraving]] during the Thirtieth Congress, 1847–48.

==Personal==
Levin married Ann Christian Hays (b. 1812) of Virginia and Tennessee in January 1833. Ann was related by marriage to future Tennessee governor and US President [[James K. Polk]] (her uncle John Hays was married  to Polk's younger sister Ophelia). Ann died a year later, in January 1834. Levin thereupon married a young widow named Julia Ann Gist, née Hammond (1814–1881) in Baltimore. Levin claimed to have met Julia while they were both shopping for tombstones for their late spouses.&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;John A. Forman. [http://americanjewisharchives.org/journal/PDF/1960_12_02_00_forman.pdf "Lewis Charles Levin, Portrait of an American Demagogue"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trees&gt;Ancestry.com, [http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/3368581/family?fpid=6022702707 Levin family trees].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis and Julia Levin had one child, a daughter called Louise or Louisa (1840–1919). (It is occasionally reported erroneously that there was a son named Louis.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/this-day-in-jewish-history/.premium-1.579797 Ha'aretz Online], March 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Jacob Rader, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0K7DReQW67sC&amp;dq ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985'', Volume 1], p. 283, Wayne State Univ. Press 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa married a Brazilian diplomat named Carlos de Barros in Washington City in 1862, and later lived in South America, Philadelphia, and New York City. One of their sons and two grandsons were institutionalized in the 20th century for insanity.&lt;ref name=trees/&gt;

Levin's precise connection to his purported family in Charleston and [[Columbia, South Carolina]] is unclear. It has been claimed that the family records in Charleston were destroyed during an [[1886 Charleston earthquake|earthquake and fire in 1886]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography'' Online [http://www.mocavo.com/Dictionary-of-American-Biography-Volume-11/815187/215 link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forman/&gt; According to published family trees, Levin had a father, a brother, and two nephews also named Lewis C. Levin. However, these trees, and the published records of Jewish families listing the Levins, do not include the Lewis C. Levin who is the subject of this article—or, indeed, any member of the family born in or around 1808. One might speculate that Levin was a "natural" or illegitimate child and/or adoptee. According to some sources he was called Charles Lewis Levin when he taught school in Woodville, Mississippi in the late 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Turitz and Turitz, ''Jews in Early Mississippi.'' 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is the case, it would appear he transposed his forenames after his presumptive elder brother, Lewis C. Levin, Jr., died in 1829. (Lewis C. Levin, Sr. had died in 1817.)&lt;ref name=trees/&gt;

==Scandal, insanity, and death==
After leaving Congress in 1851, Levin continued to campaign for the Native American or [[Know-Nothing]] movement, as it became known. He attempted to campaign for U.S. Senator, which prior to the [[17th Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]] was a seat elected by the state legislature rather than by popular vote. Levin was accused of bribing members of the [[Pennsylvania Assembly]] and was [[subpoena]]ed by a state investigation in February 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Reports of the Joint Committee of the Legislature of Pennsylvania in relation to alleged improper influences in the election of United States senator [https://archive.org/details/reportsofjointco00penn]&lt;/ref&gt; The findings were inconclusive, but Levin never again held office.

Levin and other Nativists helped tilt the 1852 Presidential election toward [[democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin Pierce]] and away from the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]]' candidate, the popular [[Mexican–American War]] leader General [[Winfield Scott]]. There were Catholics in Scott's family, and he was accused of papist connections.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holt, "The Politics of Impatience: The Origins of Know Nothingism [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2936778]." 1973, Journal of American History.&lt;/ref&gt; Levin was an organizing speaker of the first [[1856 American National Convention|Know-Nothing Party convention]] in March 1855.&lt;ref&gt;[[Humphrey J. Desmond]], The Know-Nothing Party: A Sketch [https://archive.org/stream/knownothingparty00desmrich/knownothingparty00desmrich_djvu.txt]. 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Though in notably failing health, he was a featured speaker at the American Order's rally that autumn in a New York City park.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, October 18, 1855 [http://www.americanbystander.com/levin_americanratifmtginPark_1855.pdf]. The unnamed park is probably City Hall park.&lt;/ref&gt;

Levin was enraged and disgusted by the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s nomination of [[John C. Frémont]] for President at the convention in Philadelphia in June 1856. He wrote a lengthy diatribe against Frémont,&lt;ref&gt;The Union Safe!: The Contest Between Fillmore and Buchanan!: Frémont Crushed!, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; which he delivered at a rally in Philadelphia's National Hall (now [[Independence Hall]]) shortly after [[Millard Fillmore]] had been nominated by both the Know Nothings and the Whigs. However, Frémont partisans pulled him off the stand.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morrison Rice, "The Know-Nothing Party in Virginia, 1854–1856," Virginia Historical Society magazine, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to newspaper reports, Levin suffered a complete mental collapse and became so "deranged" that he was placed in the [[Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital|Philadelphia Hospital for the Insane]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "Hon. Lewis C. Levin in the Insane Asylum," Sept. 27, 1856.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E6DF1039E134BC4F51DFBF66838D649FDE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers report him being committed on a later occasion in June 1859, after a visit to a brother in Columbia, South Carolina. Levin is said to have become "dangerous and unmanageable" on the train to Richmond, whereupon friends and railway workers subdued him and detained him in the mail car.&lt;ref&gt;New York Evening Post, and other papers, c. June 29, 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of his madness is unclear, but one newspaper, expanding on a wire-service story, speculated, "His insanity is supposed to have been brought about by an immoderate use of [[opium]]."&lt;ref&gt;Utica Daily Observer, June 29, 1859&lt;/ref&gt; He was returned to the Philadelphia Hospital for the Insane  and died there of "Insanity" in March 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbystander.com/levindeath.jpg Federal Census Mortality Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; Levin was buried in [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]], in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
Lewis Levin's role in a [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] party is sometimes deemed a paradox, despite the fact he was native-born himself (albeit first-generation). His opposition was not to immigration as such but rather to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]; he eagerly sought support from non-Catholic immigrants.[https://web.archive.org/web/20021120071425/http://www.irish-society.org/Hedgemaster%20Archives/philadelphia.htm] It is a mark of his skill that he was able to equate "nativism" with [[anti-Catholicism]], and to do so in Philadelphia, where sectarian animosity had historically been minimal, and where native-born Catholics had lived side-by-side with Anglicans, Quakers, and others since the Colonial period.

For that matter Levin himself did not seem to have any personal sectarian animus, which suggests that his anti-Catholic activism was merely rhetorical and opportunistic. The explorer and soldier [[John Gregory Bourke]] (1846–1896), whose devoutly Catholic family were friends and neighbors of Levin's in 1840s and 1850s Philadelphia, recalled Levin fondly and wrote that the Bourke and Levin families were close for many years.&lt;ref&gt;"Bourke on the Southwest," New Mexico Historical Review, January 1933, p. 25. Online: [https://archive.org/stream/newmexicohistori08univrich#page/24/mode/2up archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Charles Nordhoff (journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]] worked for Lewis Levin when he was a boy, around 1845, and recalled Levin as a kind, generous employer. A "printer's devil" for Levin's Daily Sun newspaper, Nordhoff really wanted to be a cabin boy on a US Navy ship going to China. Levin first warned the lad that he'd end up as a "dirty, drunken old sailor," but relented at last, and intervened with [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] commander, Commodore [[Jesse Elliot]] to get the boy a billet. Nordhoff's maritime and writing career was thereby launched.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Nordhoff, ''Man-of-War Life: A Boy's Experience in the U.S. Navy, During a Voyage Around the World, in a Ship of the Line''. 1856. Nordhoff told this story in other speeches and books throughout his life.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A brilliant adventurer named Lewis C. Levin, a native of Charleston, S.C., and a peripatetic law practitioner, first in South Carolina, next in Maryland, next in Louisiana, next in Kentucky and finally in Pennsylvania, was the acknowledged leader of the Native American element that had erupted during the summer of 1844 in what is remembered as the disgraceful riots of that year in which Catholic churches and institutions were burnt by the mob ... 

He was one of the most brilliant and unscrupulous orators I have ever heard. He presented a fine appearance, graceful in every action charming in rhetoric and utterly reckless in assertion. I have heard him both as a temperance and political orator, and I doubt whether during his day any person in either party of the State surpassed him on the hustings. He was elected by a good majority and was re-elected in 1846 and '48, thus serving six consecutive years as a representative from the city.|''Old Time Notes of Pennsylvania'', 1905, pp. 84–85.}}

'''Herr Fiend''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] from the various [[Gobots]] series. He is an evil Renegade scientist, and is also known as Doctor Go.&lt;ref name="Bellomo 2010 90–93"/&gt;

===Animated series===
In the animated Gobots series Herr Fiend is given the name "Doctor Go."

Doctor Go appears in "Battle for Gobotron" episode #1. Due to animation errors the Renegade Doctor Go appears identical to Zeemon in the pilot series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Battle for Gobotron Part 1|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= |season= 1|number= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Doppleganger" episode #23 Cy-Kill has Doctor Go program robot duplicates of the Guardians using recordings he made of the real Guardians. When demonstrating the [[Space Bender]] weapon to Unicom, Leader-1 learns that the Renegades are attacking Washington. The Renegades ambush Leader-1 and replace him with his duplicate. Leading the [[Command Center (Gobots)|Command Center]] back to Gobotron and getting rid of Scooter and Small Foot the Renegades then release duplicates of [[Path Finder (Gobots)|Path Finder]], [[Rest-Q]], [[Van Guard]] and Turbo. Small Foot and Scooter are able to capture the Turbo duplicate and learn where their friends are being held. Cy-Kill then replaces [[Good Night (Gobots)|Good Night]]. Using the duplicate Turbo the Guardians infiltrate the Renegade base, free the captured Guardians and escape from [[Spoons (Gobots)|Spoons]] and [[Fitor]]. Although blocked by the Renegades, Scooter uses a hologram of [[Zod (Gobots)|Zod]] to make the Renegades flee. Making it back to Gobotron the Guardians are attacked by the Guardian duplicates. The real Guardians are able to defeat their duplicates with the aid of the real [[Zeemon]], [[Hans-Cuff]] and Rest-Q. Cy-Kill then arrives in [[Thrustor]] with more duplicates, but Small Foot is able to stop with robots using the Space Bender device, which fuses their robot brains.&lt;ref name="Doppleganger"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Doppleganger|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= |season= 1|number= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Go appears in the feature film ''[[GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords]]'' where he uses the brain stormer on the female Rock Lord Solitaire.

'''Small Foot''' is a [[fictional character]] from the various [[Gobots]] series and later became part of the [[Transformers universes]]. Her name is a parody of the famous monster truck [[Bigfoot (truck)|Bigfoot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Totally Tubular '80s | last=Bellomo | first=Mark | year=2010 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=978-1-4402-1282-6 | pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small Foot is a female Gobot.&lt;ref name="toplessrobot1"/&gt; Small Foot is one of Leader-1's most trusted [[Armed forces|soldiers]]. A tracker, what she lacks in size she more than makes up for in heart and determination.  Small Foot can often be seen kicking around with [[Scooter (Gobots)|Scooter]] but she idolizes [[Leader-1]] and is often found fighting by his side.  Trouble often finds her wherever she is.  Sometimes with all of her determination Small Foot becomes impulsive and eager to please the older and more experienced Guardian soldiers.

In robot mode she can fire energy shots from the two lamps on her chest. She converts into a pickup truck. She has a tow-cable with hook that she uses in both modes.

Small Foot was featured in one of the early Gobots commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnrEvJaFA1Q|title=Gobots - Series 2 Regular Gobots Commercial|date=13 November 2007|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autobot Small Foot is based on the Gobots characters of the same name.

===Animated series===
Small Foot makes her debut in the episode "Trident's Triple Threat". Small Foot's impulsiveness runs away with her in this episode when she tries to take on three Renegades at once. [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]], and [[Cop-Tur]] beat her up so severely that Turbo has to carry her back to their base in his arms.

Small Foot's impulsiveness almost cost her life when the Guardians accidentally released the [[Master Renegade]] thinking that he was the [[Last Engineer]]. The Master Renegade took Small Foot hostage and kept the other Guardians at bay while he tried to fly away in their command center with Crasher. With Turbo's help Small Foot escaped from the Master Renegade but she paid a terrible price. [[Rest-Q]] checked out all of Small Foot's internal structures and was shocked when he discovered that Small Foot's transforming protocol was completely gone after the initial carnage that was inflicted upon her by the Master Renegade.  It was as if Small Foot never went through the modifier, a machine that gives Gobots the ability to transform into vehicles after they leave the Guardian Academy, leading Matt Hunter to ask if Small Foot can be put through the modifier again. Rest-Q warns that such a thing has never been done before but there are no other options.  '''[[Baron Von Joy]]''' and Rest-Q look on as Small Foot's transformation mechanism is repaired.  When the job is done, Baron Von Joy asks Small Foot if she can transform.  When she does she takes Matt, Nick, and A.J. back the Guardian HQ so that she may get to her battle station.  However, the lone Gobot who was later joined by Scooter and Turbo never made it back to base.  Instead the Renegades blasted a hole in the ground in front of them and Small Foot and Turbo crashed through a wall and stopped short of another wall while poor [[Challenge of the Gobots|Scooter]] couldn't stop and slammed into a glass partition.  It is within the glass partition that the Guardian trio and their human companions found the man that they believed is The Last Engineer and brought him back to Guardian H.Q.

Small Foot is among the Go-Bots who defend their world against the bug-like invaders in "Invasion from the 21st Level" episode #21-22.

[[Cy-Kill]], [[Cop-Tur]], [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]] and [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]] attacked [[Leader-1]], [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]], [[Scooter (Gobots)|Scooter]] and Small Foot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5817">'''Tenderness''' is a quality of [[meat]] gauging how easily it is chewed or cut. Tenderness is a desirable quality, as tender meat is softer, easier to chew, and generally more [[palatable]] than harder meat. Consequently, tender cuts of meat typically command higher prices. The tenderness depends on a number of factors including the meat grain, the amount of connective tissue, and the amount of fat.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/meat-processing/Myoglobin-content#ref501728 |title=Meat processing : Meat Qualities |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenderness can be increased by a number of processing techniques, generally referred to as ''[[#Tenderizing|tenderizing]]'' or ''tenderization''.

==Influencing factors==
Tenderness is perhaps the most important of all factors impacting meat eating quality, with others being flavor, juiciness, and succulence.&lt;ref name="Troy2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Troy | first=D.J. | last2=Kerry | first2=J.P. | title=Consumer perception and the role of science in the meat industry | journal=Meat Science | publisher=Elsevier | volume=86 | issue=1 | year=2010 | pages=214–226 | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.05.009 | doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.05.009 | accessdate=17 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenderness is a quality complex to obtain and gauge, and it depends on a number of factors. On the basic level, these factors are meat grain, the amount and composition of connective tissue, and the amount of fat.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; In order to obtain a tender meat, there is a complex interplay between the animal's pasture, age, species, breed, protein intake, calcium status, stress before and at killing, and how the meat is treated after slaughter.&lt;ref name=hub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhub.com/buy_food_meat_tenderness.htm |title=The Meat Tenderness Debate |publisher=Natural Hub |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat with the fat content deposited within the steak to create a ''[[marbled meat|marbled]]'' appearance has always been regarded as more tender than steaks where the fat is in a separate layer.&lt;ref name=hub/&gt; Cooking causes melting of the fat, spreading it throughout the meat and increasing the tenderness of the final product.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Testing==

The [[meat industry]] strives to produce meat with standardized and guaranteed tenderness, since these characteristics are sought for by the consumers.&lt;ref name=Luciano&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uco.es/organiza/servicios/publica/az/php/img/web/25_13_47_889BiochemicalLuciano.pdf |title=BIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS OF MEAT TENDERNESS: A BRIEF REVIEW |last1=Luciano |first1=F. B. |last2=Anton |first2=A.A |last3=Rosa |first3 = C.F. |journal=Arch. Zootec. |issue=56 (R): 1-8. |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that purpose a number of objective tests of tenderness have been developed, gauging meat resistance to [[shear force]], most commonly used being ''Slice Shear Force'' test&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slice Shear Force |url=http://www.beefresearch.org/CMDocs/BeefResearch/Slice%20Shear%20Force.pdf|first1=S. D. |last1=Shackelford |first2=T. L. |last2=Wheeler, Ph.D. |publisher=National Cattlemen’s Beef Association USDA-ARS |location=Centennial, Colorado |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Warner–Bratzler Shear Force'' test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/30400510/protocols/Warner-BratzlerShearForceProtocol.pdf |title=Warner-Bratzler Shear Force Protocol |first1=Tommy L. |last1=Wheeler |first2=Steven D. |last2=Shackelford |first3=Mohammad |last3=Koohmaraie USDA-ARS |publisher=U.S. Meat Animal Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenderizing==
Techniques for breaking down [[collagen]]s in meat to make it more palatable and tender are referred to as ''tenderizing'' or ''tenderization''.

There are a number of ways to tenderize meat:
*Mechanical tenderization, such as [[meat tenderizer|pounding]],&lt;ref name="oFaC"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGee|first=Harold|title=[[On Food and Cooking|ON FOOD AND COOKING, The science and lore of the kitchen]]|year=2004|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; or piercing.&lt;ref name="oFaC" /&gt;
*The tenderization that occurs through cooking, such as [[braising]].&lt;ref name="LAR"&gt;{{cite book|title=LAROUSSE Gastronomique|year=2000|publisher=Hamlyn|isbn=0-600-60235-4|pages=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tenderizers in the form of naturally occurring [[enzyme]]s, which can be added to food before cooking.&lt;ref name="oFaC"/&gt;
**Examples of enzymes used for tenderizing: [[papain]] from [[papaya]],&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt; [[bromelain]] from [[pineapple]] and [[actinidin]] from [[kiwifruit]].
*[[Marination|Marinating]] the meat with [[vinegar]], [[wine]], [[lemon juice]], [[buttermilk]] or [[yogurt]].&lt;ref name="oFaC"/&gt;
*[[Brining]] the meat in a salt solution ([[brine]]).&lt;ref name="oFaC"/&gt;
*[[Beef aging|Dry aging]] of meat at {{convert|0|to|2|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt;
*[[Velveting]]
*[[Sodium bicarbonate]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6707-tenderizing-meat-with-a-baking-soda-solution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Efforts have been made since at least 1970 to use explosives to tenderize meat and a company was founded to try to commercialize the process; as of 2011 it was not yet scalable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abrahams|first1=Marc|title=Best way to tenderise meat?

The '''''Mencius''''' ({{zh|c=孟子}}; [[Old Chinese]]: ''*mˤraŋ-s tsəʔ''; {{zh|p=Mèngzǐ}}) is a collection of anecdotes and conversations of the [[Confucian]] thinker and philosopher [[Mencius]] on topics in moral and political philosophy, often between Mencius and the rulers of the various [[Warring States period|Warring States]].  Mencius was a disciple of one of the students of [[Zisi]], a grandson of [[Confucius]], and the ''Mencius'' records his travels and audiences with the various rulers of the [[Warring States period]], his students, and his other contemporaries.{{sfnp|Lau|1993|p=331}}{{sfnp|Shih|Knechtges|2010|p=668}} A number of linguistic and textual clues suggest that the text was not written by Mencius himself but by his disciples,{{sfnp|Lau|1993|p=331}} probably during the late 4th century BC.{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=69}}

The ''Mencius'' comprises seven chapters, each divided into two halves, with alternating short sayings and extensive dialogues on specific philosophical arguments.{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=70}} Its fundamental positions, such as Mencius' famous argument in chapter 6A that human nature is inherently good, are usually presented as conversations between Mencius and contemporaneous thinkers, while arguments on specific issues usually appear in records of his advice and counsel to various rulers.{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=70}} His argument that inborn potential tends towards virtue contrasts with the position of contemporary figure [[Yang Zhu]] who argued that that human nature is motivated by self interest. {{sfnp|denecke|2017|p=210}}

The ''Mencius'' was one of the most important texts of early [[Confucianism]], and represents a notable advance over the [[Analects|''Analects of Confucius'' (''Lunyu'' 論語)]] in terms of sophistication of argument.{{sfnp|Shih|Knechtges|2010|p=668}}  Notwithstanding its early importance to Confucianism, the ''Mencius'' was not canonized as one of the [[Chinese Classics]] until over 1,000 years later in Song dynasty [[Neo-Confucianism]].{{sfnp|Shih|Knechtges|2010|p=668}} {{sfnp|fuller|2004|p=175}}

A '''mercy shot''' is a final shot delivered in an [[execution]]. It follows after at least one original shot intended to mortally wound or kill the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Ordinary Men, Christopher R. Browning&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered "merciful" in the sense that it ends the physical suffering of the person being executed. The use of the mercy shot is not universal; due to limited compassion for the victims or due to limited available [[ammunition]], some execution victims are left to die of their wounds or are simply buried alive, without a mercy shot.

'''Mikkel Aaland''' (born 1952) is a Norwegian-American photographer, based in San Francisco and Norway, and is known for work in the early days of [[digital photography]], as well as his twelve books on photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjp-online.com/2016/03/world-famous-photographers-meet-above-the-arctic-circle-at-nordic-lights-festival/|title=World Famous Photographers meet near the Arctic Circle at Nordic Light International Festival of Photography – British Journal of Photography|website=www.bjp-online.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his 1978 book ''Sweat'', an illustrated history of sweat bathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-sauna-20140503-story.html|title=Hot tips from a summit of sauna experts - Los Angeles Times|last=Garfinkel|first=Perry|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His documentary photographs have been exhibited in major institutions around the world, including the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]] and the former [[Musée Lenine|Lenin Museum]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/399|title=Mikkel Aaland|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaland is the author of works of memoir, books featuring his own photojournalism as well as works on digital imaging and various [[Adobe Photoshop]] products.

==Biography==

=== Early years ===

Aaland was born in [[San Francisco]] and grew up in nearby [[Livermore, California]]. His [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] born father worked as a scientist at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] research facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberbohemia.com/Pages/aboutmikkel.htm Cyberbohemia]&lt;/ref&gt; Aaland was an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] who attended [[Livermore High School]], where he played [[American football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Family-murder-leads-to-book-for-9173113.php|title=Mikkel Aaland’s brother killed their father — so he wrote a book|date=2016-08-21|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[California State University]] in [[Chico, California|Chico]] with a major in [[photojournalism]] and was an [[All-America#Swimming and diving|All-American swimmer]] on the NCAA Division II championship team.

===Beginning career===
In 1978 Aaland published his first book, ''Sweat: The Illustrated History and Description of the Finnish Sauna, Russian Bania, Islamic Hammam, Japanese Mushi-buro, Mexican Temescal, and American Indian &amp; Eskimo Sweat Lodge''. The book was the culmination of a three-year travel and photo-journalistic tour of the world's various bathing customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Family-murder-leads-to-book-for-9173113.php|title=Mikkel Aaland’s brother killed their father — so he wrote a book|date=2016-08-21|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaland continues to be an active proponent and historian of sweat bathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.saunatimes.com/sauna-talk/sauna-talk-mikkel-aaland-author-of-the-iconic-book-sweat-and-the-mascot-for-sauna-enthusiasts-everywhere/|title=Sauna Talk: Mikkel Aaland, author of the iconic book "Sweat" and the mascot for sauna enthusiasts everywhere - Saunatimes|date=2016-07-17|work=Saunatimes|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aaland published his second nonfiction book, ''County Fair: Portraits'' (1981) after spending nine years traveling the United States visiting county [[fair]]s. [[Jon Carroll]] wrote in ''New West'' magazine, "(County Fair) is a chronicle of people being who they are. These faces become historical." The photographer [[Mary Ellen Mark]] said of the book: "Such moving photographs, funny and sad. It's real Americana. Aaland is a latter day [[Mike Disfarmer]]." In 1982 Aaland appeared as a guest on the ''[[David Letterman Show]]'', sharing work from both ''Sweat'' and ''County Fair''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Z6CjoomEBVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview in 1981 Aaland was introduced to the newly emerging field of digital photography by renowned photographer [[Ansel Adams]]. Aaland soon became the West Coast editor of the Swedish ''FOTO'' magazine. He contributed articles and photos for other publications such as ''American Photographer'', ''American Photo'', ''Digital Creativity'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Popular Science]]'', and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. In 1981 he received the National Art Directors award for photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/399|title=Mikkel Aaland - O’Reilly Media|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital photography instruction===
One of the first to write about digital photography, Aaland released the book ''Digital Photography'' (1992). The book gives instruction and tips on using digital cameras to take unique photographs. He followed that with ''Still Images in Multimedia'' (1996) and then ''Shooting Digital: Pro Tips for Taking Great Pictures with Your Digital Camera'' (2003), which was named by Designer's Bookshelf as "Best Digital Photography Book of the Year for 2004."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/399|title=Mikkel Aaland - O’Reilly Media|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaland eventually joined academia, lecturing about photography at [[Stanford University]], [[Drexel University]], and [[UC Berkeley]]. He also spoke at computer graphics conferences around the country.  Aaland has been the co-host of the Nordic Light International Festival of Photograph since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nle.no/blogg/2018/2/1/mikkel-aaland-to-co-host-nordic-light-2018|title=Mikkel Aaland to co-host the Nordic Light festival 2018|work=Nordic Light International Festival of Photography|access-date=2018-11-12|language=no-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mikkelaaland.com/nordic-light-festival.html|title=Nordic Light Festival|website=www.mikkelaaland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eyeem.com/blog/discussing-the-future-of-photography-eyeem-at-nordic-light-festival|title=Discussing the Future of Photography. EyeEm at Nordic Light Festival {{!}} EyeEm|website=EyeEm|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2001, Aaland began publishing a number of guidebooks about using the computer design program [[Photoshop]] to enhance digital photography; ''Photoshop Elements Solutions: The Art of Digital Photography'' was followed by second, third, and fourth volumes. He also acted as an unpaid adviser to the development of both the alpha, beta, and final versions of the Adobe Photoshop Elements application. ''Photoshop CS2 RAW: Using Adobe Camera Raw, Bridge, and Photoshop to Get the Most Out of Your Digital Camera'' (2006) was Aaland's first of two books explaining the graphic file format RAW, which is used by professional photographers.

While working as an adviser on the photo editing software for [[Adobe Systems]] Lightroom's beta tests, Aaland proposed a real-world test of the software by inviting professional photographers to travel to a far-off land where they would use Lightroom. The result of this was ''Photoshop Lightroom Adventure: Mastering Adobe's Next-generation Tool for Digital Photographers'' (2007). Aaland followed up that book the same year with ''Photoshop Lightroom 2 Adventure: Mastering Adobe's Next-generation Tool for Digital Photographers'', which brought professionals to Tasmania to show users how photographers work with the Lightroom 2 software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jeffpflueger.com/content/lightroom-2-adventure-tasmania|title=Lightroom 2 Adventure: Tasmania {{!}} Jeff Pflueger Visual Media|website=www.jeffpflueger.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldhum.com/features/jeff-pflueger/travel-photography-and-writing-with-light-20091104/|title=Travel Photography and ‘Writing With Light’|work=World Hum|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memoir and travel work ===
In a diversion from photography instruction, Aaland published ''The Sword of Heaven: A Five Continent Odyssey to Save the World'' (1999), detailing the six years he spent traveling around the world documenting a peace project initiated by survivors of [[Hiroshima]] and led by a [[Shinto]] priest. During this time, Aaland dropped brick-sized pieces of a holy Shinto Sword of Heaven into bodies of water around the world to form a protective ring of [[kami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Odyssey-of-S-F-Author-Raised-In-Bomb-Shelter-2900160.php|title=Odyssey of S.F. Author Raised In Bomb Shelter / Mikkel Aaland traveled the world to disperse the Holy Shinto sword|date=1999-11-01|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaland’s most recent book, ''The River in My Backyard'', is an illustrated memoir exploring his family history, the murder of his father, and his pilgrimage to [[Mount Kailash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mikkelaaland.com/the-river-in-my-backyard-by-mikkel-aaland.html|title=Mikkel Aaland -Photo Gallery|website=www.mikkelaaland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Triangulation|title=Triangulation 272: Mikkel Aaland|date=2016-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msX7NeE2OYk|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.norwegianamerican.com/arts/book-review-two-rivers-flow-in-a-haunting-memoir/|title=Book review: Two rivers flow in a haunting memoir - The Norwegian American|date=2017-03-23|work=The Norwegian American|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweat bathing ===
Aaland, as the author of ''Sweat: The Illustrated History and Description of the Finnish Sauna, Russian Bania, Islamic Hammam, Japanese Mushi-buro, Mexican Temescal, and American Indian &amp; Eskimo Sweat Lodge,'' is recognized as an authority on sweat bathing. In 2014 Aaland organized the Perfect Sweat Summit in San Francisco, bringing together 50 international experts on sweat bathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidersguidetospas.com/features/the-sauna-connoisseur-mikkel-aaland/|title=The Sauna Connoisseur: Mikkel Aaland - Insiders Guide to Spas|work=Insiders Guide to Spas|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidersguidetospas.com/features/in-search-of-the-perfect-sweat/|title=In Search of the Perfect Sweat - Insiders Guide to Spas|work=Insiders Guide to Spas|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaland is currently filming a travel documentary series, ''Perfect Sweat'', which combines his career-long interests in photography, travel, and sweat bathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perfectsweatseries.com/|title=Home|website=www.perfectsweatseries.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary series is an exploration of bathing traditions around the world, and revisits the topic of his 1978 book ''Sweat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spabusiness.com/detail.cfm?pagetype=featuresonline&amp;featureid=32956&amp;mag=Spa%20Business&amp;linktype=story&amp;source=none&amp;ref=n|title=Spa Business - Mikkel Aaland|website=www.spabusiness.com|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trcgiornale.it/mikkel-aaland-alle-terme-taurine/|title=Mikkel Aaland alle Terme Taurine|work=TRC Giornale|access-date=2018-11-20|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hs.fi/nyt/art-2000005330508.html|title=Nyt.fi: Norjalais-amerikkalainen sauna-asiantuntija iloitsee löylykulttuurin kukoistuksesta Suomessa: ”Nuoret ovat taas löytäneet saunan”|date=2017-08-18|work=Helsingin Sanomat|access-date=2018-11-20|language=fi-FI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4717">'''Parallel constraint satisfaction processes''' ('''PCSP''') is a model that integrates the fastest growing research areas in the study of the mind; [[Connectionism]], [[neural networks]], and [[parallel distributed processing]] models.&lt;ref name="Read, S.J. 1997"&gt;Read, S.J., Vanman, E.J. &amp; Miller L.C. (1997). Connectionism, parallel constraint satisfaction processes, and gestalt principles: (Re)Introducing cognitive dynamics to social psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 1 (1), 26–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamic model of attitude==
This model integrates these three areas to propose a holistic explanation for an individual’s response to [[cognitive dissonance]]. It models an explanation of the dynamic structure of attitudes and the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] change involved in [[cognitive dissonance theory]]. PCSP posits that beliefs impose constraints on other beliefs, and conditions can either constrain or make salient different aspects of one’s beliefs. Attitudes and beliefs are therefore changeable, due to trying to satisfactorily fit with the various constraints of circumstances as well as adapt to the constantly evolving truths in life. It is not an alternative to the theory but rather a model that incorporates the many facets of [[cognitive dissonance theory]].
Cognitive dissonance theory centers mainly on:
*[[Cognition]]
*[[Self]]-concept
*[[Social]] [[Identity (social science)|identity]]

Human beings may give greater importance to one of these areas but no single factor will be the sole influence. The different theories are probably all accurate given the right time, the right place, and the right individual, therefore an integrated more holistic model may better explain the reasons for attitude/behavior inconsistency and the change of attitude following cognitive dissonance.

==Gestalt psychology==
Researchers (Read 1991) have found within [[Gestalt psychology]] an integrated model of explaining attitude change that incorporates neuroscientific and social psychological concepts.&lt;ref name="Read, S.J. 1997"/&gt;
Theories of cognitive dissonance as well as its alternatives are based on the assumption that the attitudes and beliefs one holds are fixed entities. Recently psychologists have progressed from categorizing psychological phenomena as static, to recognizing the dynamic aspects that vary with different contexts. 
The concept of [[neural network]] models uses the Gestalt principle of totality to explain social, emotional and cognitive tendencies.

In a feedback or parallel constraint satisfaction network, activation passes around symmetrically connected nodes until the activation of all the nodes asymptotes or "relaxes" into a state that satisfies the constraints among the nodes. This process allows for the integration of a number of different sources of information in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Read, S.J., Snow, C.J. &amp; Simon, D. (2003). Constraint Satisfaction Processes in Social Reasoning, In R. Alterman &amp; D. Kirsch (Eds.), Proceedings of the 25th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society [CD-ROM]. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social psychology==

Parallel constraint satisfaction processes can be applied to three broad areas in [[social psychology]]:&lt;ref name="Read, S.J. 1997"/&gt;

*Impression formation and causal attribution
*Cognitive consistency
*Goal-directed behavior.

This approach revealed that some phenomena that seem unexpected or counterintuitive are in actuality due to the normal functioning of the cognitive system. For example, Shultz and Lepper (1996) noted that in thinking about cognitive dissonance in terms of parallel constraint satisfaction processes, it becomes clear that cognitive consistency phenomena—such as those studied by dissonance researchers—are not the result of atypical or unusual cognitive processes but rather are the direct result of normal cognitive functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Shultz, T.R. &amp; Lepper, M.R. (1996). Constraint satisfaction modeling of cognitive dissonance phenomena. Psychological Review, 103, 219–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paschal mystery''' is one of the central concepts of [[Faith in Christianity|Catholic faith]] relating to the [[Salvation history|history of salvation]]. Its main subject is the passion, death, and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus Christ]] – the work God the Father sent His Son to accomplish on earth. According to the Compendium of the [[Catechism]] of the Catholic Church, "The Paschal Mystery accomplished once for all by the redemptive death of His Son Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism states that in the liturgy of the Church which revolves around the seven sacraments, "it is principally his own Paschal mystery that Christ signifies and makes present."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c1a2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c1a1.htm#1085&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] churches celebrate this mystery on [[Easter]]. It is recalled and celebrated also during every [[Eucharist]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Bouyer|Bouyer, Louis]], (1951) ''The Paschal Mystery'', pp. 41 and 50&lt;/ref&gt; and especially on a Sunday, which is the Pascha of the week.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Paul II]], "[[Dies Domini]]" 3, (1998),  see the text on-line: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html APOSTOLIC LETTER DIES DOMINI]. Access date:2012-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology of 'Paschal' ==
The word "paschal" is the equivalent of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] "pascha" and is derived from [[Aramaic]] "pasḥā" and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] "pesaḥ", meaning "the passing over" (cf. [[Book of Exodus|Ex]] 12:13.23.27; cf. [[Book of Isaiah|Is]] 31,5). The origin is not known. Some scholars refer to [[Assyria]]n "pasah" – ''appease'' or [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] "pa-sh" – remembrance or "pē-sah" – ''the blow''. The Bible links "pesaḥ" with "pāsaḥ" – two literal meanings are: ''to limp'' and to perform a ritual dance around a sacrifice ([[Books of Kings|1 K]] 18:21.26). Figuratively it may be understood, "to jump", "to pass", "to spare". It refers to the passage of God on the [[Passover]] night, when the Israelites left Egypt. God struck the houses of Egyptians and left the Israelites untouched, i.e. ''passed over''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Émile Bonnard OP, (1988) Passover, in: ''Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

The second word, 'mystery', is regarded in Christian 20th-century theology as one of the most important key-words of Christianity and its theology. It opposes the ideas of [[Gnosticism]], [[Rationalism]] and Semi-Rationalism, pointing out that there are Divine mysteries (properly called) which cannot be grasped by mere human reasoning and can only be [[Revelation|revealed]] by God through [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[First Vatican Council]], Dogmatic Constitution ''[[Dei Filius]]'' (24.04.1870), ch.2 ''De revelatione'', Denzinger-Shönmetzer (DS, 36 ed.) 3005; cf. 3876; Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Constitution ''[[Dei verbum]]'', 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rahner|Rahner K.]], Mystery, in: ''Sacramentum Mundi'', vol. 4, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In this meaning ''mystery'' describes not an idea that must be unlocked or solved like a novel, but the Divine truth and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|life]], to which God through the [[Christian Church|Church]], [[sacrament]]s, word of God and [[Christian faith|faith]], [[Sacraments of Initiation|initiates]] the dedicatees. (cf. [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Eph]] 1,17ff)

== Patristic spiritual and theological aspects ==
The very first known use of the term ''Paschal mystery'' (literally  ''Mystery of the Pascha'') was found in the homily of [[Melito of Sardis]] ''[[Peri Pascha|On the Pascha]]'' written between A.D. 160 and 170:&lt;ref&gt;Cantalamessa R. [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|OFMCap]], (1993) in: ''Easter in the Early Church'', p. 41, endnote d. Cf. [[Letter to the Ephesians|Eph]]3:4; [[Letter to the Colossians|Col]] 4:3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;{{Quotation|Understand, therefore, beloved,
how it is new and old,
eternal and temporary,
perishable and imperishable,
mortal and immortal, this ''mystery of the Pascha'':
old as regards the force
but new as regards the Word;
temporary as regards the model (gr. ''typos''),
eternal because of grace
perishable because of the slaughter of the sheep,
imperishable because of the life of the Lord;
mortal because of the burial in earth,
immortal because of the rising from the dead
|''On the Pascha'', 2-3}}
&lt;/poem&gt;
According to [[Raniero Cantalamessa]] OFMCap, [[Patristics|patristic]] interpretation of the paschal mystery in its major facets and constituent dimensions may be summarised in four points:
# '''History.''' Historical events form the foundation for the Paschal mystery and are commemorated in the paschal liturgy of Easter
# '''Sacraments and mistagogy.''' Historical events of the death and resurrection of Christ are realised in the believer as passage from death to life. Primarily, it is achieved in baptism and the Eucharist, but the paschal solemnity of [[Easter]] taken as a whole is itself a [[Sacraments of Initiation|sacrament]], the ''paschale sacramentum''.
# '''Moral and spiritual life.''' ''Pascha'' (or Easter) is a ''[[transitus]]'' – detachment from evil, conversion to good, and progress in spiritual life, until the final ''transitus'' to the ''Kingdom of God''.
# '''Eschatology.''' In the early years of the Church Paschal mystery was celebrated with a vivid expectation of the coming of Christ. Gradually Christian communities have come to focus on the presence of Christ in the Church as liturgical  anticipation of the ''[[parousia]]''. Paschal eschatology has also individual dimension as eagerness for the heavenly Pascha. Paschal mystery becomes a pledge of eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;Cantalamessa R. [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|OFMCap]], (1993) Introduction, in: ''Easter in the Early Church'', p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catholic teaching ==

To underscore the importance of the Paschal mystery, the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, states that "The Paschal Mystery of Jesus, which comprises his passion, death, resurrection, and glorification, stands at the center of the Christian faith because God's saving plan was accomplished once for all by the redemptive death of his Son Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Second Vatican Council ===

According to Pope Benedict XVI, the most important and essential message of the council is "the Paschal Mystery as the center of what it is to be Christian and therefore of the Christian life, the Christian year, the Christian seasons".&lt;ref name="w2.vatican.va"&gt;http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2013/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20130214_clero-roma.html&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Mysterium paschale'' was used repeatedly during [[Second Vatican Council]] (1963–65) as a meaningful designation of the Christian redemption proclaimed and now accomplished in the [[liturgy]]. Council Fathers endorsed the fruit of the work of scholars of the [[Liturgical Movement]], specifically [[Odo Casel|Dom Odo Casel]] and the whole [[Maria Laach Abbey|Maria Laach]] school. The term ''mystery of salvation'' made its way to the Council documents not without some opposition or misunderstanding. Some fathers expressed doubts saying that it was a vague and chimeric idea, its orthodoxy was dubious, and that it was ignored by sound [[theology]]. Eventually the Council decided to confirm the importance of the term. It is reflected especially in the Constitution on the liturgy ''[[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Bouyer|Bouyer L.]] (1965), ''The Liturgy Revived. A Doctrinal Commentary of the Conciliar Constitution on the Liturgy'', pp.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Füglister, Notker, (1969) Passover, in: ''Sacramentum Mundi'', vol. 4, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; In the very beginning of 1st chapter, where the Council document speaks about ''restoration and promotion'' of the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], ''paschal mystery'' is shown as the way [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] has redeemed mankind:

{{Quotation|The wonderful works of God among the people of the Old Testament were but a prelude to the work of Christ the Lord in redeeming mankind and giving perfect glory to God. He achieved His task principally by the paschal mystery of His blessed passion, resurrection from the dead, and the glorious ascension, whereby "dying, he destroyed our death and, rising, he restored our life".&lt;ref&gt;''Easter [[Preface (liturgy)|Preface]]'' of the [[Roman Missal]]&lt;/ref&gt; For it was from the side of Christ as He slept the sleep of death upon the cross that there came forth "the wondrous sacrament of the whole Church"&lt;ref&gt;See the old ''Roman Missal'', used before the restoration of Holy Week by the [[pope Pius XII]], ''Prayer before the second lesson for Holy Saturday.''&lt;/ref&gt; | Constitution ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'' 5; cf. n. 10, 47, 61}}

=== Post-Conciliar magisterial documents ===
After Second Vatican Council the term ''Paschal mystery'' has been used by Catholic Church [[Magisterium]] as one of basic concepts of [[Christian faith]] and life.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "The Paschal mystery of Christ's cross and Resurrection stands at the center of the Good News that the apostles, and the Church following them, are to proclaim to the world. God's saving plan was accomplished 'once for all' by the redemptive death of his Son Jesus Christ." (CCC 571) 

In explaining the sacramental system of the church or the sacramental economy, the Catechism dedicates one chapter on the Paschal Mystery in the Age of the Church. It teaches that "In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own Paschal mystery that Christ signifies and makes present. During his earthly life Jesus announced his Paschal mystery by his teaching and anticipated it by his actions. When his Hour comes, he lives out the unique event of history which does not pass away: Jesus dies, is buried, rises from the dead, and is seated at the right hand of the Father 'once for all.'

"His Paschal mystery is a real event that occurred in our history, but it is unique: all other historical events happen once, and then they pass away, swallowed up in the past. The Paschal mystery of Christ, by contrast, cannot remain only in the past, because by his death he destroyed death, and all that Christ is - all that he did and suffered for all men - participates in the divine eternity, and so transcends all times while being made present in them all. The event of the Cross and Resurrection abides and draws everything toward life." (CCC 1085) 

It also explains that "The Paschal mystery has two aspects: by his death, Christ liberates us from sin; by his Resurrection, he opens for us the way to a new life. This new life is above all justification that reinstates us in God's grace, 'so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.'Justification consists in both victory over the death caused by sin and a new participation in grace. It brings about filial adoption so that men become Christ's brethren." (CCC 654) 

In 1992 letter ''Communionis notio'' of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] to the [[bishop]]s about the Church understood as communion, ''paschal mystery'' is explained as the means by which God's initiative was carried out to bring to disciples of Christ and, indeed, to the whole of mankind the gift of [[Koinonia|communion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_28051992_communionis-notio_en.html ''Communionis notio'' 3]. Access date 2012-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Paul II]] in his letter on keeping the Lord's day holy wrote that to celebrate Sunday is to make present the graces of the Paschal Mystery, which is the climax of the [[salvation history]]:

{{Quotation|The Paschal Mystery of Christ is the full revelation of the mystery of the world's origin, the climax of the history of salvation and the anticipation of the eschatological fulfilment of the world. What God accomplished in Creation and wrought for his People in the Exodus has found its fullest expression in Christ's Death and Resurrection, though its definitive fulfilment will not come until the [[Parousia]], when Christ returns in glory. In him, the "spiritual" meaning of the Sabbath is fully realized, as [[Pope Gregory I|Saint Gregory the Great]] declares: "For us, the true Sabbath is the person of our Redeemer, our Lord Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Epist. 13, 1: [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 140A, 992&lt;/ref&gt;
|''[[Dies Domini]]'', 18}}

The document called ''Instrumentum Laboris'', issued before the Synod on the Eucharist (2005), spoke about perception of the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharistic mystery]] among the faithful. In many developed countries Christians fail to see the Eucharist as a celebration of the paschal mystery. They tend to perceive it as simply the fulfilment of a Sunday obligation and a meal of fellowship. The paschal mystery, ''celebrated in an unbloody manner on the altar'', is much more a source of spiritual strength to those Christians who live in the situation of suffering, wars, and natural disasters etc.&lt;ref&gt;Synod of Bishops, XI Ordinary General Assembly, ''[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/synod/documents/rc_synod_doc_20050707_instrlabor-xi-assembly_en.html The Eucharist: source and summit of the life and mission of the church – "Instrumentum Laboris"]'' 33. Access date: 2012-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2005 Synod, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] and bishops emphasised the need for ''the faithful to enter more deeply into the mystery being celebrated''. They called for a process of mystagogy, i.e. initiation into the mystery of Salvation. According to the Pope's exhortation published after the Synod, initiation into the mystery of the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] should respect three elements:
* Interpretation of ''the events of Jesus' life, and the Paschal Mystery in particular, in relation to the entire history of the Old Testament''.
* Introduction into the meaning of the signs and gestures of the rites. In a highly technological age people no longer understand them.
* Safeguarding the impact celebration of the rites should have on Christian life ''in all its dimensions – work and responsibility, thoughts and emotions, activity and repose''.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20070222_sacramentum-caritatis_en.html Post-synodal apostolic exhortation "Sacramentum Caritatis" 64]''. Access date: 2012-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope called for new communities and movements to assist in the practical realisation of that programme in [[parish]]es:
{{Quotation|Each Christian community is called to be a place where people can be taught about the mysteries celebrated in faith. In this regard, the Synod Fathers called for greater involvement by [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|communities of consecrated life]], movements and groups which, by their specific charisms, can give new impetus to Christian formation. In our time, too, the Holy Spirit freely bestows his gifts to sustain the apostolic mission of the Church, which is charged with spreading the faith and bringing it to maturity.|Exhortation ''Sacramentum Caritatis'', 64}}

Among the new communities of consecrated life which contribute to the Christian formation there are e.g. [[Community of St. John]], [[Community of the Lamb]], [[Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem]] and others. The Pope spoke also about new movements and groups working in the field of Christian formation. Among internationally active there are e.g. [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic Renewal]], [[Communion and Liberation]], [[Community of the Beatitudes]], [[Community of the Chemin Neuf]], [[Community of Sant'Egidio]], [[Emmanuel Community]],  [[Focolare Movement]], [[Neocatechumenal Way]], [[Opus Dei]], etc. These communities, movements and groups have emerged in the 20th century on the grounds of [[Second Vatican Council]]'s renewal of the Church.

[[File:Ffm-dreikoenigskirche-gottesdienst.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Due to historical context of nominalism promoted by [[William Ockham]], Protestant [[Eucharist]] has become more a fraternal meal than a celebration of the paschal mystery. "Abendmahl" during the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|evangelical]] service in the church of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Kings]], [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]].]]

=== Paschal mystery and the traditionalists===
The concept of the paschal mystery is criticised by the traditionalists. According to the address of the Superior of the [[Society of St. Pius X]], Bishop Bernard Fellay (2001), ''the theology of the "paschal mystery" minimizes the mystery of the Redemption, because it considers the sacrament only in its relation with the "mystery", and because the conception that it makes of the "memorial"  alters the sacrificial dimension of the Mass'' and as a consequence it ''renders the post-Conciliar Liturgy dangerously distant from Catholic doctrine''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bishop Bernard Fellay, ''The Problem of the Liturgical Reform – A Theological and Liturgical Study'', Kansas City: Angelus Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI|Card. Joseph Ratzinger]] and Jonathan Robinson [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|CO]] show that the traditionalists put themselves in a false position, overlooking the fact that the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]]'s teaching about this issue restored a profoundly traditional doctrine, central to Christian thought and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Jonathan Robinson|chapter= The Paschal Mystery|title= The Mass and Modernity. Walking to Heaven Backward |url= http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2005/jrobinson_walkheaven_dec05.asp |accessdate= 2013-01-28 |year= 2005|publisher= Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco |isbn= 1-58617-069-4|pages= 239–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book |first1 = Joseph | last1 =Ratzinger |authorlink= Pope Benedict XVI | chapter = The Theology of the Liturgy|title= Looking Again at the Question of the Liturgy with Cardinal Ratzinger  |year= 2003|publisher= Saint Michael's Abbey Press |location= Farnborough |editor1-first= Alcuin|editor1-last= Reid OSB |pages= 18–31}}, cf. [[Louis Bouyer]], The Paschal Mystery, in: ''Dictionary of Theology'', trans. rev. Charles Underhill Quinn, New York: Desclee, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protestant view of the mystery ==
Protestant view of grace and salvation was influenced very much by [[nominalism]] of [[William Ockham]]'s ''razor''. In [[Martin Luther]]'s opinion Ockham was the only [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] whose teaching was worth studying.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Bouyer|Bouyer L.]], The spirit and forms of protestantism, p. 186-188&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of traditional [[Metaphysics]], and especially the [[Problem of universals|universals]], paved the way to modern [[empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Gilson|Gilson, É.]], History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages, p.499&lt;/ref&gt; In this nominalistic Protestant view of relationship between God and creation, the mystery of God becomes utterly unattainable for human reason, even if it is illumined by [[Christian faith|faith]]. While traditional understanding of the mystery of faith is that the Divine [[revelation]] can use human word, somehow assimilating the Word of God, to initiate man into the mystery of the divine life, according to [[Louis Bouyer]], the Protestant view excludes such approach. Revelation of the mystery of salvation to man is compatible with traditional philosophy, like [[Thomism]], and incompatible with the Protestant view of grace, influenced by nominalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''The spirit and forms of protestantism'', p. 195, citation: ''The theologian who has thoroughly grasped the thomist doctrine (which in fact does more than systematise accurately the practice of the Church since the prophets and apostles) will not imagine that he can understand and manipulate any enunciation of the divine Word as he could those of his own mind. Nor will he conclude that the Word of God has to remain an unresolved enigma, a symbol impossible to decipher. Knowing that God made all things as a reflection of his own thoughts, and the human mind as a reflection of his own word, he will strive, his mind illumined by faith, to open himself to the mysteries God reveals, not confining them in the framework of his own ideas, but transposing and enlarging these, not destroying their value in their own order, but transcending the limits of mere reason — a real elevation, not a collapse into the subrational. Thus, the supernatural is received by the mind enlightened and elevated by faith, not as darkening its natural lights, but by the acquiescence of the human mind in its invasion by the Spirit of God; in this unique experience, it recognises both that it is rapt from itself and taken back by Him who had made it for Himself, in His own image.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological reflection ==
Paschal mystery embraces several events of Jesus' passing away from this world. They are central to the Christian [[Creed]].

=== The Crucifixion and Descent of Jesus to the Dead ===
Jesus sacrificed his life by freely accepting death on the cross and being put in a tomb. In experiencing death and overcoming it in resurrection, Christ assures us that we will have life everlasting with God as we too, through Christ's accomplishment as our representative, will triumph over death and pass into eternal life with the resurrection of the glorified body.

=== The Resurrection ===

Three days after he died and was buried, Jesus was raised from the dead with a new and glorified body. All four Gospels of the New Testament clearly give an account of the resurrection. This event is at the heart of faith in Christ (see 1 Corinthians 15:3-5).
....

=== The Ascension and Exaltation ===

Forty days after the resurrection, the risen Christ ascended to the Father in Heaven, God's domain. From there, Christ, who is hidden from our eyes, will come again in glory at the end of time to judge the living and the dead. Through the Ascension and Exaltation of Christ, humanity has been given the unbreakable promise of everlasting life with God. 
 
Through the Paschal Mystery everything has been justified and made right in Christ with God. Jesus came to fulfil and perfect the covenant of God, and to assure all that God's love is eternal and constant.

"As Jesus truly dies and is buried, how we should be filled with wonder! Seamlessly the sadness of Christ’s death gives way to the joy of the Resurrection as Easter dawns upon us" (Compendium, 126).

==Summary==
[[File:PetClubInuDaisukiGameplay.png|225px|left|thumb|Attempting to play with the puppy.]]

The object of the game is to nurture the dog from [[puppy]]hood into adulthood and even into [[old age]]. There are many breeds of pets and there are several different kinds of young female avatars to control. First, the player must give the master a name; this is followed by giving the dog a [[name]]. Names be inserted using either [[hiragana]], [[katakana]] or using the [[ASCII]] letters traditionally given to [[Languages of Europe|most European language]]s; this applies to both naming the dog and the owner.

Dogs must be taken for [[Walking|walk]]s and given plenty of [[physical exercise]]s, [[training]] in addition to lessons that teach them [[discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?http://ameblo.jp/wettissue/entry-10097180153.html| title = Advanced game overview |language=Japanese | publisher = Ameblo| date = | accessdate = 2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If neglected, the dog will hold his head up in the air and refuse to take orders from the player. Competition from the computer player's dog provides a reason for the player to give her dog adequate training and discipline without making the pet overly tired or hungry.

A '''quine''' is a non-empty [[computer program]] which takes no input and produces a copy of its own [[source code]] as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the [[computability theory]] and [[computer science]] literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".

A quine is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of an execution environment, when the execution environment is viewed as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] transforming programs into their outputs. Quines are possible in any [[Turing complete]] programming language, as a direct consequence of [[Kleene's recursion theorem]]. For amusement, programmers sometimes attempt to develop the shortest possible quine in any given [[programming language]].

The name "quine" was coined by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his popular science book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', in honor of philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1908–2000), who made an extensive study of [[indirect self-reference]], and in particular for the following paradox-producing expression, known as [[Quine's paradox]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some languages, particularly [[scripting language]]s, an empty source file is a fixed point of the language, being a valid program that produces no output.{{efn|1=Examples include [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]}} Such an empty program, submitted as "the world's smallest self reproducing program", once won the "worst abuse of the rules" prize in the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www0.us.ioccc.org/1994/smr.hint IOCCC 1994 Worst Abuse of the Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of [[Von Neumann universal constructor|self-reproducing automata]] came from the dawn of computing, if not before. [[John von Neumann]] theorized about them in the 1940s. Later, [[Paul Bratley]] and Jean Millo's article "Computer Recreations: Self-Reproducing Automata" discussed them in 1972.&lt;ref name="Bratley_Millo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bratley
  | first1 = Paul
  | authorlink1 = Paul Bratley
  | last2 = Millo
  | first2 = Jean
  | title = Computer Recreations: Self-Reproducing Automata

  | year = 1972
  | pages = 397–400
 | doi=10.1002/spe.4380020411
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bratley first became interested in self-reproducing programs after seeing the first known such program written in [[Atlas Autocode]] at Edinburgh in the 1960s by the [[University of Edinburgh]] lecturer and researcher [[Hamish Dewar]].

The "download source" requirement of the [[Affero General Public License]] is based on the idea of a quine.

==Examples==
In general, the method used to create a quine in any programming language is to have, within the program, two pieces: (a)&amp;nbsp;[[Source code|code]] used to do the actual printing and (b)&amp;nbsp;[[data]] that represents the textual form of the code.  The code functions by using the data to print the code (which makes sense since the data represents the textual form of the code), but it also uses the data, processed in a simple way, to print the textual representation of the data itself.

The following [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code demonstrates the basic structure of a quine.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java"&gt;public class Quine
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    char q = 34;      // Quotation mark character
    String[] l = {    // Array of source code
    "public class Quine",
    "{",
    "  public static void main(String[] args)",
    "  {",
    "    char q = 34;      // Quotation mark character",
    "    String[] l = {    // Array of source code",
    "    ",
    "    };",
    "    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)           // Print opening code",
    "        System.out.println(l[i]);",
    "    for(int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++)    // Print string array",
    "        System.out.println(l[6] + q + l[i] + q + ',');",
    "    for(int i = 7; i &lt; l.length; i++)    // Print this code",
    "        System.out.println(l[i]);",
    "  }",
    "}",
    };
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)           // Print opening code
        System.out.println(l[i]);
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++)    // Print string array
        System.out.println(l[6] + q + l[i] + q + ',');
    for(int i = 7; i &lt; l.length; i++)    // Print this code
        System.out.println(l[i]);
  }
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The source code contains a string array of itself, which is output twice, once inside quotation marks.

The same idea is used in the following [[SQL]] quine:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql" enclose="div"&gt;
SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE('SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE("$",CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),"$") AS Quine',CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),'SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE("$",CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),"$") AS Quine') AS Quine
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A very concise quine with the same basic structure can be written in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="lua"&gt;x = [["x = [" .. "[" .. x .. "]" .. "]\nprint(" .. x)]]
print("x = [" .. "[" .. x .. "]" .. "]\nprint(" .. x)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

And in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;s = 's = %r\nprint(s%%s)'
print(s%s)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As a [[one-liner_program|one-liner]] in [[MATLAB|Matlab]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="matlab"&gt;
s='disp(char([115,61,39,s,39,59,s]));';disp(char([115,61,39,s,39,59,s]));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As a one-liner in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C"&gt;
int main(){char*s="int main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);return 0;}";printf(s,34,s,34);return 0;}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Actually another shorter one:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C"&gt;
main(p){printf(p="main(p){printf(p=%c%s%1$c,34,p);}",34,p);}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Quines can take advantage of &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;.  For example, this [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] quine:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ruby"&gt;eval s="print 'eval s=';p s"&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In [[TI-BASIC|TI-BASIC]], if the last line of a program is value returning, the returned value is displayed on the screen. Therefore, a program containing a single digit results in a 1-byte quine. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


==="Cheating" quines===

Quines, per definition, cannot receive ''any'' form of input, including reading a file, which means a quine is considered to be "cheating" if it looks at its own source code. The following [[Unix shell|shell]] script is not a quine:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash"&gt;
#!/bin/sh
# Invalid quine.
# Reading the executed file from disk is cheating.
cat $0
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Nor is this succinct use of the [[Shebang (Unix)|Shebang]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash"&gt;
#!/bin/cat
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The above also applies to this [[JavaScript]] code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
function a() {
    document.write(a, "a()");
}
a()
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In [[PHP]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="php"&gt;&lt;? highlight_file(__FILE__) ?&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In Python:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;print(open(__file__).read())&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A program in the joke language HQ9+ is a quine if and only if the source code consists only of zero or more '+' characters and a single 'Q' character (the 'Q' command prints a quine and '+' prints nothing):

&lt;pre&gt;++Q++++++&lt;/pre&gt;

One of the shortest cheating quines is provided by [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], which has a built-in command to read its own source:

&lt;pre&gt;source type&lt;/pre&gt;

An even shorter cheating quine exists on many 1980s home computers (such as the [[ZX Spectrum]] and the [[Commodore 64]]) as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;1 LIST&lt;/pre&gt;

Another even shorter cheating quine in bash:
&lt;pre&gt;dd&lt;*&lt;/pre&gt;

In C:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
/*#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;*/
main() {
	char c;FILE *f;
	f=fopen(__FILE__,"r");
	while((c=fgetc(f))!=EOF)putchar(c);
/*	system("pause");*/
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Other questionable techniques include making use of compiler messages; for example, in the [[GW-BASIC]] environment, entering "Syntax Error" will cause the interpreter to respond with "Syntax Error".  Ignoring the restriction that quines be non-empty, there are many examples of programming languages where an empty program is valid (such as [[C (programming language)|C]]).  Such programs generally do nothing, in effect, reproducing the program.

==Ouroboros programs==

The quine concept can be extended to multiple levels of recursion, originating  "[[ouroboros]] programs", or quine-relays. This should not be confused with [[#Multiquines|Multiquines]].

==Multiquines==

David Madore, creator of [[Unlambda]], describes multiquines as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url = http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html
   |title = Quines (self-replicating programs)
   |author = David Madore
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A multiquine is a set of r different programs (in r different languages — without this condition we could take them all equal to a single quine), each of which is able to print any of the r programs (including itself) according to the command line argument it is passed. (Note that cheating is not allowed: the command line arguments must not be too long — passing the full text of a program is considered cheating)."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A multiquine consisting of 2 languages (or biquine) would be a program which:
* When run, is a quine in language X. 
* When supplied with a user-defined command line argument, would print a second program in language Y. 
* Given the second program in language Y, when run normally, would also be a quine in language Y.
* Given the second program in language Y, and supplied with a user-defined command line argument, would produce the original program in language X.

A biquine could then be seen as a set of two programs, both of which are able to print either of the two, depending on the command line argument supplied.

Theoretically, there is no limit on the number of languages in a multiquine,
a 5-part multiquine (or pentaquine) has been produced with [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[NewLISP]], and [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url = https://github.com/rvantonder/pentaquine
   |title = Pentaquine - 5 part multiquine
   |author = Rijnard van Tonder
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and there is also a 25-language multiquine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=={{Anchor|RADIATION}}Radiation-hardened==
A [[radiation-hardened]] quine is a quine that can have any single character removed and still produce the original program with no missing character.  Of necessity, such quines are much more convoluted than ordinary quines, as is seen by the following example in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

]]
'''[[Visual prosthesis|Retinal prostheses]]''' for restoration of sight to patients blinded by retinal degeneration are being developed by a number of private companies and research institutions worldwide.  The system is meant to partially restore useful vision to people who have lost their [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] due to retinal diseases such as [[retinitis pigmentosa]] (RP) or [[macular degeneration|age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD).  Three types of retinal implants are currently in clinical trials: '''epiretinal''' (on the [[retina]]), '''subretinal''' (behind the retina), and '''suprachoroidal''' (between the choroid and the sclera).  Retinal implants introduce visual information into the retina by electrically stimulating the surviving retinal neurons.  So far, elicited percepts had rather low resolution, and may be suitable for light perception and recognition of simple objects.

==History==
Foerster was the first to discover that electrical stimulation of the [[occipital lobe|occipital]] cortex could be used to create visual percepts, [[phosphene]]s.&lt;ref name="Foerster1" /&gt;  The first application of an implantable stimulator for vision restoration was developed by Drs.  Brindley and Lewin in 1968.&lt;ref name="Brindley2" /&gt;    This experiment demonstrated the viability of creating visual percepts using direct electrical stimulation, and it motivated the development of several other implantable devices for stimulation of the visual pathway, including retinal implants.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;  Retinal stimulation devices, in particular, have become a focus of research as approximately half of all cases of blindness are caused by retinal damage.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;  The development of retinal implants has also been motivated in part by the advancement and success of [[cochlear implant]]s, which has demonstrated that humans can regain significant sensory function with limited input.&lt;ref name="Zeng5" /&gt;

The [[Argus Retinal Prosthesis|Argus II retinal implant]], manufactured by [[Second Sight Medical Products]] received market approval in the USA in Feb 2013 and in Europe in Feb 2011, becoming the first approved implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA approves first retinal implant for adults with rare genetic eye disease|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm339824.htm|website=fda.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device may help adults with RP who have lost the ability to perceive shapes and movement to be more mobile and to perform day-to-day activities. The epiretinal device is known as the Retina Implant and was originally developed in Germany by [[Retina Implant AG]]. It completed a multi-centre clinical trial in Europe and was awarded a [[CE marking|CE Mark]] in 2013, making it the first wireless epiretinal electronic device to gain approval.

==Candidates==
Optimal candidates for retinal implants have retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration.  These diseases cause blindness by affecting the [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the outer layer of the retina, while leaving the inner and middle retinal layers intact.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Santos7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Humayun8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim10" /&gt;  Minimally, a patient must have an intact [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]] layer in order to be a candidate for a retinal implant. This can be assessed non-invasively using [[optical coherence tomography|optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging]].&lt;ref name="Matsuo11" /&gt;  Other factors, including the amount of residual vision, overall health, and family commitment to rehabilitation, are also considered when determining candidates for retinal implants.  In subjects with age-related macular degeneration, who may have intact peripheral vision, retinal implants could result in a hybrid form of vision.  In this case the implant would supplement the remaining peripheral vision with central vision information.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;

==Types==
There are two main types of retinal implants by placement. Epiretinal implants are placed in the internal surface of the retina, while subretinal implants are placed between the outer retinal layer and the [[retinal pigment epithelium]].

===Epiretinal implants===

====Design principles====
Epiretinal implants are placed on top of the retinal surface, above the nerve fiber layer, directly stimulating ganglion cells and bypassing all other retinal layers. Array of electrodes is stabilized on the retina using micro tacks which penetrate into the sclera.  Typically, external video camera onto eyeglasses&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt; acquires images and transmits processed video information to the stimulating electrodes via wireless [[telemetry]].&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;  An external transmitter is also required to provide power to the implant via [[radio-frequency induction]] coils or [[infrared]] lasers.  The real-time image processing involves reducing the resolution, enhancing contrast, detecting the edges in the image and converting it into a spatio-temporal pattern of stimulation delivered to the electrode array on the retina.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt; The majority of electronics can be incorporated into the associated external components, allowing for a smaller implant and simpler upgrades without additional surgery.&lt;ref name="Liu13" /&gt;  The external electronics provides full control over the [[image processing]] for each patient.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;

====Advantages====
Epiretinal implants directly stimulate the retinal ganglion cells, thereby bypassing all other retinal layers. Therefore, in principle, epiretinal implants could provide visual perception to individuals even if all other retinal layers have been damaged.

====Disadvantages====
Since the nerve fiber layer has similar stimulation threshold to that of the retinal ganglion cells, axons passing under the epiretinal electrodes are stimulated, creating arcuate percepts, and thereby distorting the retinotopic map. So far, none of the epiretinal implants had light-sensitive pixels, and hence they rely on external camera for capturing the visual information. Therefore, unlike natural vision, eye movements do not shift the transmitted image on the retina, which creates a perception of the moving object  when person with such an implant changes the direction of gaze. Therefore, patients with such implants are asked to not move their eyes, but rather scan the visual field with their head. Additionally, encoding visual information at the ganglion cell layer requires very sophisticated image processing techniques in order to account for various types of the retinal ganglion cells encoding different features of the image.

====Clinical study====
The first epiretinal implant, the ARGUS device, included a silicon platinum array with 16 electrodes.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;  The Phase I clinical trial of ARGUS began in 2002 by implanting six participants with the device.  All patients reported gaining a perception of light and discrete phosphenes, with the visual function of some patients improving significantly over time.  Future versions of the ARGUS device are being developed with increasingly dense electrode arrays, allowing for improved spatial resolution.  The most recent ARGUS II device contains 60 electrodes, and a 200 electrode device is under development by ophthalmologists and engineers at the USC Eye Institute.&lt;ref name="Humayun17" /&gt;  The [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141121165336/http://www.2%2Dsight.eu/ee/healthcare%2Dprofessionals ARGUS II device received marketing approval] in February 2011 (CE Mark demonstrating safety and performance), and it is available in Germany, France, Italy, and UK. Interim results on 30 patients long term trials were published in ''Ophthalmology'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22244176 | doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.09.028 | volume=119 | title=Interim results from the international trial of Second Sight's visual prosthesis | pmc=3319859 | year=2012 | journal=Ophthalmology | pages=779–88 | author=Humayun MS, Dorn JD, da Cruz L, Dagnelie G, Sahel JA, Stanga PE, Cideciyan AV, Duncan JL, Eliott D, Filley E, Ho AC, Santos A, Safran AB, Arditi A, Del Priore LV, Greenberg RJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argus II received approval from the US FDA on April 14, 2013 [http://2-sight.eu/landing-fda-l FDA Approval]{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.
Another epiretinal device, the Learning Retinal Implant, has been developed by IIP technologies GmbH, and has begun to be evaluated in clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;  A third epiretinal device, EPI-RET, has been developed and progressed to clinical testing in six patients. The EPI-RET device contains 25 electrodes and requires the [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] to be replaced with a receiver chip.  All subjects have demonstrated the ability to discriminate between different spatial and temporal patterns of stimulation.&lt;ref name="Klauke18" /&gt;

===Subretinal implants===

====Design principles====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image: Spatial Resolution Associated with a Retinal Implant.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Vision simulations using head mounted cameras can be used to evaluate the spatial resolution required for object recognition.  In this case, a 16 x 16 pixel array is used to represent the current camera image.  The computer monitor displays the resultant pixelated image, in which the spoon and the subject’s hand can be identified.  &lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;]] --&gt;
Subretinal implants sit on the outer surface of the retina, between the photoreceptor layer and the retinal pigment epithelium, directly stimulating retinal cells and relying on the normal processing of the inner and middle retinal layers.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;   Adhering a subretinal implant in place is relatively simple, as the implant is mechanically constrained by the minimal distance between the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium.  A subretinal implant consists of a silicon wafer containing light sensitive [[photodiode|microphotodiodes]], which generate signals directly from the incoming light.  Incident light passing through the retina generates currents within the microphotodiodes, which directly inject the resultant current into the underlying retinal cells via [[multielectrode array|arrays of microelectrodes]].  The pattern of microphotodiodes activated by incident light therefore stimulates a pattern of [[retina bipolar cell|bipolar]], [[retina horizontal cell|horizontal]], [[retina amacrine cell|amacrine]], and [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion]] cells, leading to a visual perception representative of the original incident image.  In principle, subretinal implants do not require any external hardware beyond the implanted microphotodiodes array.  However, some subretinal implants require power from external circuitry to enhance the image signal.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;

====Advantages====
A subretinal implant is advantageous over an epiretinal implant in part because of its simpler design.  The light acquisition, processing, and stimulation are all carried out by microphotodiodes mounted onto a single chip, as opposed to the external camera, processing chip, and implanted electrode array associated with an epiretinal implant.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;  The subretinal placement is also more straightforward, as it places the stimulating array directly adjacent to the damaged photoreceptors.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;  By relying on the function of the remaining retinal layers, subretinal implants allow for normal inner retinal processing, including amplification, thus resulting in an overall lower threshold for a visual response.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;  Additionally, subretinal implants enable subjects to use normal eye movements to shift their gaze.  The [[retinotopy|retinotopic]] stimulation from subretinal implants is inherently more accurate, as the pattern of incident light on the microphotodiodes is a direct reflection of the desired image.  Subretinal implants require minimal fixation, as the subretinal space is mechanically constrained and the retinal pigment epithelium creates [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] within the subretinal space.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;

====Disadvantages====
The main disadvantage of subretinal implants is the lack of sufficient incident light to enable the microphotodiodes to generate adequate current.  Thus, subretinal implants often incorporate an external power source to amplify the effect of incident light.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;  The compact nature of the subretinal space imposes significant size constraints on the implant.  The close proximity between the implant and the retina also increases the possibility of thermal damage to the retina from heat generated by the implant.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;  Subretinal implants require intact inner and middle retinal layers, and therefore are not beneficial for retinal diseases extending beyond the outer photoreceptor layer.  Additionally, photoreceptor loss can result in the formation of a [[glial scar|membrane]] at the boundary of the damaged photoreceptors, which can impede stimulation and increase the stimulation threshold.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;

====Clinical studies====
Optobionics was the first company to develop a subretinal implant and evaluate the design in a clinical trial.  Initial reports indicated that the implantation procedure was safe, and all subjects reported some perception of light and mild improvement in visual function.&lt;ref name="Chow19" /&gt;  The current version of this device has been implanted in 10 patients, who have each reported improvements in the perception of visual details, including contrast, shape, and movement.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;  [[Retina Implant AG]] in Germany has also developed a subretinal implant, which has undergone clinical testing in nine patients. Trial was put on hold due to repeated failures.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;  The Retina Implant AG device contains 1500 microphotodiodes, allowing for increased spatial resolution, but requires an external power source. Retina implant AG reported 12 months results on the Alpha IMS study in Feb 2013 showing that six out of nine patients had a device failure in the nine months post implant [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/suppl/2013/02/18/rspb.2013.0077.DC1/rspb20130077supp1.pdf Proceedings of the royal society B], and that five of the eight subjects reported various implant-mediated visual perceptions in daily life. One had optic nerve damage and did not perceive stimulation.  The Boston Subretinal Implant Project has also developed several iterations of a functional subretinal implant, and focused on short term analysis of implant function.&lt;ref name="Rizzo20" /&gt;  Results from all clinical trials to date indicate that patients receiving subretinal implants report perception of phosphenes, with some gaining the ability to perform basic visual tasks, such as shape recognition and motion detection.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;

==Spatial resolution==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image: Expected visual function over time.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The development timeline of retinal implant technology.  The first study in 2002 included devices with 12 electrodes, which enabled light and hand motion perception.  Devices with 60 electrodes have more recently become available, and implants containing 200 electrodes are in development.  The number of electrodes incorporated into retinal implants is expected to continue to increase over time, resulting in similar increase in the visual function which could be provided by retinal implants.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;]] --&gt;

The quality of vision expected from a retinal implant is largely based on the maximum [[angular resolution|spatial resolution]] of the implant.  Current prototypes of retinal implants are capable of providing low resolution, [[pixelization|pixelated]] images.

"State-of-the-art" retinal implants incorporate 60-100 channels, sufficient for basic object discrimination and recognition tasks.  However, simulations of the resultant pixelated images assume that all electrodes on the implant are in contact with the desired retinal cell; in reality the expected spatial resolution is lower, as a few of the electrodes may not function optimally.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;  Tests of reading performance indicated that a 60-channel implant is sufficient to restore some reading ability, but only with significantly enlarged text.&lt;ref name="Fornos21" /&gt;  Similar experiments evaluating room navigation ability with pixelated images demonstrated that 60 channels were sufficient for experienced subjects, while naïve subjects required 256 channels.  This experiment, therefore, not only demonstrated the functionality provided by low resolution [[optical feedback|visual feedback]], but also the ability for subjects to adapt and improve over time.&lt;ref name="Dagnelie22" /&gt;  However, these experiments are based merely on simulations of low resolution vision in normal subjects, rather than clinical testing of implanted subjects.  The number of electrodes necessary for reading or room navigation may differ in implanted subjects, and further testing needs to be conducted within this clinical population to determine the required spatial resolution for specific visual tasks.

Simulation results indicate that 600-1000 electrodes would be required to enable subjects to perform a wide variety of tasks, including reading, face recognition, and navigating around rooms.&lt;ref name="Weiland3" /&gt;  Thus, the available spatial resolution of retinal implants needs to increase by a factor of 10, while remaining small enough to implant, to restore sufficient visual function for those tasks.

==Current status and future developments==
Clinical reports to date have demonstrated mixed success, with all patients report at least some sensation of light from the electrodes, and a smaller proportion gaining more detailed visual function, such as identifying patterns of light and dark areas.  The clinical reports indicate that, even with low resolution, retinal implants are potentially useful in providing crude vision to individuals who otherwise would not have any visual sensation.&lt;ref name="Chader12" /&gt;  However, clinical testing in implanted subjects is somewhat limited and the majority of spatial resolution simulation experiments have been conducted in normal controls.  It remains unclear whether the low level vision provided by current retinal implants is sufficient to balance the risks associated with the surgical procedure, especially for subjects with intact peripheral vision.  Several other aspects of retinal implants need to be addressed in future research, including the long term stability of the implants and the possibility of retinal [[neuroplasticity|neuron plasticity]] in response to prolonged stimulation.&lt;ref name="Zrenner4" /&gt;

The Manchester Royal Infirmary and Prof Paulo E Stanga announced on July 22, 2015 the first successful implantation of Second Sight's [[Argus II]] in patients suffering from severe Age Related Macular Degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article4504868.ece Article in Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-33571412 BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; These results are very impressive as it appears that the patients integrate the residual vision and the artificial vision. It potentially opens the use of retinal implants to millions of patients suffering from AMD.

Some new pre-clinical studies restoring vision to animal models&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03212-0 Nanowire arrays restore vision in blind mice], and [https://www.livescience.com/62496-artificial-retina-ink-gold-restore-vision.html How Tattoo Ink and Gold Could (One Day) Help Restore Vision].&lt;/ref&gt; show promise of artificial photo voltaic layers transplanted on top of the retina. These layers convert light to electricity in a way similar to photoreceptors.

'''Roy H. Chamberlain''' (1862 - date of death unknown) was a Member of the [[Board of General Appraisers]].

==Biography==
Chamberlain was born in 1862 in [[Clarinda, Iowa|Clarinda]], [[Iowa]]. He served as [[Postmaster]] of Clarinda from 1895 to 1899. He served as clerk and acting collector of customs for the United States Military and Naval Forces in [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]], [[Cuba]] from 1899 to 1901.

==Federal Judicial Service==
On June 3, 1908, [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] appointed Chamberlain to the [[Board of General Appraisers]] via a [[recess appointment]]. On December 8, 1908, President Roosevelt nominated Chamberlain to the same seat, which had been vacated by [[Wilbur Fisk Lunt]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 11, 1909 and received his commission on January 15, 1909. He served on the board until he was removed from office by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]] on March 3, 1913.

===Circumstances of his removal from office===

Chamberlain's removal from office followed an investigation by a commission appointed for the purpose and consisting of Assistant Attorney General Winfred T. Dennison, Collector of the Port of New York William Loeb and law officer of the Bureau of Insular Affairs [[Felix Frankfurter]] future Supreme Court Justice. Chamberlain had been accused of incompetence in office. The commission determined on February 13, 1913 that Chamberlain was not an attorney and was not qualified to hold office. The commission further determined that decisions written by Chamberlain while on the Board had actually been prepared by another person. On March 3, 1913, President Taft upheld the commission's decision and removed Chamberlain from office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/03/04/100390351.pdf "Appraisers Let Out on Taft's Last Day", New York Times, March 4, 1913]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
After his removal from office, he worked as a grocer in [[Bradford, Pennsylvania|Bradford]], [[Pennsylvania]] from 1920 to 1930.

'''Roy Mitchell Kinnear''' (8 January 1934 – 20 September 1988) was an English [[actor]]. He is known for his roles in films directed by [[Richard Lester]]; including Algernon in ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965); Clapper in ''[[How I Won the War]]'' (1967); and Planchet in ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1973), reprising the latter role in the 1974 and 1989 sequels. He is also known for playing Private Monty Bartlett in ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'' (1965), Henry Salt in the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'', and cruise director Curtain in [[Juggernaut (1974 film)|Juggernaut]] (1974). 

Kinnear made his stage debut in 1955, and came to prominence in the [[BBC]] satirical comedy series ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' in 1962. He went on to appear in numerous British television comedy programmes, including ''[[Dick Emery|The Dick Emery Show]]'' (1979–81), and in the sitcoms ''[[Man About the House]]'' (1974–75), ''[[George and Mildred]]'' (1976–79) and ''[[Cowboys (TV series)|Cowboys]]'' (1980–81).

==Early life==
Kinnear was born in [[Wigan]], [[Lancashire]], the son of Annie (''[[married and maiden names|née]]'' Durie, previously Smith) and [[Roy Kinnear (rugby)|Roy Kinnear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/50/Roy-Kinnear.html|title=Roy Kinnear Biography (1934-1988)|publisher=filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] dual international in rugby union and rugby league, having played for {{nrut|Scotland}} and [[Great Britain national rugby league team]] international, making one [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]] appearance and three for [[Other Nationalities rugby league team|Other Nationalities]], and scoring 81 tries in 184 games for [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]; he collapsed and died while playing [[rugby union]] with the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in 1942, at the age of 38. [[Scotland Rugby League]] have named their Student Player of the Year Award after him.

Kinnear was educated at [[George Heriot's School]] in [[Edinburgh]]. At the age of 17 he enrolled in the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]; [[national service]] interrupted his studies.

==Career==
In the 1950s Kinnear began a career in [[repertory]] theatre when he appeared in a show at [[Newquay]]. In 1959 he joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]] at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]], performing in both the 1960 play and 1963 film of ''[[Sparrows Can't Sing]]''. Prior to joining Littlewood's workshop, he was a member of the cast of Perth Repertory Theatre. The cast also included Valerie Lush, [[Jane Cain]] (the original voice of the Speaking Clock) and Russell Hunter. He continued to work on stage and radio before gaining national attention as a participant in the television show ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''. 

Kinnear was [[Stanley Baker]]'s original choice to play VC recipient [[Frederick Hitch]] in the film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]''. Baker did not know Kinnear's name, and told the casting director to get "the actor from ''That Was the Week That Was'' whose surname begins with K." [[David Kernan]], also a cast member of that programme, was summoned and Baker chose to hire him rather than search for Kinnear. 

Kinnear later appeared in many films and television shows, including ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'', ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]'', ''[[Man About the House]]'', ''[[George and Mildred]]'', ''The [[Dick Emery]] Show'' (as Gaylord's long-suffering father) and four episodes of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. He starred in ''Cowboys'', a sitcom about builders. His best-known films are those he made with director and close friend [[Richard Lester]]: ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum]]'', ''[[How I Won the War]]'', ''[[The Bed Sitting Room (film)|The Bed Sitting Room]]'', ''[[Juggernaut (1974 film)|Juggernaut]]'' and the ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 film)|Musketeer]]'' series of the 1970s and 1980s.

He appeared with [[Christopher Lee]] in the Hammer horror film ''[[Taste the Blood of Dracula]]'' (1970). Also in 1970 he played Mr. Perkins, Melody's father in [[Waris Hussein]]'s ''Melody'', a puppy love story. He played the father of spoiled rich girl [[List of characters in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory#Veruca Salt|Veruca Salt]] in the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971), an adaptation of [[Roald Dahl]]'s children's novel ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. 

He guest-starred in ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies']]'' episode "[[Rome Antics]]" as the Roman Emperor, and in the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' episode [[List of Ripping Yarns episodes|"Escape From Stalag Luft 112B"]] (1977) as the fearsome German Sergeant Vogel.

He narrated and provided voices for the stop-motion children's television show ''[[Bertha (TV series)|Bertha]]''. He appeared in two music videos for [[Mike + The Mechanics]] ("[[All I Need Is a Miracle]]" and "[[Taken In]]") as the band's manager; in the former, he was reunited with his ''Help!'' co-star [[Victor Spinetti]].

He narrated ''[[Towser]]'' and ''[[Bertha (TV series)|Bertha]]'', voiced Pipkin in the 1978 film ''[[Watership Down (film)|Watership Down]]'' and voiced Texas Pete's henchman Bulk in ''[[SuperTed]]'' (also with Victor Spinetti, who voiced the evil Texas Pete). Kinnear appeared regularly on the stage. In later life he appeared in productions such as ''The Travails of Sancho Panza'' (playing the title role), and in ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', in 1985. 

In 1987, Kinnear starred in the ITV sitcom ''[[Hardwicke House]]'', but the show caused such a storm of protest it was cancelled after just two episodes.

His final completed roles were in ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1988) a made-for-television film directed by and starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[John Gielgud]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]], as a patient in the [[BBC1]] hospital drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', and a voice role as Mump in ''[[The Princess and the Goblin (film)|The Princess and the Goblin]]'', which was released in 1991, three years after his sudden death in September 1988. Following his death, the ''Casualty'' episode was postponed. It finally aired in August 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holby.tv/db/index.php?id=10,1291,0,0,1,0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
Kinnear was married to actress [[Carmel Cryan]]. They had three children, including TV and theatre actor [[Rory Kinnear|Rory]] and casting director Kirsty. Their elder daughter, Karina, was born with [[cerebral palsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/theatre/rory-kinnear-good-show-sweet-prince-6541358.html |title=Rory Kinnear: Good show, sweet prince  |date=29 November 2010 |publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Roy Kinnear's grave.jpg|thumb|Roy Kinnear's grave in East Sheen Cemetery, London]]
On 19 September 1988, Kinnear fell from a horse during the making of ''[[The Return of the Musketeers]]'' in [[Toledo, Spain]], and sustained a broken pelvis and internal bleeding. He was taken to hospital in [[Madrid]] but died the next day from a [[heart attack]], brought on by his injuries. He was 54 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DD113DF930A1575AC0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= ''Roy Kinnear Is Dead At 54 After Falling From Horse in Film''] Susan Heller Anderson, 23 September 1988 ''[[The New York Times]]'', accessed 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[East Sheen]] Cemetery.

After his death, Kinnear's family sued the production company and the film's director. In 1991, they received a £650,000 settlement. They later went on to demand an official investigation into the level of medical care Kinnear had received in Spain. Director [[Richard Lester]] quit the film business as a direct result of Kinnear's death.&lt;ref name="Teleg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3670797/Rory-Kinnear-becoming-an-actor-was-a-way-of-getting-to-know-my-father-better.html|title=Rory Kinnear: becoming an actor was a way of getting to know my father better|work=Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=21 May 2008 | location=London | first=John | last=Preston | date=27 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2958">The '''San Marino Scale''' is a suggested scale for assessing risks associated with [[Active SETI|deliberate transmissions from Earth]] aimed to possible [[extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial intelligent life]]. The scale evaluates the significance of transmissions from Earth as a function of signal intensity and information content. The scale was suggested by [[Iván Almár]] at a conference in [[San Marino]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="san-marino-scale"&gt;https://iaaseti.org/en/san-marino-scale/ IAA SETI Permanent Study Group: The San Marino Scale&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hecht |first=Jeff |journal= Acta Astronautica|title=The San Marino Scale: A new analytical tool for assessing transmission risk |date=24 October 2006|laysummary=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10363-what-are-the-chances-of-aliens-sniffing-us-out.html |laysource=New Scientist |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.04.012 |volume=60 |pages=57 |last2=Paulshuch |first2=H |bibcode=2007AcAau..60...57A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="quantifying"&gt;{{cite web

|access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The radio output of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune is not considered in the model. 
The San Marino Scale was subsequently adopted by the SETI Permanent Study Group of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] at its 2007 meeting in Hyderabad, India.

== Calculation ==
In the original presentation given by Almár, the San Marino Index, '''SMI''', of a given event is calculated as the sum of two terms. 

:&lt;math&gt; SMI = I + C &lt;/math&gt;

The first term, '''I''', is based on the intensity of the signal relative to the background noise in the same frequency band. This term is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], and calculated as: 

:&lt;math&gt; I {{=}} \log_{10}\left(\frac {\text{signal intensity}} { \text{background intensity}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
 
For example, a signal which is 100 times more intense than the background noise at the same frequency and bandwidth would have an I value of two. 

The second term, '''C''', is more subjective and relates to the content, aiming, timing, and character of the signal.&lt;ref name="quantifying"/&gt; A C rating of one is something like a stray radar pulse, lacking any information content and randomly directed. A C rating of five is a deliberate reply to an extraterrestrial signal.

'''''Sciadopitys verticillata''''', '''koyamaki''' or '''Japanese umbrella-pine''', is a unique [[conifer]] [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Japan]]. It is the sole member of the family '''Sciadopityaceae''' and [[genus]] '''''Sciadopitys''''', a [[living fossil]] with no close relatives, and present in the fossil record for about 230 million years.

[[File:Flore des serres v14 249a.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''Sciadopitys verticillata'' from "Flore des serres et des jardins de l'Europe"&lt;/center&gt;]]
Its genus name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[prefix]] ''sciado-'' meaning "shadow" and ''[[pitys (mythology)|pitys]]'', meaning "[[pine]]"; the [[Binomial nomenclature|specific epithet]] means "with [[Whorl (botany)|whorls]]".

It is an [[evergreen]] [[tree]] that can grow 15–27&amp;nbsp;m tall, with brown main shoots bearing whorls of 7–12&amp;nbsp;cm long flexible green [[wikt:cladode|cladodes]] that look like, and perform the function of, [[leaf|leaves]] but are actually composed of [[Plant stem|stem]] tissues; occasionally, a cladode will be forked and produce a bud in the 'v' of the fork. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are 6–11&amp;nbsp;cm long, mature in about 18 months, and have flattish scales that open to release the [[seed]]s.

There is inconsistent evidence regarding the plant family which produced [[Baltic amber]]. Both macrofossil and microfossil evidence suggest a ''[[Pinus]]'' relative, whereas chemical and [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared microspectroscopy]] evidence suggest relatives of either ''[[Agathis]]'' or ''Sciadopitys''.&lt;ref name="Wolfe2009"&gt;{{ cite journal |last1=Wolfe |first1=A.

A symbolic representation of the tree (known in Japanese as ''kōyamaki'') was chosen as the [[mon (badge)|Japanese Imperial crest]] for [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino]], currently third in line to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]].

'''Stanley Allison''' "'''Stan'''" '''Rogers''' (November 29, 1949&amp;nbsp;– June 2, 1983) was a Canadian [[folk music]]ian and [[songwriter]].

Rogers was noted for his rich, [[baritone]] voice and his traditional-sounding songs which were frequently inspired by [[Canadian history]] and the daily lives of working people, especially those from the fishing villages of the [[Maritime provinces]] and, later, the farms of the [[Canadian prairies]] and [[Great Lakes]]. Rogers died in a fire aboard [[Air Canada Flight 797]] on the ground at the [[Greater Cincinnati Airport]] at the age of 33.

==Early life and musical development==
Rogers was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanrogers.net/about/stan-rogers|work=Stan Rogers Biographies|title=Stan Rogers biodata|publisher=Fogarty's Cove Music|accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of Nathan Allison  Rogers and Valerie ([[née]] Bushell) Rogers, two [[Maritimers]] who had relocated to [[Ontario]] in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948. Although Rogers was raised in [[Binbrook, Ontario]]&lt;ref name="Rockingham2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/6789050-garnet-rogers-travels-with-my-brother-stan/ |title=Garnet Rogers: Travels with my brother, Stan |last=Rockingham |first=Graham |date=30 July 2016 |website=The Hamilton Spectator |publisher=Metroland Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;, he often spent summers visiting family in [[Guysborough County, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |title=Script changed in new play |date=26 July 1991 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/325828570/ |work=Nanaimo Daily Free Press |location=[[Nanaimo]], British Columbia |volume=117 |issue=93 |department=Entertainment Guide and tvScene |page=14 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Kane2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/fogartys-cove-maritime-legend-hard-reality-and-a-quarry-that-could-change-itall/article29641074/ |title=Ballad of Fogarty's Cove: The Nova Scotia legend, a hard reality and a quarry that could change it all |date=15 April 2016 |last=O'Kane |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=Phillip Crawley |location=[[Toronto]]], Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was there that he became familiar with the way of life in the [[Maritimes]], an influence which was to have a profound impact on his subsequent musical development. He was interested in music from an early age, reportedly beginning to sing shortly after learning to speak.&lt;ref name="O'Kane2016"/&gt; He received his first guitar, a miniature hand-built by his uncle Lee Bushell, when he was five years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Stan Rogers shows off his first guitar|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/stan-rogers-shows-off-his-first-guitar|access-date=3 January 2018|series=Canada After Dark|first=Paul|last=Soles|network=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=November 30, 1978|via=CBC Digital Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was exposed to a variety of music influences, but among the most lasting were the [[country and western]] tunes his uncles would sing during family get-togethers. Throughout his childhood, he would practice his singing and playing along with his brother [[Garnet Rogers|Garnet]], six years his junior.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

While Rogers was attending [[Saltfleet high school|Saltfleet High School, Stoney Creek, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/saltfleet/alumni-news/memories|title=Memories|date=November 6, 2014|author=Saltfleet Alumni Committee|website=Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board|publisher=Saltfleet District|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808235806/http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/saltfleet/alumni-news/memories/|archivedate=August 8, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he started to meet other young people interested in [[folk music]], although at this time he was dabbling in [[rock and roll]], singing and playing [[bass guitar]] in [[garage bands]] such as "Stanley and the Living Stones" and "The Hobbits".&lt;ref name=spider&gt;{{cite news|date=25 October 1967|title=Spider Starts Strong Web |last1=Yeatman |first1=Jill |last2=Weeks |first2=Graham |url=http://digitalcollections.trentu.ca/islandora/object/arthur:658/datastream/PDF/view |format=PDF |editor1-last=O'Brian |editor1-first=Geoff |work=Arthur |volume=2 |issue=6 |location=Peterborough, Ontario |publisher=Trent University|page=7 |via=Trent University Digital Collections |quote=Hobbit spokesman, Stan Rogers, usually accounted for most of the instrumental sound...}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Rogers briefly attended both [[McMaster University]] and [[Trent University]], where he performed in small venues with other student musicians, including [[Ian Tamblyn]], [[Chris Ward (singer)|Chris Ward]] and fellow Hobbit Nigel Russell.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digitalcollections.trentu.ca/islandora/object/arthur:551/datastream/PDF/view "Hoot Heats Up"].

In 1976, Rogers recorded his debut album, ''Fogarty's Cove'', released in 1977 on Barnswallow Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/88751368|title=Fogarty's Cove [sound recording]|last=Rogers|first=Stan|date=1977|website=Library of Congress Online Catalogue|publisher=Fogarty's Cove Music|location=Hamilton, Ontario, Canada|access-date=2017-02-24|quote=Originally released in 1977 on Barn Swallow Records, BS 1001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's subject matter dealt almost entirely with life in [[Maritimes|maritime Canada]], and was an immediate success. Rogers then formed [[Fogarty's Cove Music]], and bought Barnswallow during the production of ''Turnaround'', allowing him to release his own albums. [[posthumous work|Posthumously]], additional albums were released.{{cn|date=February 2018}}
 
&lt;!---Significant passage about his musical development required here-----&gt;
Rogers' songs often had a [[Celtic music|Celtic]] feel which was due, in part, to his frequent use of [[DADGAD]] guitar tuning. He regularly used his [[William Laskin|William 'Grit' Laskin]] built [[12-string guitar]] in his performances. His best-known pieces include "[[Northwest Passage (song)|Northwest Passage]]", "[[Barrett's Privateers]]", "[[The Mary Ellen Carter]]", "[[Make and Break Harbour]]", "[[The Idiot (song)|The Idiot]]", "[[Fogarty's Cove]]", and "[[White Squall (song)|White Squall]]".{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Death==
Rogers died alongside 22 other passengers most likely of [[smoke inhalation]] on June 2, 1983, while traveling on [[Air Canada Flight 797]] (a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]) after performing at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]]. The airliner was flying from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], to [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]] when a fire of unknown ignition source within the vanity or toilet shroud of the aft washroom forced it to make an [[emergency landing]] at the [[Greater Cincinnati Airport]] in northern Kentucky.

There were initially no visible flames, and after attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, smoke filled the cabin. Upon landing, the plane's doors were opened, allowing the five crew and 18 of the passengers to escape, but approximately 60 to 90 seconds into the evacuation the oxygen rushing in from outside caused a flash fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-02.pdf |format=PDF |author=Bureau of Accident Investigation |title=NTSB/AAR-86/02 |date=31 January 1986 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |location=Washington, D.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322014736/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-02.pdf |archive-date=22 March 2006 |dead-url=yes |via=AirDisaster.Com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers was one of the passengers still on the plane at the time of the fire.

His ashes were scattered in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of Nova Scotia.

==Legacy==
Rogers' legacy includes his recordings, songbook, and plays for which he was commissioned to write music. His songs are still frequently covered by other musicians, and are perennial favourites at Canadian [[campfires]] and [[song circles]]. Members of Rogers' band, including his brother [[Garnet Rogers]], continue to be active performers and form a significant part of the fabric of contemporary Canadian folk music. Following his death, he was nominated for the [[Juno Awards of 1984|1984 Juno Awards]] in the category for [[Juno Award for Artist of the Year|Best Male Vocalist]]. In 1994, his posthumous live album ''[[Home in Halifax]]'' was likewise nominated for [[Juno Award for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year – Solo|Best Roots and Traditional Album]].

His widow, Ariel, continues to oversee his estate and legacy. His music and lyrics have been featured in numerous written publications and films. For instance, his lyrics have appeared in school poetry books,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} taking their place alongside acknowledged classics. His song "[[Northwest Passage (song)|Northwest Passage]]" was featured in the last episode of the TV show ''[[Due South]]'', his songs "[[Barrett's Privateers]]" and "[[Watching the Apples Grow]]" having been previously featured. "Barrett's Privateers" has also been used extensively in promotion ads for [[Alexander Keith's Brewery|Alexander Keith's]] ale. In the 2005 [[CTV television network|CTV]] [[made-for-TV movie]] on the life of [[Terry Fox]], Rogers' "[[Turnaround (song)|Turnaround]]" is the music over the closing shot. As the movie ends, Fox is depicted, alone, striding up a hill, while the lyric "And yours was the open road. The bitter song / The heavy load that I'll never share, tho' the offer's still there / Every time you turn around," forges a link between these Canadian icons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Many of his songs on the albums ''[[Northwest Passage (album)|Northwest Passage]]'' and ''[[From Fresh Water]]'' refer to events in Canadian history.

[[Adrienne Clarkson]], who, prior to serving as the [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1999 to 2005, had worked for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], highlighted Rogers' career in a 1989 [[television documentary]] called ''[[One Warm Line]]'' on [[CBC Television]]; she also quoted Rogers in her investitural address.

When CBC's [[Peter Gzowski]] asked Canadians to pick an alternate national anthem, "Northwest Passage" was the overwhelming choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Enright |first1=Michael |title=Stan Rogers: Folk Singer, Storyteller, Proud Canadian Part 2 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/rewind/stan-rogers-folk-singer-storyteller-proud-canadian-part-2-1.3239078 |date=7 July 2016 |website=CBC Rewind with Michael Enright |publisher=CBC |accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Great Canadian Song Contest |url= |access-date= |series=Morningside |series-link=Morningside (radio program) |first=Peter |last=Gzowski |station=CBC Radio |date=3 March 1995 |quote= |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stan Rogers Folk Festival]] is held every year in [[Canso, Nova Scotia]]. In 1995, several artists performed two nights of concerts at Halifax's [[Rebecca Cohn Auditorium]], which were released on album that year as ''[[Remembering Stan Rogers]]''.

Rogers is also a lasting fixture of the Canadian folk festival [[Summerfolk Music and Crafts Festival|Summerfolk]], held annually in [[Owen Sound, Ontario]], where the main stage and amphitheater are dedicated as the "Stan Rogers Memorial Canopy". The festival is firmly fixed in tradition, with Rogers' song "[[The Mary Ellen Carter]]" being sung by all involved, including the audience and a medley of acts at the festival.

At [[Canmore Folk Music Festival|The Canmore Folk Festival]], Alberta's longest running folk music festival, performers take to the Stan Rogers Memorial Stage, which is the festival's main stage.

Stan's son, [[Nathan Rogers]], is also an established Canadian folk artist with a voice and lyrical acumen similar to his father's.  He has released two critically acclaimed solo discs and tours internationally as a solo act and in the trio ''Dry Bones''.

In 2007, Rogers was recognized posthumously with a National Achievement Award at the annual [[SOCAN]] Awards held in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2007-socan-awards&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Groundwood Books turned Rogers' song Northwest Passage into a children's book illustrated by award-winning artist Matt James.

'''Superhumanism''' as is defined as "the ability of humans to go above and beyond the general expectations and realities of humankind".{{cn|date=November 2017}} This can be accomplished through natural ability, self-actualization or technological aids. 
Historical outlooks on superhumanism are viewed{{by whom|date=April 2018}} as finding the ideal human in physical, mental as well as spiritual form, and has influenced politics, policy, philosophers, scientists and movements.

Well documented historical applications of this philosophy can be found in the events of [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II.{{dubious|date=April 2018}} 
Modern depictions of this have evolved and are shown through the [[comic book]] ideal of [[superheroes]] like [[Superman]], or through technologically aided people or [[cyborg]]s. 

== In philosophy ==
[[File:Nietzsche_-_Ainsi_parlait_Zarathoustra.djvu|thumb|The philosopher behind the belief of superhumanism believed in the importance of creating a greater meaning in life through individual betterment.]]
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844-1900) was a philosopher who challenged Christianity, the traditional ideas of purity, God, afterlife and other things such as morality. Nietzsche was a believer in creating the perfect human, or at least a definition of one. He believed in achieving this perfection through the enhancement of individual and cultural health, creativity, and power, and that to be a successful human one would focus on the realities of our world, rather than the beyond world, or afterlife. Nietzsche was often categorized as an existentialist philosopher of his time, and had his hand in the arts, writing, psychologic and social revolution. His later writings gave birth to the philosophy of Übermenschlich or [[Übermensch]], which translates relatively into [[Superhuman|superhuman]] or superhumanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Winter 2014|title = Friedrich Nietzsche|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/nietzsche/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Robert|last = Wicks|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Übermensch ===
{{main|Übermensch}}
Nietzsche explores the idea of a superhuman, in his writing ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra.'' This writing reveals his thinking as he discusses the reality of humans existing as just that, and their potential to be more, through risks taken to advance humanity. This belief focuses not on a man who is bettering oneself but instead establishes values which create a meaning to life greater than one person, and positively influencing the lives of others with an overarching goal of humanity. These goals help one overcome life's feeling of meaninglessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nietzsche's idea of the ''overman'' (Ubermensch) is one of the most significant concept in his thinking|url = https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~pj97/Nietzsche.htm|website = ccrma.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of bettering one's self, for humanity, developed within the philosophy of Nazi Germany.  The Nazi philosophy of the [[master race]], revolved around the concept of creating a perfect race, often referred to as the [[Aryan race]].  This was projected onto the people as a way of purifying their society, to create a Germanic master race, in which Übermensch became a core philosophy.  By creating a philosophy that defined the superior and the inferior human, people began to classify those around them as such.  Nietzsche and the Nazis believed in the greatness of humans because of the "[[H. L. Mencken|Polish blood in their veins,"]] and were henceforth able to classify and separate the "inferior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Nazi Death Machine: Hitler's Drugged Soldiers|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-nazi-death-machine-hitler-s-drugged-soldiers-a-354606.html|newspaper = Spiegel Online|date = 2005-05-06|access-date = 2015-12-07|first = Andreas|last = Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Nazi experimentation even included trying to chemically purify and enhance their soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nazis Tried To Chemically Enhance Their Soldiers|url = http://www.rense.com/general34/enhance.htm|website = www.rense.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In culture ==

=== Art ===
[[Nicholas Treadwell]] is a British artist who wrote the book ''Superhumanism'' that was published in 1979 and was followed by ''Superhumanism 2'' in 1982.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Superhumanism {{!}} Treadwells|url = http://www.superhumanism.eu/about/superhumanismus/|website = www.superhumanism.eu|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the author's own words, the movement is, "the first people's art movement – a movement, first and foremost, inspired by life, as opposed to inspired by art.  It is a movement of art by the people, for the people, and about the people.  It is about tolerance and human understanding.  Initially, a superhumanist work will move you to feel – to laugh, to cry, to shudder, to be overwhelmed with compassion.  They do not include any aesthetic gesture to distract from the vivid nature of the image.  A superhumanist work will take a down to earth subject, and use original technical means to exaggerate it,  achieving an over-the-top impact of it's humanist theme." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Treadwell used this art movement to emphasize the connection between mundane nature of humans, and the superior characteristics that exist in that simplicity.

=== Anarchy ===
It is suggested that there is a relationship between the fall of a society and the perfection of mankind. Many economic, social and environmental factors, which all contribute to the sustainability of a society, are built upon the need for a solution to a problem. Superhumanism requires the ability to overcome these problems, either through physical, mental or emotional triumphs of purity and self-actualization. Through the elimination of these problems, many economies and social structures would be collapsed. Also, through advancement in areas such as [[Transhumanism]], some believe that people humans will advance to a point of education and readiness that war will break out between one another, or tyrannies will reign, due to the high levels of advancements being achieved hence correlating with a need for power, eventually leading to an ultimate state of anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anarchism and Transhumanism|url = https://libcom.org/forums/anarchist-federation/anarchism-transhumanism-29032011|website = libcom.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real life ===
''[[Stan Lee's Superhumans]]'' was a television show devoted to finding people around the world who exhibit abilities that exceed normal human capabilities. [[Daniel Browning Smith|The most flexible man in the world]], is an example of a superhuman who travels the world finding physical and mental feats that expand the realm of what humans can do.

[[Human Body: Pushing the Limits]] is a Discovery Channel show that explores what happens to people's strength, sight, brainpower, and sensing abilities when placed under extreme stress. These circumstances can lead to short-term superhuman abilities, which allow people to excel in advanced, or impossible tasks.

Many acts performed by elite athletes are seen as superhuman. Elite athletes perform at a level that is perceived as unattainable by normal standards of performance. These are the result of a mixture of genetics, physical training, and mental conditioning. For example, the highest [[VO2 max]] test results ever recorded were from Norwegian cross-country skier, [[Bjørn Dæhlie|Bjorn Daehlie]], who scored a 96 ml/kg/min. The average range for VO2 Max is between 35-40 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min) for men and 27-31 ml/kg/min for women.  Another man, [[Dean Karnazes]] ran 50 marathons in 50 days in all 50 states in 2006. On February 4, 2015 actor and power lifter [[Hafthór Júlíus Björnsson|Hafthor Bjornsson]] broke a 1000 year old record by carrying a 1,433 pound log on his back for 5 steps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Thrones' star smashes 1000-year-old weightlifting record|url = http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2352774-the-mountain-from-game-of-thrones-breaks-1000-year-old-weightlifting-record|website = New York Post|date = 2015-02-04|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of athletics, many people have performed superhuman feats. The [[Blue Angels]] flight acrobatics team regularly pulls maneuvers equal to 4-6 times the force of gravity (g), with some turns as high as 8g. One man, Greg Poe, is a pilot who was able withstand turns of 12g.

There are also many stories of people lifting extremely heavy objects under extreme stress, known as [[hysterical strength]]. These situations are created when abnormal tasks are completed due to the brains heightened need for achievement.

=== Science ===
One modern day method of achieving above average abilities include [[performance-enhancing drugs]]; these include substances such as [[Analgesic|painkillers]], [[Blood doping|blood boosters]], [[stimulant]]s, and [[anabolic steroid]]s, but can also encompass substances that aren't fully recognized as enhancers such as [[caffeine]], protein supplements, and [[vitamin]]s. While drugs as a form of achieving superhuman capabilities is a well known concept in fiction, such as films like ''[[Limitless (film)|Limitless]]'' and the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]], in real life the current substances that are known and available don't produce such fantastical abilities. The results from some of these drugs are minimal, and often short term. However, they can still produce [[Anabolic-androgenic steroids abuse|detrimental side effects]], including many adverse psychological&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioural Manifestations of Anabolic Steroid Use|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-200519070-00002|journal = CNS Drugs|date = 2012-08-29|issn = 1172-7047|pages = 571–595|volume = 19|issue = 7|doi = 10.2165/00023210-200519070-00002|first = Adam J.|last = Trenton|first2 = Dr Glenn W.|last2 = Currier|pmid=15984895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physiological&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Blood pressure and rate pressure product response in males using high-dose anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1440244003800245|journal = Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date = 2003-09-01|pages = 307–312|volume = 6|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/S1440-2440(03)80024-5|first = F|last = Grace|first2 = N|last2 = Sculthorpe|first3 = J|last3 = Baker|first4 = B|last4 = Davies|pmid=14609147}}&lt;/ref&gt; effects.  [[SARMS]] and [[Methylhexanamine|DMAA]] are safer forms to enhance physical performance. Other forms of enhancement include strengthening the material properties of bone by integrating it with titanium foam. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19493-titanium-foam-builds-wolverine-bones/&lt;/ref&gt; More studies are needed to assess the long term effects of these emerging technologies. 

[[Transhumanism]] is a philosophy, modern-day movement, and practice that seeks to improve humanity through means such as [[evolution]] and [[cybernetics]] (see also [[human enhancement]]). Fictionalized accounts of this can include the characters from the [[X-Men|X-men]] franchise (mutants who are seen as "the next step in human evolution"), and also [[cyborg]]s such as those found in the [[Ghost in the Shell]] franchise. A widespread school of thought, is that transhumanism can include all methods of improving humanity with the goal of ending issues and flaws that have existed for as long as humanity has, but also faces the issues of how far should it go, such as if or when it achieves a state where what exists is [[Dehumanization|no longer human]].

== Religion ==

=== God ===
As a major defining factor of the superhumanism philosophy, humans are expected to possess traits that are considered to be those of high moral grounds, dignity  and intrinsic values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spiritual Titanism: Indian, Chinese, and Western Perspectives|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=py3nd3vIkjUC|publisher = SUNY Press|date = 2001-03-01|isbn = 9780791492826|first = Nicholas F.|last = Gier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who believe in superhumanism, value the importance of independent responsibility in making the world a better, and more moral place. This often means being in, or establishing some sort of spirituality which allows one to follow guidelines and grounds of a moral structure, and achieve a certain level of clarity and purity in their self and their path to righteousness and betterment. Superhumanism is often referred to as a combination between religion and philosophy, which suggests that there should be a correlation between the actions of man, and the patterns of the earth, in which this unity established with God, nature and man can allow for super human feats to become possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Naturalism, Supernaturalism, and Humanism|url = http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/naturalism.html|website = philosophy.lander.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SuperCam''' is a suite of remote-sensing instruments for the [[Mars 2020]] rover mission that performs remote analyses of rocks and soils with a camera, two [[laser]]s and four [[spectrometer]]s to seek [[organic compound]]s that could hold [[biosignature]]s of past microbial [[life on Mars]], if it ever existed there.

==Development==
SuperCam is being developed in collaboration between [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology ([[Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology|IRAP]]) in France, the French Space Agency ([[CNES]]), the [[University of Hawaii]] and the [[University of Valladolid]] in Spain. The Principal Investigator is Roger Williams from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].
SuperCam is an improved version of the successful [[Chemistry and Camera complex|ChemCam]] instruments of the ''Curiosity'' rover that have been upgraded with two different lasers and detectors.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goenka 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Scientists"/&gt;

In April 2018, SuperCam entered the final stages of assembly and testing. The flight model is scheduled to be integrated in 2018 and installed to the rover later the same year. The rover mission is planned to launch in July 2020.

The suite has several integrated instruments: [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[Plate reader#Time-resolved fluorescence (TRF)|time-resolved fluorescence]] (TRF) spectroscopy, and Visible and InfraRed (VISIR) [[Reflectance difference spectroscopy|reflectance spectroscopy]] to provide preliminary information about the mineralogy and molecular structure of samples under consideration, as well as being able to directly measure [[organic compound]]s.&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Scientists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goenka 2017"&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/nasas-mars-2020-rover-update-supercam-will-detect-organic-materials-2593996 NASA's Mars 2020 Rover Update: SuperCam Will Detect Organic Materials]. Himanshu Goenka, ''International Business Times''. 26 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The total is four complementary spectrometers, making the suite sensitive enough to measure trace amounts of chemicals.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;  In April 2018, SuperCam entered the final stages of assembly and testing.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt;

===LIBS===

Its remote [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS) emits a 1064-nm red laser beam to investigate targets as small as a grain of rice from a distance of more than 7 meters, allowing the rover to study targets beyond the reach of its arm.&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysOrg2018"/&gt; The beam vaporizes a tiny amount of rock, creating a hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. SuperCam then measures the colors of light in the plasma, which provide clues to the target's elemental composition.&lt;ref name="Goenka 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt; Its laser is also capable of remotely clearing away surface dust, giving all of its instruments a clear view of the targets.&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt; LIBS unit contains three spectrometers. Two of these handle the visible and violet portion of the VISIR spectra, while the IR portion is recorded in the mast.&lt;ref name="Page54"&gt;[http://www.spectroscopyonline.com/supercam-remote-sensing-instrument-suite-mars-2020-rover-preview?pageID=4 The SuperCam Remote Sensing Instrument Suite for the Mars 2020 Rover: A Preview]. Roger C. Wiens, Sylvestre Maurice, Fernando Rull Perez. ''Spectroscopy''. Volume 32, Issue 5, pg 54.  1 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raman spectroscopy===

SuperCam's [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrometer]] (at 532 nm) investigate targets up to 12 m from the rover. In the Raman spectroscopy technique, most of the green laser light reflects back at the same wavelength that was sent, but a small fraction of the light interacts with the target molecules, changing the wavelength in proportion to the vibrational energy of the molecular bonds. By spectrally observing the returned Raman light, the identity of the minerals can be determined.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book| last = Gardiner| first = D.J. | title = Practical Raman spectroscopy| publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| series = | date = 1989| doi = | isbn = 978-0-387-50254-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.036.epdf|doi=10.1038/nprot.2016.036|pmid=26963630|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22|title=Using Raman spectroscopy to characterize biological materials|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=11|issue=4|pages=664–87|date=April 2016|last1=Martin|first1=Francis L.|last2=Stone|first2=Nicholas|last3=McAinsh|first3=Martin R.|last4=Walsh|first4=Michael J.|last5=Martin-Hirsch|first5=Pierre L.|last6=Gardner|first6=Benjamin|last7=Fullwood|first7=Nigel J.|last8=Esmonde-White|first8=Karen|last9=Dorney|first9=Jennifer|last10=Curtis|first10=Kelly|last11=Cinque|first11=Gianfelice|last12=Bird|first12=Benjamin|last13=Ashton|first13=Lorna|last14=Butler|first14=Holly J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IR spectrometer===

The [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrometer]], provided by France, operates in the [[near-infrared]] (1.3 to 2.6 micrometers) wavelengths and its [[photodiodes]], or detectors, are cooled by small thermoelectric coolers to ensure that they operate between -100°C and -50°C at all times.&lt;ref name="Page54"/&gt; This instrument will analyze many of the [[clay minerals]] and help unravel the history of liquid [[water on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; The types of clay minerals and their abundances give clues about the nature of the water that was present, whether fresh or salty, acidic or neutral [[pH]], whether it might have been icy or warm, and whether the water was present for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; These are key questions to understand  [[Planetary habitability|how habitable]] the surface environment was in the distant past.

===Camera/telescope===

SuperCam's optical camera acquires high-resolution color images of samples under study, which also help determine the surface geology. This camera can also study how [[Water on Mars|atmospheric water]] and dust absorb or reflect solar radiation, which may help to develop [[Climate of Mars|weather forecasts]].&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt; SuperCam is also equipped with a microphone to capture the first audio recordings from the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; The microphone is the same model (Knowles Electret) as the ones that flew to Mars on the 1998 [[Mars Polar Lander]] and the 2007 [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]].&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt; However, neither mission was able to record sounds.&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;

===Spectrometers - Table ===

The detectors of all four spectrometers are cooled to just below 0°C by thermoelectric coolers. The  [[photodiodes]] for the infrared (IR) spectrometer are further cooled to between -100°C and -50°C at all times.&lt;ref name="Page54"/&gt;

'''The Engine''' is a fictional device described in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] in 1726. It is possibly the earliest known reference to a device in any way resembling a modern [[computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Eric A. Weiss]] |title=Jonathan Swift's Computing Invention |url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MAHC.1985.10017 |quote=In 1726 Jonathan Swift published a description of a wonderful machine, made of equal parts of ...  |work=[[IEEE]] |year=1985 |accessdate=2010-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a device that generates [[permutations]] of word sets. It is found at the [[Academy of Projectors]] in [[Lagado]] and is described thus by Swift:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“... Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.” He then led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in ranks. It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room. The superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than others. They were all linked together by slender wires. These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without any order. The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was going to set his engine at work.” The pupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed. He then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were scribes. This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn, the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved upside down."&lt;ref name="gullivers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swift|first1=Jonathan|title=Gulliver's Travels|date=1726|page=Part 3, Chapter 5|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/829/829-h/829-h.htm|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Final Destination''''' (alternatively known as '''''Final Destination 4''''') is a 2009 American [[3D film|3D]] [[supernatural horror film]] written by [[Eric Bress]] and directed by [[David R. Ellis]], both of whom also worked on ''[[Final Destination 2]]''. Released on August 28, 2009, it is the fourth installment of the [[Final Destination (film series)|''Final Destination'' film series]], and the first to be shot in [[High-definition video|HD]] [[3D film|3D]]. It is currently the highest-grossing ''Final Destination'' film, earning $186 million worldwide but also received the worst critical reception of the franchise. 

==Plot==

In 2009, College student Nick O'Bannon visits the McKinley Speedway with his girlfriend Lori Milligan and their friends Hunt Wynorski and Janet Cunningham. While watching the race, Nick has a premonition of a horrible car accident that sends debris into the stands, causing the stadium to collapse. When Nick panics, a fight breaks out and several people leave the stadium, including Lori, Hunt, Janet, security guard George Lanter, mechanic Andy Kewzer, his girlfriend Nadia Monroy, racist tow truck driver Carter Daniels, and mother Samantha Lane. As Nadia berates the group, a stray tire flies out of the stadium and decapitates her.

Several days after the accident, Carter tries to set a fire on George's lawn for preventing him from saving his wife, but a chain reaction causes him to be dragged down the street on fire before his tow truck explodes. The next day, Samantha is leaving the beauty salon when a rock propelled by a lawn mower is shot through her eye, killing her. After reading about the events in the newspaper and [[Final Destination series|the past disasters]], Nick becomes convinced that Death is after them. Hunt and Janet don't believe them, but they manage to convince George to help. The group visits the mechanic shop to warn Andy, but he is killed when a CO2 tank launches him through a chain link fence. After receiving a premonition involving water, Nick tries to warn Hunt, who has gone to a country club pool. At the same time, George and Lori try to find Janet, who becomes trapped in a malfunctioning car wash, and they narrowly manage to save her. Hunt drops his lucky coin in the water after accidentally turning the pool's drain on. When he dives in, he is sucked down to the drain, where the increasing suction eventually sucks his organs through the drain pipe. Afterward, George admits that he tried to commit suicide several times, but all attempts have failed. Nick believes saving Janet must have ruined Death's plan and the group celebrates.

Four days later, Nick begins to see more omens and remembers asking cowboy Jonathan Groves to switch seats prior to the accident, meaning he is next. Nick and George track Jonathan down at a hospital, where he remained in traction recovering from the accident. They witness him being crushed by an overflowing bathtub that falls through the ceiling. As they leave, George is suddenly hit by a speeding ambulance and Nick realizes that Lori and Janet are still in danger. He tracks them down at a mall cinema and convinces Lori to leave, but Janet refuses and is killed by flying debris when a chain reaction causes the screen to explode. A multitude of explosions race Nick and Lori through the mall until they are trapped on a malfunctioning escalator, Lori is dragged into the gears and killed. This turns out to be another premonition, but George is killed by the ambulance before Nick can warn him.

At the mall, Lori begins seeing omens as well. Having failed in his premonition, Nick runs back to the mall to stop the explosion before it occurs. He is pinned to a wall by a nail gun but manages to stop the fire before it spreads to several combustible barrels, saving everyone. Two weeks later, Nick notices a loose scaffold prop while heading into a café and warns a construction worker about it before going inside. While talking with Lori and Janet, he starts to see more omens and alludes to the theory that his predictions were red herrings meant to lead them to where they needed to be for Death to strike. Just as he realizes this the scaffold outside collapses, causing a truck to swerve and crash into the coffee shop, killing all three of them. Janet is crushed under the tires, Lori is decapitated by the impact, and Nick is propelled into a wall, dislocating his jaw.

The soundtrack attracted generally favorable reviews. Christian Clemmensen of [[Filmtracks.com]] gave the score 3 out of 5 stars and felt Tyler was "capable [...] to further explore new stylistic territory while making substantial use of the structures and tone of [predecessor composer] [[Shirley Walker]]'s music." His approach to the scores were called "intelligent", and provide "adequate if not strikingly overachieving recordings is testimony to his immense talents."

The reviewers were also impressed with the extension of the sound used by Walker in ''[[Final Destination 3]]''. "It relates to an affection for Walker's contribution to the industry," said an unnamed critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/final_destination09.html |title=''The Final Destination'' review |work=Filmtracks.com | date=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A SoundNotes reviewer grades the film with an impressive score of 7.5/10, remarking "Brian Tyler slugs his way through the inadequacies of ''The Final Destination'' and produces a score with reasonable entertainment value and enough of an appeal to make it function well apart from the woeful film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scorenotes.com/soundtracks/finaldestination.html |title=''The Final Destination'': Soundtrack Review |work= ScoreNotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''The Final Destination'' was initially scheduled for a DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] release on December 22, 2009. The film was pushed back to January 5, 2010 in the US. Both the DVD and Blu-ray Disc included two pairs of 3D glasses with each set and featured a 2D version on the disc, along with additional scenes. Only the Blu-ray Disc version included two alternate endings, a "making of" featurette about the deaths, storyboard visualization and a preview of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34418/the-final-destination-crashes-blu-ray-and-dvd |title=''The Final Destination'' Crashes onto Blu-ray and DVD |work=[[DreadCentral]] | date=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray Disc release, also a combo pack, includes a standard DVD of the film.

In [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores, some of the DVDs included an exclusive ''Final Destination'' comic book.

The movie was released uncut in Australian theaters with an [[Australian Classification Board#Film and video game classifications|MA15+]] (Strong horror violence, sex scene) rating. When the movie's DVD/Blu-ray Disc release was reviewed, the ACB (Australian Classification Board) noted several scenes in the 2D version that exceeded the guidelines of the MA15+ category. There were two editions released in Australia: a DVD version which only contains a censored 2D version (most of the blood effects taken off and gore trimmed) and a DVD release awarded an R18+ rating (High impact violence) with both uncensored 2D and 3D versions (and 3D glasses included). The covers between the two releases vary.

==Reception==
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 29% of 95 critics gave the film a positive review, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 4.2 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_destination_final_death_trip_3D/ |title=The Final Destination |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's consensus is: "With little of the ingenuity of previous installments, ''The Final Destination'' is predictable, disposable horror fare." [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 30 based on 14 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/finaldestination4 | title=''The Final Destination'': Reviews | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | date = January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Raven''''' is a 2012 American [[psychological]] [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[James McTeigue]], produced by Marc D. Evans, Trevor Macy and Aaron Ryder and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodtrailers.net/2010/10/luke-evans-and-alice-eve-in-james-mcteigue%E2%80%99s-the-raven "Luke Evans and Alice Eve in James McTeigue’s The Raven"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031155402/http://www.hollywoodtrailers.net/2010/10/luke-evans-and-alice-eve-in-james-mcteigue%E2%80%99s-the-raven/ |date=2010-10-31 }}. ''HollywoodTrailers.net''. Retrieved 2011-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; It stars [[John Cusack]], [[Alice Eve]], [[Brendan Gleeson]] and [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]].

Set in 1849,&lt;ref name="TheRaven2012film-r2" /&gt; it is a fictionalized account of the last days of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s life, in which the poet and author pursues a [[serial killer]] whose murders mirror those in Poe's stories. While the plot of the film is fictional, the writers based it on some accounts of real situations surrounding Edgar Allan Poe's mysterious death. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. The title derives from Poe's poem "[[The Raven]]", in the similar manner of the earlier unrelated [[The Raven (1935 film)|1935]] and [[The Raven (1963 film)|1963]] films.

It was released in [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] on March 9, 2012 and in the [[United States]] on April 27, 2012. The film garnered mostly negative reviews, with the [[visual effects]] and [[Film score|score]] by [[Lucas Vidal]] praised, but the performances and [[Plot twist|plot twists]] criticized.

==Plot==
In 19th-century [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], several policemen discover a murdered woman sprawled on the floor of her apartment, which was locked from the inside. While police search for the killer's means of escape, they discover a second corpse in the chimney, later identified as the 12-year-old daughter of the first victim. A celebrated detective, Emmett Fields ([[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]]), is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in a short story, "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]", that he once read.

The writer Edgar Allan Poe ([[John Cusack]]) is brought to Fields for questioning. After finding the body of Griswold ([[John Warnaby]]), a rival of Poe, cut in half by a pendulum (as in Poe's story "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]"), the pair deduce that someone is staging murders based on Poe's stories. Edgar's love, Emily Hamilton ([[Alice Eve]]), is kidnapped at her father's ([[Brendan Gleeson]]) masquerade ball, like the one described in Poe's "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]". The killer taunts Poe in a note, demanding that Edgar write and publish a new story. Poe's lodgings are burned down by people who believe he is exploiting the murders for his own journalistic ends, and he is forced to move in with Fields.

A clue from the killer referring to "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" leads Poe and Fields to search the tunnels under the city with several policemen, discovering the walled-up corpse of a man dressed as Emily. The man is determined to be a sailor, and the clues on his body bring the pursuers to [[Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Holy Cross Church]], where an empty grave with Emily's name on it has been prepared. As the police attempt to break down the church doors, the killer attacks and kills one of the policemen, then shoots and wounds Fields. Poe gives chase on horseback, but the killer escapes.

Poe writes one last newspaper column, offering his life for Emily's, suggesting that he could take poison. In the morning, the maid gives Poe a letter from the killer, accepting his terms, but the note was delivered long before the paper was distributed. Realizing that the killer must work at the paper, Poe races to confront his editor, Henry ([[Kevin McNally]]), but Henry is already dead, another note lying next to him.

The real killer is the paper's typesetter, Ivan Reynolds ([[Sam Hazeldine]]), who congratulates Poe and offers him a drink. Ivan attempts to converse with Edgar, but Poe demands Emily's location. Ivan pours a vial of poison, promising to end the story as Poe had written it. Poe agrees and drinks the liquid. Ivan quotes "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", cluing Edgar that Emily is concealed beneath the printing floor. As the killer leaves, Poe uses the last of his strength to tear up a false section of floor and open a trapdoor leading to Emily's prison.

Poe rescues Emily, and they share a poignant moment before she is taken away by ambulance. Delirious from the poison, Edgar wanders off to a park bench to die. A man walking in the park recognizes him as the famous writer, and asks if he is all right. Poe can summon only enough strength to say, "Tell Fields his last name is Reynolds." Later, when Fields comes to view Poe's corpse at the hospital, the attending physician is unable to tell him the exact cause of death, but mentions that the writer was incoherent, insisting that "his last name is Reynolds." Fields ponders the meaning of the phrase, slowly connecting the dots.

Ivan disembarks from a train in Paris. As a porter carries his luggage, Ivan climbs into a carriage and is confronted by Fields. He lunges for the detective, and Fields shoots him at point blank range.
