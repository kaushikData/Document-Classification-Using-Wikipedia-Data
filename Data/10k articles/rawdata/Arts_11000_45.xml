[[File:AVA from Spruce St.jpg|thumb|The Academy of Vocal Arts as seen from Spruce Street]]
The '''Academy of Vocal Arts''' (AVA) is a school dedicated to providing free higher education to aspiring [[opera]] singers. The school was founded in 1934 by Helen Corning Warden and is located at 1920 Spruce Street in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/pennsylvania/philadelphia/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654657102&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Academy%20of%20Vocal%20Arts&amp;st=cse New York Times 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820045152/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/pennsylvania/philadelphia/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654657102&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Academy%20of%20Vocal%20Arts&amp;st=cse |date=August 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the [[Great Depression]], few people could afford any kind of higher education, especially the long and costly training needed for a career in opera. Recognizing this difficulty, Helen Corning Warden, a prominent member of Philadelphia society, set out to establish a school where talented singers could receive highest quality training without having to suffer the financial burdens that such an education would normally entail. Encouraged by voice teacher Edgar Milton Cooke, Mrs. Warden and a group of her friends set out to establish a school for professional singers that would provide tuition-free education.

For more than six decades, gifted singers have come from throughout the world to seek training. Many current and former teachers, such as Sidney Dietch, Nicola Moscona, Giovanni Consiglio, Louis Quilico, Benita Valente, Nell Rankin, Bill Schuman and William Stone, have had highly successful careers.  Admission into AVA's four-year program is highly competitive, with approximately 28 singers enrolled in any given year. Today, AVA is the only tuition-free institution dedicated exclusively to the study of voice.

Helen Corning Warden served as the Academy's chairperson until her death. She was succeeded by her daughter, [[Adele W. Paxson|Adele Warden Paxson]], who was followed by her daughter, Sally Paxson Davis.  Since 1977, Christofer Macatsoris has held the position of music director.  Baritone and 1983 alum K. James McDowell has served as president and artistic director since 1987.

==Program==
The program of training offered by the Academy of Vocal Arts is centered on one-on-one repertoire coaching with a faculty of conductors and coaches and a weekly voice lesson with one of AVA's esteemed voice instructors. The program also includes French, German and Italian language classes, movement &amp; dance, stagecraft and stage combat classes, history of opera &amp; care of the professional voice seminars, and professional development coaching through private classes and workshops. AVA mounts four operatic productions each year featuring resident artists in leading and supporting roles, produced and directed by visiting professional directors with full orchestra. Additionally, chamber music recitals, a sacred music concert and an annual vocal competition feature in the Academy's season. Resident artists are given opportunities to audition for visiting companies from the US and Europe as well as international agents and managers. The Academy of Vocal Arts is also unique among training institutions in offering all residents merit-based fellowships to help offset the cost of living expenses while attending AVA.

==Alumni==
Notable alumni of the school include: [[Lando Bartolini]], [[Burak Bilgili]], [[Gwendolyn Bradley]], [[Stephen Costello (tenor)|Stephen Costello]], [[Joyce DiDonato]], [[Michael Fabiano]], [[Othalie Graham]], [[Eglise Gutiérrez]], [[Bryan Hymel]], [[Angela Meade]], [[Latonia Moore]], [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]], [[Ailyn Pérez]], [[Seymour Schwartzman]], [[Gregory Stapp]],  [[Ruth Ann Swenson]], [[Richard Troxell]], [[James Valenti]],   and [[Beverly Wolff]].

Many AVA alumni have national and international careers as   operatic soloists. From 2009 to 2012, every recipient of the [[Richard Tucker Award]] was an AVA graduate. Current resident artists have been selected as grand final winners of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions every year since 2011. Each year since 2012, the Metropolitan Opera's Beverly Sills Award has been awarded to an AVA alumnus.

[[Jean Anouilh]]'s play '''''Antigone'''''  is a [[tragedy]] inspired by [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Antigone (Sophocles play)|play of the same name]] by [[Sophocles]]. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent through its pronunciation ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃tiɡɔn}}, approximately ''an-tee-gon'').

==Performance history==

===Original production===

The play was first performed in Paris at the [[Théâtre de l'Atelier]] on February 6, 1944, during the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[military occupation|occupation]]. Produced under Nazi [[censorship]], the play is purposefully ambiguous with regard to the rejection of authority (represented by [[Antigone]]) and the acceptance of it (represented by [[Creon]]).  The parallels to the [[French Resistance]] and the Nazi occupation are clear, however.

===British première===

The play received its British première by the [[Old Vic]] Theatre Company at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]], London, on 10 February 1949. The production was [[Theatrical producer|produced]] by [[Laurence Olivier]] (who also played the role of Chorus) and had the following cast:&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Anouilh]] (1951): ''Antigone''. Methuen &amp; Co Ltd, London. {{ISBN|0-413-30860-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Chorus'' - [[Laurence Olivier]]
*''Antigone'' - [[Vivien Leigh]]
*''Nurse'' - [[Eileen Beldon]]
*''Ismene'' - [[Meg Maxwell]]
*''Haemon'' - [[Dan Cunningham]]
*''Creon'' - [[George Relph]]
*''First Guard (Jonas)'' - [[Thomas Heathcote]]
*''Second Guard (a Corporal)'' - [[Hugh Stewart (actor)|Hugh Stewart]]
*''Third Guard'' - [[George A. Cooper|George Cooper]]
*''Messenger'' - [[Terence Morgan]]
*''Page'' - [[Michael Redington]]
*''Eurydice'' - [[Helen Beck]]

==Adaptations==

Actress [[Katharine Cornell]] produced and starred in a 1946 production at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre in Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ifVxpwAACAAJ Google Books: Antigone at the National Theatre, 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]] played the role of King Creon. Also performing were [[Bertha Belmore]], [[Wesley Addy]], [[Ruth Matteson]], [[George Mathews (actor)|George Mathews]], and [[Oliver Cliff]], and [[Marlon Brando]] (as the Messenger), [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] (The Third Guard). The production was staged by Cornell's husband [[Guthrie McClintic]].&lt;ref&gt;Tad Mosel, "Leading Lady:  The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell", Little, Brown &amp; Co., Boston (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The translation was by [[Lewis Galantière]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4078798/ "Galantiere ... adapted Jean Anouilh's ANTIGONE for Katharine Cornell in 1946" See {{OCLC|762051925}} for the earliest publication.&lt;/ref&gt;. It has since been published many times.

There was an English-language [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1818353/ television production] in 1959 starring [[Dorothy Tutin]].

In 1974, an American television production of the play, presented on [[PBS]], starred [[Geneviève Bujold]] and [[Stacy Keach]].

There have also been more recent English translations by [[Barbara Bray]] in 2009 ({{ISBN|9780413695406}}) and by [[Jeremy Sams]] in 2002 ({{ISBN|9780573628191}}).

'''BBC Alba''' is a [[Scottish Gaelic]] language [[digital television]] channel jointly owned by the [[BBC]] and [[MG Alba]]. The channel was launched on 19 September 2008 and is on-air for up to seven hours a day. The name ''{{lang|gd|[[Alba]]}}'' is the Scottish Gaelic name for [[Scotland]]. The station is unique in that it is the first channel to be delivered under a BBC licence by a partnership and is also the first multi-genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Gaelic digital TV channel debated| publisher = [[BBC Online]]| date = 29 August 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6968320.stm| accessdate = 3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/local/alba_eng.shtml |title=Commissioning - BBC Alba |publisher=BBC |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7556739.stm |title=Launch date for Gaelic TV channel |publisher=BBC News |date=13 August 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel is available in Scotland via [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/2010/december/bbc_alba.shtml|title=Trust approves BBC Alba carriage on Freeview|publisher=BBC Trust|date=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the UK on [[Sky UK|Sky]], [[Freesat]], [[Virgin Media]], [[BBC iPlayer]], and [[TVPlayer]]. BBC Alba has an average viewership of 637,000 adults over the age of 16 in Scotland each week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.mgalba.com/downloads/reports/annual-report-12-13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; BBC Alba got 4.1 million views on BBC iPlayer between 2012–2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Gaelic broadcasting in Scotland}}

In 2007, the [[BBC Trust]] opened a consultation for a Gaelic digital service in partnership with the [[MG Alba|Gaelic Media Service]]. Following the BBC Trust consultation in November 2007, the [[Audience Council Scotland]] recommended their support for the creation of the service on 7 December 2007, stating that the Trust should pursue carriage of the service on digital terrestrial television and that existing "gaelic zone" programming on [[BBC Scotland]] should remain after the launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/aboutus/acs/content/meetings/minutes.shtml?minutes=minutes20071207 |title=Audience Council Scotland - Meeings |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/aboutus/acs/content/audience/submissions.shtml |title=Audience Council Scotland - Audience |publisher=BBC |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2008, the BBC Trust gave the go-ahead for a Gaelic channel.

The channel began broadcasting on satellite at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 19 September 2008 with a launch video featuring a new rendition of the [[Runrig]] song, ''{{lang|gd|Alba}}''. The first part of a live [[céilidh]] from [[Skye]], presented by Mary Ann Kennedy, was followed by a specially produced comedy drama entitled ''{{lang|gd|Eilbheas}}'' (Elvis), starring [[Greg Hemphill]] as [[Elvis Presley]], at 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm. The channel's first independent commission, ''{{lang|gd|Peter Manuel – Deireadh an Uilc?}}'' (''Peter Manuel - The End of Evil?''), a drama documentary produced by [[STV Productions]], was shown at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm before the opening night closed with the second half of the live celidh from Skye. The launch night was simulcast on [[BBC Two Scotland]] between 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm and there was a launch event held at the [[National Museum of Scotland]], which was recorded by the channel's news service ''{{lang|gd|[[An Là]]}}''.

A study carried out for the channel indicated that 650,000 people watched BBC Alba per week in the first two months of broadcasting, in spite of only being available to around a third of Scots.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7693193.stm |title=Viewer figure boost for Gaelic TV |publisher=BBC News |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being subject to a review by the BBC Trust and a recommendation from the [[Audience Council Scotland]] in 2009, a plan was announced to broadcast the channel on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], in Scotland only, from the digital switchover (2010) under the proviso that reach of the service extended beyond the core Gaelic audience to 250,000. This was approved on 27 December 2010 by the BBC Trust&lt;ref name="Freeview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/december/bbc_alba.shtml|title=Trust approves BBC Alba carriage on Freeview|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the service launched on Freeview on 8 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13479551|title=BBC Alba Freeview date unveiled|publisher=BBC News|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel also launched on Virgin Media (Scotland only) on 18 May 2011,&lt;ref name=VirginLaunch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmediascotland.com/press_news/30026/bbc-alba-to-begin-broadcasting-on-virgin-tv|title=BBC Alba to Begin Broadcasting on Virgin TV|publisher=allmediascotland|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virgin Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=126782 |title=BBC Alba Launches on Virgin Media |publisher=4RFV.co.uk |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521033850/http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=126782 |archivedate=21 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made available nationwide on the Virgin Media and Sky platforms, the former on 6 November 2012.

== Operation ==

[[File:BBC Scotland.jpg|thumb|Pacific Quay in Glasgow, from where BBC Alba is transmitted.]]

BBC Alba is broadcast for up to seven hours a day in the [[United Kingdom]] on satellite platforms [[Sky UK|Sky]] and [[Freesat]], cable provider [[Virgin Media]] and on digital terrestrial provider [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in Scotland only. Programmes are also available to watch on the internet live through services including the [[BBC iPlayer]] and some programmes are available for seven days after broadcast on this service and on catch up services of some other services.

The channel is financed from the [[BBC Scotland]] budget and by MG Alba, which itself is financed by the [[Scottish Government]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]. The BBC spent £8 million on the channel, of which £5 million was used for programming, in 2011/12&lt;ref name="BBC report 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=The BBC Executive's Review and Assessment|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/bbc_executive_2011_12.pdf|work=Annual Report and Accounts 2011/12|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 November 2012|pages=2–64|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MG Alba applies the majority of its budget (£12.4 million in 2008/09) to the Gaelic Digital Service.

BBC Alba has four studios across Scotland, located in [[Stornoway]], [[Glasgow]], [[Inverness]] and [[Portree]]. Continuity and channel management is based in Stornoway while the news services are based in Inverness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgalba.com/en/rhs_links/faqs.html |title=MG Alba - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[MG Alba]] |date=19 September 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413090258/http://www.mgalba.com/en/rhs_links/faqs.html| archivedate= 13 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short pre-recorded information program called ''{{lang|gd|Dè Tha Dol}}'' is sent from Stornoway and is played out at 7:55&amp;nbsp;pm daily. [[BBC Scotland]]'s headquarters at [[Pacific Quay]] in Glasgow is used to transmit the programmes.&lt;ref name="mgalba.com"/&gt; The First Minister, [[Alex Salmond]] opened the new BBC Alba studio in Portree in August 2008 where he recorded a message for the launch of BBC Alba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/This-Week/Media-Briefings/080825 |title=Media Briefing |date=25 August 2008 |work=www.scotland.gov.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

BBC Alba combines [[television]], [[radio]] and [[on-line]] programme content, and is anticipated to have a positive impact at many levels including increasing artistic and technical skills, extending economic opportunities, stimulating parents' interest in [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic medium education]], appealing to and serving the adult learners and strengthening Gaelic usage in extremely important media. It holds significant potential to assist with the development of positive attitudes to the acquisition and transmission of Gaelic. BBC Alba broadcasts more Scottish sport than any other channel, with over three hours a week of football, rugby and shinty. In addition, the station also broadcasts a live news programme for 30&amp;nbsp;minutes every weekday.

=== Programming ===

MG Alba and the BBC have announced that around ninety minutes of television content daily will be new material. Output on the station consists of news, current affairs, sport, drama, documentary, entertainment, education, religion and children's programming, broadcast on most days between 5&amp;nbsp;pm and 12&amp;nbsp;am. Sport programmes began on Saturday 20 September 2008 and news services on Monday 22 September 2008.&lt;ref name="mgalba.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgalba.com/faq_english.html |title=MG Alba Fios Naidheachd |publisher=Mgalba.com |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081414/http://www.mgalba.com/faq_english.html |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's programmes are shown for two hours every weekday, between 17:00 and 19:00. Current affairs series ''{{lang|gd|[[Eòrpa]]}}'' and children's magazine show ''{{lang|gd|[[Dè a-nis?]]}}'' are broadcast on Thursday nights on BBC Alba and also continue to be shown on [[BBC Two Scotland]] at their usual timeslots on Thursdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/tbh/eorpa/english/index.shtml |title=Alba Eòrpa (English) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nightly half-hour news programme, ''{{lang|gd|[[An Là]]}}'', is aired on weeknights at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm with newsreaders Angela Maclean and Iain Maclean. Radio Personality of the Year, Derek 'Pluto' Murray, is their resident sports reporter. ''{{lang|gd|[[Spòrs]]}}'' on Saturday nights features weekly coverage of a selected [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] match. ''{{lang|gd|[[Rugby Beo]]}}'' broadcasts one live Magners League rugby union game a week, involving one of the competition's Scottish teams. A Gaelic-learning programme, ''[[Speaking our Language]]'' is re-broadcast on weeknights at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm. Former ''{{lang|gd|Eòrpa}}'' reporter, Derek Mackay hosts a weekly chat show, ''{{lang|gd|Cnag na Cùise}}'', on Sunday nights. So far two series of current affairs documentary ''{{lang|gd|[[Trusadh]]}}'' has been commissioned as of 2010, which is sometimes presented by [[Donald MacSween]].

BBC Alba also fund new programming, such as ''[[Fraochy Bay]]''.

=== Subtitling ===

Most of the adult programming on BBC Alba contains on-screen [[English language|English]] [[subtitles]].  For logistical reasons, live broadcasts (including the news) are not subtitled, although certain events (e.g. the annual [[Hogmanay]] broadcast ''{{lang|gd|Bliadhna Mhath Ùr}}'') have scripted elements that are subtitled, while interviews and ad-libbed lines are not.

Children's programmes are not subtitled. Controversially, no English dialogue on the channel is subtitled into Gaelic.

=== Sport ===

BBC Alba concentrates on three sports: [[association football|football]], [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[shinty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football-news/scottish-football/scottish-football-league/2008/07/31/sfl-s-delight-at-joy-sponsorship-deal-for-challenge-cup-86908-20678564/ |title=SFL's delight at joy sponsorship deal for Challenge Cup |publisher=The Daily Record |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009–10 season, the station broadcast one full [[Scottish Premier League]] game every Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/7507443.stm |title=BBC Gaelic to screen SPL matches |publisher=BBC News |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game selected was always one not covered by either live [[Sky Sports]] or on an on-demand basis by [[BT Vision]] and was shown three hours after the end of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/naidheachdan/story/2008/07/080715_gaelic_spl.shtml |title=Geamaichean a' Phrìomh Lìog air an t-Seirbheis Dhidseataich |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}} {{gd icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matches only included Gaelic commentary along with English subtitles.

The channel reached an agreement with the [[Scottish Football League]] to broadcast live [[association football|football]] games during the 2008–09 season. This began with the final of the [[Scottish Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]], which was also sponsored by MG Alba.&lt;ref name = "SFL"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/7867162.stm BBC Alba to screen live SFL games], [[BBC Sport]], 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC Alba then started broadcasting [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] games, beginning with the match between [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] and [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] on 22 February 2009.&lt;ref name = "SFL"/&gt;

BBC Alba also struck a deal with the Scottish rugby authorities to show one live rugby, [[Scottish Premiership Division One]] match every weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=David |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/rugby/Scottish-clubs-agree--to.4555181.jp |title=Scottish clubs agree to BBC Alba showing ten games live - Scotsman.com Sport |publisher=Sport.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2015-16 season, BBC Alba will show 20 live matches (excluding [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]) from either [[2015-16 Scottish Championship]] (including the play-off final), [[2015–16 Scottish League One|League 1]] or [[2015–16 Scottish League One|League 2]] as well as four matches from the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]]. The station also altered their coverage of [[Scottish Premiership]] highlights, showing one hour highlights of two non-televised matches on a Saturday and Sunday night at 22:00. Other football coverage includes all [[Scotland U21s]] and [[Scotland national women's football team|Women's]] matches. As well as the final of the [[2015-16 Scottish Junior Cup]].

In 2010 BBC Alba bought the rights for [[Pro14|Celtic League]] rugby jointly with public service broadcasters from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/7813469/Celtic-Rugby-secure-improved-broadcast-deal-for-Magners-League-coverage.html|title=Celtic Rugby secure improved broadcast deal for Magners League coverage|last=Clutton|first=Graham|date=9 June 2010|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent production companies ===

A number of independent companies have been commissioned to produce content for the channel, or have productions currently airing. These include:

* Theatre Hebrides (''{{lang|gd|Lostbost}}'')
* Madmac Productions (''Broadford or Bust'')
* Caledonia Stern and Wylde (''{{lang|gd|Tìr is Teanga}}'')
* MnE Media, formerly known as ''{{lang|gd|Meadhan nan Eilean}}'' (''{{lang|gd|Seasaidh Lexy}}'', ''{{lang|gd|[[Cuide ri Cathy]]}}'')
* Tern TV (''{{lang|gd|Slighe gu Biadh}}'')
* Eyeline Media (''{{lang|gd|Air an Rathad}}'', ''{{lang|gd|Làrach anns an Fhàsach}}'')
* MacTV (''{{lang|gd|Ealtainn}}'')
* Studio Alba (''{{lang|gd|A' Gharaids}}'')

== Criticism ==

=== Lack of Gaelic content and emphasis on English ===

The Gaelic community, including writers {{lang|gd|[[Aonghas MacNeacail]]}}, [[Angus Peter Campbell]], Lisa Storey and musician Allan MacDonald, have criticised the non-availability of Gaelic subtitles, and the emphasis on English language interviews and reportage in the channel's content for adults. Writers and authors were reported by the BBC Gaelic news service as setting up a campaign, GAIDHLIG.TV, to increase Gaelic content on Alba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BBC Alba is not a Gaelic channel|author= |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/naidheachdan/29125194|newspaper= |date= 9 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014 |work=BBCAlbaNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to introduce 'red button facilities' to allow viewers to switch to English language sports commentary, first announced in August 2014 for rugby and the Guinness Pro12 series, was heavily criticised by the Gaelic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= English content on ALBA harmful to Gaelic development |author=Allan MacDonald and Lisa Storey |url= http://www.gaidhlig.tv/post/96634203357/litir-gu-whfp-2014 |newspaper=West Highland Free |date= 11 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism resulted in MG Alba announcing publicly in the West Highland Free Press that the 'red button option' for English language commentary would not expand to other sports or areas of the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Freagairt do draghan mu MG ALBA |author= |url= http://www.whfp.co.uk |newspaper=West Highland Free Press |date= 11 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014 |language=gd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports programming ===

Between its launch in September 2008 and the beginning of 2010, the BBC Alba channel lost a third of its viewers, but its number of viewers remains five times larger than the size of the Gaelic speech community in Scotland (just over 58,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnag.org.uk/munghaidhlig/stats/gspeakcensus01.php |title=CnaG ¦ Census 2001 Scotland: Gaelic speakers by council area |publisher=Cnag.org.uk |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427072929/http://www.cnag.org.uk/munghaidhlig/stats/gspeakcensus01.php| archivedate= 27 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The historian Michael Fry has argued that many of its viewers only watch it for the football coverage, because "you don't need Gaelic to watch football", and that in this way the channel is "cheating".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The model is, however, both common and intentional as it is on comparable channels such as the [[Irish language]] channel [[TG4]], the [[Basque language|Basque]] broadcaster [[EITB]] or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] channel [[S4C]]. In Europe, these channels' main mission is not commercial, but the promotion of the original languages.

=== Freeview ===

Some criticism had been levied over the channel's addition to Freeview, primarily due to the BBC's original plan (with acceptance from the BBC Executive) to remove all 13 BBC Radio channels from Freeview for Scottish viewers over the period that BBC Alba will be shown on Freeview (between 5&amp;nbsp;pm and midnight); however the criticism has not been directed at the BBC's decision to extend BBC Alba to Freeview in principle.&lt;ref name=Freeview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BBC Alba to be shown on Freeview|author= |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-12049472|newspaper= |date= 21 December 2010|accessdate=27 January 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 2011, it was reported that the BBC has backed down on the plans, after the BBC had "managed to reengineer facilities" to allow [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] and [[BBC 6 Music|6 Music]] to continue to broadcast on a 24-hour basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowlibdems.org.uk/scottish-lib-dems/bbc-change-of-heart-on-digital-radio-simple-common-sense.html |title=BBC change of heart on digital radio 'simple common sense' |publisher=Scottish Lib Dems |date=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521022349/http://www.glasgowlibdems.org.uk/scottish-lib-dems/bbc-change-of-heart-on-digital-radio-simple-common-sense.html |archivedate=21 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three stations were chosen because they have the highest evening audience ratings on digital television of the seven BBC radio stations unavailable on FM radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2011/05/bbc_alba_on_freeview.html|title=BBC Alba on Freeview|publisher=BBC Internet Blog|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 2 December 2013, it was confirmed that more radio stations were made available 24 hours in Scotland, but with some trade-offs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/posts/I-can-hear-it-coming-in-the-air-tonight-the-return-of-five-radio-stations-in-the-evenings-on-Freeview-in-Scotland|title=I can hear it coming In the air tonight: the return of five radio stations in the evenings on Freeview in Scotland |publisher=BBC About the BBC Blog|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio 4]], [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|4 Extra]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra|5 Live Sports Extra]], [[BBC Radio Scotland]] and [[BBC Asian Network]] were restored, but as noted in the blog with some technical trade-offs, such as mono audio rather than stereo during the evenings on the radio stations mentioned and the audio bit rate of the TV channels in Scotland on Freeview reduced to 192kbit/s from 256kbit/s.

The '''Brand Standard Identification Number (BSIN)''' is a 6-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://product.okfn.org/brand/ OKFN Brand Repository Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origins of BSIN come from the worldwide product repository of [[OKFN]]: To integrate a product, a brand must be assigned.
The [[OKFN]] project "Open Product Data" uses BSIN codes in its product repository.&lt;ref&gt;http://product-open-data.com&lt;/ref&gt;
Each brand of the [[OKFN]] brand repository is given a unique BSIN.
The first version of the brand repository has been launched on the 20th of December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://product.okfn.org/2013/12/20/brand-standard-identifier-number-bsin-open-product-data-working-group-launches-a-brand-repository/ Launch announcement ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The BSIN code is composed if 6 alphanumeric characters. letters are uppercase and '0' and 'O' are excluded to avoid confusions.
When a BSIN code is created, it can physically be destroyed or replaced. When it is deleted, its status becomes "deleted" and the reason of the deletion is always provided.
The objective is to ensure users of the reliability and the stability of the BSIN.

There are two types of brands: 
* manufacturer brand
* retailer brand

== Roadmap ==

The concept of "owner" will be used to gather brands belonging to big manufacturers such as Unilever, Pesico,... 
The second objective is to avoid confusion between the brand and the company belonging the brand. For example, The Coca-Cola company (owner) belongs Cola-Cola (brand), coca zero (brand),...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4999">'''Bellsybabble''' is a fictional language of the [[Devil]], which he makes up as he goes along. Writer [[James Joyce]] mentions it in the following postscript to a letter (containing the story now known as "The Cat and the Devil"), which he wrote  in 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-1-139-43523-9| last = Milesi| first = Laurent| title = James Joyce and the Difference of Language| date = 2003-07-24| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eRonW7lL64MC| p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; to his four-year-old [[Stephen James Joyce|grandson]]:&lt;ref name="Melchiori1988"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| editors = Rosa Maria Bollettieri Bosinelli, Carla Marengo, Christine van Boheemen (eds.)| last = Melchiori| first = Giorgio| author-link=Giorgio Melchiori|title = The Languages of Joyce: Selected Papers from the 11th International James Joyce Symposium Venice 1988| chapter = The Languages of Joyce| date = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15–16}}
{{quote|The devil mostly speaks a language of his own called Bellsybabble which he makes up himself as he goes along but when he is very angry he can speak quite bad French very well though some who have heard him say that he has a strong Dublin accent.}}

The name "Bellsybabble" is a [[pun]] on [[Beelzebub]], [[:wikt:babble|"babble"]] and [[Tower of Babel|Babel]]. Bellsybabble has variously been called a poly-language,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0885-0429| volume = 32| issue = 4| pages = 354–367| last = Hodgkins| first = Hope Howell| title = High Modernism for the Lowest: Children's Books by Woolf, Joyce, and Greene| journal = Children's Literature Association Quarterly| accessdate = 2016-05-17| date = 2007| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/232430503/abstract/96D42492A5FF4B7FPQ/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pluridialectal idiom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| issue = 2| pages = 343–374, 483, 487–488| last = Mihálycsa| first = Erika| title = "Writing to the self-accompaniment of a tongue that is not mine": The Figure of Translation in Beckett's Work| journal = HJEAS : Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies| accessdate = 2016-05-17| date = 2013| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1664902206/citation/96D42492A5FF4B7FPQ/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ludic creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| pages = 35–44| last = Cronin| first = Michael| title = After Bellsybabble: Transformation, Invention, and Resistance in Translation| journal = Parallèles| date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}}

== Significance ==
For [[Giorgio Melchiori]], it is suggestive of the idea that in [[literary text]]s, there is not a single language, but a multitude of languages, a different one for each reader of the text.&lt;ref name="Melchiori1988"/&gt;{{rp|16}} It has been compared with the language of Joyce's novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Emory University| last = Ferris| first = Kathleen Richard| title = James Joyce, Wandering Jew| location = United States -- Georgia| accessdate = 2016-05-17| date = 1989| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/303794530/abstract/CE031289D61944E4PQ/7|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also provided the inspiration for [[C. George Sandulescu]]'s study of ''Finnegans Wake'', entitled ''The Language of the Devil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = C. Smythe| isbn = 978-0-8023-1284-6| last = Sandulescu| first = Constantin-George| title = The language of the Devil : texture and archetype in Finnegans wake| location = Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire| date = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}}

Linguist [[John Haiman (linguist)|John Haiman]] compares Bellsybabble to ordinary [[language]] in the way it continually shapes, and is in turn shaped by, the utterances spoken within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-511524-6| last = Haiman| first = John| title = Talk is cheap : sarcasm, alienation, and the evolution of language| location = Oxford| date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}} This challenges the rigid [[Langue and parole|separation]] between [[Linguistic competence|code]] and [[linguistic performance|message]]. On one hand, the language determines the presupposed content and boundaries of possible messages, as shown by the concept of [[linguistic relativity]]. On the other hand, the message may also affect the code used by that very message.&lt;ref&gt;In English, this can happen in sentences of the type "A is B", where "A" differs from "B" in person or number. Here the grammatical pattern that requires a verb to [[Grammatical agreement|agree]] with its subject can give way, allowing agreement with whatever is asserted to be identical to the subject. Thus in the sentence "[[Our Father]], who ''are'' in heaven," it is only the use of "Our Father" as a term of address that allows the verb "are" to be in the second person. (Haiman 1998, p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from the [[Benetton family]], who founded the company in 1965. Benetton has a network of about 5,000 stores in the main international markets.&lt;ref name="About Benetton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benettongroup.com/group/profile/glance |title=At a glance |publisher=Benetton Group |accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

[[File:UCB King Peter's street.jpg|thumb|United Colors of Benetton in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]]]

In 1963, [[Luciano Benetton]], the oldest of four children, was a 30-year-old salesman in Treviso. His initial small collection of sweaters received a positive response in local stores in the [[Veneto]] region, and soon after he asked his sister and two younger brothers, Gilberto and Carlo, to join him. In 1965, the entity known as the "Benetton Group" was formed.&lt;ref name="Timeline of the Benetton Group"&gt;[http://www.benettongroup.com/group/profile/group-history Timeline of the Benetton Group] Benetton Group Official Webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Benettons opened their first store in [[Belluno]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=aU_fBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=Luciano+Benetton&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Luciano%20Benetton&amp;f=false|title=Essentials of International Marketing|last=Brady|first=Donald L.|date=2014-12-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317471202|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three years after in [[Paris]], with Luciano as chairman, his brother Gilberto in charge of administration, their younger brother Carlo running production, and Giuliana as a chief designer.

===Brands===
The company's core business remains their clothing lines: United Colors of Benetton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benetton.com|title=United Colors of Benetton|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sisley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sisley.com |title=Sisley |publisher=Sisley |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Group has a network of about 5,000 stores around the world.&lt;ref name="About Benetton"/&gt;

==Marketing==
The company is known for sponsorship of a number of sports, and for the provocative and original "United Colors" publicity campaign. The latter originated when [[photographer]] [[Oliviero Toscani]] was given ''[[Full Powers|carte blanche]]'' by the Benetton management. Under Toscani's direction, ads were created that contained striking images unrelated to any actual products being sold by the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Up to 1982, Benetton marketing campaigns relied on traditional models wearing the brand clothing. In 1982, the company decided to change its advertising campaigns by focusing on world issues to raise awareness and create an added value for the brand. In 1984, Oliviero Toscani photographed the first multiracial ad for the brand.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

These graphic, billboard-sized ads included depictions of a variety of shocking subjects, one of which featured a deathbed scene of a man ([[AIDS]] activist [[David Kirby (activist)|David Kirby]]) dying from AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/45701/the-photo-that-brought-aids-home|title=The Photo That Brought AIDS Home|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included a bloodied, unwashed newborn baby with umbilical cord still attached, which was highly controversial. This 1991 advert prompted more than 800 complaints to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|British Advertising Standards Authority]] during 1991 and was featured in the reference book ''[[Guinness World Records]] 2000'' as 'Most Controversial Campaign'. Others included a black stallion [[mating|covering]] a white mare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irenecano.wordpress.com/2008/12/11/el-caso-de-benetton/|title=El caso de Benetton|work=PERIODISMO DE MARCA|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; close-up pictures of tattoos reading "[[HIV]] Positive" on the bodies of men and women, a cemetery of many cross-like tombstones, a collage consisting of genitals of persons of various races, a priest and nun about to engage in a romantic kiss, pictures of inmates on [[death row]], an electric chair, an advert showing a [[Dark skin|dark-skinned]] boy with hair shaped into the devil's horns, three different hearts with "black", "white" and "yellow" written onto them (from March 1996), and a picture of a bloodied T-shirt and pants riddled with bullet holes from a soldier killed in the [[Bosnian War]] (appeared in February 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.benettongroup.com/ben_en/about/campaigns/list/bosnian_soldier/?t=print|title=Benetton-Bosnian Soldier Home|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the advertisements, although not all, had a plain white background, and in most the company's logo served as the only text accompanying the image.

===2011 marketing campaign===
In autumn 2011, Benetton launched its new worldwide communication campaign, an invitation to the leaders and citizens of the world to combat the "culture of hatred", and created the UNHATE Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unhatefoundation.org |title=UNHATE Foundation |publisher=UNHATE Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was created as the group's corporate social responsibility strategy and not as a cosmetic exercise.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unhate.benetton.com/foundation/ |title=The Foundation &amp;#124; Unhate Foundation |publisher=Unhate.benetton.com |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Benetton Group “seeks to contribute to the creation of a new culture against hate”.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; Benetton's [[Fabrica research centre]] partnered up with 72andSunny to create the UNHATE poster series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/2011/november/benetton-unhate |title=2011 |publisher=Creative Review |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benetton “These are symbolic images of reconciliation—with a touch of ironic hope and constructive provocation—to stimulate reflection on how politics, faith and ideas, even when they are divergent and mutually opposed, must still lead to dialogue and mediation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mail Foreign Service |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2062423/Benetton-Unhate-advert-Pope-kissing-imam-withdrawn-Vatican-calls-disrespectful.html |title=Benetton 'Unhate' advert of Pope kissing imam withdrawn after Vatican calls it 'disrespectful' &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2012-06-28 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 72andSunny adds “United Colors of Benetton returns to the cultural conversation with a simple and powerful message of tolerance: UNHATE. Hate and love are often in a delicate and unstable balance. This campaign promotes a shift in the balance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.72andsunny.com/ |title=72andSunny |publisher=72andSunny |date=2011-04-07 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these posters of the lip-locking political and religious figures have sparked controversy. In addition, Benetton released an advertisement that displayed President [[Barack Obama]] of the [[United States]] and President [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]] kissing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/id/45326469&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2011, [[Holy See|The Vatican]] announced that it would take legal action against Benetton after the company used a photo purportedly showing [[Pope Benedict XVI]] kissing [[Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb|Ahmed Mohamed el Tayeb]], the imam of the [[Al Azhar]] mosque in [[Egypt]]. Benetton responded: "We reiterate that the meaning of this campaign is exclusively to combat the culture of hatred in all its forms," said a Benetton Group spokesman. "We are therefore sorry that the use of the image of the Pope and the Imam has so offended the sentiments of the faithful. In corroboration of our intentions, we have decided, with immediate effect, to withdraw this image from every publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benettongroup.com/archive/press-release/press-note |title=Benetton Press Note |publisher=Benettongroup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, UCB launched a campaign in collaboration with Devbhumi, a registered company owned by rural women from remote villages in Uttarakhand state of India. The initiative claims to empower over 6,000 rural women artisans across India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fashion-/-cosmetics-/-jewellery/fashion-brand-aims-to-empower-over-6000-women-weavers/articleshow/61629440.cms|title=Fashion brand aims to empower over 6,000 women weavers|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport and sponsorship==
{{main|Benetton Formula|Benetton Rugby|Treviso Basket|Sisley Volley}}

Benetton Group entered [[Formula One]] as a sponsor of [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] in {{f1|1983}}, then [[Alfa Romeo (Formula One)|Alfa Romeo]] in {{f1|1984}}; this arrangement was extended to both Alfa and [[Toleman]] in {{f1|1985}}. [[Benetton Formula]] Ltd. was formed at the end of 1985 when the Toleman and [[Spirit (racing team)|Spirit]] teams were sold to the Benetton family. The team saw its greatest success under [[Flavio Briatore]], who managed the team from {{f1|1990}} to {{f1|1997}}. [[Michael Schumacher]] won his first [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championships]] with the team in {{f1|1994}} and {{f1|1995}}, and the team won their only [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' title]] in 1995. From {{f1|1996}}, the team raced under an Italian licence although it continued to be based, like Toleman, in [[Oxfordshire]] in England. The team was bought by [[Renault]] for US$120 million in {{f1|2000}} and was rebranded [[Renault F1]] in 2002.

In 1979, Benetton first sponsored their (then amateur) local rugby team, A.S. Rugby Treviso. [[Benetton Rugby]] has since become a major force in Italian rugby, with 11 league titles and supplying many players to the national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benettonrugby.it/105_0/default.ashx|title=Benetton Rugby - Storia|accessdate=2008-04-07|language=it|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414205150/http://www.benettonrugby.it/105_0/default.ashx|archivedate=2008-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benetton Group has also sponsored [[Treviso Basket]] (1982–2012) and [[Sisley Volley]] (1987–2012).

==Criticisms==
Benetton has faced criticism from [[Mapuche]] organizations over its purchase of traditional Mapuche lands in [[Patagonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapuche-nation.org/english/main/benetton/main/info.htm |title=The Invisible Colours of Benetton - Campaign|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Curiñanco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton's claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santarosarecuperada.com.ar/english/index.html |title=Recovered Mapuche territory in Patagonia: Benetton vs. Mapuche |publisher=MAPU Association |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908191814/http://www.santarosarecuperada.com.ar/english/index.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company have published a position statement regarding the Mapuche in Patagonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625071312/http://www.benettongroup.com/media-press/company-position-statements|archivedate=25 June 2012|url=http://www.benettongroup.com/media-press/company-position-statements|title=Benetton’s position regarding the Mapuche in Patagonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benetton aroused suspicion when they considered using [[RFID]] tracking chips on clothes to monitor inventory. A boycott site alleges the tracking chips "can be read from a distance and used to monitor the people wearing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boycottbenetton.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309222351/http://www.boycottbenetton.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-03-09|title=Boycott Benetton|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of consumer privacy were raised and the plan was shelved.

[[PETA]] launched a boycott campaign against Benetton for buying wool from farmers who practiced [[mulesing]].  Benetton has since agreed to buy nonmulesed wool and has further urged the wool industry to adopt the PETA and Australian Wool Growers Association agreement to end mulesing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethesheep.com/f-benettonvictory.asp|title=Campaign ends|publisher=PETA Save the Sheep! campaign|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benetton's position statement on the mulesing controversy is available on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benettongroup.com/media-press/company-position-statements|title=Benetton’s position regarding the controversy on mulesing between the Australian Wool Industry and PETA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BioArt''' is an [[art]] [[practice (social theory)|practice]] where humans work with live tissues, [[Microbial art|bacteria]], living organisms, and life processes. Using scientific processes such as [[biotechnology]] (including technologies such as [[genetic engineering]], [[tissue culture]], and [[cloning]]) the artworks are produced in laboratories, galleries, or [[artist]]s' [[studio]]s. The scope of BioArt is considered by some artists to be strictly limited to "living forms", while other artists would include art that uses the imagery of contemporary medicine and biological research, or require that it address a controversy or blind spot posed by the very character of the life sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pentecost | first=Claire |editor-first=da Costa| editor-last=Beatrice |title=Tactical Biopolitics: Art, Activism and Technoscience |publisher=The MIT Press |pages=110 |chapter=Outfitting the Laboratory of the Symbolic: Toward a Critical Inventory of Bioart |isbn=978-0-262-04249-9| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although BioArtists work with living matter, there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about [[ethical]], [[social]], and [[aesthetic]] inquiry.  The phrase "BioArt" was coined by [[Eduardo Kac]] in 1997 in relation to his artwork ''Time Capsule''. Although it originated at the end of the 20th century, through the works of pioneers like [[Joe Davis (artist)|Joe Davis]], [http://www.martademenezes.com Marta de Menezes] and the artists hosted by [[Symbiotica]], BioArt is more widely practiced now.

==Overview==
[[File:Self Portre Yin - Yang (BioArt).tif|thumb|Self Portre 1988 Yin - Yang (BioArt), playing on the parallels between image manipulation and cloning]]

BioArt is often intended to be shocking or humorous.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2017}} One survey of the field, ''Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing'', puts it this way: "BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: draw attention to the beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110212142541/http://www.emilyvoigt.com/isotope.html#content  The Art is Alive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While raising questions about the role of science in society, "most of these works tend toward social reflection, conveying political and societal criticism through the combination of artistic and scientific processes."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/ethics/2007-03-05-bio-art_N.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | first=Jessica M. | last=Pasko | title=Bio-artists use science to create art | date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most people who practice BioArt are categorized as artists in this new media, they can also be seen as scientists, since the actual medium within a work pertains to molecular structures, and so forth. Because of this dual-acceptance, the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard University invites anyone to submit works based on scientific or artistic value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioart.med.harvard.edu/bioart_introduction.html BIOart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020121935/http://bioart.med.harvard.edu/bioart_introduction.html |date=October 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can encourage anyone to submit work they strongly respond to.

==Exposing artists to laboratories==
The laboratory work can pose a challenge to the artist, at first, as the environment is often foreign to the artist. While some artists have prior scientific training, others must be trained to perform the procedures or work in tandem with scientists who can perform the tasks that are required.  Bio artists often use formations relating to or engaged with science and scientific practices, such as working with bacteria or live-tissue.

Much of the art involves tissue-culturing and transgenics, a term for a variety of genetic engineering processes through which genetic material from one organism is altered by the addition of synthesized or transplanted genetic material from another organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17387568/|title=Bio-artists bridge gap between arts, sciences|date=4 March 2007|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Eduardo Kac commissioned the creation of a transgenic [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] bunny as part of a piece called GFP Bunny. "The PR campaign included a picture of Kac holding a white rabbit and another, iconic image of a rabbit photographically enhanced to appear green."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pentecost | first=Claire |editor-first=da Costa| editor-last=Beatrice |title=Tactical Biopolitics: Art, Activism and Technoscience |publisher=The MIT Press |pages=107 |chapter=Outfitting the Laboratory of the Symbolic: Toward a Critical Inventory of Bioart |isbn=978-0-262-04249-9| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project in collaboration with [[Stelarc]] grew a 1/4 scale replica of an ear using human cells.  The project was carried out at [[Symbiotica]]: the Art &amp; Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology, [[University of Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html|title=Extra Ear ¼ Scale - The Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project in Collaboration with Stelarc|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art addressing topics in biology and society==
[[File:FPbeachTsien.jpg|thumb|It is debated whether BioArt must, like this work of [[microbial art]], be made with actual organisms. Artwork made with bacteria expressing 8 different colors of [[green fluorescent protein|fluorescent proteins]]]]

The scope of the term BioArt is a subject of ongoing debate. The primary point of debate centers around whether BioArt must necessarily involve manipulation of biological material, as is the case in [[microbial art]] which by definition is made of [[microorganism|microbes]]. A broader definition of the term would include work that addresses the social and ethical considerations of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See Bio Art entry in Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2007-2014. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these terms BioArt as a genre has many crossovers with fields such as critical or speculative design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anker |first1=Suzanne |title=The beginnings and the ends of Bio Art |url=http://www.suzanneanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-The-beginnings-and-the-ends-of-Bio-Art-Bio-Art-Life-in-the-Anthropocene-Artlink-Magazine.pdf |journal=Artlink |date=2014 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work often reaches a much broader general audience, and is focused on starting discussions in this space, rather than pioneering or even using specific biological practices. Examples in this space include Ray Fish shoes, which advertised shoes made and patterned with genetically engineered stingray skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextnature.net/2012/12/the-rise-and-fall-or-rayfish-footwear/|title=The Rise and Fall or Rayfish Footwear - Next Nature Network|date=19 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BiteLabs, a biotech startup that attempted to make salami out of meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-guy-who-want-to-sell-you-salami-made-out-of-james-franco-are-100-serious |title=The Guy Who Wants to Sell Lab-Grown Salami Made of Kanye West Is "100% Serious" |publisher=|date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
BioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics.  ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Alka Chandna, a senior researcher with [[PETA]] in Norfolk, Virginia, has stated that using animals for the sake of art is no different from using animal fur for clothing material. "Transgenic manipulation of animals is just a continuum of using animals for human end, regardless of whether it is done to make some sort of sociopolitical critique. The suffering and exacerbation of stress on the animals is very problematic."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

However, many BioArt projects deal with the manipulation of cells and not whole organisms, such as ''[[Victimless Leather]]'' by [[Symbiotica]]. "An actualized possibility of wearing 'leather' without killing an animal is offered as a starting point for cultural discussion. Our intention is not to provide yet another consumer product, but rather to raise questions about our exploitation of other living beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/vl.html|title=Victemless Leather|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book store shoplifting''' is a problem for book sellers and has sometimes led stores to keep certain volumes behind store counters.

[[Shoplifter]]s at [[book store]]s, also known as book shops, may be either amateur or professional thieves. Professionals target high-priced books and books that are easily resold, such as college textbooks.

In addition to shoplifting, thievery also has been due to pilfering by shipping personnel and burglary. Book stores also are victimized by thefts of merchandise and other items aside from books. At Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, someone attempted to steal a security camera. At the Boulder Bookshop in Boulder, Colorado, prints hung in the bathroom and plants have been stolen.&lt;ref name=mrstb&gt;Rabb, Margo, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/books/review/Rabb-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=review&amp;pagewanted=print "Steal These Books"], essay, ''The New York Times Book Review'', December 20, 2009, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns of independent book sellers==
Owners of small, independent book stores have said they find shoplifting particularly bothersome. According to Paul Constant, a Seattle book-store employee, "I know a few booksellers who have literally been driven a little bit crazy at the thought of their inventory evaporating out the door, and with good reason: An overabundance of shoplifters can put bookstores out of business. One local bookstore owner can famously talk about shoplifters with total strangers for hours, with the detail and passion that some people reserve for sexual conquests."&lt;ref name=pcfos&gt;Constant, Paul, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=520472 "Flying Off the Shelves: The Pleasures and Perils of Chasing Book Thieves"], ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', February 26, 2008, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shoplifting is a particular problem," said Patricia Van Osdol, owner of Wellington Books in Portland, Oregon. "It can be disastrous in a small store like this."&lt;ref&gt;Federman, Stan, "Book Shop Like Candy Store to Its Owner", article, ''The Oregonian'' of Portland, Oregon, April 9, 1992, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books frequently stolen==
According to several sources, in the United States certain books, or books by certain authors, are much more likely to be stolen than others, although there are no hard statistics on the subject.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;

Ron Rosenbaum, an author and ''[[New York Observer]]'' columnist, wrote in 1999 that [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] had a list of these authors whose books are the most frequently stolen from that book-store chain (or perhaps the [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] store in the chain, where his source, "a helpful clerk", worked): [[Martin Amis]], [[Paul Auster]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Jeanette Winterson]], but none more frequently than books by [[Charles Bukowski]].&lt;ref name=rrs&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron, [http://www.observer.com/node/42023 "Shoplift Lit: You Are What You Steal"], column, ''[[The New York Observer]]'', September 26, 1999, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=otmsb&gt;[http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2005/12/23/08 "Book Stealing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613075317/http://onthemedia.org/transcripts/2005/12/23/08 |date=2010-06-13 }}, segment transcript, ''[[On the Media]]'', December 23, 2005, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Constant gave this list, which he called "pretty much the authoritative top five, the New York Times best-seller list of stolen books": Bukowski, [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], [[Philip K. Dick]], and Burroughs, along with "any graphic novel". Constant wrote that other popular targets are books by Hunter S. Thompson and the Beats, [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Haruki Murakami]], and [[Mark Z. Danielewski]], and the most-stolen books tend to be a steady group with little variation over time.&lt;ref name=pcfos/&gt; As of late 2009, Danielewski's ''House of Leaves'' was the most frequently stolen book from Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, according to a store manager there.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]'' by [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] was the most-shoplifted book, according to a January 2008 article in ''The Telegraph''.&lt;ref name=mbjeel&gt;Brown, Mick, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3670336/Jeffrey-Eugenides-Enduring-love.html "Jeffrey Eugenides: Enduring love"], ''The Telegraph'', January 5, 2008, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Mark's Bookshop]] (which closed in 2016) in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] of Manhattan, like Barnes &amp; Noble, used to move frequently-stolen titles behind the counter. At that bookstore, as of late 2009, the books behind the counter included works by Amis, Bukowski, Burroughs, Raymond Carver, Don DeLillo and Jack Kerouac. Sometimes the staff moves books back to the shelves with the idea that a book's popularity for theft may lessen over time. "Amis went out and came right back," a store manager told a writer for ''The New York Times.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;

According to Rosenbaum, "[I]f you look at who's actually doing the shoplifting, they're not really down-and-out, lower-depths types but like to pose as being down and out, and shoplifting is part of the aura."&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt; Constant wrote, "[F]iction that young white men read, and self-satisfied young white men, the kind who love to ''stick it to [[The Man|the man]]'', are the majority of book shoplifters."&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;&lt;ref name=pcfos/&gt;

===In comparison with books stolen from public libraries===
{{Main|Library theft}}
Public libraries have a much different set of frequently stolen books. In the United States, how-to books are more often the targets of thieves, as are books about witchcraft, the occult, UFOs or astrology, according to Larra Clark, a spokeswoman for the American Library Association, who asked members which books were most often stolen. Of the 70 libraries across the United States who responded to her query in 2001, none mentioned books by [[Charles Bukowski]]. An official from a [[prison library]] responded that dictionaries and poetry were the most frequently stolen types of books at that institution.&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt;

==Theft by professionals==
According to Tom Cushman, a New York book-store manager interviewed in 2005, factors influencing book thefts included high resale value and whether or not the book was displayed in an area difficult for the store clerks to watch. When [[Harry Potter]] books were new and popular items in book stores, they were among the top targets of thieves, he said.&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt;

Brian Zimmerman, associate general manager at the San Francisco State University book store, said thieves there were much more likely to be students, but professional thieves took more books and targeted volumes with higher prices.&lt;ref name=nc&gt;Codd, Nathan, [http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/news/013510.html "Theft an ongoing issue for bookstore"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701172234/http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/news/013510.html# |date=2010-07-01 }}, ''SFXpress'', September 16, 2009, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thieves have been known to take whole stacks of books at once.&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt; According to a 1991 article in ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'',
studies showed that the "casual thief", defined as "not a professional but more than a one-timer", accounted for 70 to 75 percent of shoplifting.&lt;ref name=crpcbbs&gt;Romano, Carlin, "The Problem of Catching and Booking the Book Shoplifters", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', June 26, 1991, retrieved via Newsbank.com, December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that thieves were so brazen in New York City that just outside St. Mark's Bookshop, "sidewalk peddlers openly ply books – many of them still bearing St. Mark's telltale stamp – at half off the prices inside the store.''&lt;ref&gt;Rivenburg, Roy, "Thieves Rip Off Book Stores in Growing Volume", ''Buffalo News'', "Lifestyles" section, p E1 (story reprinted from ''The Los Angeles Times''), October 25, 1992; retrieved via Newsbank website, December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, book store owners in New York and California accused second-hand book stores of organizing theft rings to shoplift titles for resale. Drama Book Shop in Manhattan lost 533 books with a total sales price of $10,873 from January 1 to May 8, 1991. One thief told store officials that a ring organized by a second-hand store had been assigned to steal books from the Drama Book Shop, according to Rozanne Seelan, co-owner of the victimized store.&lt;ref name=crpcbbs/&gt;

==Countermeasures==
Book stores at San Francisco State University and City College of San Francisco train their employees who are examining books being returned or sold to the stores to look for price tag stickers, books that don't seem to have been used, and anyone offering to sell multiple copies of a single title. When store employees approach customers to ask whether they need help, they also discourage theft, according to Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

==Reactions of authors==
Jeffrey Eugenides and Paul Auster both laughed when journalists asked them about being some of the authors whose books are most shoplifted. "It's one of those things authors argue about" among themselves, Eugenides said, adding that he and Auster had discussed their status as authors of frequently stolen books.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mbjeel/&gt;

[[Abbie Hoffman]] wrote ''[[Steal This Book]]'' in 1970 and published in 1971. While largely about rebelling against authority, it includes a section on shoplifting.

'''Thompson's Opera House''', also known as '''Brown's Hall''', '''Brown's Opera House''' or the '''Gem Theater''', is a small theater building in [[Pioche, Nevada]]. The Opera House is a wood frame building built in 1873, attached roughly to the adjoining brick Gem Theater, a 1937 masonry [[Movie theater|cinema]].&lt;ref name="bldgsnv1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicoletta|first=Julie|title=Buildings of Nevada|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|page=254|chapter=Pioche|isbn=0-19-514139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opera House was used as a community meeting house, dance hall and theater. The theater was built by Aleck Brown in September 1873 and featured a performance of ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' for its opening night, with a cast of professional actors from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The Opera House was purchased in 1891 by Alexander S. Thompson of Pioche.  Thompson renovated the floor and enlarged the stage. After Thompson's death in 1905 his sons Charles and Frank took over, remodeling in 1907. The Opera House screened its first [[silent movie]] in 1915.  In 1935 the Opera House was renamed the Gem Theater after Frank Thompson took over sole management, but in 1937 he built a new Gem Theater next door expressly for movies. The Opera House declined from that point.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=84002074}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Brown's Hall/Thompson's Opera House|last=Christian|first=Mary Louise|author2=Werber, Diane|date=September 23, 1983|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two story rectangular building shows elements of the [[Greek Revival]] style with its shallow front gable/pediment. It originally featured a one-story porch across the width of the facade with a balustrade above, removed but now restored. The front is covered with clapboards while the side and rear are sheathed in board and batten siding. The structure is framed with heavy timber in a post-and-beam arrangement. The ground floor housed commercial space and dressing rooms. The main hall is on the second floor, entered by steep stairs from the street. A shed-roofed addition to the rear is built into the hillside and houses the stage at the second floor level.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

The Opera House was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; It is one of three 19th century theaters remaining in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

[[File:Caravanserai of Qalat el-Mudiq 01.jpg|thumb|upright 2.2|Caravanserai of [[Qalaat al-Madiq]], in northern Syria]]

A '''caravanserai''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ær|ə|ˈ|v|æ|n|s|ə|ˌ|r|aɪ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/caravanserai?s=t|accessdate=31 Jan 2016|title=Dictionary.com – caravansary}})&lt;/ref&gt; was a roadside [[Pub#Inns|inn]] where travelers ([[caravan (travellers)|caravaners]]) could rest and recover from the day's journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Caravanserai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information and people across the network of [[trade route]]s covering Asia, [[North Africa]] and [[Southeast Europe]], especially along the [[Silk Road]].

These were found frequently along the [[Achaemenid Empire]]'s [[Royal Road]], a {{convert|2500|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} ancient highway that stretched from [[Sardis]] to [[Susa]] according to [[Herodotus]]: "Now the true account of the road in question is the following: Royal stations exist along its whole length, and excellent caravanserais; and throughout, it traverses an inhabited tract, and is free from danger."&lt;ref&gt;"The History - Herodotus" - http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Major urban caravanserais were also built along the [[Grand Trunk Road]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], especially in the region of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Delhi]].

==Etymology==
===Caravanserai===
[[File:Izadkhvast Caravanserai 01.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Izadkhvast]] caravanserai, [[Fars Province]], [[Iran]]]]
The word is also rendered as ''caravansary'', ''caravansaray'', ''caravanseray'' and ''caravansara''. The [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|کاروانسرای}} ''kārvānsarāy'' is a compound word combining ''kārvān'' "[[caravan (travellers)|caravan]]" with ''sarāy'' "palace", "building with enclosed courts", to which the Persian suffix ''-yi'' is added. Here "caravan" means a group of traders, pilgrims or other travellers, engaged in long distance travel. The word ''serai'' is sometimes used with the implication of caravanserai.

A number of place-names based on the word ''sarai'' have grown up: [[Mughal Serai]], [[Sarai Alamgir]] and the [[Delhi Sarai Rohilla railway station]] for example, and a great many [[Sarai (disambiguation)|other places]] are also based on the original meaning of "palace".

===Khan===
[[File:18 Chardin Caravanseray in Kashan.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Illustration of a caravanserai in [[Kashan]], [[Iran]] by [[Jean Chardin]] in 1723]]
The Persian caravanserai was built as a large road station, outside of towns. An inn built inside a town would be smaller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316248/khan|title=Khan - architecture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was known in Persian as a ''khan'' ({{lang|fa|خان}}) (from Middle Persian hʾn' (xān, “house”)). In the Middle-East the term "khan" covers both meanings, of roadside inn as well as of inner-town inn. In Turkish the word is rendered as ''han''. The same word was used in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], having arrived through [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman conquest]]. The Greek ''pandocheion'', lit.: "welcoming all",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3829.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 3829. πανδοχεῖον (pandocheion) -- an inn|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus meaning 'inn', led to ''[[funduq]]'' in Arabic ({{lang|ar|فندق}}), ''pundak'' in Hebrew (פונדק), ''[[fundaco]]'' in Venice, ''[[fondaco]]'' in Genoa and ''[[alhóndiga (disambiguation)|alhóndiga]]''&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=alh%C3%B3ndiga|title=alhóndiga in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Spanish.

== Caravanserai in Arab literature ==
[[Al-Muqaddasi]] the Arab geographer wrote in 985 CE about the hostelries, or wayfarers' inns, in the Province of Palestine, a province at that time listed under the topography of Syria, saying: "Taxes are not heavy in Syria, with the exception of those levied on the Caravanserais (''Fanduk''); Here, however, the duties are oppressive..."&lt;ref&gt;Mukaddasi, ''Description of Syria, Including Palestine'', ed. Guy Le Strange, London 1886, pp. 91, 37&lt;/ref&gt; The reference here being to the imposts and duties charged by government officials on the importation of goods and merchandise, the importers of which and their beasts of burden usually stopping to take rest in these places. Guards were stationed at every gate to ensure that taxes for these goods be paid in full, while the revenues therefrom accruing to the Fatimid kingdom of Egypt.

==Architecture==
[[File:Carvansara plan.png|thumb|upright|A sample [[floor plan]] of a [[Safavid Empire]]-era caravanserai]]
Most typically a caravanserai was a building with a square or rectangular walled exterior, with a single portal wide enough to permit large or heavily laden beasts such as [[camel]]s to enter. The courtyard was almost always open to the sky, and the inside walls of the enclosure were outfitted with a number of identical [[animal stall]]s, bays, niches or chambers to accommodate merchants and their servants, animals, and merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, Eleanor. 1978. Trade and Travel: Markets and Caravansary.' In: Michell, George. (ed.). 1978. ''Architecture of the Islamic World - Its History and Social Meaning.'' London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravanserais provided water for human and animal consumption, washing and [[ritual purification]] such as [[wudu]] and [[ghusl]]. Sometimes they had elaborate baths. They also kept [[fodder]] for animals and had shops for travellers where they could acquire new supplies. In addition, some shops bought goods from the travelling merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Ciolek, T. Matthew. 2004-present. [http://www.ciolek.com/OWTRAD/caravanserais-catalogue-00.html Catalogue of Georeferenced Caravansaras/Khans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207084049/http://www.ciolek.com/OWTRAD/caravanserais-catalogue-00.html |date=2005-02-07 }}. Old World Trade Routes (OWTRAD) Project. Canberra: www.ciolek.com - Asia Pacific Research Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multani Caravanserai]], which was established in the 14th century in Azerbaijan and now houses a restaurant, was constructed in a square shape. It has very ancient style with balconies around the courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advantour.com/azerbaijan/baku/multani-caravanserai.htm|title=Multani caravanserai on the Silk Road|website=www.advantour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carbuncle Awards''' are [[architecture]] prizes, given by the Scottish magazine ''[[Urban Realm]]'', formerly ''Prospect'', presented to buildings and areas in Scotland intermittently since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles |title=Carbuncles |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were established following a discussion about why policy initiatives to improve the quality of the built environment seemed to be having so little impact beyond the centres of Scotland’s key cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles/2005/The_Carbuncle_Awards_2005.html |title=The Carbuncle Awards 2005 |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the awards is derived from a comment by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]'s proposed extension of London's [[National Gallery]] as a "monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration|title=Life after carbuncles|first=Jonathan|last=Glancey|date=17 May 2004|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|title=A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace|accessdate=2014-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three award categories:
*Plook on the Plinth Award "for the most dismal town in Scotland". A "plook" is a Scottish noun for [[pimple]].
*The Pock Mark Award "for the worst planning decision".
*The Zit Building Award "for the worst building completed since the last awards".

Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners.

[[Cumbernauld]] in [[Lanarkshire]] has won the Plook on the Plinth Award twice and is the town most frequently nominated for the award.

The Carbuncle Awards inspired the [[Carbuncle Cup]], another [[architecture]] prize launched in 2006 and given annually by ''[[Building Design]]'' magazine to "the ugliest building in the [[United Kingdom]] completed in the last 12 months."&lt;ref name=bd2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/six-in-race-for-carbuncle-cup/5003099.article |title=Six in race for Carbuncle Cup |date=22 July 2010 |author=Watson, Anna |work=bdonline.co.uk |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has gone on to achieve somewhat greater prominence in the media.

:''For the other theatre known by this name, see [[Chatham Garden Theatre]].''

The '''Chatham Theatre''' or '''Chatham Street Theatre''' was a [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]] on the southeast side of Chatham Street (now [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]]) in [[New York City]]. It was located at numbers 143-9, between Roosevelt and James streets, a few blocks south of the [[Bowery, Manhattan|Bowery]].&lt;ref&gt;Perris&lt;/ref&gt; At its opening in 1839, the Chatham was a neighborhood establishment, which featured big-name actors and drama. By the mid-1840s, it had become primarily a venue for [[blackface]] [[minstrel show]]s. [[Frank S. Chanfrau]] restored some of its grandeur in 1848.

The playhouse's most successful period was under the management of A. H. Purdy. He staged productions of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' beginning in 1852, the success of which prompted him to advertise heavily and to create a special section where  [[African American]] patrons could sit. Following Purdy's departure in 1857, the theatre entered its final decline. It flip-flopped many times between a standard [[melodrama]] house and a concert [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] before finally being demolished in 1862.

==Early management==

[[Thomas Flynn (actor)|Thomas Flynn]] and [[Henry Willard]] financed the construction of the Chatham Theatre in 1839. Under Flynn's management, the playhouse opened on 11 September 1839 with a production of ''[[A New Way to Pay Old Debts]]'' starring [[John R. Scott]] and [[Mrs. Thomas Flynn]]. It was essentially a neighborhood theatre at this time,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 60&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of the [[Panic of 1837]] were still being felt, so the establishment lost money. Nevertheless, Flynn and Willard kept it open for another year, staging [[comedy|comedies]] and [[drama]]s that starred popular actors, including James Anderson, [[William Rufus Blake]], [[Junius Brutus Booth]], and [[Mademoiselle Celeste]]. The theatre finally closed in January 1840 due to differences between the two owners.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 297&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles R. Thorne]] bought Willard's stake and joined Flynn as manager for two weeks in February 1840. Still, the theatre saw little success. Thorne then bought out Flynn's stake for $500.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 297&lt;/ref&gt; As sole manager, Flynn led the playhouse to a profitable four years, featuring popular talents such as [[James S. Browne]], [[Mary Duff]], [[Edwin Forrest]], [[Thomas D. Rice]], [[John Sefton]], [[Henry Wallack]], and Bill Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 287-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, Thorne sold the theatre to his [[stage manager]], a Mr. Stevens, and to [[A. W. Jackson]], who managed for one season. During this time, the theatre was mainly a [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrel]] house. On 8 April 1845, [[Ben De Bar]] became stage manager, but he soon partnered with [[William S. Deverna]] to lease the building. De Bar ceased active management on 5 October. [[M. S. Phillips]] was the next lessee, followed by [[J. Fletcher]], who bought the theatre in 1847.

By this time, the Chatham Theatre was performing poorly. It became a [[circus]] for a time before eventually reopening as a playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 301&lt;/ref&gt; Admissions were low for the time: 25¢ for the boxes, one shilling for the pit, and six pence for the gallery. The audience now consisted of the [[Working class|lower classes]], who on holidays "used to talk, shout, and scream so that the actors went through their parts in dumb show . . . ."&lt;ref&gt;Brown 301&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank S. Chanfrau]] and [[W. Olgivie Ewen]] became joint lessees on 28 February 1848 with Chanfrau as manager. They renamed the building '''Chanfrau's National Theatre''' and tried to reclaim some of the theatre's lost prestige. This lasted until 8 July 1850.

==Purdy's tenure==

[[A. H. Purdy]] took over operations in 1850 for what would prove the theatre's most successful period. He renamed the building '''Purdy's National Theatre'''. He renovated in April 1852, reopening on 19 April. On 23 August 1852, Purdy produced the first non-comedic stage adaptation of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' in the United States. This version, written by [[Charles Western Taylor]], ran for 11 nights but saw little success.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 314&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the 1853 season was devoted to a much more successful dramatization of Stowe's novel. The production ran almost non-stop from 18 July 1853 to 19 April 1854, when performances were cut back to three nights weekly until 13 May. The play proved so popular with [[African American]] audiences that Purdy created a special black-only section of the theatre on 15 August. No unaccompanied women were allowed there, and the entrance was separate from the main doors. Purdy expanded the section on 29 October.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 312&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the great success of the ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' production, Purdy still lost money from [[advertising]] too heavily and by splurging on too many gifts for [[Cordelia Howard]], the young actress who was starring in the drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 314&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this one overzealous blunder, Purdy had a flair for advertising. On 1 September 1856, he began his sixth season at the Chatham by erecting a statue of [[George Washington]] atop the playhouse while the [[New York Brass Band]] played and fireworks were launched. Purdy left during the [[Panic of 1857]].

==Later management==

The theatre then entered a long period of decline.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 60&lt;/ref&gt; The new owners redecorated before the 1858-9 season. Early on 10 July 1859, part of the theatre caught fire, apparently from gunfire [[special effects]] from the play the night before; the building suffered $500 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 335&lt;/ref&gt; The building was remodeled once again in November 1859 and reopened on 14 November as the '''Chatham Amphitheatre'''. Circuses provided the main attraction.

On 6 March 1860, [[J. Howard Rogers]] and [[Joseph C. Foster]] leased the building. They opened on 8 March as the '''National Concert Saloon'''. The emphasis now was on [[alcoholic beverages]] served by attractive waitresses.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 336&lt;/ref&gt; Admission prices were 12¢ for boxes and 6¢ for the pit.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 336&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July, [[Charles J. Waters]] took over management and reopened as the '''National Theatre''', a standard [[melodrama]] playhouse. [[George Beane]] replaced Waters on 6 October and restored the concert saloon theme. This lasted until December, when he gave it over to a [[German people|German]] troupe.

Fox and Curran took over in 1861. They spent a great deal of money to restore the theatre, then reopened on 16 November as the '''National Music Hall'''. They failed to turn a profit, and George Lea, manager of the [[Melodeon (New York)|Melodeon]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Hooley's Theatre]] in [[Brooklyn]] gained control in December. He made the most of his three establishments by using the same actors at all three venues. They would first perform at the Melodeon, then travel to the Chatham, to finish up the night at Hooley's.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 337&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1862, the Chatham Theater was demolished. Part of it survived and was rented to shopkeepers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3791">'''''Cín Dromma Snechtai''''' or '''''Lebor Dromma Snechtai''''' ("book of Druimm Snechta") is a now lost early Irish manuscript., thought to have been written in the 8th century AD.

==Name==
[[Old Irish]] ''cín'', derived from the Latin ''quinio'' "five", was a small book made of five folded [[vellum]] leaves; ''lebor'', modern Irish ''leabhar'', is the standard word for a book.&lt;ref&gt;Dáibhí Ó Cróinín, ''Early Medieval Ireland'', Longman, 1995, pp. 172-173&lt;/ref&gt; It is "named from the place of its origin or preservation, namely Druim(m) Snechta (Drumsnat, [[County Monaghan]]), where a monastery had been founded in the sixth century."&lt;ref&gt;Thomás Ó Concheanainn, "A Connacht Medieval Literary Heritage: Texts derived from ''Cín Dromma Snechtai'' through ''Lebor na hUidre''",  ''Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies'' 16, Winter 1988, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
[[Geoffrey Keating]] was aware of the book, although he does not seem to have had access to it himself in compiling his ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'',&lt;ref name=koch&gt;John T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'', ABC-Clio, 2006, pp. 437-438&lt;/ref&gt; and believed it dated to before the arrival of [[Saint Patrick]].&lt;ref&gt;David Comyn and Patrick S. Dinneen (eds.), ''The History of Ireland by Geoffrey Keating, D.D.'', Vol. 1, 1902, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century scholar [[Eugene O'Curry]] found a marginal note in the [[Book of Leinster]], partly illegible, which said that the ''Cín'' was compiled by a son of Dauí, king of Connacht. O'Curry favoured Ernín, son of Dauí Galach, a nephew of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]] and a contemporary of Patrick, but allowed that it may have been a son of [[Dauí Tenga Uma]], a king of Connacht who died at the end of the fifth century&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene O'Curry]], ''Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish History'', Dublin: James Duffy, 1861, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Francis J. Byrne]] believes the two kings were in fact the same person).&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis J. Byrne]], ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'', Four Courts Press, second edition, 2001, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Thurneysen]], who made a convincing reconstruction of its contents in 1912-13, proposed a date in the early 8th century for the writing of the book. Other scholars have proposed dates in the 9th or 10th century, although these are disputed. It is cited as a source by many of the most important early Irish manuscripts, including ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'', the Book of Leinster, the [[Book of Ballymote]], the [[Great Book of Lecan]], and the MS Egerton 88.&lt;ref name=koch /&gt;

Texts believed to originate from the ''Cín Dromma Snechtai'' are notable for their archaic language, and include:&lt;ref name=koch /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Carney, "Language and Literature to 1169", in Dáibhí Ó Cróinín, ''A New History of Ireland Vol 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 451-510&lt;/ref&gt;

It was directed by [[Roger Coleman (professor)|Roger Coleman]] until 1999 when it was merged into the newly created [[Helen Hamlyn Research Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/designage/index.html|title=DesignAge|publisher=The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AARL&gt;{{cite web|title=Age &amp; Ability Research Lab – History|url=http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/290/all/1/history.aspx|publisher=Helen Hamlyn Research Centre|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RaisingOurGame&gt;[http://www.designweek.co.uk/raising-our-game/3012575.article "Raising Our Game"]. ''Design Week''. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The programme was the recipient of the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize|Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education]] in 1994 in the category of “the Arts”.&lt;ref name="Queen"/&gt;

==History==
By the early 1990s, it was recognized that older adults, in particular adults over 50, were becoming an increasingly significant portion of the population, while improvements in nutrition and medicine were enabling these older adults to remain active. This demographic shift was thought to be permanent.
However, the fact that the younger population represented a shrinking market and older population a growing one was largely ignored by the design profession. In response to the lack of understanding of these issues and the design community’s lack of understanding of their implications, in 1991 DesignAge was founded to investigate the needs of the older population, to interpret the results of the research in a way relevant to designers and industry, and to develop new methodologies in design and design education in response to this demographic shift.&lt;ref name="RSA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutDA&gt;{{cite web|title=About DesignAge |url=http://designage.rca.ac.uk/DA/aboutDA.html |publisher=DesignAge |accessdate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000819052351/http://designage.rca.ac.uk/da/aboutDA.html |archivedate=August 19, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DesignAge argued that older adults were [[Social model of disability|“rendered disabled” by]] public spaces and transportation systems that had not been designed for this segment of the population, and therefore design had an influential role to play in shaping the future, in that improvements of the life for older adults, as well as the job market and national economy could be realized if designers, manufacturers, and retailers could shift their attitudes towards aging so as to collaborate to create age-friendly products and services. By pointing out that designing for the aging population was designing for their own aging, effectively reframing aging as an issue of self-interest, DesignAge was able to engage younger designers to design for older people.&lt;ref name=DesignResearchForOurFutureSelves&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Roger|title=Design Research for Our Future Selves|url=http://researchonline.rca.ac.uk/404/1/coleman_design_research_for_our_future_selves_1994.pdf|publisher=Royal College of Art|year=1994|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, R.; Clarkson, J.; Dong, H.; Cassim, J. (2007). ''Design for Inclusivity''. Ashgate Publishing Company. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways that DesignAge used to engage design students was to hold an annual design competition, called the DesignAge Competition, held between 1992 and 1998, to challenge design students to design for their “future selves.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/cp/competition/desage.html "The DesignAge Competition".] The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

DesignAge also engaged the industry at large by approaching the [[Design Business Association]] (formed in 1986 by the [[Chartered Society of Designers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.org.uk/index.aspx?id=42 "Key Dates in CSD History"]. Chartered Society of Designers. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) and suggesting a “product challenge” to their member agencies; these were small-scale&lt;ref&gt;Cassim, Julia (April 2008).

Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; events where they would work with older users to design products on a speculative basis for the aging population.&lt;ref name="RaisingOurGame"/&gt;

In 1999 DesignAge became the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre and extended into the research of Inclusive Design.

==Selected publications==
DesignAge produced a number of publications, including the seminal ''Designing For Our Future Selves'' published in 1993.
Other publications include the “Designing for our future selves” special issue (volume 24, issue 1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Ergonomics, Volume 24, Issue 1, Pages 2-69 (February 1993)  – sciencedirect.com|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00036870/24/1|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the journal ''Applied Ergonomics'' published in 1993; ''Once in a Lifetime: An Evaluation of Lifetime Homes in Hull,'' published in 1995; and ''Working Together, A New Approach To Design,'' published in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980111033134/http://designage.rca.ac.uk/DA/publications.html DesignAge Publications]. DesignAge. Retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Within three years of its existence DesignAge reported that it was able to raise awareness of the issue within the design profession, in related disciplines including ergonomics, in education, and also among major retailers, manufacturers, and the age lobby.&lt;ref name="DesignResearchForOurFutureSelves"/&gt;

In 1994, DesignAge was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in the category of “the Arts” in recognition of its contribution to the shift in perception towards designing for older adults and for working with corporations to design products for older adults and people incapacitated by illness.&lt;ref name="Queen"/&gt;

==Notable collaborations==

===Design for Ageing Network===
In 1994, DesignAge established a Europe-wide research network on design and aging called the DAN (Design for Ageing Network), funded until 1997 by [[Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities (European Commission)|DG V]] of the European Commission (then the Directorate-General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/bepa/european-group-ethics/archive-mandates/mandate-1991-1997/index_en.htm "Mandate 1991–1997"], European Commission. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;). The network’s goal was to “develop the necessary expertise, know-how and understanding to enable design and industry to respond to the growing population of over-50’s in Europe in appropriate and life-enhancing ways” through the use of “in-depth collaboration with older people” that went “beyond simple measuring and questioning.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981206174133/http://dan.interact.nl/DAN/INFO/homepop1.html "What is the DAN?"]. Design for Ageing Network. Retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After DesignAge was subsumed into the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre, DAN continued to exist until early 2004 when it was superseded by the Include Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/designage/DAN/index.html "The Design for Ageing Network"]. The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence project===
DesignAge also participated in an EU-funded project called Presence,&lt;ref name="AARL"/&gt; which ran from 1997 to 1999&lt;ref&gt;[http://hookerandkitchen.com/presence/ The Presence Project]. Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose aim was “enhancing activity and presence of older people in communities”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presenceweb.i3net.org/ Presence]. Presence.

==Career==

===1990s===
Anderson moved to New York when she was 22 years old. To support herself as she started her career, she worked as a waitress.&lt;ref name="Bio1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Gillian – Biography (page 1)|work=gilliananderson.ws|url=http://www.gilliananderson.ws/about/bio1.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her career in [[Alan Ayckbourn]]'s play ''[[Absent Friends (play)|Absent Friends]]'' at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] alongside [[Brenda Blethyn]];&lt;ref name=AbsentFriends&gt;{{Cite news|last=Witchel|first=Alex|title=Two Newcomers Make Waves in Ayckbourn Play|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/20/theater/two-newcomers-make-waves-in-ayckbourn-play.html|accessdate=February 10, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 20, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her role she won the 1990–91 [[Theatre World Award]] for "Best Newcomer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Past Recipients – Theatre World Awards|url=http://www.theatreworldawards.org/past-recipients.html|website=''theatreworldawards.org''|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next theatrical role was in [[Christopher Hampton]]'s ''[[The Philanthropist (play)|The Philanthropist]]'' at the [[Long Wharf Theatre]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Philanthropist&gt;{{Cite news|last=Klein|first=Alvin|title=THEATER; 'The Philanthropist'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/02/nyregion/theater-the-philanthropist.html|accessdate=September 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992, and spent a year auditioning. The same year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, ''[[The Turning (1992 film)|The Turning]]'', starring [[Karen Allen]] and [[Tess Harper]]. The film drama is an adaptation of the play ''Home Fires Burning''.&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt;

Although she had once vowed she would never do television work, being out of work for a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: "First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [to auditions] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't want to be involved in it."&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt; She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, ''[[Class of '96]]'', on the fledgling [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]].&lt;ref name="BioYahoo"/&gt;

As a result of this guest appearance, Anderson was sent the script for ''[[The X-Files]]''. She was 24 when she decided to audition because, "for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= Walker|first= Alix|title= People should know that I laugh|url= http://www.stylist.co.uk/from-the-app/gillian-anderson-people-should-know-that-i-laugh|accessdate=September 21, 2015|newspaper= Stylist Magazine|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] wanted to hire her, but Fox wanted someone with previous television exposure and greater sex appeal.&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt; Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as [[Dana Scully|FBI Special Agent Dana Scully]]. Anderson got the part assuming it would run for 13 episodes, the standard minimum order for American television networks. Filmed for the first five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, before moving to Los Angeles, the series ran for nine seasons. Two related films were also produced, released in 1998 and 2008. During her time on ''The X-Files'', Anderson won numerous awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully, including an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series#1990s|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/gillian-anderson |title=Gillian Anderson Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama#1990s|Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series Drama]], two [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series#1990s|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series]] and a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television]].

Anderson also provided the voice for a parody of her Scully character in "[[The Springfield Files]]", an episode of the animated comedy television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. While filming the ''X-Files'', she met assistant art director [[Clyde Klotz]], who became her first husband.&lt;ref name="BioLT"/&gt; Anderson's character on ''X-Files'' initiated a phenomenon referred to as "[[Dana Scully#"The Scully Effect"|The Scully Effect]]"; as the [[medical doctor]] and the [[FBI Special Agent]] inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine and [[law enforcement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8347">'''Ilona (Ili) Kronstein''' (née '''Neumann''', 1897–1948) was a Jewish, [[Budapest]]-born artist.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unknown|first1=Unknown|title=Gerda Lerner Family Collection 1939-1978|url=http://search.cjh.org/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&amp;ct=display&amp;fn=search&amp;doc=dedupmrg142604524&amp;indx=1&amp;recIds=dedupmrg142604524&amp;recIdxs=0&amp;elementId=0&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;displayMode=full&amp;frbrVersion=&amp;query=any%2Ccontains%2C%22Neumann+Emma+%28nee+Deutsch%29+b+1875%22&amp;vl(4199461UI0)=any&amp;dscnt=0&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28CJH%29&amp;onCampus=falso&amp;vid=beta&amp;institution=CJH&amp;highlight=true&amp;dym=true&amp;lang=eng&amp;vl(freeText0)=%22Neumann%20Emma%20%28nee%20Deutsch%29%20b%201875%22&amp;dstmp=1468335044013|website=Center For Jewish History (cjh.org)|publisher=Center For Jewish History|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kronstein was originally a [[graphic artist]] by trade, her artistic style evolved over her lifetime. Her works were newly discovered in the late 1990s and were later exhibited at the [[Jewish Museum Vienna|Jewish Museum]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Welt der Ili Kronstein = the world of Ili Kronstein : Werke 1938-1943|date=2000|publisher=Juedisches Museum Wien, 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Ili was born in 1897 to Sigmund (Zsiga) Neumann and Emma Deutsch in Budapest, [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Her younger sisters were born in 1899 (Margit (Manci)) and in 1903 (Klara (Klari)). Around 1908, Sigmund's textile mill went out of business and he emigrated to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]] with his family. There, Ili became proficient in Italian and developed an appreciation for Italy and its inhabitants. She showed artistic skill during childhood, but her work was discouraged by Sigmund. The family returned to Budapest, and Ili was removed from school when she was 16, as she needed to concentrate on getting ready for marriage and the middle-class lifestyle that accompanied it. During this period of her life, she volunteered for several years in nursery schools for poor children.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Later life and artistic influences==

Ili married Robert Kronstein in 1919, despite original disapproval from Sigmund and Emma. She moved with Robert to [[Vienna]], Austria-Hungary and he purchased a pharmacy there. In 1920, the couple had its first daughter, [[Gerda Lerner|Gerda]], and in 1925 its second daughter, Nora (named after Nora Helmer from [[A Doll's House|Henrik Ibsen's ''A Doll's House'']]). Ili and Robert's marriage was tense and contradictory. Much of the riffs in the marriage stemmed from Ili's longing to branch out and meet fascinating and enlightened people. The couple moved to a larger apartment during her first pregnancy. Ili's mother-in-law lived with them, and she disapproved of Ili's artistic and nonconformist attitudes. Following the birth of Nora, both Ili and Robert agreed to live together in the same home as friends (not husband and wife), and "he continued to support her throughout their lives."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein was then free to evolve artistically while being financially secure. She experimented with defining herself both as a person and as an artist for many years. She became a [[book binder]] and, after this, a German (her second language) writer. Kronstein started to diligently develop her artistry in the early 1930s, first as a graphic artist. Initially, Kronstein was significantly influenced by [[Egon Schiele]]'s work, but later she was influenced by the artist-teacher [[Johannes Itten]]. She learned from Itten either at his School of Living and Art in [[Berlin, Germany]] or over the duration of one of his frequent visits to Vienna. Over the course of 1934 to 1936, Kronstein informally taught Gerda art lessons which mirrored Itten's methodology and viewpoints. Later, Itten's philosophies guided Kronstein's work; the counsel she provided for Nora (she went on to become an artist); and the description (in print) of a painting class that she had planned, which encompasses "practice exercises" and philosophical ideology (for instance, the relationship among breathing exercises, yoga, and art).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein developed herself as an artist though study of the "old masters[']" art when she travelled to Italy and other places periodically. She additionally educated herself on "[[Japanese brush painting|Japanese classical brush painting]]," and was interested in [[Impressionist]] artwork, especially [[Paul Cézanne]]. She also took interest in literary, cinematic, and artistic [[German Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein rented an art studio in 1933&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; with help from Robert's economic support. There, she worked many days and nights at her work, while running a salon as well. She featured her "graphic work, portraits and landscapes" at her own exhibits. Her evolution as an artist was stunted by the [[Anschluss]] (1938). Not long after, Robert moved to [[Vaduz]] in [[Liechtenstein]] (Robert founded another pharmacy there in 1933.)
During a [[Nazi]] street raid, Ili was coerced to scrub the sidewalk. Gerda and Ili were held in jail for six weeks (April 1938) "as hostages for Robert." Prior to their release, it was required that Ili declare in writing that she and her children would leave Austria immediately, however, three months passed before they could leave Austria to reunite with Robert. At first, Kronstein felt free spirited, as she had just escaped from Nazi influence. However, that positivity was replaced by "restlessness and unhappiness," because she resented "the uncultured provincialism of Vaduz" and she did not have a studio. During this time, Nora attended a Swiss boarding school, and Gerda went to [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]] in hopes to attain a visa to the [[United States|U.S.]] Kronstein then left Vaduz and visited in Zürich periodically. In Zürich, she roomed with Gerda in a "cheap, small room," consumed food moderately, but took relish in the cultural resources. In 1938,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; both Ili and Gerda were held in jail as foreigners and [[deportation]] to Germany was a threatened upon them. Robert managed to change their deportation location to Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein left Liechtenstein, and stayed for a brief time in [[Paris]], France. She then left for [[southern France]]. There, her artistic creativity blossomed. She started working with colors, and her works gained more depth. During this time, her style bordered [[cubism]] and [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]]. She spent time in [[Nice, France|Nice]] and befriended inspirational artists who taught her valuable lessons. In this circle of inspirations was [[Latvians|Latvian]] painter [[Rudolf Ray-Rapaport]], and he and Kronstein became close friends.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The Kronsteins still planned to emigrate, but, in June 1941, Ili's application for a [[U.S. visa]] got denied. In the past, she was confined in [[Gurs internment camp]] for six weeks alongside ten thousand refugees, both Jews and anti-Fascists. Also in Gurs was [[Charlotte Salomon]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. In Gurs, Kronstein showed "remarkable courage, good humor and resourcefulness," despite dwindling health. In late 1940, Kronstein endured [[paralysis]] of her right arm. Later on in 1945, Kronstein was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]]. Over the course of the year 1941, she could not work for extended amounts of time, however, she still drew until she could no longer grip a pencil. Following Ray-Rapaport's immigration to the U.S. in 1942, Kronstein went to Liechtenstein and later to Switzerland in order to receive treatment for her illnesses. She was paralyzed yet mentally attentive and spent her last four years of life in private care in Zürich. She died at the age of fifty-one on April 22, 1948.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Imperial Cathedral''' ({{lang-de|Kaiserdom}}) is the designation for a [[cathedral]] linked to the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial rule]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

==Rhenish Cathedrals==
The three [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedrals of [[Mainz Cathedral|Mainz]], [[Worms Cathedral|Worms]] and [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]] in the northwestern [[Upper Rhine]] area are called '''Rhenish Imperial Cathedrals'''.

The construction of Mainz Cathedral was begun about 975 under Archbishop [[Willigis]], then [[regent]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for minor King [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. His seat was already meant as a kind of "state church", it was the first building of this size north of the Alps. The cathedral was completed in 1009, burnt down at the dedication, and was immediately rebuilt. Willigis may have planned to replace [[Aachen Cathedral]] as coronation church of the [[King of the Romans]]; indeed Otto's III successors [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] (in 1002) and [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] (in 1024) were crowned in Mainz, but both presumably in the preceding building, since the present cathedral was not consecrated until in 1038. King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] also contributed to the building after another blaze in 1081. Mainz Cathedral was the coronation site for [[Philip of Swabia]], for [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], and anti-king [[Henry Raspe]].

Speyer Cathedral is the world's largest preserved Romanesque church (after the demolition of [[Cluny Abbey]]) and today a UNESCO [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|World Heritage Site]]. It was built starting about 1025 by King Conrad II as a family vault for the ruling [[Salian dynasty]]. His successor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] donated the [[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Speyer Gospels]] in 1046; the building was completed in 1061 under the rule of King Henry IV. During the [[Investiture Controversy]] with [[Pope Gregory VIII]], he had the church again extended from 1081, in order to stress his Imperial authority. His mortal remains were transferred to the cathedral by his son [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] in 1111.

Worms Cathedral, a highrising building, was built from about 1130 to 1181. It houses the tombs of Emperor Conrad's II family and also got its status because of its size and glory. The church was the site of the nomination of [[Pope Leo IX]] in 1048 and of the conclusion of the 1122 [[Concordat of Worms]] ending the Investiture Controversy. In 1235 the marriage of Emperor Frederick II with [[Isabella of England]] took place here.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Carolingian foundations==
[[Aachen Cathedral]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] since 1978, today is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen|Bishops of Aachen]] and the city's landmark. Its central octagon was erected from the late 8th century onwards as the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|chapel]] of the [[Palace of Aachen]], a residence of Emperor [[Charlemagne]]. The building, a masterpiece of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], has been expanded several times over the centuries; from 936 it served as the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronation]] church of the [[King of the Romans|Kings of the Romans]] after their [[Prince-elector|election]] at Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the former Palatine Chapel did not attain the rank of a cathedral until 1802, permanently in 1930.

[[Frankfurt Cathedral]] (St Bartholomew Church) is also described as an Imperial cathedral, though it never had been a bishop's seat. The present [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building replaced a Carolingian palatine chapel, erected at the Frankfurt [[Kaiserpfalz|royal palace]] (''Königpfalz''). It was rebuilt as a basilica and collegiate church consecrated by Archbishop [[Rabanus Maurus]] in 852. Frankfurt first became the site of the [[Imperial election|election]] of the German monarch with the accession of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1152, definitely fixed in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]]. From 1562 until 1792, Frankfurt was also the site of the Imperial coronation ceremony led by the Archbishop of Mainz.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Other==
[[Bamberg Cathedral]] with its four towers also has the same status. Built from 1004 onwards for the newly established [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bamberg|Bishopric of Bamberg]] at the behest of the last [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] King [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] and his wife [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], the church is the site where the only [[Canonization|canonized]] imperial couple has their grave. In 1046 Bishop [[Pope Clement II|Suidger of Bamberg]] was elected Pope Clement II; his grave at the cathedral is the only [[List of extant papal tombs|tomb of a Pope]] north of the Alps. The Romanesque building, also known for the [[Bamberg Horseman]], is part of the historic [[Bamberg|Town of Bamberg]] and today also listed as a World Heritage Site.

Less well known is that the Imperial Cathedral in the small town of [[Königslutter]], a basilica built from 1135 as a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] abbey chuch and family vault of the [[Supplinburger dynasty]] in the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] lands of Emperor [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]]. The church was completed about 1170, more than 30 years after Lothair's death, by the [[House of Welf|Welf]] duke [[Henry the Lion]] at the time when the Imperial rule had already passed to the [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabian]] house of [[Hohenstaufen]]. Like Frankfurt Cathedral, it was never the seat of a bishop.

[[Magdeburg Cathedral]], see of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] founded by Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] in 968, as well as [[Palermo Cathedral]] (Maria Santissima Assunta) with the sarcophagi of the Hohenstaufen emperors [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] are sometimes also called Imperial cathedrals.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''''', ({{lang-ar| جامع التواريخ }} ''Compendium of Chronicles'', {{lang-mn|Судрын чуулган}}, {{lang-fa| جامع‌التواریخ }}) is a work of literature and history, produced in the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]] in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Inal. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (1247–1318) at the start of the 14th century, the breadth of coverage of the work has caused it to be called "the first world history".&lt;ref name="Melville"&gt;{{cite web|last=Melville|first=Charles|title=JĀMEʿ AL-TAWĀRIḴ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jame-al-tawarik|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in three volumes.  The surviving portions total approximately 400 pages, with versions in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. The work describes cultures and major events in world history from China to Europe; in addition, it covers Mongol history, as a way of establishing their cultural legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Carey. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The lavish illustrations and calligraphy required the efforts of hundreds of scribes and artists, with the intent that two new copies (one in Persian, and one in Arabic) would be created each year and distributed to schools and cities around the [[Ilkhanate]], in the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[Anatolia]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Approximately 20 illustrated copies were made of the work during Rashid al-Din's lifetime, but only a few portions remain, and the complete text has not survived. The oldest known copy is an Arabic version, of which half has been lost, but one set of pages is currently in the [[Nasser Khalili#Islamic Art Collection|Khalili Collection]], comprising 59 folios from the second volume of the work. Another set of pages, with 151 folios from the same volume, is owned by the [[Edinburgh University Library]]. Two Persian copies from the first generation of manuscripts survive in the [[Topkapı Palace]] Library in [[Istanbul]]. The early illustrated manuscripts together represent "one of the most important surviving examples of Ilkhanid art in any medium",&lt;ref&gt;''Compendium of Chronicles'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and are the largest surviving body of early examples of the [[Persian miniature]].

==The author==
{{main article|Rashid-al-Din Hamadani}}
Rashid-al-Din Hamadani was born in 1247 at [[Hamadan]], Iran into a Jewish family. The son of an [[apothecary]], he studied medicine and joined the court of the Ilkhan emperor, [[Abaqa Khan]], in that capacity. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty. He rapidly gained political importance, and in 1304 became the [[vizier]] of emperor and Muslim convert [[Ghazan]]. He retained his position until 1316, experiencing three successive reigns, but, convicted of having poisoned the second of these three [[Khan (title)|Khans]], [[Öljaitü]], he was executed on July 13, 1318.

Hamdani was responsible for setting up a stable social and economic system in Iran after the destruction of the Mongol invasions, and was an important artistic and architectural patron. He expanded the university at [[Rab'-e Rashidi]], which attracted scholars and students from Egypt and Syria to China, and which published his many works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadigh|first=Soudabeh|title=Ilkhanid Structures Discovered in Tabriz|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=6754|publisher=CHN|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a prolific author, though few of his works have survived: only a few theological writings and a correspondence which is probably apocryphal are known today in addition to the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''. His immense wealth made it said of him that he was the best paid author in Iran.

==The work==
[[File:GhazanConversionToIslam.JPG|250px|left|thumb|"The conversion of [[Ghazan]] Khan to [[Islam]]", [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] manuscript, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Supplément persan 1113, c. 1430]]
The ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' was one of the grandest projects of the Ilkhanate period,&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Lorenz Books| isbn = 978-0-7548-2087-1| last = Carey| first = Moya| title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture| year = 2010|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; "not just a lavishly illustrated book, but a vehicle to justify Mongol hegemony over Iran".&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Bloom, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The text was initially commissioned by Il-Khan Ghazan, who was anxious for the Mongols to retain a memory of their nomadic roots, now that they had become settled and adopted Persian customs. Initially, the work was intended only to set out the history of the Mongols and their predecessors on the steppes, and took the name ''Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī'', which makes up one part of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''. To compile the History, Rashid al-Din set up an entire precinct at the university of [[Rab'-e Rashidi]] in the capital of [[Tabriz]]. It contained multiple buildings, including a [[mosque]], hospital, library, and classrooms, employing over 300 workers.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

After the death of Ghazan in 1304, his successor [[Öljaitü]] asked Rashid al-Din to extend the work, and write a history of the whole of the known world. This text was finally completed in sometime between 1306 and 1311.

After Rashid al-Din's execution in 1318, the Rab-i-Rashidi precinct was plundered, but the in-process copy that was being created at the time survived, probably somewhere in the city of Tabriz, possibly in the library of Rashid's son, Ghiyath al-Din. Later, Rashid's son became Vizier, in his own right, and expanded the restored university precinct of his father. Several of the ''Jāmiʿ''{{'}}s compositions were used as models for the later seminal illustrated version of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' known as the [[Demotte Shahnameh|Demotte ''Shahnameh'']].&lt;ref name=b31&gt;Blair. pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, the Arabic copy was in [[Herat]], perhaps claimed after a victory by the [[Timurid dynasty]]. It then passed to the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] in India, where it was in the possession of the emperor [[Akbar]] (r. 1556–1605). There is then a record of it passing through the hands of later Mughal emperors for the next few centuries. It was probably divided into two parts in the mid-1700s, though both sections remained in India until the 19th century, when they were acquired by the British. The portion now in the Edinburgh library was presented as a gift to Ali-I Ahmad Araf Sahib on October 8, 1761, and in 1800 was in the library of the Indian prince [[Farzada Kuli]]. This fragment was acquired by Colonel [[John Baillie of Leys]] of the [[East India Company]], and then in 1876 passed to the Edinburgh University Library.&lt;ref name=b31/&gt; The other portion was acquired by [[John Staples Harriott]] of the East India Company sometime prior to 1813. At some point during the next two decades it was brought to England, probably when Harriott came home on furlough, when the manuscript entered the collection of Major General [[Thomas Gordon (British Army officer)|Thomas Gordon]]. He then bequeathed it to the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]] in 1841. In 1948, it was loaned to the British Museum and Library, and in 1980 was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]], where it was purchased by the Rashidiyyah Foundation in Geneva for £850,000, the highest price ever paid for a medieval manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Blair. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The Khalili Collection acquired it in 1990.

To write the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'', Rashid al-din based his work on many written and oral sources, some of which can be identified:
* From Iran, it is very similar to work by [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a [[Persian people|Persian]] historian who wrote an account of the [[Mongol Empire]] entitled ''[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay|Taʾrīkh-ī jahān-gushāy]]'' "History of the World-Conqueror". Also from Iran, the ''Shahnameh'' is drawn upon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/shahnameh/vgallery/section2.html?p=25&amp;g=,13,14,15,16,18,23,24,25,26,27,28,29 Fitzwilliam Museum], Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;
* For Europe, the ''Chronicle of the Popes and the Emperors'' of [[Martin of Opava]]
* For the Mongols, it seems that he had access to the [[Altan Debter]], through the ambassador of the Great Khan to the court of the Il-Khanate.
* For China, the author knew the translation of four Chinese manuscripts: three on medicine and one on administration. Furthermore, it is known that he enjoyed calligraphy, painting and Chinese music. The links with this world were made all the easier because Mongols also ruled the Chinese empire.

===Contents===
The ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' consists of four main sections of different lengths:

1. The ''Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī'', the most extensive part, which includes:
:* The Mongol and Turkish tribes: their history, genealogies and legends
:* The history of the Mongols from [[Genghis Khan]] up to the death of Mahmud Ghazan

2. The second part includes :
:* The history of the reign of Öljaitü up to 1310 (no known copy)
:* The history of the non-Mongol peoples of Eurasia (a [[universal history]] from the time of Creation, following the organization of work of the Abbasid historian [[al-Tabari]] in his ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', often referred to as ''at-Tabari's HIstory,'' and to the historic Muslim history of [[Qazi Beiza'i]] in the ''Neẓām al-tawārīkh'':
:** [[Adam]] and the patriarchs
:** the kings of the [[history of Iran|pre-Islamic Iran]]
:** [[Muhammad]] and the Caliphs ([[Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate]]s)
:** the Islamic dynasties of Persia ([[Ghaznavids]], the shahs of [[Khwarezm]], the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]-ruled [[Alamut]])
:** the [[Turkic peoples]],
:** the [[History of China]]
:** [[Jewish history]],
:** [[Frangistan]] (ie., Europe, primarily the [[Papal States]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]])
:** the [[History of India|Indians]].

3. The ''Shu'ab-i panjganah'' ("Five genealogies, of the Arabs, Jews, Mongols, Franks, and Chinese"). This text exists in two copies of the manuscript in the library of the Topkapı Palace in [[Istanbul]] (ms 2937&lt;!-- says U.Chicago library; fr. WP says 29 321 --&gt;), but has only been published on microfilm.

4. The ''Suwar al-akalim'', a geographical compendium. Unfortunately, it has not survived in any known manuscript.

===Illustrations===
Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in the [[Muslim world]] in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Bloom &amp; S. Blair|title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art Vol. II|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of the illustration for the various ''Tawarikh'' copies was probably done at the Rab-al Rashidi university complex, a contemporary written account mentions that they were also done elsewhere in Mongol empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom &amp; Blair, Grove Enlycl., Vol. II p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Battle of Badr.jpg|thumb|250px|Mohammed exhorting his family before the [[Battle of Badr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rashid |last=al-Din |url=http://warfare.uphero.com/Persia/13-14C/Jami_al-Tawarikh-Mohammed_exhorting_his_family_before_the_battle_of_Badr-Khalili-Ms727-f66a.htm |title=Khalili Collection, MSS. 727, folio 66a |date=1305–14 |work=Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The scene now in the Kahlili collection illustrating the [[Battle of Badr]] used a collection of stock figures, and scholars are in disagreement as to who is represented. One descriptor says it shows Muhammad with [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib]] and [[Ali]] before sending them to battle. Another says Muhammad is on the right, but Hamza and Ali on the left, or perhaps the center. Another description says it is Muhammad exhorting his family to fight, and that he may be one of the central figures, but it is not clear which one.&lt;ref&gt;Blair. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questions about the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''===
There is little reason to doubt Rashid al-Din’s editorial authorship but the work is generally considered a collective effort. It may also be possible that it was compiled by a group of international scholars under his leadership. Yet, a number of questions remain about the writing of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh.'' Several others, such as Abu’l Qasim al-Kashani, claimed to have written the ''universal history''. Rashid al-Din was of course a very busy man, with his public life, and would have employed assistants to handle the materials assembled and to write the first draft: Abu'l Qasim may have been one of them. Furthermore, not all of the work is original: for instance, the section on the period following the death of Genghis Khan in particular is directly borrowed from Juvayni. Other questions concern the objectivity of the author and his point of view: it is after all an official history, concerning events with which Rashid al-Din in his political capacity was often involved at first hand (for the history of the Ilkhanate in particular). Nonetheless, the work "is characterized by a matter-of-fact tone and a refreshing absence of sycophantic flattery." &lt;ref name="Melville"/&gt;

==Contemporary manuscripts of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''==
[[File:Mongol siege Jami al-Tawarikh Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|250px|Folio from the Edinburgh collection, showing a miniature painting of Mongols besieging a city. Note the elements protruding beyond the frame.]]
The ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' was the center of an industry for a time, no doubt in part due to the political importance of its author. The workshop was ordered to produce one manuscript each in Arabic and Persian every year, which were to be distributed to different cities.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Although approximately 20 of the first generation of manuscripts were produced, very few survive, which are described below. Other later copies were made from the first set, with some illustrations and history added to match current events.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic manuscripts===
The earliest known copy is in Arabic, dated to the early 1300s. Only portions of it have survived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/khan8/hd_khan8.htm |title=Folios from the Jami' al-tavarikh|work=Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=January 15, 2012|quote=Today only two early-fourteenth-century Persian copies of the Compendium and part of one Arabic copy survive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided into two parts between the [[University of Edinburgh]] (151 folios) and the Khalili Collection (59 folios), although some researchers argue for these being from two different copies. Both sections come from the second volume, with the pages interwoven. The Edinburgh part covers some of the earlier history up through a section about the Prophet Muhammad, and then this story is continued in the Khalili portion, with further narratives weaving back and forth between the two collections, ending with the final section also being in the Edinburgh collection.

====Edinburgh folios====
The Edinburgh part has a page size of 41.5 × 34.2&amp;nbsp;cm, with a written area of 37 × 25&amp;nbsp;cm, and contains 35 lines per page written in [[Naskh (script)|Naskhi]] calligraphy.  There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuks]] and [[Atabey]]s, and the history of the sultans of [[Khwarezm]]. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]], who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as "Baillie's collection".

Seventy rectangular [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s adorn the manuscript, which reflect the cosmopolitan nature of [[Tabriz]] at the time of its production. In this capital, a crossroads of trade routes and influences, and a place of great religious tolerance, Christian, Chinese, Buddhist and other models of painting all arrived to feed the inspiration of the artists.

The miniatures have an unusual horizontal format and only take up about a third of the written area; this may reflect the influence of Chinese scrolls. Some parts of the surviving text are heavily illustrated and other parts not at all, apparently reflecting the importance accorded to them. The miniatures are ink drawings with [[watercolour]] washes added, a technique also used in China; although they are generally in good condition, there was considerable use of metallic silver for highlights, which has now oxidized to black. Borrowings from Christian art can also be seen; for example the ''Birth of Muhammad'' adapts the standard Byzantine composition for the ''[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]]'', but instead of the [[Biblical Magi]] approaching at the left there is a file of three women.&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Bloom, 28; Canby, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  The section includes the earliest extended cycle of illustrations of the [[Depictions of Muhammad|life of Muhammad]].  Like other early Ilkhanid miniatures, these differ from the relatively few surviving earlier Islamic book illustrations in having coherent landscape backgrounds in the many scenes set outside, rather than isolated elements of plants or rocks.  Architectural settings are sometimes given a sense of depth by different layers being shown and the use of a three-quarters view.&lt;ref&gt;Min Yong Cho, 12-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice distinguished four major painters and two assistants:

* The ''Painter of [[Iram of the Pillars|Iram]]'': the most influenced by China (reflected in Chinese elements, such as trees, interest in the landscape, interest in contemplative characters). The work is characterized by open drawing, minimal modelling, linear drapery, extensive details, stripped and balanced compositions, delicate and pale colours, and a rare use of silver. He painted mostly the early miniatures, and may have been assisted by the ''Master of [[Tahmura]]''.
* The ''Painter of [[Lohrasp]]'': characterized by a variety of subjects, including many throne scenes, a variable and eclectic style, quite severe and angular drapery, a verity of movements, stripped and empty backgrounds. His absence of interest in landscape painting shows a lack of Chinese influences, which is compensated for by inspiration from Arab, Syrian and Mesopotamian painting. His work is of variable quality, and uses silver systematically. His assistant: the ''Master of Scenes from the Life of the Prophet''.
* The ''Master of the Battle Scenes'': a somewhat careless painter, as becomes evident when the number of arms does not match the number of characters, or a leg is missing among the horses.  He is notable for a complete lack of focus and horror, and for strong symmetry, his compositions usually comprising two parties face to face composed of a leader and two or three followers. Decoration is limited to grass, indicated in small vegetative clumps, except during sieges and attacks on the city.
* The ''Master of [[Alp Arslan]]'' appears briefly, at the end of the manuscript. His style is crude and unbalanced, his characters often badly proportioned.

Just as distinguishable are different racial and ethnic types, made manifest not just in the physical attributes of the characters, but also their clothes and their hats. One can thus distinguish a remarkably well observed group of [[People of Ethiopia|Abyssinians]], Western-style figures based on Syrian Christian manuscripts, Chinese, Mongols, Arabs, and so on.

The Edinburgh folios were displayed at an exhibition at the [[Edinburgh University Library|University of Edinburgh Main Library]] in summer 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Emma|last2=Skeldon|first2=Steven|title=The World History of Rashid al-Din, 1314.

====Khalili folios====
[[File:Buddha offers fruit to the devil - from Jami al-Tawarikh.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Buddha offers fruit to the devil'', [[Khalili Collection]]]]
The portion in the [[Khalili Collection]], where it is referred to as MSS727, contains 59 folios, 35 of them illustrated.
Until sold in 1980 it was owned by the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in London. It is a different section of the History than that of the Edinburgh version, possibly from a different copy. Each page measures {{convert|43.5|by|30|cm|in}} (slightly different dimensions to the Edinburgh portion due to different models copied). According to Blair's description of the collection, "Two major sections were lost after division: thirty-five folios (73-107) covering the life of Muhammad up to the caliphate of Hisham, and thirty folios (291-48) going from the end of the Khwarazmshahs to the middle of the section on China. The latter may have been lost accidentally, but the former block may have been jettisoned deliberately because it had no illustrations. The folios about the life of the Prophet were further jumbled, and four were lost. The final three folios (301-303) covering the end of the section on the Jews were also lost, perhaps accidentally, but judging from the comparable section in MS.H 1653, they had no illustrations and may also have been discarded."&lt;ref&gt;Blair. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript was brought to Western attention by William Morley, who discovered it in 1841 while he was cataloguing the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society in London. For some time this collection was displayed in the [[King's Library]] of the [[British Museum]]. It includes twenty illustrations, plus fifteen pages with portraits of the emperors of China. The text covers the history of Islam, the end of China's history, the history of India, and a fragment from the history of the Jews. The work of the Painter of Luhrasp and Master of Alp Arslan is again evident. Some differences in style can be observed, but these can be attributed to the difference in date. A new painter appears for the portraits of Chinese leaders, which uses special techniques that seem to mimic those of [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] mural painters (according to S. Blair): an attention to line and wash, and the use of black and bright red. This artist seems to be very familiar with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Persian manuscripts===
[[File:Assassination_of_Nizam_al-Mulk.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Hashshashin|Assassin]] (left, in white turban) fatally stabs [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Seljuk vizier, in 1092, from Topkapi MS H 1653.]]
There are two early 14th century copies in Persian in the [[Topkapi Palace]] Library, [[Istanbul]].

* MS H 1653, made in 1314, which includes later additions on the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid era]] for Sultan [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]]. The full collection, known as the ''Majmu'ah'', contains [[Bal'ami]]'s version of [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]]'s chronicle, the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'', and [[Nizam al-Din Shami]]'s biography of [[Timur]]. The portions of the ''Jāmiʿ'' cover most of the history of the Muhammad and the Caliphate, plus the post-caliphate dynasties of the Ghaznavids, Saljuqs, Khwarazmshahs and Is'mailis, and the Turks. It contains 68 paintings in the Ilkhanid style.
* MS H 1654, made in 1317, which includes 118 illustrations, including 21 pages of portraits of Chinese emperors. It was copied for Rashid al-Din, and like H 1653 was later owned by Shahrukh.&lt;ref&gt;Blair. pp. 27–28, and note 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later versions and manuscripts===
Interest in the work continued after the Ilkhans were replaced as Persia's ruling dynasty by the [[Timurids]].  [[Timur]]'s youngest son, [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shahrukh]], who ruled the eastern portion of the empire from 1405–47, owned incomplete copies of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' and commissioned his court historian [[Hafiz-i Abru]] to complete it.  The earliest dated manuscript made for Shahrukh includes the original text and additions by Hafiz-i Abru, along with other histories, and is dated 1415-16 (Topkapi Palace Library, MS B 282).  The Topkapi MS H 1653, discussed above, combines an incomplete Ilkhanid ''Jāmiʿ'' with Timurid additions, which are dated 1425.  Another ''Jāmiʿ'' is in Paris ([[BnF]], Supplément persan 1113), dated to about 1430, with 113 miniatures.  Most of the miniatures for these volumes copy the horizontal format and other features of the Ilkhanid manuscripts, while retaining other features of Timurid style in costume, colouring and composition, using what is sometimes known as the "Historical style".&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Bloom, 58 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SekienNinmenju.jpg|thumb|right|The ''jinmenju'' as illustrated by [[Toriyama Sekien]]]]
{{nihongo|'''Jinmenju''' or '''Ninmenju'''|人面樹|''human-face tree''}} is a strange [[tree]] illustrated in [[Toriyama Sekien]]'s ''[[Konjaku Hyakki Shūi]]''.

==Description in folklore==
Legend has it that the tree grows "in remote mountain valleys in China".

The Jinmenju's [[fruit]] appear to be "human heads. The faces are always smiling or laughing, even as they fall from their branch."

==In popular culture==
* In the ''[[InuYasha]]'' anime series, episodes 57 and 58 revolve around Tokajin, a sage who feeds humans to a demonic tree with human-faced fruit in exchange for the immortality the fruit can grant.
* In the music video for [[Dir en grey]]'s song "[[Obscure (song)|Obscure]]", a woman resembling a [[geisha]] is seen taking a baby's head from a tree.
* The [[Pokémon]] Exeggutor may have been based on the Jinmenju.
* In several ''[[Castlevania]]'' games, there is a monster called "corpseweed" that appears as a tall plant with a head dangling from the end. 
* In the [[Sega Saturn]] port of ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' there is a new enemy Jinmenju which looks almost exactly like a jinmenju.
* In the game ''[[Tomba!|Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return]]'', there are fruits in Donglin Forest that either cry or laugh.
* In the film ''[[Dead and Deader]]'', there is an enemy tree-like creature, called Sun, with human faces, which may be inspired by this creature.

'''Kongo ivories''' are some of the finest sculptural works produced by the people of the west-central Africa's Lower Congo region. In the [[Kongo Kingdom]], [[ivory]] was a precious commodity that was strictly controlled by chiefs and kings, who commissioned sculptors to produce fine ivory sculptures for their personal and courtly use. With the rise of the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic trade]], ivory became one of the most valuable African [[natural resources]] sought by Western industry. Eventually, Kongo ivory carvers produced works not only for indigenous leaders and elites but also for Europeans and other foreigners.&lt;ref name="Met Museum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridges|first=Nichole N.|title=Kongo Ivories|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kong/hd_kong.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afro-Portuguese ivories==
Most of the earliest extant ivory carvings from sub-Saharan Africa were not made for African consumers.&lt;ref name="Ross 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Doran|title=Elephant : the animal and its ivory in African culture|year=1992|publisher=Fowler Museum of Cultural History, University of California|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0930741250|authorlink=Imagining Elephants: An Overview|editor=Doran Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richly decorated oliphants, or side-blown horns, from the sixteenth century are among the earliest known of the Kongo Kingdom's royal commissions in ivory. Although made in the form of musical instruments to be used during court ceremonies, many such sculptures were likely given as gifts and made for sale to Portuguese elites, missionaries, and traders.&lt;ref name="Met Museum" /&gt; In the 1950s, historian [[William Buller Fagg|William Fagg]] coined the term “Afro-Portuguese ivories” to describe Kongo oliphants and other ivory sculptures from this period.&lt;ref name="Fagg 1958"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagg|first=William|title=Afro-Portuguese Ivories|year=1958|publisher=Batchworth Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma George Ross, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/apiv/hd_apiv.htm "Afro-Portuguese Ivories"] ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of Afro-Portuguese ivories are in the [[British Museum]], many of them made in [[Sierra Leone]] and Benin in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Carved+ivory+Sierra+Leone British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Carved+salt-cellar+Benin British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carved ivories for export==
About the middle of the nineteenth century, a new style of ivory carving developed in the area to meet the demand of the export trade along the [[Loango Kingdom|Loango Coast]] of west-central Africa. This style consisted of fine, detailed relief carving that depicts scenes of Kongo life.&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes commonly portrayed in relief on the ivories capture the dynamic and cosmopolitan coastal activity related to the transatlantic trade.

Most carved Loango tusks are not longer than two to three feet because they were sourced from forest elephants, which are much smaller than the African savannah elephant. Full Loango tusk sculptures that were sculpted from the enormous tusks of savannah elephants are extremely rare; one notable example is now part of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]’s collection.

[[File:jp49819980922-lilithfair.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The main stage, September 22, 1998, [[Tweeter Center Boston|Tweeter Center]], [[Mansfield, Massachusetts]].]]
'''Lilith Fair''' was a [[concert tour]] and travelling [[music festival]], founded by Canadian musician [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Nettwerk Music Group]]'s [[Dan Fraser]] and [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]], and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010. It consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. In its initial three years, Lilith Fair raised over $10M for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128588089 |title=With Sales Lagging, Lilith Fair Faces Question Of Relevance |last=Pellegrinelli |first=Lara |date=19 July 2010 |website=NPR |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1996, Canadian [[Sarah McLachlan]] became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/28/lilith.fair/ | title=Lilith Fair: Lovely, lively and long overdue | author=Donna Freydkin | publisher=CNN | date=1998-07-28 | accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together — in McLachlan's home town, on September 14, 1996 — went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the biblical Jewish lore that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife.

In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16 million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;  Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;

In 2010, Lilith Fair staged a revival with mixed results, as several dates were canceled and many performers backed out of scheduled performances.

In March 2011, co-founder Sarah McLachlan declared that the Lilith concept was no longer being considered for future shows, due to changing audience views and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/sarah-mclachlan-says-lilith-fair-is-over/article1932922/ | title=Sarah McLachlan says Lilith Fair is over | author=MARSHA LEDERMAN | publisher=Toronto Globe and Mail | date=2011-03-08 | accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performers==

===1997===
The artists appearing at Lilith Fair varied by date (with McLachlan and Suzanne Vega the only artists to play all dates). Appearances were organized into three stages. Almost all Village Stage artists performed only one or two dates. Many of them won slots on the bill in a series of local talent searches in their home cities.

==2010 revival==
In an April 25, 2009, Twitter post, Nettwerk founder Terry McBride announced that a Lilith Fair tour through North America would be relaunched for the summer of  2010, with a two-week tour of Europe to follow.

The tour was plagued with financial problems from the beginning. The first seven shows were sparsely attended and the eighth show was the first to be cancelled. Initially Sarah McLachlan claimed (in an interview posted on the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' website on July 9) that the July 8 Phoenix show was canceled in protest of [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act|Arizona Senate Bill 1070]], which she strongly opposes.&lt;ref name="azc070910"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2010/07/09/20100709sarah-mclachlan-lilith-fair-arizona-immigration-protest-cancel.html | title=Sarah McLachlan: Lilith Fair was a protest cancellation | author=Ed Masley | publisher=[[azcentral.com|The Arizona Republic]] | date=2010-07-09 | accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour fell apart on the road as headliners [[Carly Simon]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[The Go-Go's]], and [[Queen Latifah]] dropped out of the tour, fearing that they would not be paid for their performances.&lt;ref name="Artists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lilithfair.com/artists/index.html |title=Artists |publisher=Lilith Fair |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330035003/http://lilithfair.com/artists/index.html |archivedate=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to poor ticket sales, 13 shows (about one-third of the tour) were scratched (two announced on June 25,&lt;ref name="2010-06-25_news"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=115&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=47614 |title=Lilith Fair Dates Cancelled Due to Poor Ticket Sales |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115173624/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=115&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=47614 |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ten more on July 1,&lt;ref name="2010-07-01_news"&gt;[http://www.lilithfair.com/news/2010-lilith-tour-announcement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704062130/http://www.lilithfair.com/news/2010-lilith-tour-announcement |date=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one additional on July 2)&lt;ref name="2010-07-02_news"&gt;[http://www.lilithfair.com/news/lilith-atlanta-alert] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705151225/http://www.lilithfair.com/news/lilith-atlanta-alert |date=July 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one reassigned to a smaller venue.

'''Lily Sobhani''', born 15 October 1976 in [[Norfolk, England]], is a live events producer who specializes in producing large, internationally broadcast music events, usually with a charity component.

==Life==
Lily Sobhani has been working in music and live event production for 15 years, and in that time she  has produced, promoted, distributed and messaged countless cause-related and  charity concerts. Her first major production as an executive producer was the original [[Make Trade Fair#Make_Trade_Fair_concerts|Fairplay]] concert in 2002 for Oxfam’s [[Make Trade Fair]] campaign, which she produced through her company Bottle,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwu.org/one-big-no-musicians-and-artists-against-the-war..html?archive_page=114 "ONE BIG NO - musicians and artists against the war", The Communications Union, 6 March 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717042926/http://www.cwu.org/one-big-no-musicians-and-artists-against-the-war..html?archive_page=114 |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with partners [[Emily Eavis]] and [[Marianne Troup]].

==Career==
===Live 8===
In June 2005, Sobhani was called upon by the Make Poverty History coalition to execute a concert in Japan for the [[Live 8]] concert series.  In a span of 4 weeks, Sobhani accomplished the impossible task of securing the  venue, artists, broadcast partners and financing, and developing local  messaging, for the event at [[Makuhari Messe]] in Japan, on the outskirts of  Tokyo. The show, [[Live 8 concert, Chiba]], prompted the Japanese Government to add 2 billion dollars more aid  for the poorest countries of the world a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteband.org/media/gcap-news/archives/gcapnews.2007-04-19.7685898026/ "Japan’s Live 8 Concert!", GCAP Asia, 4 July 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110054303/http://www.whiteband.org/media/gcap-news/archives/gcapnews.2007-04-19.7685898026 |date=10 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Earth===
During that  experience Sobhani met [[Kevin Wall]], founder of [[Live Earth]] and Exec Producer of  Live 8, and when Live Earth was conceived, she was one of the first people he called on. Lily became Worldwide Head of Events,&lt;ref&gt;[http://liveearth.org/sv/press/pressrelease/live-earth-australia-revealed "Live Earth Australia Revealed" Live Earth, 7 May 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001123716/http://liveearth.org/sv/press/pressrelease/live-earth-australia-revealed |date= 1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bellsouthpwp.net/t/p/tplipps/scaryguy/245500-2.htm "Live Earth Credits"]&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for the delivery  of all Live Earth music concerts. In this capacity, Sobhani supervised teams  responsible for all facets of production – from staging and lighting design to  promotion, finance, broadcast capture and distribution and artist  coordination. The original [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth]] was a set of 9 concerts staged on 7 continents over 24 hours,  and was broadcast to 2 billion people on 7 July 2007. It became the largest  global entertainment event ever held.

Following this, Sobhani was again tapped by Kevin Wall to produce an additional Live Earth concert to take place in [[Mumbai, India]]. [[Live Earth#Live Earth India 2008|Live Earth India]] was scheduled to take place 7 December 2008. Unfortunately, the concert was cancelled shortly after the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]] on 26 November 2008.

In early 2010, Sobhani was asked last minute to step in and help oversee the Chicago portion of the [[Live Earth#Dow_Live_Earth_Run_for_Water|Live Earth Run for Water]].

===FIFA World Cup Kick-Off Celebration Concert===

Most recently, Lily Sobhani produced the inaugural Official FIFA 2010 World Cup Kickoff Celebration Concert,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-aa.co.uk/news/2009/10/concert-to-kick-off-2010-world-cup.aspx "Concert to kick off 2010 World Cup", Access All Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlink.co.za/news_article.htm?contentID=8675 "First-ever FIFA kick-off celebration concert" Artslink.co.za, 7 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; which opened the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament on 10 June. It featured live performances from Black Eyed Peas, Shakira, Alicia Keys, John Legend and Juanes, as well as an amazing blend of African artists including Amadou &amp; Mariam, Angelique Kidjo, BLK JKS and Tinariwen.

=== The Secret Policeman's Ball===

Most recently, Lily Sobhani executive produced the American reboot of [[The Secret Policeman's Ball 2012|The Secret Policeman's Ball]] at the Radio City Music Hall in New York on March 4, 2012, a celebration of Amnesty International's 50th Anniversary. The event was a tremendous success with a focus on comedy: [[Russell Brand]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Rashida Jones]], [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Catherine Tate]], [[Noel Fielding]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[David Cross]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[David Walliams]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Jack Whitehall]] and many more all taking to the stage. Together with these comedy stars, [[Coldplay]] and [[Mumford &amp; Sons]] played sets, headlining the event. 

Lily currently resides in Los Angeles, CA.

&lt;!--
************** Additions must be sourced **************
Any additions must [[wp:cite]] a [[wp:reliable source]]
The source must specifically state the color you wish
to add. 

******** Please do not list colors of groups **********
Adding colors of every company, school, state, and organization
would excessively bloat the lists. Well-known colors may be an
exception.

************************* NOTE ************************
For ToC to work, the row for the first color starting with 
each letter MUST give the "id" parameter to {{Colort/1row}}.
e.g. the first color starting with "Q":
    {{Colort/Color| ... |name=[[Royal blue#Queen blue|Queen blue]]|link target=Q}}
Please keep entries in alphabetical order to 
make this more manageable.

If you wish to add a color and are unfamiliar with this format,
please request that it be added on the talk page [[talk:list of colors]]
See [[help:talk pages]]. Include a source that specifically states the 
color's name and the RGB levels. Picking the RGB levels from a color
swatch is insufficient as these levels can be distorted by compression, etc.

'''Nadine Labaki''' ({{lang-ar|نادين لبكي}}; born February 18, 1974) is a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] actress and director.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Nadine Labaki spent the first seventeen years of her life, living in a war torn environment, by 1991 the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] in Lebanon had ended.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=uuueBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Nadine+Labaki%22+%22neorealism%22+%22politics%22&amp;ots=yxRJRN6J95&amp;sig=tsfhhl81Nbrn6sTnJfN0yjd6Zc8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=New Voices in Arab Cinema|last=Armes|first=Roy|date=2015-01-29|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780253015280|location=|pages=232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her career with [[Studio El Fan]], a Lebanese talent show, in 1990. The show aired during the 1970s, which continued through to the early 2000s. At the talent show, Labaki won a prize for directing various music video productions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KANOAYzkhA8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Nadine+Labaki&amp;ots=mPP71-VVwn&amp;sig=ebzPh5HVrV86xw8dOJkqGpvGWV0#v=onepage&amp;q=Nadine%20Labaki&amp;f=false|title=Music and Media in the Arab World|last=Frishkopf|first=Michael Aaron|date=2010|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|year=|isbn=9789774162930|location=|pages=103 and 104|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labaki obtained a degree in audiovisual studies at [[Saint Joseph University]] in [[Beirut]]. In 1997, she directed her graduation film, ''11 Rue Pasteur'', which won the Best Short Film Award at the Biennale of Arab Cinema at the [[Arab World Institute]] in [[Paris]]. Labaki is unique among her fellow Lebanese and Arab Film Makers in that she was not educated or trained abroad.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=uuueBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Nadine+Labaki%22+%22neorealism%22+%22politics%22&amp;ots=yxRJRN6J95&amp;sig=tsfhhl81Nbrn6sTnJfN0yjd6Zc8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=New Voices in Arab Cinema|last=Armes|first=Roy|date=2015-01-29|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780253015280|location=|pages=232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, she attended a workshop in acting at the [[Cours Florent]] in Paris. She went on to direct advertisements and music videos for renowned Middle Eastern singers, for which she won several awards.

===As a director===
[[File:Nadine Labaki.jpg|thumb|upright|Labaki in 2007]]
In 2003, Labaki's name began to become more popular within the Arab media. 2003 was also the year when she began directing music videos for singer [[Nancy Ajram]]. The song, "Akhasmak ah" (I'll taunt you), sparked controversy due to the nudity presented and its sexually explicit dancing.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KANOAYzkhA8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Nadine+Labaki&amp;ots=mPP71-VVwn&amp;sig=ebzPh5HVrV86xw8dOJkqGpvGWV0#v=onepage&amp;q=Nadine%20Labaki&amp;f=false|title=Music and Media in the Arab World|last=Frishkopf|first=Michael Aaron|date=2010|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|year=|isbn=9789774162930|location=|pages=103 and 104|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, Labaki took part in the [[Cannes Film Festival]] Residence for six months, during that time, she wrote ''[[Caramel (film)|Caramel]]'', her first feature film. In 2006, she directed and played one of the leading roles in ''Caramel'', which showcases a Beirut that most people are not familiar with. Rather than tackle political issues that have plagued Lebanon, she presents a comedy that deals with five Lebanese women in Beirut who gather at a beauty salon and deal with issues related to love, sexuality, tradition, disappointment, and everyday ups and downs. The film premiered at the Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007, which was a commercial success in the summer of that same year. It sold worldwide and collected important prizes at many festivals around the world, garnering Labaki much acclaim both as a director and actress. It also put her on Variety's 10 Directors to Watch list at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. In 2008 the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture and Communication]] gave her the Insignia of Chevalier in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Order of Arts and Letters]].

In 2010, Labaki directed and starred in her second feature film, ''Where Do We Go Now?'' The film humorously tackles a delicate subject about a village in which church and mosque stand side by side as women try to keep their blowhard men from starting a religious war. 

The film also premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in the "[[Un Certain Regard]]" category in 2011. The film won the Cadillac people’s choice award at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It also collected many other awards in festivals around the world, like Cannes Film Festival, [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]], [[Stockholm Film Festival]]. The film was also nominated for best foreign film at the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award|Critics Choice Awards]] in Los Angeles.

In late 2013, Nadine Labaki started work on her third feature film called “Cafarnaúm” (Capernaum) which was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/1201776734-1201776734/|title=Lebanese Director Nadine Labaki Preps ‘Cafarnaúm’ (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|date=2016-05-17|work=Variety|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She intends to use mostly non-professional actors for this film, similar to her past works. 

Labaki's style of cinematography uses cinematic conventions, such as illuminations, atmosphere lighting, and silence to help convey the meaning in her films. Despite the often dangerous political situations Labaki continues to write and direct films that do not focus on conflict. 

She was selected to be on the jury for the [[Un Certain Regard]] section of the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/61349.html |title=Un Certain Regard Jury 2015 |date=7 May 2015 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |work=Cannes Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of her third feature, [[Capernaum (film)|''Capernaum'']], which won the Jury Prize at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]], [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA)  signed Labaki in all areas, but she continues to be represented in France by Art Media Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="‘Capernaum’ Director Nadine Labaki Signs With CAA"|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/capernaum-director-nadine-labaki-signs-caa-1202388485/}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===As an actress===
Nadine Labaki started acting in short films during the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FtzFBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=Nadine+Labaki+-+L.A.+Welcomes+Lebanese+Filmmaker+Nadine+Labaki,+Who+Wrote,+Stars+in+%22Caramel%22&amp;ots=Rql4y-YfZy&amp;sig=3cEa-Xr58IZFFBa-c0dIzdZxT0E#v=onepage&amp;q=nadine%20labaki&amp;f=false|title=The Global Film Book|last=Stafford|first=Roy|date=2014-01-10|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136474583|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an actor, Labaki starred in ''Stray Bullet,'' directed by [[Georges Hachem]] in 2010. She appears in the Moroccan production ''Rock The Casbah,'' directed by [[Laila Marrakchi]], alongside actors [[Hiam Abbas]] and [[Lubna Azabal]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Politics==
Through her films, Nadine Labaki connects themes from the Arab world and the Western world. Her transnational feminism highlights ordinary women affected by complex realities deeply rooted in decades of political turmoil. Nadine Labaki was a candidate on the list of the new political movement [[Beirut Madinati]] for the capital’s [[Beirut municipal election, 2016|May 2016 local election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://beirutmadinati.com/candidates/?lang=en Our Candidates]. [[Beirut Madinati]] website, retrieved 27 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Beirut Madinati focuses on social justice and the good of the public utilizing a diverse group of citizens as representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beirutmadinati.com/|title=Beirut Madinati|website=beirutmadinati.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite achieving about 40% of the popular vote, the movement lost against its opponent, the 'Beirutis' list' supported by [[Saad Hariri]], in all 6 out of 12 wards, but did not gain a single seat under the election’s one-district [[First-past-the-post voting|First-past-the-post system]].
==Personal life==
Labaki is multilingual, fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. In 2007, she married musician and composer [[Khaled Mouzanar]]. In 2009,
Nadine Labaki gave birth to her first boy, Walid. In 2016 Nadine gave birth to a daughter.

In 2016, Labaki received an honorary degree from the American University of Beirut and was the speaker at the 150th Commencement Ceremony.

The '''Perkins Opera House''' (also known as the '''Monticello Opera House''') is a historic [[opera house|theatre]] in [[Monticello, Florida]]. It is located at the corner of [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|Washington Street]] and [[U.S. Route 19 in Florida|Jefferson Street]].

== History ==
The ''Perkins Block'' was built in 1890 by Monticello businessman John H. Perkins.  This building included three first floor bays housing Perkins' mercantile interests - a [[general store]] and sewing machine shop, a [[hardware store]] and a farm implement supply store.  In addition, Perkins built a stable behind the building from which horses, mules and wagons were sold.  The second floor of the Perkins Block included a large foyer and an opera house boasting unparalleled [[acoustics]] and the largest [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] in the region.

Perkins had hopes of establishing the opera house as a major theater in the [[Southern United States|South]]. For several years, performances included both professional touring groups and local productions.  Shortly after the turn of the century, however, the [[railroads]] were re-routed, by-passing Monticello. The wealthy patrons who had once wintered in south Georgia and north Florida sought destinations further south in Florida, and the opera house faced financial disaster.

Unable to attract the once-popular theatre productions, Perkins discontinued live performances.  A failed attempt to utilize the building as a movie theater led to the abandonment of the auditorium.  Although the downstairs bays saw continuous occupation for a variety of uses, the opera house stood idle and soon fell into disrepair.

In 1972, the vision of a handful of interested people saved the opera house, with its falling plaster and leaking roof, from the destruction of the wrecker's ball. An organization was formed to provide opportunities for young performers and restore the opera house.

The Monticello Opera Company was formed in March of that year and performed at the first fund-raising event at the home of Mr. and Mrs. John H. Phipps.

[[File:Monticello opera house02.jpg|thumb|left|The Perkins opera house, seen from the east side]]

The purchase of the Perkins Block was consummated on October 17, 1973.  On that date, the Monticello Opera House, Inc. purchased the building with money raised through fund-raising efforts, a grant from the State of Florida and a private donation from Mrs. Dorothy Simpson, who held one-half interest in the building.

Maintenance and restoration of the facility continues to this day.  In a joint effort with the Florida Department of State, Division of Historic Resources, a restoration project was completed in the area of the original stairway leading to the auditorium balcony.  The construction brought the facility into compliance with fire code regulations to allow the lawful use of seating in the balcony.  The project was completed with a sensitivity to the original architectural features and makes use of original molding and wainscoting wherever possible.  Although the original seating in the balcony remained intact, the seats on the main level of the theater had to be replaced.  The current seating was donated by [[Tallahassee Community College]] President during the school's renovation of its theater.  Installation of the "new" seats was accomplished entirely with volunteer labor from members of the community.

Although the downstairs had been remodeled to accommodate those with disabilities, it was not until May 2004, that the theater became accessible. In 1999 $25,000 was donated in the memory of Dr. Gerald M. Cathey to institute fund raising efforts for installation of an elevator. An additional $25,000 was raised over the course of the next two years through donations from benefactors and production proceeds from the Opera House Stage Company.  A $50,000 matching grant from the Department of State, Division of Historical Resources resulted in the hiring of Riley Palmer Construction to complete this long desired renovation.

==Present usage==

The Monticello Opera House is commonly used for a variety of events including [[children's theater]], [[Mystery dinner|murder mystery dinners]] and large [[musicals]]. There is also a patio and gazebo in the back where weddings and receptions are held.

'''Planographic printing''' means printing from a flat surface, as opposed to a raised surface (as with [[relief print]]ing) or incised surface (as with [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing).  [[Lithograph]]y and [[offset printing|offset lithography]] are planographic processes that rely on the property that water will not mix with oil. The image is created by applying a [[:wiktionary:tusche|tusche]] (greasy substance) to a  plate or stone. (The term lithography comes from ''litho'', for ''stone'', and -''graph'' to draw.) Certain parts of the semi-absorbent surface being printed on can be made receptive to ink while others (the blank parts) reject it.

'''Project Rastko — Internet Library of Serb Culture''' ({{lang-sr|Пројекат Растко — Електронска библиотека српске културе, Projekat Rastko — Elektronska biblioteka srpske kulture}}) is a non-profit and non-governmental publishing, cultural and educational project dedicated to [[Serbs|Serb]] and Serb-related [[art]]s and [[humanities]]. It is named after [[Rastko Nemanjić]].

==Project==
The project was established in 1997 as a part of a pan-regional Balkans Cultural Network Initiative {{Fact|date=November 2007}}. Its main activities are:
* [[electronic publishing]] in the fields of [[Serbia]]n and Serbian-related arts and humanities
* scientific and cultural conferences and studies about [[Balkan]] cultural-civilizational integration {{Fact|date=November 2007}}
* bilateral and multilateral activities with other Balkan and world countries
* establishing regional centres
* technical training

The apex of the project is its [[digital library|electronic library]] with more than half a [[gigabyte]] of material, comprising [[e-book|electronic books]] and [[essay |articles]], [[photograph]]s and [[comic strip| comic]]s. Though most texts are in [[Serbian language]] there is a body of material in other languages, again mostly in [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], but also in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language |Spanish]] and other languages. 

The library contains material in both the [[public domain]] and [[copyright]]ed texts published with the authors' permissions{{Fact|date=November 2007}}, dating from earliest [[medieval]] Serb texts to contemporary [[science fiction]]. The site of the project also hosts several sites not directly related to the project.

Project Rastko also hosts the European version of [[Distributed Proofreaders]], which intends to supply [[Project Gutenberg]] with public domain texts in European languages. Project Rastko is organising a coalition of European e-libraries for the purpose of collecting public domain works, aiming to eventually have a node of Distributed Proofreaders in each European country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Puppy pregnancy syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] illness in humans brought on by [[mass hysteria]].

The syndrome is thought to be localized to villages in several states of [[India]], including [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Orissa]], and [[Chhattisgarh]], and has been reported by tens of thousands of individuals.&lt;ref name="Welle"&gt;{{cite news | title = Medicine challenges Indian superstition | newspaper = Deutsche Welle World | date = December 31, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|first=Shaikh Azizur |last=Rahman|url=http://www.dw.de/medicine-challenges-indian-superstition/a-16489334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is far more prevalent in areas with little access to education.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

People suffering from this condition believe that shortly after being bitten by a dog, puppies are conceived within their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt; This is said to be especially likely if [[Canine reproduction#Copulation|the dog is sexually excited]] at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name="Scientific"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bering | first = Jesse | title = Puppy Pregnancy Syndrome: Men Who Think They Are Pregnant with Dogs | publisher = Scientific American | date = November 15, 2011  | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/2011/11/15/puppy-pregnancy-syndrome-men-who-are-pregnant-with-dogs/ | accessdate = March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are said to bark like dogs, and have reported being able to see the puppies inside them when looking at water, or hear them growling in their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;{{cite news | last = Achin | first = Kurt | title = Bizarre Medical Myth Persists In Rural India | newspaper =Voice of America | date = March 26, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/bizarre-medical-myth-persists-in-rural-india-143818636/179310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the victims will eventually die – especially men, who will give birth to their puppies through the penis.&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt;

[[Witch doctors]] offer oral cures, which they claim will dissolve the puppies, allowing them to pass through the digestive system and be excreted "without the knowledge of the patient".&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

Doctors in India have tried to educate the public about the dangers of believing in this condition.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; Most sufferers are referred to psychiatric services, but in rare instances patients fail to take anti-[[rabies]] medication in time, thinking that they have puppy pregnancy syndrome and thus the witch doctor's medicine will cure them.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt; This is further compounded by witch doctors stating that their medicine will fail if sufferers seek conventional treatment.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

Some psychiatrists believe that the syndrome meets the criteria for a [[Culture-bound syndrome|culture-bound disorder]].&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

'''Saint Martin's School of Art''' was an [[art school|art college]] in London, England. It offered foundation and degree level courses. It was established in 1854, initially under the aegis of the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. Saint Martin's became part of the [[London Institute]] in 1986,&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; and in 1989 merged with the [[Central School of Art and Design]] to form [[Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design]].&lt;ref name=frieze/&gt;

==History==
Saint Martin's School of Art was established in 1854 by [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry Mackenzie]], [[vicar]] of the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. It became independent from the church in 1859.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; 

The school was at first housed on the top floor of [[St Martin's Northern School]] in Shelton Street (then called Castle Street), to the north of [[Long Acre, London|Long Acre]].&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;

The Gilbert-Garret Competition for Sketching Clubs was founded at Saint Martin's in 1870, when John Parker was headmaster. It was named after [[John Gilbert (painter)|Sir John Gilbert]], the first president of the school.&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;[s.n.] (1904-1905). [http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/general/Arts-And-Crafts-Magazine/Art-School-Exhibitions-2.html#.UfzxAOBEBID Art School Exhibitions]. ''Arts and Crafts: a monthly practical magazine for the studio, the workshop &amp; the home''. '''1–2'''. UIN: BLL01002839292. (unpaginated online text). Accessed August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1952 to 1979 [[Frank Martin (sculptor)|Frank Martin]] was head of the [[sculpture]] department of Saint Martin's. He brought in young sculptors such as [[Anthony Caro]], [[Robert Clatworthy (sculptor)|Robert Clatworthy]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] to teach, and also employed as part-time teachers recent graduates of the department, including David Annesley, Michael Bolus, [[Phillip King (artist)|Phillip King]], [[Tim Scott (artist)|Tim Scott]], Bill Tucker and [[Isaac Witkin]].&lt;ref name=frieze/&gt;&lt;ref name=poussin/&gt;&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt; Caro's influence was particularly strong, and the group around him came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors. The sculpture department became, in the words of Tim Scott: "the most famous in the art world".&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt;

The first public performance of the [[Sex Pistols]] took place at the school on 6 November 1975; they were the support band for a group called [[Bazooka Joe (band)|Bazooka Joe]].&lt;ref name=sharp/&gt;

[[File:persian rug.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A rug produced by the [[Basseri|Basseri tribe]]]]
A '''Shiraz carpet''' ({{lang-fa|قالی شیراز}}) is a type of [[Persian rug]] made in the villages around the city of [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], in the Iranian province of [[Fars Province|Fars]]. 

Designs tend to come from settled tribal weavers so they mimic [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], [[Khamseh]] ([[Basseri]] and [[Khamseh Arabs]]), [[Afshar people|Afshar]], Abadeh and Luri designs.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Since the weavers are using fixed looms the rugs tend to be larger and often coarser than their tribal counterparts.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Shiraz rugs are not often very finely knotted, with both Qashqai and Abadeh both having a finer knot. Shiraz utilizes the Persian (asymmetrical) knot.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
 
Some pieces feature Cyrus' white horse. The Shiraz carpet is the only rug to depict nightingales, which are shown as angular-shaped birds. These birds are said to symbolise contentment and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental rugs: a complete guide - Charles W. Jacobsen, C. E. Tuttle Co. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The rugs of the [[Basseri|Basseri tribe]], one of the [[persian people|Persian]] tribes of the [[Fars province]], are famous for their colorful designs. Orange is the specific color of Basseri rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marvdashtonline.ir/728.ir/show.asp?id=2739|title = Basseri tribe history|date = |accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = Marvdashtnama (Persian)|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:spinartjg.jpg|thumb|right|''Spin art'']]
'''Spin art''' is an art form that uses [[paint]], a canvas such as glossy cardboard and a spinning platform. It is primarily used to entertain and expose [[children]] to the process of art creation, although it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

==Techniques==
[[Image:SPINARTTIMELAPSE.gif|thumb|left|''Spin art time lapse'']]
To create spin art, an artist initially decorates or drips paint onto a canvas. The canvas can be anything; however, the most common form of canvas is a small rectangular piece of cardboard.  Before the paint on the canvas dries, the artist secures the canvas to a platform that can be rotated at high speed. Once the canvas is secure, the artist can then begin spinning the canvas. Most spinning platforms are electrical or battery operated, with more elaborate platforms enabling the artist to vary the rotational speed.

As the canvas rotates, [[centrifugal force]]s draw the wet paint outwards, creating intricate designs. The artist can drip more paint onto the canvas while it is spinning, thus layering paints on top of each other, creating different effects. Using different colors, a skilled spin artist can blend colors together into subtle designs. At any point during this process, the artist can stop the spinning platform to view the canvas. Since the canvas is usually rotating at a high rate, it is difficult if not impossible to view the image on the canvas until the platform has stopped spinning, thus creating a sense of surprise and uncertainty during the creation process.

Since the 1960s spin art can be seen in the works of certain contemporary artists. The artists using this technique often reconfigure their own machines by incorporating a more powerful engine than those belonging to schools. The variety of results that this technique produces gives us a good idea of the infinite possibilities.

Professional artists:

'''Alfons Schilling'''
{{main article|Alfons Schilling}}
During the 1960s Alfons Schilling was one of the first artists to become interested in spin art. action painting also had a large influence on his work and added to its originality. Instead of installing it vertically he did it horizontally.

'''Annick Gendron'''
{{main article|Annick Gendron}}
From 1968 to 1973 the French artist Annick Gendron used industrial wheels to spin paint on Plexiglas. At the end of the 1960s she was one of the first artist to use centrifugal force to produce large-sized artworks. Inspired by children's games : spin art, spin painting, her goal was to transcend this modest use to get the most spectacular effects from it. Damien Hirst got the same idea in the 1990s, as her he transcends the original practice, by the use of more spectacular materials, sizes, shapes, and skill improvement. Her work has been shown at the Raymond Duncan Gallery, at the [[Bernheim-Jeune]] Gallery, at the Salon des Indépendants and Surindependant at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, at the Salon des Artistes Français at the Grand Palais and the Salon d'Automne in Paris.

'''Damien Hirst'''
{{main article|Damien Hirst}}
From 1995 the British artist Damien Hirst started a series of spin paintings. His finished pieces are circular in shape and mounted onto steel frames. This is a series of original works of art and screen prints. He was inspired by memories of the technique of spin painting which he saw as a child on the BBC's ''Blue Peter''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hirsts-spinning-wheel-brings-good-fortune-1155421.html Hirst's spinning wheel brings good fortune]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Stafford'''

During the late 1960s developed a spinning rotating machine on which he attached raw canvas and sprayed acrylic paint while the drum spun. He exhibited those abstract paintings in the United States and in Germany in 1968-1969. Several are in important museum collections including the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abstract-art.com/abstraction/l1_7pntgrs_Show_fldr/47Stafford.html Abstract-Art.com, Lawrence Stafford]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Chadwick'''

Mark Chadwick's art is concerned by the use of machines in a production of an artwork, questioning what happens to an artwork once a machine has been used in its production. Chadwick often creates paintings using the spinning technique to introduce the element of chance and questioning the control of the artist. He consistently changes the method and considers all types of aspects to create different works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riseart.com/article/2013-05-01-introducing-mark-chadwick&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fiancée of Belus''''' ({{lang-fr|La fiancée de Bélus}}) is a painting by French artist [[Henri-Paul Motte]] based on a fanciful [[Babylonia]]n ritual associated with deity [[Bel (mythology)|Belus]] (Bel). According to that ritual, Bel was offered a girl who sat on the lap of the Bel's statue overnight, and then was replaced by another, all of whom were the winners of daily beauty contests.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://fr.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/943594/interview-de-come-fabre-deux-toiles-insolites-entrent-au-musee |title=Interview de Côme Fabre : deux toiles insolites entrent au Musée d'Orsay|language=French|publisher=[[Louise Blouin Media]]| date=8 August 2013| accessdate =4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motte cited as a reference the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], but the related quote was later found to be invented.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; ''The Fiancee of Belus'' features oversized, [[Academic art|Academic style]], while the foreground shows blood spattered by the brush.&lt;ref name="blou"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/944399/musee-dorsay-curator-tackles-the-ultimate-taboo-academic-art|title=Musee D'Orsay Curator Tackles the Ultimate Taboo: Academic Art|publisher=[[Louise Blouin Media]]| date=15 Aug 2013| accessdate =17 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To restore the interior of the Babylonian temple, Motte copied the Greek temple in Olympia, while the sculpture is inspired by [[lamassu]].&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

In 2013, the painting was acquired by the [[Musée d'Orsay]] where it is presently kept. It was previously housed in [[Galerie Vincent Lecuyer]], near Musée d’Orsay and was exhibited in Brussels at [[BRAFA Art Fair]] and [[PAD fair]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="blou"/&gt;

'''''The Slim Shady LP''''' is the second studio album and the major-label debut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Gil|title=Best Of '99: Eminem Pulls No Punches On Major-Label Debut Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/511899/best-of-99-eminem-pulls-no-punches-on-major-label-debut-album/|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=MTV News|date=9 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; by American rapper [[Eminem]]. It was released on February 23, 1999 by [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]]. Recorded in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]], following Eminem's recruitment by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]], the album features production from Dr. Dre, the [[Bass Brothers]], and Eminem himself. ''The Slim Shady LP'' is his first album with a major label after his first album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' was released on an independent label in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Gil|title=Best Of '99: Eminem Pulls No Punches On Major-Label Debut Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/511899/best-of-99-eminem-pulls-no-punches-on-major-label-debut-album/|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=MTV News|date=9 February 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913062602/http://www.mtv.com/news/511899/best-of-99-eminem-pulls-no-punches-on-major-label-debut-album/|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the album's lyrical content is written from the perspective of the rapper's [[alter ego]] Slim Shady, whom the rapper created on the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' (1997). The lyrics are noted for their depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity.

The album was met with both critical and commercial success; critics praised Eminem for his unique lyrical style, and the album debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] behind [[TLC (band)|TLC]]'s ''[[FanMail]]'' with 283,000 copies sold in its opening week. "[[Just Don't Give a Fuck]]", from the [[Slim Shady EP]], was released in October 1998. 

The first official single, "[[My Name Is]]", peaked at number 36 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming his first entry on that chart. ''The Slim Shady LP'' went on to be certified quadruple-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and has sold over 18 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biggest selling artist of the 21st century|url=https://medium.com/@shelrochaleal/the-biggest-selling-artist-of-the-21st-century-958352bda1ca|accessdate=25 September 2018|publisher=A Medium Corporation|date=2 February 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rap Album]], and in 2012, the album was ranked number 275 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ''Magazine'''s  list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time - Eminem, 'The Slim Shady LP'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/eminem-the-slim-shady-lp-20120524|website=Rolling Stone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510002609/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/eminem-the-slim-shady-lp-20120524|archivedate=2015-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Slim Shady LP'' turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. [[Interscope Records]] awarded him with his own record label, [[Shady Records]], and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the [[Vans Warped Tour]] and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] and a negative influence on American youth.

== Background ==
Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'', which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the [[Bass Brothers]], was released under their independent record label [[Web Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Infinite'' achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations.  The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock &amp; roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  After the release of ''Infinite'', Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.&lt;ref name="allmusicbio"&gt;{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=Eminem – Biography |url=http://allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |work=AllMusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129034257/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |archivedate=November 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappointment of ''Infinite'' inspired Eminem to create the [[alter ego]] Slim Shady: "Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play ''[[Slim Shady EP]]''. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide [[rap battle]] competition.  He placed second, and the staff at [[Interscope Records]] who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the ''Slim Shady EP'' to company CEO [[Jimmy Iovine]].&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer [[Dr. Dre]], founder of [[Aftermath Entertainment]].  Dr. Dre recalled, "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'"&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.

==Recording==
[[File:Dr. Dre.jpg|thumb|190px|Eminem had idolized ''The Slim Shady LP'' co-producer Dr. Dre (''pictured in 2008'') since he was a teenager.]]
''The Slim Shady LP'' was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]] in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Studiowhere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|title=Studio Where Eminem Worked On Shady LP Up For Auction|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=December 14, 2004|accessdate=March 4, 2012|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111120430/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|archivedate=November 11, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group [[N.W.A]] as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much&amp;nbsp;... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre."&lt;ref name="Bozza24"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions.&lt;ref name="Stubbs58"&gt;Stubbs, 2006. p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;  The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his [[freestyle rap]]s; "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled.&lt;ref name="Stubbs58"/&gt; He later said: "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." "&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished "[[My Name Is]]" in an hour.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  Three other songs, including "Role Model", were also recorded that day.&lt;ref name="Bozza24"/&gt;

"[['97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde]]", which was formerly featured on the ''Slim Shady EP'' as "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for ''The Slim Shady LP'' to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to [[Chuck E. Cheese's]]. However, he really took her to the recording studio.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; He explained, "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." Eminem also said, "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  The song "[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted [[Dee Barnes]].  Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre "fell out of his chair laughing" upon hearing the lyric.&lt;ref name="Stubbs68"&gt;Stubbs, 2006. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle.  After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.&lt;ref name="Bozza43"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Another skit, "Bitch", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor [[Henry Winkler]], tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem's music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chonin|first1=Neva|title=Rage Against the Past / Eminem is a former skinny white kid who raps with a vengeance|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Rage-Against-the-Past-Eminem-is-a-former-skinny-2931902.php|accessdate=January 19, 2018|date=May 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Eminem was mixing ''The Slim Shady LP'', at the same time, [[Kid Rock]] was recording his fourth studio album, ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]''; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record [[scratching]] for Eminem's song "My Fault", which appears on ''The Slim Shady LP''; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock's song "Fuck Off" for ''Devil Without a Cause''.&lt;ref name=freepearly&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2015/08/26/kid-rock-early-years-detroit/31193049/&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's production was handled primarily by the [[Bass Brothers]], Dr Dre, and Eminem.&lt;ref name="Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/02/23/eminem-slim-shady-lp-anniversary/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129185225/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/02/23/eminem-slim-shady-lp-anniversary/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 29, 2013|title=Eminem's The Slim Shady LP, 12 Years Later|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllmusicReview"/&gt;  The beats have been compared to [[West Coast hip hop]] and [[G-funk]] musical styles.&lt;ref name="RSReview"/&gt;  Kyle Anderson of [[MTV]] wrote that "The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play."&lt;ref name="Newsroom"/&gt;  According to the staff at [[IGN]], "'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde" is backed by the "lulling serenity of a super silky groove".&lt;ref name="IGNReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/565/565938p1.html|title=The Slim Shady LP - Over-the top horror-core with fat beats|author=IGN Staff|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=November 12, 2004|accessdate=March 11, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022014750/http://music.ign.com/articles/565/565938p1.html|archivedate=October 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Cum on Everybody"; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae&lt;ref name="Stubbs78"&gt;Stubbs, 2006. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while "My Name Is", which is built around a piano "sample" from British musician [[Labi Siffre]]'s "I Got The", features a prominent [[bassline]] and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-style keyboards.&lt;ref name="Newsroom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozza25" /&gt;  "I'm Shady" was originally written over a [[Sade (band)|Sade]] track, but after hearing a "sample" of [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s "Pusherman" in [[Ice-T]]'s song "[[I'm Your Pusher (Ice-T song)|I'm Your Pusher]]", Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use "Pusherman".&lt;ref name="Stubbs84"&gt;Stubbs, 2006. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminem's vocal inflection on the record has been described as a "nasal whine"; Jon Pareles of ''[[The New York Times]]'' likened his "calmly sarcastic delivery" to "the early [[Beastie Boys]] turned cynical".&lt;ref name="NYtimesrev"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/17/arts/pop-review-a-rapper-more-gauche-than-gangsta.html|title=Pop Review; A Rapper More Gauche Than Gangsta|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=April 17, 1999|accessdate=July 12, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113094605/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/17/arts/pop-review-a-rapper-more-gauche-than-gangsta.html|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper's vocals to "[[Pee-wee Herman]] with a nasal Midwestern accent".&lt;ref name="ctrev"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-04-09/features/9904090063_1_slim-shady-lp-eminem-vanilla-ice|title=Feeding the Frenzy|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|date=April 9, 1999|accessdate=July 12, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103160810/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-04-09/features/9904090063_1_slim-shady-lp-eminem-vanilla-ice|archivedate=November 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skit entitled "Lounge" appears before "My Fault" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating [[rat pack]] crooners.

Many of the songs from ''The Slim Shady LP'' are written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff".&lt;ref name="Bite"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bite me|last=Verrico|first=Lisa|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=May 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the [[horror film]] genre: "Why can't people see that records can be like movies?  The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen."&lt;ref name="Noshame?"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/entertainment/ca-29770|title=Has He No Shame?|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=May 14, 2000|accessdate=March 11, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715014258/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/entertainment/ca-29770|archivedate=July 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] by critics and commentators.&lt;ref name="Guardiancover"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cover story: Emma Brockes meets Eminem|last=Brockes|first=Emma|date=November 12, 1999|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, "I have a fairly salty relationship with women&amp;nbsp;... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'"&lt;ref name="Guardiancover"/&gt;  Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word "[[nigga]]" on the album, with the rapper noting, "It's not in my vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Guardiancover"/&gt; ''The Slim Shady LP'' begins with a "Public Service Announcement" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic [[disclaimer]] discussing the album's explicit lyrical content.&lt;ref name="Bestskit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-skits/eminem-public-service-announcement-2000|title=The 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Skits - Eminem "Public Service Announcement"|last=Alvarez|first=Gabriel|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=March 11, 2012|work=Complex|publisher=Complex Media|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109035556/http://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-skits/eminem-public-service-announcement-2000|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the album, a skit entitled "Paul" features a phone call from [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]] to Eminem telling him to "tone down" his lyrics.&lt;ref name="Hasted111"&gt;Hasted, 2011. p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

"Guilty Conscience" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre.  The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the "angel" and "devil" sides of the characters' conscience, respectively.&lt;ref name="Newsroom"/&gt;  The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party.&lt;ref name="Noshame?"/&gt; In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in "Guilty Conscience", the outcome is unclear.&lt;ref name="Noshame?"/&gt;  On "My Fault", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on [[Psilocybin mushrooms|psychedelic mushrooms]] at a [[rave]].&lt;ref name="Bozza49"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  "[['97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde]]" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife's corpse. It is an [[epilogue]] to the song "[[Kim (Eminem song)|Kim]]", although "'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter.&lt;ref name="Noshame?"/&gt;  Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that "There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it's not because of what it describes, it's how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words."&lt;ref name="AllmusicReview"/&gt;  On the song "Brain Damage", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school.&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451396/alleged-bully-sues-eminem-1-million.jhtml|title=Alleged Bully From Eminem's 'Brain Damage' Files $1 Million Suit|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=December 10, 2001|accessdate=February 16, 2012|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202035439/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451396/alleged-bully-sues-eminem-1-million.jhtml|archivedate=February 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing ''The Slim Shady LP'', Anthony Bozza of ''Rolling Stone'' described Eminem as "probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem.  His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-blows-up-20091105|title=Eminem Blows Up|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2012|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FxQwPdj4?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-blows-up-20091105|archivedate=April 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem was inspired to write "Rock Bottom" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual.&lt;ref name="Stubbs81" /&gt;  He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as "discouraged, hungry, and malnourished."&lt;ref name="Stubbs81"/&gt;  "If I Had" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is "tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour".&lt;ref name="Hartigan162"&gt;Hartigan, 2005. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the "white trash" stereotype.&lt;ref name="Hartigan161"&gt;Hartigan, 2005. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was met with general acclaim from [[music critics]]. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's "expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination", adding that "Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make ''The Slim Shady LP'' one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music."&lt;ref name="AllmusicReview"/&gt;  David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the album's "unapologetic outrageousness" as a reaction to the "soul positivity" of [[conscious hip hop]], noting that "''The Slim Shady LP'' marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes&amp;nbsp;... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch."&lt;ref name="EWeekly Review"/&gt;  Soren Baker of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that "He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time" but lamented the "sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem."&lt;ref name="LATimes Review"/&gt;

Many reviewers commented on the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of ''[[Popular Communications]]'' states, "Eminem's music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodman|first=Gilbert|title=And Other Four Letter Words: Eminem And The Cultural Politics Of Authenticity|journal=[[Popular Communications]]|year=2006|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that "the wife-killing jokes of "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than [[Garth Brooks]]', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass [[Bloodhound Gang]] record."&lt;ref name="RSReview"/&gt; Nathan Rabin of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' felt that although the album is "sophomoric and uninspired" at times, Eminem's "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas."&lt;ref name="Rabin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/eminem-the-slim-shady-lp,20723/|title=Eminem: The Slim Shady LP - Review|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|work=''[[The A.V.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Eminem-01-mika.jpg|thumb|The success of the album transformed Eminem into an international celebrity. Pictured in a concert in [[Munich]], Germany in October 1999]]
After the success of ''The Slim Shady LP'', Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. [[Interscope Records]] awarded him with his own record label, [[Shady Records]]; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]].&lt;ref name="Hasted 123"&gt;Hasted, 2011. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: "This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree&amp;nbsp;... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop myself from spoiling her."&lt;ref name="Hasted 123"/&gt;

To promote ''The Slim Shady LP'', Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule.  He joined the [[Vans Warped Tour]] as a last-minute replacement for [[Cypress Hill]], a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami.&lt;ref name="Huxley79"&gt;Huxley, 2000. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night.&lt;ref name="Hasted 123"/&gt; During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs.&lt;ref name="Huxley79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasted 125"&gt;Hasted, 2011. p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, "I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder."&lt;ref name="Hasted 125"/&gt; However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on ''[[Total Request Live]]''.&lt;ref name="Huxley79"/&gt;

Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content.  He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by ''Billboard'' editor in chief [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]], the writer accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] about "slapping a pregnant bitch" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of ''The Slim Shady LP''.&lt;ref name="Hasted 125"/&gt; The rapper defended himself by saying, "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;

==Lawsuits==
On September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for [[slander]] based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line "I just found out my mom does more dope than I do" from "My Name Is".&lt;ref name="Bozza69"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thereal"&gt;{{cite news|title=INTERVIEW: Who's the real Slim Shady?|last=Verrico|first=Lisa|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|publisher=[[Johnston Press]]|date=January 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees.&lt;ref name="Bozza69"/&gt; Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a "lawsuit queen", and alleging that "That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda.

In December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in [[Roseville, Michigan]] who was made the subject of the song "Brain Damage" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and [[Expectation of privacy|invasion of privacy]].&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"/&gt; Bailey's attorney stated "Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry&amp;nbsp;... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism."&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"/&gt; In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"/&gt; Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of ''Rolling Stone Magazine''.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed by judge [[Deborah Servitto]] in 2003, who rapped in her explanation that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem's entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event.&lt;ref name="victim"/&gt; The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey's lawyer ruled out any further appeals.&lt;ref name="victim"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eminem safe from bully's lawsuit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4451583.stm|accessdate=June 17, 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=April 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that "Guilty Conscience" contains an unauthorized sample of "Go Home Pigs" composed for the film ''[[Getting Straight]]'' by her husband, [[Ronald Stein]], who died in 1988.&lt;ref name="OldLady"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478649/eminem-sued-over-sample.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Sued&amp;nbsp;...

'''Toy theater''', also called '''paper theater''' and '''model theater''' (also spelt '''theatre''', see [[British and American spelling differences|spelling differences]]), is a form of miniature theater dating back to the early 19th century in Europe. Toy theaters were often printed on [[paperboard]] sheets and sold as kits at the [[concession stand]] of an [[opera house]], [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]], or [[vaudeville|vaudeville theater]]. Toy theaters were assembled at home and performed for family members and guests, sometimes with live musical accompaniment. Toy theater saw a drastic decline in popularity with a shift towards [[realism (theatre)|realism]] on the European stage in the late 19th century, and again  with the arrival of [[television]] after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, John. "A Short Entertaining History of Toy Theater." Cambridge: Great Small Works, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Toy theater has seen a resurgence in recent years among many [[puppeteer]]s, [[author]]s and [[filmmaker]]s and there are numerous international toy theater festivals throughout the Americas and Europe.

==History==
===Late 18th and early 19th century===
The original toy theaters were mass-produced replicas of popular plays, sold as kits that people assembled at home, including stage, scenery, characters and costumes. They were printed on paperboard, available at English playhouses and commercial libraries for "a penny plain or two pence coloured." Hobbyists often went to great pains to not only hand-color their stages, but to embellish their toy theater personae with bits of cloth and tinsel. Just as the toy-sized stages diminished a play’s scale, their corresponding scripts tended to abridge the text, paring it down to key characters and lines for a shorter, less complicated presentation.

In the first half of the 19th century more than 300 of London’s most popular plays saw issue as toy theaters. Publishers sent artists to the playhouses of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and early-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] London to record the scenery, costumes and dramatic attitudes of the greatest successes of the day. The theatre management often provided these artists with a free seat, as the toy theatre sheets were excellent free advertising.

===Late 19th and early 20th century===
Stage theater of the early 19th century had been based more on spectacle than on depth of plot or character, and these characteristics lent themselves effectively to the format of toy theater. Toward the end of the 19th century, European popular drama had shifted its preference to the trend of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], marking a dramaturgical swing toward psychological complexity, character motivation and settings utilizing ordinary three-dimensional scenic elements. This trend in stage theater did not make an easy conversion to its toy counterpart, and with the fanciful dramas of 50 years prior being out of fashion, the toy theaters that remained in print fell into obsolescence. 

Despite its fall in popularity, toy theater remained in the realm of influential artists who championed its resurgence. In 1884 British author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote an essay in tribute of toy theater’s tiny grandeur entitled “Penny Plain, Twopence Coloured” in which he extolled the virtues of the dramas supplied by [[Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop|Pollock's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spitalfieldslife.com/2009/12/17/penny-plain-tuppence-coloured/  Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop on the Spitalfields Life website - 17 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftsmanship.net/the-rise-and-fall-of-toy-theatre/ The Rise and Fall of Toy Theatre - Craftsmanship Magazine - 6 December 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Other children’s authors like [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] also dabbled in toy theater, as did [[Oscar Wilde]]. The brothers [[Jack Butler Yeats|Jack]] and [[William Butler Yeats]] both used toy theaters as mock-ups for their work in art and stagecraft. In the 20th century toy theater became a tool for the [[avant-garde]], messed with by [[Futurism|Futurist]] founder [[F.T. Marienetti]] as well as [[Pablo Picasso]]. Film directors like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Orson Welles]] would use toy theaters as staging grounds for their cinematic masterpieces, and [[Laurence Olivier]] even made a toy theater of his film version of ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'', mass-produced with a little paper cutout of himself in the starring role.  But after its second wave boom, toy theater fell into a second recession, replaced in the 1950s, by a different box in people’s sitting rooms that needed no live operator and whose sets, characters, stories and musical numbers were beamed in electronically from miles away to be projected on the glass of a cathode ray tube: [[television]].

===Late 20th and early 21st century===
[[File:GeniZepelin05.JPG|thumb|Ainé Adriana Martelli performing Gení y el Zepelin at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]
Toy theater has been enjoying a revival in recent decades. Collectors and traditionalists perform restored versions of Victorian plays while experimental puppeteers push the form’s limits, adapting the works of [[Isaac Babel]] and [[Italo Calvino]], as well as that of unsung storytellers, friends, neighbors, relatives, and themselves. Contemporary toy theater may utilize any available technology and cover any subject, and numerous international toy theater festivals occur regularly throughout the Americas and Europe, attracting many well-known actors, musicians and authors to their stages.

==Construction and format==
[[Mass-produced]] toy theaters are usually sold as printed sheets, either in black and white to be colored as desired, or as full-color images of the [[proscenium]], scenery, sets, props and characters. The sheets are pasted onto thin [[Paperboard|cardboard]], cut out, and then assembled for the purposes of the reenacting of a play. Figures are attached to small sticks, wires, or configurations of strings that allow them to move about the set. Some toy theaters and figures are enhanced with moving parts and special effects, and it is common for performances to include live or pre-recorded sound effects and music.

==In modern media==

{{nihongo|'''Yoshiko Yamaguchi'''|山口 淑子|Yamaguchi Yoshiko}} (12 February 1920 – 7 September 2014) was a Chinese-born Japanese actress and singer who made a career in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States.

Early in her career, the [[Manchukuo Film Association]] concealed her Japanese origin and she went by the Chinese name '''Li Xianglan''', rendered in Japanese as '''Ri Kōran'''. This allowed her to represent China in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war, she appeared in Japanese movies under her real name, as well as in several English-language movies under the stage name '''Shirley Yamaguchi'''.

She was elected as a member of the [[Japanese parliament]] in the 1970s and served for 18 years. After retiring from politics, she served as vice president of the [[Asian Women's Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awf.or.jp/pdf/news_18.pdf 大鷹淑子副理事長に聞く「21世紀のいま、若い人々に伝えたいこと」] Asian Women's Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was born in 12 February 1920 to Japanese parents, {{nihongo|Fumio Yamaguchi|山口 文雄|Yamaguchi Fumio}} and {{nihongo|Ai Yamaguchi|山口 アイ|Yamaguchi Ai}}, who were then settlers in [[Fushun]], [[Manchuria]], Republic of China.

Fumio Yamaguchi was an employee of the [[South Manchuria Railway]]. From an early age, Yoshiko was exposed to [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]]. Fumio Yamaguchi had some influential Chinese acquaintances, among whom were Li Jichun ({{lang|zh|李際春}}) and Pan Yugui ({{lang|zh|潘毓桂}}). By Chinese custom for those who became sworn brothers, they also became Yoshiko's "godfathers" （also known as "nominal fathers"）and bestowed upon her two Chinese names, Li Xianglan (Li Hsiang-lan) and Pan Shuhua ({{lang|zh|潘淑華}}). ("Shu" in Shuhua and "Yoshi" in Yoshiko are written with the same [[Chinese character]]). Yoshiko later used the former name as a stage name and assumed the latter name while she was staying with the Pan family in Beijing.

As a youth Yoshiko suffered a bout of tuberculosis. In order to strengthen her breathing, the doctor recommended voice lessons. Her father initially insisted on traditional Japanese music, but Yoshiko preferred Western music and thus received her initial classical vocal education from an Italian dramatic soprano (Madame Podresov, married into [[White Emigre|White Russian]] nobility). She later received schooling in Beijing, polishing her Mandarin, accommodated by the Pan family.  She was a [[coloratura soprano]].

==Career in China==
Yoshiko made her debut as an actress and singer in the 1938 film ''Honeymoon Express 蜜月快車'', by [[Manchuria Film Production]]. She was billed as Li Xianglan, pronounced Ri Kōran in Japanese. The adoption of a Chinese stage name was prompted by the film company's economic and political motives—a Manchurian girl who had command over both the Japanese and Chinese languages was sought after. From this she rose to be a star and ''Japan-Manchuria Goodwill Ambassadress'' (日満親善大使). The head of the Manchukuo film industry, General [[Masahiko Amakasu]] decided she was the star he was looking for: a beautiful actress fluent in both Mandarin and Japanese who could pass as Chinese and who had an excellent singing voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese actors who appeared in the Manchuria Film Productions films were never informed that she was Japanese, but they suspected she was at least half-Japanese as she always ate her meals with the Japanese actors instead of with the Chinese actors, was given white rice to eat instead of the sorghum given to the Chinese, and was paid ten times more than the Chinese actors were.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though in her subsequent films she was almost exclusively billed as Li Xianglan, she appeared in a few as "Yamaguchi Yoshiko." Many of her films bore some degree of promotion of the Japanese national policy (in particular pertaining to the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere ideology) and can be termed "National Policy Films" ({{lang|zh|国策映画}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baskett|2008|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1940 film ''China Nights'' (支那の夜), also known as ''Shanghai Nights'' ({{lang|zh|上海の夜}}), by Manchuria Film Productions, is especially controversial. It is unclear whether it was a "National Policy Film" as it portrays Japanese soldiers in both positive and negative lights. In this film, Li Xianglan played a young woman of extreme anti-Japanese sentiment who falls in love with a Japanese man. A key turning point in the film has the young Chinese woman being slapped by the Japanese man, but instead of hatred, she reacts with gratitude. The film was met with great aversion among the Chinese audience as they believed that the Chinese female character was a sketch of [[debasement]] and inferiority. 23,000 Chinese people paid to see the film in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;映画旬報」昭和18年6月1日号 20・21p 中国人の鑑識眼 野口久光&lt;/ref&gt; But after the war, one of her classic songs, "Suzhou Serenade" (蘇州夜曲), was banned in China and continues to be. A few years later when confronted by angry Chinese reporters in Shanghai, Yoshiko apologized and cited as pretext her inexperienced youth at the time of filmmaking, choosing not to reveal her Japanese identity. Though her Japanese nationality was never divulged in the Chinese media until after the Sino-Japanese War, it was brought to light by Japanese press when she performed in Japan under her assumed Chinese name and as the Japan-Manchuria Goodwill Ambassadress.  Oddly enough, when she visited Japan during this period, she was criticized for being too Chinese in dress and in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baskett|2008|pp=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

format=[[Ogg]]}} When she landed in Japan in 1941 for a publicity tour, dressed in a ''cheongsam'' and while speaking Japanese with a Mandarin accent, the customs officer asked her upon seeing she had a Japanese passport and a Japanese name: "Don't you know that we Japanese are the superior people? Aren't you ashamed to be wearing third-rate Chink clothes and speaking their language as you do?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Yoshiko appeared in the film ''[[Eternity (1943 film)|Eternity]]'' (萬世流芳). The film was shot in Shanghai commemorating the centennial of the [[Opium War]]. A few top Chinese stars in Shanghai also appeared in the film and consequently endured the repercussions of controversy. Though the film, anti-British in nature, was a collaboration between Chinese and Japanese film companies, its anti-colonization undertone might also be interpreted as a satire of the Japanese expansion in east Asia. Despite all this, the film was a hit and Yoshiko became a national sensation. Her film theme songs with [[jazz]]/[[popular music|pop]]-like arrangements such as "Candy-Peddling Song" ({{lang|zh|賣糖歌}}) and "Quitting (Opium) Song" ({{lang|zh|戒煙歌}}) elevated her status to among the top singers in all Chinese-speaking regions in Asia overnight. Many songs recorded by Yoshiko during her Shanghai period became classics in Chinese popular music history. Other noteworthy hits include "Tuberoses"/"Fragrance of the Night" (夜來香), "Ocean Bird" (海燕), "If Only" (恨不相逢未嫁時), and "Second Dream" (第二夢).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baskett|2008|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s, she had become one of the [[Seven great singing stars]].&lt;ref name="Baidu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bk.baidu.com/view/310270.htm|publisher=Baidu|title=Bai Guang|accessdate=April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan, United States and Hong Kong==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
At the end of World War II she was arrested by the Chinese government for treason and collaboration with the Japanese. After her childhood Russian friend helped locate Yamaguchi's Japanese birth certificate, she was cleared of all charges, and possibly the death penalty, since she was not a Chinese national after all. Before long in 1946, she resettled in Japan and launched a new acting career there under the name '''Yoshiko Yamaguchi,''' working with directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Several of her post-war films cast her in parts that dealt either directly or indirectly with her wartime persona as a bilingual and bicultural performer. For example in 1949, Shin-Toho studios produced ''Repatriation'' (帰国「ダモイ」), an omnibus film which told four stories about the struggles of Japanese trying to return to Japan from the Soviet Union after having been taken prisoners after the defeat. The following year, Yamaguchi starred with actor [[Ryo Ikebe]] in ''[[Escape at Dawn]]'' (暁の脱走) produced by Toho and based on the novel ''Shunpuden'' (春婦伝). In the book, her character was a prostitute in a military brothel, but for this film her character was rewritten as a frontline entertainer who falls into a tragic affair with a deserter (Ikebe). In 1952, Yamaguchi appeared in ''Woman of Shanghai'' (上海の女) in which she reprised her pre-war persona as a Japanese woman passing for Chinese, who becomes caught between the two cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baskett|2008|pp=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, she established her acting career as '''Shirley Yamaguchi''' in Hollywood and on Broadway (in the short-lived musical "[[Shangri-La (musical)|Shangri-La]]") in the US. She married Japanese-American sculptor [[Isamu Noguchi]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamaguchi was Japanese, but as someone who had grown up in China, she felt torn between two identities and later wrote she felt attracted to Noguchi as someone else who was torn between two identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1956. She revived the Li Xianglan name and appeared in several Chinese-language films made in Hong Kong.  Some of her 1950s Chinese films were destroyed in a studio fire and have not been seen since their initial releases.  Her Mandarin hit songs from this period include "Three Years" (三年), "Plum Blossom" (梅花), "Childhood Times" (小時候), "Only You" (只有你), and "Heart Song" (心曲 – a cover of "Eternally").  She then returned to Japan and after retiring from the world of film in 1958, she appeared as a hostess and anchorwoman on TV talk shows.  As a result of her marriage to the Japanese diplomat Hiroshi Ōtaka, she lived for a while in Burma (modern Myanmar). They remained married until his death in 2001.

In 1969, she became the host of ''The Three O'Clock You'' (Sanji no anata) TV show on [[Fuji Television]], reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute as well as the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Yamaguchi became very active in pro-Palestinian causes in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, she was elected to the [[House of Councillors]] (the upper House of the [[Japanese parliament]]) as a member of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], where she served for 18 years (three terms). She co-authored the book, ''Ri Kōran, Watashi no Hansei'' (Half My Life as Ri Kōran). She served as a Vice-President of the Asian Women's Fund. As part of the 1993 autumn honours list, she was decorated with the Gold and Silver Star of the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]], Second Class.

Yamaguchi was considered by many Chinese in the post-World War II period to be a Japanese spy and thus a traitor to the Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Star By Any Other Name: The (After) Lives of Li Xianglan |first=Shelley |last=Stephenson|journal=Quarterly Review of Film and Video| volume=19| date= January 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This misconception was caused in part by Yamaguchi passing herself off as Chinese throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Her Japanese identity not being officially revealed until her post-war persecution nearly led to her execution as a Chinese traitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotta|2007|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had always expressed her guilt for taking part in Japanese propaganda films in the early days of her acting career. Because of this, she did not visit China for about 20 years after the war, since she felt that the Chinese had not forgiven her.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Ri Kōran by Tanaka, et al. "Looking Back on My Days as Ri Kōran (Li Xianglan)" on ZNet (Zmag.org) January 26, 2005. Article appeared in Sekai, September 2003, pp.171–75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her controversial past, Li Xianglan influenced future singers who covered her evergreen hits (such as [[Teresa Teng]], [[Fei Yu-Ching]], and Winnie Wei 韋秀嫻). [[Jacky Cheung]] recorded a cover of Tamaki Kōji's "行かないで" ("Ikanaide") and renamed it "Lei Hoeng Laan." (The original version does not have any references to Li Xianglan and nor does the remake. The Chinese title instead refers to the unknowable quality and identity of the singer's lover.) In January 1991, a musical about her life was released in Tokyo, which generated controversy because its negative portrayal of Manchukuo upset many Japanese conservatives.

Yamaguchi was one of the first prominent Japanese citizens to acknowledge the history of Japanese brutality during the wartime occupation.  She later campaigned for greater public awareness of that history and advocated paying reparations to so-called [[comfort women]], Korean women who were forced into sex slavery by the Japanese military during the war.&lt;ref name=vitello&gt;{{citation |last=Vitello |first=Paul |title=Yoshiko Yamaguchi, 94, Actress in Propaganda Films | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 22, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/movies/yoshiko-yamaguchi-94-actress-in-propaganda-films-dies.html?hpw&amp;rref=obituaries&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpHedThumbWell&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recording of a 1950 concert performance in [[Sacramento, California]] was uncovered by a professor from the [[University of Chicago]] in 2012. The concert included six songs and was performed before an audience of [[Japanese-Americans]], many of whom had likely been [[Japanese American internment|interned]] during World War II. Speaking in 2012 about the concert, Yamaguchi said: "I sang with hope that I could offer consolation to the Japanese-Americans, as I heard that they had gone through hardships during the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Recording of Japanese actress Yoshiko Yamaguchi's 1950 US concert uncovered |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20120818p2g00m0et054000c.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218190903/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20120818p2g00m0et054000c.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 18, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |newspaper=[[Mainichi Shimbun]] |date=August 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died at the age of 94 in Tokyo in 2014 on the same day as one of her fellow Seven great singing stars [[Gong Qiuxia]].&lt;ref name="asahi20140101"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jiji.com/jc/c?g=soc&amp;k=2014091400041 |script-title=ja:山口淑子さん死去＝女優「李香蘭」、政治家として活躍－９４歳 |trans-title=Yoshiko Yamaguchi / Li Xianglan dies at 94 |language=Japanese |date=14 September 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-14 |publisher=Jiji Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140914225009/http://www.jiji.com/jc/c?g=soc&amp;k=2014091400041 |archivedate=September 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
