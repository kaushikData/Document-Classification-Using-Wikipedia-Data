Akvo is a [[not-for-profit]]  internet and software developer, headquartered in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The foundation specializes primarily in building and operating data collection and visualization systems to be used in [[international development]] and [[aid]] activity. Akvo also operates the sustainable development wiki Akvopedia, which as of 2017 has 1956 content pages about water, sanitation and agriculture. Akvo was initially started as a project under the Netherlands Water Partnership in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dutchwatersector.com |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akvo operates from 11 offices worldwide. Akvo has hub offices based in a number of different locations, including [[Stockholm]], [[London]], [[Washington DC]], [[Nairobi]] and [[New Delhi]]. As of 2017, Akvo operates in 93 countries and works with more than 1800 organizations around the world from [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] to national governments and multilateral aid organizations who use Akvo’s tools to report, publish, monitor and evaluate their work.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"&gt;[http://ethiopia.nlembassy.org/binaries/content/assets/postenweb/e/ethiopie/netherlands-embassy-in-addis-ababa/services/general-information/ekn-water-directory.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the foundation's work is concentrated within the water and sanitation sector. However, since 2010 it has widened its focus to areas such as health, education, technology, agriculture and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/about-us/akvo-faq/#whywatsan |title=Akvo Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation's mission is "to build a highly effective, open, online platform and a trusted partner network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akvo.org/uploads/2012/12/Akvo_staff-handbook_20151.pdf |format=PDF |title=AKVO Handbook |website=Akvo.org |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson and Jeroen van der Sommen met at Stockholm [[World Water Week]] in 2006. At this time it was becoming clear that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] on water was going to be difficult to achieve and as a result there was the need to develop new ideas. Shortly thereafter, the idea of using open source software and open data for the development sector was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring-water-aid-projects.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in 2008 the Akvo Foundation was formed by the [[Netherlands Water Partnership]] and several other co founders, including Bjelkeman-Pettersson and van der Sommen as well as Mark Nitzberg, Mark Charmer, Gabriel von Heijne and Peter van der Linde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.vn.nl/thomas-bjelkeman-pettersson/ |title=Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson - Vrij Nederland |website=Vn.nl |date=2007-10-27 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Early timeline'''

September 2006 - Seed funding is provided by Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP). The partner organisations that participate in brainstorming about what Akvo should become are [[UNESCO]]-IHE, IRC International Resource Centre for Water and Sanitation (IRC) and the Movement Design Bureau.

April 2007 – Partners for Water and NWP provide the first batch of funding.

August 2007 – Akvopedia is shown for the first time at World Water Week.

In 2015, Akvo was named as the winner of the [[Water and Sanitation Award]]. The award was in recognition of Akvo’s innovation within the water and sanitation sector in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iadb.org/es/noticias/comunicados-de-prensa/2015-11-17/ganadores-premio-bid-femsa,11324.html?WT.mc_id=NewsEmail_Short_11324&amp;wtSrc=Email&amp;wtType=Short&amp;wtArticleID=11324&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in November 2015, Akvo was awarded the [[Dutch Water Innovation Prize]]. Akvo won the award for the development of a smart irrigation inlet sensor that measures the salinity of surface water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uvw.nl/waterinnovatieprijs-2015-uitgereikt/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==
Akvo designs and builds Software as a Service software as well as offering services that complement them, such as training and consulting. All Akvo's software is released as open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://github.com/akvo | title=Akvo Foundation on GitHub| date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akvo's tools are designed to work together at each stage of the monitoring cycle and therefore have three main purposes: first, capture and collect data;  second, understand this data and turn it into decisions; and third, share this data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://afrialliance.org/news/smart-solutions-for-water-and-climate/ |title=» Smart Solutions for Water and Climate |website=Afrialliance.org |date=2017-03-24 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations that use Akvo services include [[UNDP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.id.undp.org/content/indonesia/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/08/26/training-the-trainers-with-our-diy-survey-app-what-happens-next-.html |title=Training the trainers with our DIY survey app. What happens next? &amp;#124; UNDP in Indonesia |website=Id.undp.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/1852_23490.html |title=UNICEF Pacific Island Countries - Latest stories - UNICEF Pacific works with Ministry of Health &amp; Medical Services, towards increasing capacity for monitoring of WASH activities |website=Unicef.org |date=2015-01-27 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other NGOs and governments.

'''Akvo Flow''' (Field Level Operation Watch) allows field surveys to be managed and carried out using mobile phones. It can be used to collect, manage, analyse and display geographically-referenced monitoring and evaluation data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snv.org/update/akvo-flow-smart-technology-smart-development |title=Akvo FLOW: SMART technology for SMART Development &amp;#124; SNV World |website=Snv.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow was originally developed by Water for People.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banks |first=Ken |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2012/01/24/the-cellphone-that-keeps-the-water-and-data-flowing/ |title=The Cellphone that Keeps the Water, and Data, Flowing – National Geographic Society (blogs) |website=Voices.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Water for People partnered with Akvo to allow for wider use of the system and Akvo took over the development of Flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/blog/akvo-and-water-for-people-sign-flow-agreement/ |title=Akvo and Water For People sign FLOW agreement |website=Akvo.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Flow was used primarily in water and sanitation projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight |first=Matthew |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/22/health/water-sanitation-mobile/index.html?hpt=hp_c3 |title=Going with the 'FLOW' towards better sanitation - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has more recently been used in a variety of fields, including fisheries management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/mar/01/social-impacts-of-marine-protection-in-indonesia-in-pictures?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco |title=Living in Indonesia's marine protected areas - in pictures &amp;#124; Environment |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; school management &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://unicefpacific.blogspot.se/2015/09/champions-for-healthy-schools.html |title=Pacific Island Countries: Champions for healthy schools |website=Unicefpacific.blogspot.se |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disaster relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02q5dqz |title=BBC World Service - Click, Rebuilding Vanuatu with Smartphones |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-05-06 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, 3.990.763 data points have been captured with Flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/seeithappen/ |title=See it happen |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo RSR''' (Really Simple Reporting) was launched in September 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/38f27bf8-4a54-11de-8e7e-00144feabdc0 |title=Donor programmes: Sponsors can now view benefits online |website=Ft.com |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first product Akvo developed; it is a content management and reporting system for international development projects. It was described by Giulio Quaggiotto of the World Bank as "Real-time, paper-free, straight from the trenches reporting. If RSR takes off, it could be the killer application of Development 2.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/forget-rss-is-real-simple-reporting-the-killer-development-20-application |title=Forget RSS: is Real Simple Reporting the killer Development 2.0 application? &amp;#124; Private Sector Development |website=Blogs.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 4000 projects on the platform, with a combined value of over €150 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/akvo-rsr-supporting-use-of-open-data |title=Akvo RSR: Supporting use of Open Data &amp;#124; International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) |website=Aidtransparency.net |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvopedia''' was created in 2007 and was the first project that Akvo worked on. It is a Web-based, free content, water and sanitation knowledge resource. Akvopedia is written collaboratively by volunteers and specialists, mainly from the water and sanitation sector but anyone can edit and contribute. It is organised within five portals – Water, Sanitation, Finance, Sustainability and Decision &amp; assessment tools. Recently some of this content has been transferred to Wikiversity in the Rainwater Harvesting portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting |title=Rainwater harvesting - Wikiversity |publisher=En.wikiversity.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Sites''' is a [[Wordpress]] based system for easy creation and maintenance of websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/products/akvo-sites/ |title=Akvo Sites |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Caddisfly''' is a [[water quality]] and [[soil quality]] testing system based on [[smartphones]]. Akvo Caddisfly was originally invented by Ternup Research Labs to detect the precedes of [[fluoride]] in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716301553 |title=Monitoring of fluoride in water samples using a smartphone |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.156 |volume=551-552 |journal=Science of the Total Environment |pages=101–107 | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saurabh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternup joined forces with Akvo in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caddisfly.ternup.com/partnering-with-akvo/ |title=Partnering with Akvo &amp;#124; Caddisfly |website=Caddisfly.ternup.com |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caddisfly system has been extended to work with strip tests and phone-connected sensors as well as the original colorimetric tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/akvo-caddisfly/ |title=Akvo Caddisfly |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Lumen''' is a data visualisation platform and is Akvo's latest product. It is developed in the [[Clojure]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/clojure-in-akvo.html |title=JUXT Blog: Clojure in Europe: Akvo |website=Juxt.pro |date=2016-05-23 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovative communication ==
Akvo has gained notoriety for its unique external communication. Bruce Sterling said "It's an open-source sanitation project, and if that isn’t weird enough, they’ve got a Bollywood-parody promotional angle." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/06/akvos-bollywood/ |title=Akvo’s Bollywood Angle |publisher=WIRED |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Geographic Society]] reported from [[World Water Week in Stockholm]] about the WaterCube, the brainchild of Mark Charmer at Akvo: "Man-on-the-street journalism meets wonky water week. Frenetic water cube workers ushered a steady stream of conference attendees into their fishbowl lounge for quick Flip camera interviews. The close-ups may not be flattering, but it is interesting to hear the stream of consciousness that pours from the mouths of the unprepared and unedited. From high-profile corporate and academic leadership to those implementing projects on the ground around the world, the resulting online mosaic of more than 200 interviews collected over the last two years seems to present a near-complete view of the issues covered over six days of workshops, plenary sessions, and panels." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maxwell |first=David |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2010/09/09/world-water-week-best-design/ |title=World Water Week: Best in Design – National Geographic Society (blogs) |website=Voices.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-09-09 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent notable projects and partnerships ==
'''Akvopedia expands into Wikiversity:''' In 2015, Akvopedia begun loading content into [[Wikiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.susana.org/component/kunena/196-capacity-development/15007-akvopedia-expands-into-wikiversity-which-offers-free-learning-materials-starting-with-rainwater-harvesting-section |title=SuSanA Forum |website=Forum.susana.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akvopedia has served as source content for the Wikiversity portal and the [[Rainwater harvesting portal]].

'''Monitoring water points during drought in Ethiopia:''' In 2016, Akvo worked with UNICEF to collect data during the worst drought in over 50 years in Ethiopia. Akvo recorded over 80,000 survey responses which were used to help direct emergency resources to the most relevant areas.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"/&gt;

'''Supporting Government disaster planning and response systems:''' Since 2014, Akvo has worked in Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to introduce locally run mobile-based data and asset management tools to improve the quality and availability of data for disaster-related decision-making.  For this work Akvo won the innovationXchange award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org/winners/#VanuatuDRPlatform |title=Innovators - InnovationXchange |website=Pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Akvo Flow was used in Fiji to collect data on the extent of the damage caused by [[Cyclone Winston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/appeals/files/UNICEF_Pacific_Cyclone_Winston_External_SitRep_26Feb2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cyclone Winston : Fiji : UNICEF Report |website=Unicef.org |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artifact''' is one of many kinds of tangible by-products produced during the development of software. Some artifacts (e.g., [[use case]]s, [[class diagram]]s, and other [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) models, requirements and design documents) help describe the function, architecture, and design of software. Other artifacts are concerned with the process of development itself—such as project plans, business cases, and risk assessments.

The term ''artifact'' in connection with software development is largely associated with specific development methods or processes e.g., [[Unified Process]]. This usage of the term may have originated with those methods{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

[[Build automation|Build tools]] often refer to source code compiled for testing as an artifact, because the [[executable]] is necessary to carrying out the testing plan.  Without the executable to test, the testing plan artifact is limited to [[Static testing|non-execution based testing]].  In non-execution based testing, the artifacts are the [[Software walkthrough|walkthroughs]], [[Software inspection|inspections]] and [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness proofs]].  On the other hand, [[Dynamic testing|execution based testing]] requires at minimum two artifacts: a [[test suite]] and the executable.  An artifact occasionally may be used to refer to the released code (in the case of a [[Library (computing)|code library]]) or released executable (in the case of a program) produced but the more common usage is in referring to the byproducts of software development rather than the product itself. Open source code libraries often contain a [[test harness|testing harness]] to allow contributors to ensure their changes do not cause [[Regression testing|regression]] [[Software bug|bugs]] in the code library.

Much of what are considered artifacts is [[software documentation]].

In [[end-user development]] an artifact is either an application or a complex data object that is created by an end-user without the need to know a general programming language. Artifacts describe automated behavior or control sequences, such as database requests or grammar rules,&lt;ref&gt;H. Lieberman, B. A. Nardi, and D. Wright. Grammex: Defining grammars by example. In ACM conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Summary, Demonstrations; CHI 1998), Los Angeles, California, U.S., pp. 11–12. ACM Press, Apr. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; or user-generated content.

Artifacts vary in their maintainability.  Maintainability is primarily affected by the role the artifact fulfills.  The role can be either practical or symbolic.  In the earliest stages of software development, artifacts may be created by the design team to serve a symbolic role to show the project sponsor how serious the contractor is about meeting the project's needs.  Symbolic artifacts often convey information poorly, but are impressive-looking. Symbolic artifacts are sometimes referred to in the information architecture industry as Illuminated Scrolls, because the decorations do nothing to enhance understanding.  Generally speaking, Illuminated Scrolls are also considered unmaintainable due to the diligence it requires to preserve the symbolic quality.  For this reason, once Illuminated Scrolls are shown to the project sponsor and approved, they are replaced by artifacts which serve a practical role.  Practical artifacts usually need to be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, and, as such, are generally highly maintainable.

Artifacts are significant from a [[project management]] perspective as [[deliverable]]s. The deliverables of a software project are likely to be the same as its artifacts with the addition of the software itself.

The sense of artifacts as byproducts is similar to the use of the term ''[[Artifact (error)|artifact]]'' in science to refer to something that arises from the process in hand rather than the issue itself, i.e., a result of interest that stems from the means rather than the end.

To collect, organize and manage artifacts, a [[Software development folder]] may be utilized.

[[File:Cirrus Interior.jpg|thumb|right|2006 [[Cirrus SR22]] cockpit with Avidyne Entegra]]

'''Avidyne Entegra''' is an integrated aircraft instrumentation system, produced by [[Avidyne Corporation]], consisting of a [[primary flight display]] (PFD), and [[multi-function display]] (MFD). [[Cirrus Aircraft|Cirrus]] became the first customer of the Entegra system and began offering it on the [[Cirrus SR20|SR20]] and [[Cirrus SR22|SR22]] aircraft in 2003 as the first integrated flight deck for light [[general aviation]] (GA). The original Entegra system was designed to use third-party components such as a [[GPS]] from [[Garmin]] and an [[autopilot]] system from [[S-TEC Corporation]].

One of the advantages of these glass flight deck systems is upgradeability.  Avidyne has demonstrated this with a continuous stream of hardware and software upgrades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Key Timelines for Popular Glass - Aviation Consumer | url =http://www.aviationconsumer.com/newspics/0409-POPULAR-GLASS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including:
* 2004: Added CMax Electronic Charts and first to certify XM datalink for light GA.
* 2005  Added Primary Engine Instrumentation on PFD.
* 2006: Introduced Release 6, which added Flight Director, V-Speed &amp; Heading on ADI, additional datalink weather products on the MFD, and support for the USB memory-stick data loader.
* 2007: Introduced Release 7, which added support for WAAS/LPV Approach guidance among other things.
* 2008: Introduced Release 8, which expanded weather product for Canadian, Mexico and Caribbean (METARS, TAFs, Color Lightning).
* 2009: Release 9, a hardware and software upgrade that was certified in April 2009.

==Entegra Release 9==

With the certification of Entegra Release 9 system in April 2009, Avidyne offers dual integrated flight displays (IFD) with the FMS900w,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=New Flight Management System From Avidyne - FLYING Magazine 
 |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/avionics/1003/new-flight-management-system-from-avidyne.html 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627014739/http://www.flyingmag.com/avionics/1003/new-flight-management-system-from-avidyne.html 
 |archivedate=27 June 2009 
 |df=dmy 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a WAAS-capable flight management system (FMS) that utilizes Avidyne’s all-digital DVX740 VHF NAV/COM radio modules and GPS722 GPS receiver modules, which eliminates the reliance on 3rd-party Garmin 430 radios. The Release 9 upgrade also includes the Avidyne MLB700 which provides [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius/XM]] Satellite Datalink Weather from [http://www.wsi.com/ WSI].

Avidyne has introduced a new attitude-based digital autopilot, the DFC100, which can replace the rate-based STEC 55X autopilot in most Release 9 installations.

Entegra Release 9 is considered a 3rd-generation integrated flight deck because it is built on a brand new hardware platform using a modular architecture, dual Byteflight digital databus, all new fully digital radio designs, and incorporating a unique Page &amp; Tab user interface and QWERTY-style FMS control/display unit that are designed to dramatically reduce workload during single-pilot IFR operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Aero TV - Avidyne Next Generation Flight Deck - Flying Entegra Release 9 - Aero News Network | url =http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?ContentBlockID=d2441603-ea17-4881-a7dd-7f74b2cd6b34&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Redundancy==

Entegra Release 9 system was designed with a fully redundant dual-databus architecture that eliminates traditional "Reversionary Modes."

A typical Entegra Release 9 installation features two large-format IFD5000 Integrated Flight Displays (IFD), which are fully interchangeable for use as PFD or MFD. Since each IFD5000 is fully capable of performing the functions of the other, no unfamiliar or limited reversionary modes are required {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. In the event of a display failure, the remaining IFD5000 continues to operate as either display format with no loss of functionality.

Some competing glass flight deck systems have limited redundancy, lose critical functionality such as datalink weather, traffic, or even autopilot, and their failure modes force the pilot to learn composite display symbology and "reversionary modes."

==GA Glass history==

Avidyne was first to certify big glass for light GA with the 2003 launch of Entegra in Cirrus aircraft. This is considered a "first generation" big-glass system that integrates the six 3-inch instruments (6-pack) into a more usable package, along with an exceptionally reliable Air Data and Heading Reference System (ADAHRS) that replaces the “spinning mass” attitude and directional gyros. Entegra Release 8 still relies on a ‘federated’ radio stack (dual G430s) for GPS/NAV/COM capability, as well as audio and transponder.

==Use==
Avidyne Entegra systems are found in aircraft from such companies as:
* [[Cirrus Aircraft]]
* [[Columbia Aircraft|Columbia/Lancair Aircraft]]
* [[Piper Aircraft]]
* [[Spectrum Aeronautical]]
* [[Extra EA-500|Extra Aircraft]]

==Competition==
The Avidyne Entegra competes with the [[Garmin G1000]] and Chelton FlightLogic EFIS [[glass cockpits]]. However, there are significant differences with regard to the features, degree of integration, intuitive aspects of the design, and overall product utility. Note that the Chelton system is not typically found in airplanes that include the less expensive G1000 or Avidyne systems.

'''Barrack buster''' is the colloquial name given to several improvised [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], developed in the 1990s by the engineering group of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA).

The first barrack buster—known to the British security forces as the '''Mark 15''' mortar—fired a {{convert|1|m}} long metal [[propane]] cylinder with a diameter of {{convert|36|cm}}, which contained around {{convert|75|kg|abbr=on}} of home-made explosives and had a range of {{convert|75|to|275|m}}. The cylinder is an adaptation of a commercial '[[Kosangas]]' gas cylinder, for heating and cooking gas, used in rural areas in Ireland.&lt;ref name=hidden&gt;Geraghty 1998, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first used in an attack on 7 December 1992 against an RUC/British Army base in [[Ballygawley, County Tyrone|Ballygawley]], [[County Tyrone]],&lt;ref name="Geraghty 1998; Smith 2006"&gt;Geraghty 1998, p. 193; Ryder 2005,p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; injuring a number of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] officers.

== Provisional IRA's improvised mortars ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IRArocketf.gif|thumb|This clip shows an IRA unit attacking [[Crossmaglen]] RUC/British Army barracks in October 1989. A number of mortars are fired from the rear of a flatbed truck which has been parked opposite the station.]] --&gt;
The barrack buster belongs to a series of home-made mortars developed since the 1970s. The first such mortar—'''Mark 1'''—was used in an attack in May 1972 and it was soon followed by the first of a series of improved or differentiated versions stretching into the 1990s:

* '''Mark 1 '''  (1972): consisted of a 50&amp;nbsp;mm copper pipe filled with {{convert|10|oz|kg}} of plastic explosives. Propelled by a .303 and detonated by a [[.22 Long|.22 cartridge]].&lt;ref name="MkI"&gt;Oppenheimer and English (2009), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mark 2 '''  (1972–73): an 8 in length 57&amp;nbsp;mm steel pipe filled with {{convert|2|lb|kg}} of explosive and detonated by a 12 [[Gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] [[shotgun]] cartridge.&lt;ref name=MkI/&gt; This weapon resulted in the first fatality due to Provisional IRA mortars when a British soldier was killed trying to defuse a misfired projectile launched on Fort Monagh barracks at [[Turf Lodge]], Belfast, on 10 December 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1972.html CAIN database of deaths, 10 December 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mark 3 '''  (1973–74): a 60&amp;nbsp;mm mortar barrel with a static firing pin on the plate and a range of {{convert|260|yd|m}}. Propelled by a dried mixture of rags and [[sodium chlorate]] and detonated by a charge of [[ammonium nitrate]]. Used in attacks on [[Creggan, Derry|Creggan]] Camp, [[Derry]] and [[St Lucia Barracks, Omagh|Lisanelly Camp]], [[Omagh]], in 1973.&lt;ref name=MKIII&gt;Geraghty 1998, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; During an attack on a police station a misfired mortar killed two IRA men operating the device.
* '''Mark 4 '''  (1974): Basically a Mark 3 with a larger charge of propellant which extended its range to {{convert|400|yd|m}}. The bomb was filled with {{convert|1|lb|kg}} of ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder. Used only in one known attack on a base in [[Strabane]], County Tyrone, on 22 February 1974.&lt;ref name=MKIII/&gt;
* '''Mark 5 '''  (1974): Never used in any known attack, the security forces learned of it after the discovery of an IRA workshop at [[Cushendall]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty 1998, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mark 6 '''  (1974–1994): A 60&amp;nbsp;mm conventional mortar with a bipod and base plate and a range of {{convert|1,200|yd|m}}. The shell was propelled by a charge of homemade gunpowder, ignited by a [[.22 cartridge]]. The warhead, made of 3&amp;nbsp;lb of [[Semtex]], was detonated by another .22 cartridge on impact. The bomb armed itself "by means of a wind-driven propeller, which is an integral part of the striker". A Mark 6 grenade was thrown by hand on the roof of an armored vehicle from the top of [[Divis Tower|Divis Flats]], [[Belfast]], causing widespread damage and some casualties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Geraghty 1998, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in March 1994 in [[1994 Heathrow mortar attacks|three attacks on London Heathrow Airport]] in Britain. It is not known to have been used after these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty 1998; Smith 2006; Davies 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mark 7 ''' (1976): Longer version of '''Mark 6'''.
* '''Mark 8 ''' (1976): Longer version of '''Mark 6''', it consisted of a 4-foot steel tube, but the projectile was aerodynamically unstable. First used against the British Army base at Crossmaglen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Staff Sergeant Bruce was awarded the [[George Medal]] for clearing some unexploded ordnance after this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David (2001)''. Commando: The Illustrated History Of Britain's Green Berets. ''Haynes / Sutton Books, p. 163. {{ISBN|0750922095}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mark 9 ''' (1976–?): The device fired a shorter but wider mortar bomb, made of a cut-down gas cylinder. First used against Crossmaglen Army base on 23 October 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Mark 10''' (1979–1994): A large-calibre mortar firing a projectile containing {{convert|44|–|220|lb|kg}} of explosives. Its first use on 19 March 1979 caused the first deliberate victim—a British soldier—from an IRA mortar attack in [[Newtownhamilton]], South Armagh. It was primarily designed to attack police stations and military bases, and was used in the [[1985 Newry mortar attack]] which killed nine police officers. It was used in several attacks using configurations with multiple launching tubes, "often launched from the back of Transit type vans".&lt;ref name="Davies 2001, 14"&gt;Davies 2001, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Three such mortars using a mixture of ammonium nitrate and [[nitrobenzene]]—known as "Annie"—as warhead were used on 7 February 1991 in an [[Downing Street mortar attack|IRA attack on 10 Downing Street]] in London against British Prime Minister [[John Major]] and his War Cabinet during the first [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=Gulf&gt;Geraghty 1998, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; It was superseded by the larger '''Mark 15'''.
* '''Mark 11''' (1982–?) : Used for the first time on 13 May 1989 against a British Army observation post in Glassdrumman, South Armagh. The mortar had a range of {{convert|550|yd|m}}.&lt;ref name=Gulf/&gt;
* '''Mark 12''' (1985–?): Fired horizontally against armoured vehicles as well as RUC/Army bases. Also referred to as '''Improvised Projected Grenade'''. With a warhead made of {{convert|40|oz|kg}} of Semtex and [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Used in 1991 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty 1998, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mark 13''' (1990–?): A [[spigot mortar]], usually fired from the back of a heavy vehicle.&lt;ref name=hidden/&gt;
* '''Mark 14''' (1992–?)
* '''Mark 15''' (1992–?): First mortar known as "barrack buster". It was the "standard IRA large calibre [mortar] system" and described as having "the effect of a 'flying car bomb'". It has a calibre of 320&amp;nbsp;mm and fires a bomb of {{convert|196|–|220|lb|kg}} of explosives, with a maximum range of {{convert|275|yd|m}}. It has also been used in configurations with multiple launch tubes, with an attack using 12 tubes against a British military base in [[Kilkeel]], [[County Down]], on 9 October 1993 as being the "record".&lt;ref name="Davies 2001, 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Telegraph]] 10 October 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Two British helicopters, an Army [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] that was hovering over the helipad at a base under attack, and an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Aérospatiale Puma|Puma]] taking off from a base, were brought down by this type of mortar between March and July 1994 in South Armagh. Author Toby Harnden describes the [[1994 British Army Lynx shootdown|1994 shooting down of the Lynx]] as the most successful attack on a helicopter by the IRA during the Troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden 2001, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; The barrel was usually attached to a hydraulic [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] towed by a tractor to the launching site.&lt;ref name=ooops&gt;Oppenheimer and English (2009), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mark 16''' (1991–?): A shoulder-fired weapon for use against armoured vehicles.  Used in eleven attacks&lt;ref name=ooops/&gt; from late 1993 to early 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationbanner.com/roh/CommentView.asp?who=105#prof Operation Banner]&lt;/ref&gt; Also described as '''Projected Recoilless Improvised Grenade'''. The projectile was a {{convert|1|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[tin can]] filled with 600 grammes of Semtex formed into a [[shaped charge]].&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty 1998, pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic impact===
The intensification of the IRA's mortar campaign in the late 1980s forced the British government to increase the number of army troops in Northern Ireland from its lowest ebb of 9,000 in 1985 to 10,500 in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Ripley &amp; Chappel 1993, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA's use of mortars combined with heavy machine guns compelled the British Army to build their main checkpoints more than a mile away from the [[Irish border]] by 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O1ZaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u0wNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6780,6577778&amp;dq=checkpoint+northern-ireland&amp;hl=en 'Official describes British-Irish border as  300-Mile Difficulty] Associated Press, 12 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by other groups ==
These mortars have been used by the [[Real IRA]], who also developed their own fuzing system, in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2006; Davies 2001, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, what appears to be a similar or identical mortar technology has been used since 1998 by the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC). [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain was in 2001 rumoured to have built mortars "very similar" to the IRA's.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2001, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The possible transfer of this mortar technology to the FARC was a central issue in the arrest in August 2001 and later trial of the so-called [[Colombia Three]] group of IRA members who were alleged by Colombian authorities and the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] to have trained FARC in the manufacture and use of this mortar technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''brain transplant''' or '''whole-body transplant''' is a procedure in which the brain of one organism is transplanted into the body of another organism. It is a procedure distinct from [[head transplant]]ation, which involves transferring the entire head to a new body, as opposed to the brain only. Theoretically, a person with advanced organ failure could be given a new and functional body while keeping their own personality, memories, and consciousness through such a procedure.

No human brain transplant has ever been conducted. Neurosurgeon [[Robert J. White]] has grafted the head of a monkey onto the headless body of another monkey. EEG readings showed the brain was later functioning normally. It was thought to prove that the brain was an [[immune privilege|immunologically privileged]] organ, as the host's immune system did not attack it at first,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/45154/what-would-happen-in-a-brain-transplant-personalities-bodies-and/&lt;/ref&gt; but immunorejection caused the monkey to die after nine days.&lt;ref name="dichotomistic.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dichotomistic.com/mind_readings_head_transplant.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228155418/http://www.dichotomistic.com/mind_readings_head_transplant.html |archive-date=28 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain transplants and similar concepts have also been explored in various forms of science fiction.

== Existing challenges ==
One of the most significant barriers to the procedure is the inability of [[nerve]] tissue to heal properly; [[scar]]red nerve tissue does not transmit signals well (this is why a [[spinal cord injury]] is so devastating). Research at the [[Wistar Institute]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] involving [[regeneration (biology)|tissue-regenerating]] mice (known as [[MRL mice]]) may provide pointers for further research as to how to regenerate nerves without scarring. It is possible that a completely clean cut will not generate scarred tissue.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

An advantage is that this interface can be adjusted after the surgical interventions are done where nerves can not be reconnected without surgery.

Also, for the procedure to be practical, the age of the donated body must be sufficient: an adult brain cannot fit into a skull that has not reached its full growth, which occurs at age 9–12 years.

The brain was thought to be an [[Immune privilege|immunologically privileged]] organ, so rejection would not be a problem.

== Partial brain transplant ==

In 1982, Dr. Dorothy T. Krieger, chief of [[endocrinology]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in New York City, achieved success with a partial brain transplant in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/18/us/transplant-success-reported-with-part-of-a-mouse-s-brain.html|title=Transplant Success Reported With Part of a Mouse's Brain|last=Ap|date=18 June 1982|work=The New York Times|page=9|accessdate=20 July 2010|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a team of [[surgeon]]s from the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] attempted to transplant a group of [[brain cells]] to Alma Cerasini, who had suffered a severe [[stroke]] that caused the loss of mobility in her right [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] as well as limited speech. The team's hope was that the cells would correct the listed damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|title=Artificial Brain Cells Implanted In Patient The Procedure Is The First Of Its Kind.

== In science fiction ==

The whole-body transplant is just one of several means of putting a consciousness into a new body that have been explored in [[science fiction]].

In the film ''[[Get Out]]'' (2017), written and directed by [[Jordan Peele]], a young, white woman, Rose Armitage ([[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]]), lures her young, black boyfriend, [[Chris Washington]] ([[Daniel Kaluuya]]), to her family's estate to be auctioned-off for a brain transplant procedure that enables older, white residents of the Armitage community to obtain a pseudo-immortality in a black person's body. The Armitage family is the founder of the cult The Order of the Coagula, in which [[Missy Armitage]] (Catherine Keener), a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to subdue the consciousness of black persons to The Sunken Place, and Dean Armitage ([[Bradley Whitford]]), a neurosurgeon, transplants the brain of the white person into the black person's body. Due to the human body's need for motor functions, only a partial brain transplant is possible. The Sunken Place is essential to suppressing the conscious minds of the hosts while the brain tissue is implanted into their skulls. Once the brain transplant has been completed, the white person's consciousness takes control over the black host body; meanwhile, the consciousness of the black person remains in The Sunken Place. While in the Sunken Place, the black person's consciousness is completely intact and aware of what is going on, yet has no control over their body.

In [[Maxwell Atoms]]' Cartoon Network series ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'' (2003-2004), Hector Con Carne was reduced to a brain and a stomach and both of them were put in jars attached to the body of a Russian circus bear. Hector's brain is the main character of the cartoon.

Edgar Rice Burroughs' ''[[Barsoom|The Mastermind of Mars]]'' involves a surgeon who does this as his main operation, and a man from Earth, the narrator and main character, who is trained to do it as well.

In [[Neil R. Jones]] ''Professeur Jameson'' stories (1931), the main character is the last earthman, whose brain is saved by some alien cyborgs called the Zoromes, and is inserted into a robotic body, making him immortal.

Robert Heinlein's 1970 science fiction novel, ''[[I Will Fear No Evil]]'', features a main character named Johann Sebastian Bach Smith whose entire brain is transplanted into his deceased secretary's skull.

A similar procedure often found in science fiction is the transfer of one consciousness to another without moving the brain. This is found in many sources, most often a [[body swap]] between two characters of an ongoing television series; it occurs in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series twice, in the X-Files episode ''[[Dreamland (The X-Files)|Dreamland]]'', in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial "[[Mindwarp]]", and in ''[[Freaky Friday]]'', ''[[Farscape]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'', ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]''; even in Archie comics. Since there is no movement of the brain(s), this is not quite the same as a whole-body transplant.

In the horror film ''[[The Skeleton Key]]'', the protagonist, Caroline, discovers that the old couple she is looking after are poor Voodoo witch doctors who stole the bodies of two young, privileged children in their care using a ritual which allows a soul to swap bodies. Unfortunately the evil old couple also trick Caroline and their lawyer into the same procedure, and both end up stuck in old dying bodies unable to speak while the witch doctors walk off with their young bodies.

In the Spanish "destape" film ''[[Desembraga a fondo]]'', the brain of the protagonist, Fernando Esteso, is transplanted into his brother's skull.

In [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[The Tale of the Body Thief]]'', the vampire Lestat discovers a man, Raglan James, who can will himself into another person's body.  Lestat demands that the procedure be used on him to allow him to be human once again, but soon finds that he has made an error and is forced to recapture James in his vampiric form so he can take his body back.

Similar in many ways to this is the idea of [[mind uploading]], promoted by [[Marvin Minsky]] and others with a mechanistic view of natural intelligence and an optimistic outlook regarding [[artificial intelligence]].  It is also a goal of [[Raëlism]], a small cult based in Florida, France, and Quebec.  While the ultimate goal of transplanting is transfer of the brain to a new body optimized for it by [[genetics]], [[proteomics]], and/or other medical procedures, in uploading the brain itself moves nowhere and may even be physically destroyed or discarded; the goal is rather to duplicate the information patterns contained within the brain.

Another similar literary theme, though different from either procedure described above, is the transplanting of a human brain into an artificial, usually robotic, body.  Examples of this include: ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]''; ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''; ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]''; ''[[RoboCop]]''; the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]]; the [[Cybermen]] from the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' television series; the [[cymek]]s in the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' series; or full-body cyborgs in many [[manga]] or works in the [[cyberpunk]] genre.  In one episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', [[Spock's Brain]] is stolen and installed in a large computer-like structure; and in "[[I, Mudd]]" Uhura is offered immortality in an android body.  The novel ''Harvest of Stars'' by [[Poul Anderson]] features many central characters who undergo such transplants, and deals with the difficult decisions facing a human contemplating such a procedure. In the ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]]'' the shadow droids were created by taking the brains of grievously wounded [[TIE fighter]] pilot aces. After surgically transplanting them into a protective cocoon filled with nutrient fluids. they were surgically connected to cybernetic hardware that gave them external sensors, flight control and tactical computers that augmented their reflexes beyond the biological limit; at the cost of their humanity. Emperor [[Palpatine]] also imbued them with the dark side giving them a sixth sense, and making them into extensions of his own will.

The '''Bussard ramjet''' is a theoretical method of [[spacecraft propulsion]] proposed in 1960 by the physicist [[Robert W. Bussard]], popularized by  [[Poul Anderson]]'s novel ''[[Tau Zero]]'', [[Larry Niven]] in his ''[[Known Space]]'' series of books, [[Vernor Vinge]] in his ''[[Zones of Thought]]'' series, and referred to by [[Carl Sagan]] in the [[television]] series and [[Cosmos (book)|book]] ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]''.

&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a [[ramjet]] variant of a [[fusion rocket]] capable of reasonable [[interstellar travel]], using enormous electromagnetic fields (ranging from kilometers to many thousands of kilometers in diameter) as a ram scoop to collect and compress [[hydrogen]] from the [[interstellar medium]]. High speeds force the reactive mass into a progressively constricted magnetic field, compressing it until [[thermonuclear fusion]] occurs. The magnetic field then directs the energy as [[rocket]] exhaust opposite to the intended direction of travel, thereby accelerating the vessel.

== Feasibility ==

Since the time of Bussard's original proposal, it has been discovered that the region surrounding the [[Solar System]] has a much lower density of hydrogen than was believed at that time (see [[Local Interstellar Cloud]]). John Ford Fishback made an important contribution to the details for the Bussard ramjet in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fishback |first=J. F. |year=1969 |title=Relativistic interstellar spaceflight |journal=Astronautica Acta |volume=15 |pages=25–35 |bibcode=1969AsAc...15...25F}}&lt;/ref&gt; T. A. Heppenheimer analyzed Bussard's original suggestion of fusing [[protons]], but found the [[Bremsstrahlung]] losses from compressing protons to [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] densities was greater than the power that could be produced by a factor of about 1 billion, thus indicating that the proposed version of the Bussard ramjet was infeasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T.A. |last=Heppenheimer |title=On the Infeasibility of Interstellar Ramjets |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=31 |page=222 |year=1978|bibcode = 1978JBIS...31..222H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However Daniel P. Whitmire's 1975 analysis&lt;ref name="Whitmire1975"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel P. |last=Whitmire |title=Relativistic Spaceflight and the Catalytic Nuclear Ramjet |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=2 |issue=5-6 |date=May–June 1975 |pages=497–509 |doi=10.1016/0094-5765(75)90063-6 |url=http://www.askmar.com/Robert%20Bussard/Catalytic%20Nuclear%20Ramjet.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode = 1975AcAau...2..497W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  indicates that a ramjet may achieve net power via the [[CNO cycle]], which produces fusion at a much higher rate (~10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; times higher) than the [[proton-proton chain]].

[[Robert Zubrin]] and Dana Andrews analyzed one hypothetical version of the Bussard ramscoop and [[ramjet]] design in 1985. They determined that their version of the ramjet would be unable to accelerate into the solar wind. However, in their calculations they assumed that:

# The exhaust velocity of their interplanetary ion propulsion ramjet could not exceed 100,000&amp;nbsp;m/s (100&amp;nbsp;km/s);
# The largest available energy source could be a 500 [[kilowatt]] [[nuclear fusion]] reactor.

In the Zubrin/Andrews interplanetary ramjet design, they calculated that the drag force d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) equals the mass of the scooped ions collected per second multiplied by the velocity of the scooped ions within the solar system relative to the ramscoop. The velocity of the (scooped) collected ions from the solar wind was assumed to be 500,000&amp;nbsp;m/s.

The exhaust velocity of the ions when expelled by the ramjet was assumed not to exceed 100,000&amp;nbsp;m/s. The thrust of the ramjet d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was equal to the mass of ions expelled per second multiplied by 100,000 meters per second. In the Zubrin/Andrews design of 1985, this resulted in the condition that d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This condition resulted in the drag force exceeding the thrust of the hypothetical ramjet in the Zubrin/Andrews version of the design.

===Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket (RAIR)===
The problem of using the interstellar medium as the sole fuel source led to study of the Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket (RAIR). The RAIR carries its nuclear fuel supply and exhausts the reaction products to produce some of its thrust. However it greatly enhances its performance by scooping the interstellar medium and  using this as extra reaction mass to augment the rocket. The propulsion system of the RAIR consists of three subsystems: a fusion reactor, a scoop field, and a plasma accelerator. The scoop field funnels interstellar gas into an "accelerator" (this could for example be a heat exchange system transferring thermal energy from the reactor directly to the interstellar gas) which is supplied power from a reactor. One of the best ways to understand this concept is to consider that the hydrogen nuclear fuel carried on board acts as a fuel (energy source) whereas the interstellar gas collected by the scoop and then exhausted at great speed from the back acts as a propellant (the [[Working mass|reaction mass]]), the vehicle therefore has a limited fuel supply but an unlimited propellant supply. A normal Bussard ramjet would have an infinite supply of both, however theory suggests that where a Bussard ramjet would suffer drag from the fact that the interstellar gas ahead of it would have to be accelerated to its speed before entering the fusion reactor, whereas a RAIR system would be able to transfer energy via the "accelerator" mechanism from the reactor to the interstellar gas without having to accelerate the gas up to the ship's speed before putting this gas through the "accelerator", and so would suffer far less drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bond |first=A. |year=1974 |title=An Analysis of the Potential Performance of the Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=27 |pages=674–688|bibcode = 1974JBIS...27..674B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=C. |year=1976 |title=System Optimization for the Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=136|bibcode = 1976JBIS...29..136P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=A. |year=1980 |title=Some Considerations on the Antimatter and Fusion Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=33 |pages=117–120|bibcode = 1980JBIS...33..117J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further information on this RAIR concept can be found in the book "the star flight handbook" and at http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/slowerlight.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser Powered Interstellar Ramjet ===
Beamed energy coupled with a vehicle scooping hydrogen from the interstellar medium is another variant. A laser array in the solar system beams to a collector on a vehicle which uses something like a linear accelerator to produce thrust. This solves the fusion reactor problem for the ramjet. There are limitations because of the attenuation of beamed energy with distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whitmire |first=D. |author2 = Jackson.A|year=1977 |title= Laser Powered Interstellar Ramjet |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=30 |pages=223–226|bibcode = 1977JBIS...30..223J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic sail===
The calculations (by [[Robert Zubrin]] and an associate) inspired the idea of a [[magnetic sail|magnetic parachute or sail]]. This could be important for interstellar travel because it means that deceleration at the destination can be performed with a magnetic parachute rather than a rocket.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Pre-seeded trajectory===
Several of the obvious technical difficulties with the Bussard ramjet can be overcome by prelaunching fuel along the spacecraft's trajectory&lt;ref&gt;Discussed on {{cite book |last=Gilster |first=P. |year=2004 |title=Centauri Dreams: Imagining and Planning Interstellar Exploration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fffd3SivkC&amp;pg=PA146 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-00436-5 |pages=146–8}} Also in the entry [http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=315 'A Fusion Runway to Nearby Stars'] from centauri-dreams.org.&lt;/ref&gt; using something like a magnetic rail-gun.

The advantages of this system include
*Launching only ionized fusion fuel so that either magnetic or electrostatic scoops can more easily funnel the fuel into the engine.  The drawback is this will cause the fuel to disperse due to electrostatic repulsion.
*Launching the fuel on a trajectory so that the fuel velocity vector will closely match the expected velocity vector of the spacecraft at that point in its trajectory.  This will minimize the "drag" forces generated by the collection of fuel.
*Launching optimized isotope ratios for the fusion engines on the spacecraft.  A conventional Bussard ramjet will mostly collect hydrogen with an atomic weight of 1.  This isotope is harder to fuse than either the [[deuterium]] or [[tritium]] isotopes of hydrogen.  By launching the ideal ratio of hydrogen isotopes for the fusion engine in the spacecraft one can optimize the performance of the fusion engine.
*Although the prelaunched fuel for the ramjet negates one advantage of the Bussard design (collection of fuel as it moves through the interstellar medium) it retains the advantage of not having to accelerate the mass of the fuel and the mass of the rocket at the same time.
*The prelaunched fuel would provide some visibility into the interstellar medium &amp;ndash; thus alerting the trailing spacecraft of unseen hazards (e.g. [[brown dwarf]]s).

The major disadvantages of this system include
*The spacecraft could not deviate from the precalculated trajectory unless it was critical to do so.  Any such deviation would separate the spacecraft from its fuel supply and leave it with only a minimal ability to return to its original trajectory.
*Prelaunched fuel for deceleration at the destination star would not be available unless launched many decades in advance of the spacecraft launch.  However, other systems (such as the [[magnetic sail]]s) could be used for this purpose.

'''China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 2B''' ('''CBERS-2B'''), also known as '''Ziyuan I-02B''' or '''Ziyuan 1B2''', was a [[remote sensing]] satellite operated as part of the [[China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]]me between the [[China]] [[China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application|Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application]] and [[Brazil]]'s [[National Institute for Space Research]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; The third CBERS satellite to fly, it was launched by China in 2007 to replace [[CBERS-2]].&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt;

CBERS-2B was a {{convert|1450|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft built by the [[China Academy of Space Technology]] and based on the [[Phoenix-Eye 1]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; The spacecraft was powered by a single solar array, which provided 1,100&amp;nbsp;watts of electricity for the satellite's systems.&lt;ref name="EOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/description_cbers1_2_2b.php|title=CBERS-1, 2 and 2B Description|publisher=INPE|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120084318/http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/description_cbers1_2_2b.php#|archive-date=2014-01-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument suite aboard the CBERS-2B spacecraft consisted of three systems: the Wide Field Imager (WFI) produced visible-light to near-infrared images with a resolution of {{convert|260|m}} and a swath width of {{convert|890|km}}; a high-resolution CCD camera was used for multispectral imaging at a resolution of {{convert|20|m}} with a swath width of {{convert|113|km}}; the third instrument, the High Resolution Camera (HRC) was a panchromatic imager with a resolution of {{convert|2.7|m}} and a swath width of {{convert|27|km}}.&lt;ref name="cameras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/cameras_cbers1_2_2b.php|title=CBERS-1, 2 and 2B Cameras|publisher=INPE|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120084308/http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/cameras_cbers1_2_2b.php#|archive-date=2014-01-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRC replaced the lower-resolution Infrared Multispectral Scanner instrument flown on earlier CBERS satellites.&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt;

[[File:Claas Senator - STW 512M at Barleylands 09 - IMG 9595.jpg|thumb|Claas Senator]]

The '''Mercator''' is a series of combine harvesters produced by the German agricultural company [[Claas]] in [[Harsewinkel]]. Initially called '''Senator''', the Mercator series was introduced in 1966. The first combine harvester of the series to be called Mercator was presented in 1967, the '''Protector''' followed in 1968. Both are less productive but also less expensive models. With the Facelift, the Senator was renamed Mercator 70, while the Protector models were given the names Mercator 60 and 50.&lt;ref name="Claas" /&gt; Later, more models of the Mercator series were introduced, such as the Mercator 75.&lt;ref name="Mercator" /&gt;

The Senator is the first Claas combine harvester to feature the colour ''saatengrün'' (German: seed-green), the new Claas-logo and extensive metal covers.&lt;ref name="Claas" /&gt;

A '''click farm''' is a form of [[click fraud]], where a large group of low-paid workers are hired to click on paid advertising links for the click fraudster (click farm  master or click farmer). The workers click the links, surf the target website for a period of time, and possibly sign up for newsletters prior to clicking another link. For many of these workers, clicking on enough ads per day may increase their revenue substantially and may also be an alternative to other types of work. It is extremely difficult for an automated filter to detect this simulated traffic as fake because the visitor behavior appears exactly the same as that of an actual legitimate visitor.&lt;ref name="Munson 2007"&gt;{{cite web |last=Munson |first=Lee |title=What is a Click Farm? |website=Security-FAQs |date=October 15, 2007 |url=http://www.security-faqs.com/what-is-a-click-farm.html |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Fake like]]s''' generating from click farms are essentially different from those arising from bots where computer programs are written by software experts.  To deal with such issues, companies such as [[Facebook]] are trying to create [[algorithms]] that seek to wipe out accounts with unusual activity (e.g. liking too many pages in a short period of time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Delo |first=Cotton |title=Facebook Moves to Wipe Out Fake 'Likes,' But Can't Do Anything About Fat Fingers |website=AdAge |date=August 31, 2012 |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-moves-wipe-fake-likes-fat-fingers/236983/ |ref=harv |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logistics ==
Click farms are usually located in developing countries, such as [[China]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook Is Riddled With Click Farms Where Workers Sit In Dingy Rooms, Bars On The Windows, Generating 1,000 Likes For $1 |website=Business Insider |date=August 2, 2013 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-low-paid-workers-at-click-farms-create-appearance-of-online-popularity-2013-8 |ref={{sfnref | Business Insider | 2013}} | accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business of click farms extends to generating likes and followers on social media platforms such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Pinterest]] and more. Workers are paid, on average, one US dollar for a thousand likes or for following a thousand people on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Rijk 2013"/&gt; Then click farms turn around and sell their likes and followers at a much higher price. According to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', "BuyPlusFollowers sells 250 [[Google+]] shares for $12.95; InstagramEngine sells 1,000 &amp;#91;[[Instagram]]&amp;#93; followers for $12.00; and AuthenticHits sells 1,000 [[SoundCloud]] plays for $9.00."&lt;ref name="Rijk 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rijk |first=Joop |title=The Click Farms Are Back; Now Producing Fake Likes, Followers and Views |website=JoopRijk.com |date=August 5, 2013 |url=http://joopcrijk.com/the-click-farms-are-back-now-producing-fake-likes-followers-and-views/ |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand in June 2017, a click farm was discovered with hundreds of mobile phones and several hundred thousand SIM cards used to build up likes and views on [[WeChat]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/click-farm-raided-347200-sims-found/news-story/efb45fa8689f0a84c5a8626ea987a1f1&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two methods to click farming. The first is by hiring [[Click fraud#Non-contracting parties|competitor fraudsters]] to deplete the advertising budget of the competitor so that they will be able to have their ads shown in higher pay-per-click rankings at a lower cost.&lt;ref name="Munson 2007"/&gt; In this case, the competitor is weakened instead of being outbid in the pay-per-click bidding system. The investment on the click farm made by the fraudster is only a very small fraction of the amount lost by the competitor. The second is by hiring the click farm workers to click on ads on the click farmer's own site. This way, the money lost by the advertisers is gained by the click farmer, rather than by the search engines and content networks as in the first method.&lt;ref name="Munson 2007"/&gt;

The need for click farming arises because, as ''[[The Guardian]]'' states, "31% will check ratings and reviews, including likes and Twitter followers, before they choose to buy something."&lt;ref name="Arthur 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Arthur |first=Charles |title=How low-paid workers at 'click farms' create appearance of online popularity |website=the Guardian |date=August 2, 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/02/click-farms-appearance-online-popularity |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the increasing importance that businesses, celebrities and other organisations put on the number of likes and followers they have. This creates monetary values for likes and followers which means that businesses and celebrities feel compelled to increase their likes to create a positive online profile.

[[Pay-per-click]] providers, including [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], and [[MSN]], have made substantial efforts to combat click fraud. Automated filters remove most click fraud attempts at the source. According to Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], California-based Google, she said that “We design our systems to catch bot-related attacks.” “Because a significant amount of malicious traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds of attacks.” she added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-05-19/microsoft-sues-web-site-over-new-form-of-online-advertising-click-fraud- |title=Microsoft Sues Over Online Advertising 'Click Fraud' |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 9, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525160200/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-05-19/microsoft-sues-web-site-over-new-form-of-online-advertising-click-fraud- |archivedate=May 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to circumvent these filtering systems, click fraudsters have begun to use these click farms to mimic actual visitors.

== Implications==

Engagement rate, a performance metric that measures the quality of social media activity such as [[Facebook]] likes or [[Twitter]] retweets, can be interpreted in terms of "engagement per follower," measured by dividing the raw counts of social media activity by the number of followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yamaguchi |first=Kohki |title=How to Calculate Engagement Rate for Social Media Marketing |website=Origami Logic |date=May 13, 2016 |url=http://www.origamilogic.com/blog/how-to-calculate-engagement-rate-for-social-media-marketing |accessdate=January 10, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513223658/http://www.origamilogic.com/blog/how-to-calculate-engagement-rate-for-social-media-marketing |archivedate=May 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users who engage in short term click farms services will see their engagement rate plummet in time as the initial increase in the volume of social media activity drops when the click farms services end, coupled with the increase in fake followers if not the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Marketsmith, Inc. |url=http://www.marketsmithinc.com/2014/02/fake-likes-put-facebook-hot-water-advertisers/ |title=Fake Likes put Facebook in Hot Water with Advertisers. |website=[[Marketsmith]] |date=February 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 9, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214554/http://www.marketsmithinc.com/2014/02/fake-likes-put-facebook-hot-water-advertisers/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian security researchers and bloggers Andrea Stroppa and Carla De Micheli found out in 2013 that $40 million to $360 million to date were earned from the sale of and the potential benefits of buying fake [[Twitter]] followers. $200 million a year is also earned from fake [[Facebook]] activities.&lt;ref name="Mendoza 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mendoza |first=Martha |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/05/buy-facebook-likes_n_4544800.html |title=How Facebook Likes Get Bought And Sold |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=January 10, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107005727/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/05/buy-facebook-likes_n_4544800.html |archivedate=January 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40 to 80 percent of Facebook advertisements are bought on a [[pay-per-click]] basis. Advertisers have claimed that about 20 percent of Facebook clicks are invalid and they had tried to seek refunds.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwards |first=Jim |title=Here Are The Sealed Court Papers On 'Invalid Clicks' Facebook Doesn't Want You To See |website=Business Insider |date=November 5, 2012 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-advertisers-invalid-click-class-action-lawsuit-2012-10 |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could cost Facebook $2,494 billion of their 2014 revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook - revenue and net income 2015 |website=Statista |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/277229/facebooks-annual-revenue-and-net-income/ |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies have tried to mitigate the effects of click farming. [[Coca-Cola]] made its 2010 Super Bowl advert "Hard Times" private after learning it was shared on Shareyt and issued a statement that it "did not approve of fake fans."&lt;ref name="Arthur 2013"/&gt; [[Hasbro]] was alerted to an online casino, a sub-licensee of its [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] brand had added fake Facebook likes and hence contacted Facebook to remove the site. Hasbro issued a statement that it was “appalled to hear of what had occurred” and claimed no previous knowledge of the page.&lt;ref name="Arthur 2013"/&gt;

Although click farm services violate many social media user policies, there are no government regulations that render them illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Click-Farming and the Challenge of Online Content Integrity |website=Legal Solutions Blog |date=November 11, 2013 |url=http://blog.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-and-techology/click-farming-challenge-online-content-integrity/ |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sam DeSilva, a lawyer specializing in IT and outsourcing law at Manches LLP in Oxford had mentioned that: "Potentially, a number of laws are being breached – the consumer protection and unfair trading regulations. Effectively it's misleading the individual consumers."&lt;ref name="Arthur 2013"/&gt;

== Advertising provider responses ==
Facebook issued a statement stating: "A [[like button|like]] that doesn't come from someone truly interested in connecting with the brand benefits no one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5795">'''Customer knowledge''' ('''CK''') is the combination of experience, value and insight information which is needed, created and absorbed during the transaction and exchange between the [[customer]]s and enterprise.&lt;ref name=gebert2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gebert|first1=Henning|last2=Geib|first2=Malte|last3=Kolbe|first3=Lutz|last4=Riempp|first4=Gerold|url=http://iceb.nccu.edu.tw/proceedings/2002/PDF/f262.pdf|title=Towards customer knowledge management: Integrating customer relationship management and knowledge management concepts|journal=The Second International Conference on Electronic Business (ICEB 2002)|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Campbell (2003) defines customer knowledge as: "organized and structured information about the customer as a result of systematic processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Campbell, A. J.|year=2003|title=Creating customer knowledge competence: Managing customer relationship management programs strategically|journal=Industrial marketing management|volume=32|pages=375–383|doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(03)00011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitussis et al. (2006), customer knowledge is identified as one of the more complex types of knowledge, since customer knowledge can be captured from different sources and channels.&lt;ref name="jscdss.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khosravi|first1=Arash|last2=Che Hussin|first2=Ab Razak|title=A Review of Customer Knowledge Management Importance|journal=Journal of Soft Computing and Decision Support Systems|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=45–52 |url=http://www.jscdss.com/index.php/files/article/view/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darryn Mitussis|author2=Lisa O'Malley|author3=Maurice Patterson|title=Mapping the re-engagement of CRM with relationship marketing|journal=European Journal of Marketing|volume=40|issue=5/6|pages=572–589|doi=10.1108/03090560610657840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Various classifications exist:
Gebert et al. (2002), classified customer knowledge from an organization's perspective into three types:&lt;ref  name=gebert2002/&gt;
#knowledge about customers: is gained mainly by [[service management]], offer management, [[complaint management]] and, if available, contract management. The main user processes of knowledge regarding the customer are campaign management and service management, because both processes personalize their services based on user criteria. Knowledge about the customer must be transparent within the company; although its distribution beyond the border of the company must be controlled, as this type of knowledge can often be directly transformed into competitive advantages. The development of such knowledge is also expensive, because knowledge revelation is quite time-consuming.
#knowledge for customers: is mainly developed in processes within the company, for example, the research and development section or a production department. Collecting this knowledge is the responsibility of campaign management. It should be refined according to the customer requirements. It is then disseminated to the other [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) processes, mainly: contract management, offer management, and service management. CRM manages knowledge, transparency and dissemination of knowledge for customers. Maintaining the balance between comprehensibility and precision is the main challenge when managing this kind of knowledge.
#knowledge from customers: can be obtained in the same ways as knowledge about customers. Capturing knowledge from customers is based on the important fact that customers who obtain  their own expertise when utilizing a service or product can be seen as equal partners. This concept is not regularly understood in the business world and its effects have been poorly researched in academia (Garcia-Murillo and Annabi, 2002).&lt;ref name="jscdss.com"/&gt;

The same categorization of customer knowledge has been made by others such as Bueren et al. (2005) and Feng and Tian (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bueren,  A., Schierholz, R., Kolbe, L., and Brenner, W.|year=2005|title=Improving performance  of  customer  processes  with knowledge management|url=https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/a080b16584a378f06199ade7ec9c25e0-en.pdf/Improving_performance_of_customer-processes_with_knowledge_management.pdf|journal=Business Process Management Journal|volume=11|issue=5|pages=573–588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feng, T., Tian, J. (2005), "Customer knowledge management and condition analysis of successful  CKM  implementation", Proceedings  of  the  fourth  international Conference on machine learning and cybernetics, Guanghou, August 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; In another categorization, Crié and Micheaux (2006) divide customer knowledge into two types, namely: "Behavioural" (or Quantitative) and "Attitudinal" (or Qualitative). Behavioral knowledge is easy to acquire and is basically quantitative by nature; that is, containing a customer transactional relations with the company. On the other hand, attitudinal knowledge is difficult to acquire because it deals with a customer's [[wikt:state of mind|state of mind]]; but meanwhile it is an important factor for enhancement of customer knowledge because they are directly related to a customer's thoughts and insights.

==Types of software==
Day trading software falls into three main categories: Data, [[Charting]], and Trade Execution.&lt;ref name=gm /&gt;&lt;ref name=ia /&gt;

===Important Data===
A [[day trader]] needs to know the prices of the stocks, [[Futures contract|futures]], or currencies that s/he wants to trade. In the case of stocks and futures, those prices come from the exchange where they are traded. Forex is a little different as there is no central exchange.

===Charting===
The vast majority of day traders will chart prices in some kind of charting software. Many charting vendors also supply data feeds.

Charting packages all tend to offer the same basic [[technical analysis]] indicators. Advanced packages often include a complete programming language for creating more indicators, or testing different trading strategies.

===Trade Execution===
Once traders have their data and can see and analyze it on a chart, they will at some point want to place a trade. To do so, they need to use some kind of trade execution software or [[electronic trading platform]].&lt;ref name=ia /&gt; Many trade execution software allow advanced traders to develop their own trading strategies by using an [[API]].

Most [[brokerage firm|stock brokerage firms]] will provide proprietary software linked directly to their in-house systems, but many third party applications are available through [[Independent software vendor]]s(ISV). The advantage of third party programs is that they allow the trader to trade through different brokers whilst retaining the same interface. They may also offer a number of advanced features such as automatic trade execution.

[[File:Original message.jpg|thumb|A binary signal, also known as a logic signal, is a digital signal with two distinguishable levels]]

A '''digital signal''' is a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] that is being used to represent data as a sequence of [[discrete space|discrete]] values; at any given time it can only take on one of a finite number of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1eO7kLWUmYIC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;ots=EBhxEwk7bY&amp;dq=digital%20signal%20logic&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%20signal%20logic&amp;f=false |title=Digital Design with CPLD Applications and VHDL |author=Robert K. Dueck |quote=A digital representation can have only specific discrete values}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Digital Signal Processing|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H_5SAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780131873742|first = John G.|last = Proakis|first2 = Dimitris G.|last2 = Manolakis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=waveform/&gt; This contrasts with an [[analog signal]], which represents [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] values; at any given time it represents a [[real number]] within a continuous range of values. 

Simple digital signals represent information in discrete bands of analog levels. All levels within a band of values represent the same [[information state]]. In most [[digital circuits]], the signal can have two possible values; this is called a [[binary signal]] or '''logic signal'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chegg.com/homework-help/definitions/digital-signal-4 |title=Digital Signal |access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are represented by two voltage bands: one near a reference value (typically termed as ''ground'' or zero volts), and the other a value near the supply voltage. These correspond to the two values "zero" and "one" (or "false" and "true") of the [[Boolean domain]], so at any given time a binary signal represents one [[binary digit]] (bit).  Because of this [[discretization]], relatively small changes to the analog signal levels do not leave the discrete envelope, and as a result are ignored by signal state sensing circuitry.  As a result, digital signals have [[noise immunity]]; [[electronic noise]], provided it is not too great, will not affect digital circuits, whereas noise always degrades the operation of analog signals to some degree.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{cite book| last1  = Horowitz| first1 = Paul | last2  = Hill| first2 = Winfield | title  = The Art Of Electronics, 2nd Ed.| publisher = Cambridge University Press| date   = 1989 | pages  = 471-473| language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=xp2nuQAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA471&amp;dq=digital+analog+noise| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 0521370957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital signals having more than two states are occasionally used; circuitry using such signals is called [[multivalued logic]].  For example, signals that can assume three possible states are called [[three-valued logic]].   

In a digital signal, the physical quantity representing the information may be a variable electric current or voltage, the intensity, phase or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of an [[optics|optical]] or other [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic field]], acoustic pressure, the [[magnetization]] of a [[magnetic storage]] media, etcetera. Digital signals are used in all [[digital electronics]], notably computing equipment and [[data transmission]].

==Definitions==
The term ''digital signal'' has related definitions in different contexts.

===In digital electronics===
[[File:5PAMlevels.png|thumb|A five level [[pulse-amplitude modulation|PAM]] digital signal]] 
In [[digital electronics]] a digital signal is a [[pulse train]] (a [[pulse amplitude modulated]] signal), i.e. a sequence of fixed-width square-wave electrical pulses or light pulses, each occupying one of a discrete number of levels of amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;B. SOMANATHAN NAIR, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WK45wLHL-ycC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=%22digital+signals+are%22+%22digital+electronics%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBGoVChMI5JHo5a_jxwIVCtcsCh0VzQ61#v=onepage&amp;q=%22digital%20signals%20are%22%20%22digital%20electronics%22&amp;f=false Digital electronics and logic design] 2002: "Digital signals are fixed-width pulses, which occupy only one of two levels of amplitude."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Migga Kizza, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HsawoKBLZOwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=computer+networks+%22digital+signal%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAGoVChMIzZHYqbXjxwIVy4osCh3neg_D#v=onepage&amp;q=computer%20networks%20%22digital%20signal%22&amp;f=false Computer Network Security] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A special case is a ''logic signal'' or a ''binary signal'', which varies between a low and a high signal level.

===In signal processing===
[[File:Digital.signal.discret.svg|thumb|In signal processing, a digital signal is an abstraction that is discrete in time and amplitude, meaning it only exists at certain time instants.]]
{{main article|Digital signal (signal processing)}}
In [[digital signal processing]], a digital signal is a representation of a physical signal that is a sampled and quantized. A digital signal is an abstraction which is discrete in time and amplitude. The signal's value only exists at regular time intervals, since only the values of the corresponding physical signal at those sampled moments are significant for further digital processing. The digital signal is a sequence of codes drawn from a finite set of values.&lt;ref name=Khanna&gt;Vinod Kumar Khanna, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vf2qXAbn58oC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22a+digital+signal+is+a%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20digital%20signal%20is%20a%22&amp;f=false Digital Signal Processing], 2009: A digital signal is a special form of discrete-time signal which is discrete in both time and amplitude, obtained by permitting each value (sample) of a discrete-time signal to acquire a finite set of values (quantization), assigning it a numerical symbol according to a code ... A digital signal is a sequence or list of numbers drawn from a finite set.&lt;/ref&gt; The digital signal may be stored, processed or transmitted physically as a [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) signal.

===In communications===
[[File:Frequenzumtastung.jpg|thumb|A [[frequency shift keying]] (FSK) signal is alternating between two waveforms, and allows passband transmission. It is considered digital in literature on [[data transmission]].]]
[[File:AMI-code.png|thumb|An [[Alternate mark inversion|AMI coded]] digital signal used in baseband transmission (line coding)]]
In [[digital communications]], a digital signal is a continuous-time physical signal, alternating between a discrete number of waveforms,&lt;ref name=waveform&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WJ9qkNpScFAC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22a+digital+signal+is%22+communication&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwB2oVChMI-MD09ZjjxwIVBAssCh1wnQu4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20digital%20signal%20is%22%20communication&amp;f=false  Analogue and Digital Communication Techniques]: "A digital signal is a complex waveform and can be defined as a discrete waveform having a finite set of levels"&lt;/ref&gt; representing a [[bitstream]]. The shape of the waveform depends the transmission scheme, which may be either a [[line coding]] scheme allowing [[baseband transmission]]; or a [[digital modulation]] scheme, allowing [[passband]] transmission over long wires or over a limited radio frequency band. Such a carrier-modulated sine wave is considered a digital signal in literature on digital communications and data transmission,&lt;ref&gt;J.S.Chitode, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ycq1cTYrLDkC&amp;pg=PA585&amp;dq=%22a+digital+signal+is%22+CW&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI0-DjspvjxwIVhBEsCh0FjAFT#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20digital%20signal%20is%22%20CW&amp;f=false Communication Systems], 2008: "When a digital signal is transmitted over a long distance, it needs CW modulation."&lt;/ref&gt; but considered as a bitstream converted to an analog signal in electronics and computer networking.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Halsall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QadX5XErZ9IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=halsall+computer+networks&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=%22digital%20signal%22&amp;f=false Computer Networking and the Internet]: "In order to transmit a digital signal over an analog subscriber line, modulated transmission must be used; thas is the electrical signal that represents the binary bit stream of the source (digital) output must first be converted to an analog signal that is compatible with a (telephony) speech signal."&lt;/ref&gt;

In communications, sources of interference are usually present, and noise is frequently a significant problem. The effects of interference are typically minimized by filtering off interfering signals as much as possible and by using [[Redundancy (information theory)|data redundancy]]. The main advantages of digital signals for communications are often considered to be the noise immunity to noise capability, and the ability, in many cases such as with audio and video data, to use data compression to greatly decrease the bandwidth that is required on the communication media.

==Logic voltage levels==
{{main article|Logic level}}
[[File:S Digital.svg|framed|A logic signal waveform: (1) low level, (2) high level, (3) rising edge, and (4) falling edge.]]
A [[waveform]] that switches representing the two states of a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value (0 and 1, or low and high, or false and true) is referred to as a ''digital signal'' or ''logic signal'' or ''binary signal'' when it is interpreted in terms of only two possible digits.

The two states are usually represented by some measurement of an electrical property: [[Electric potential|Voltage]] is the most common, but [[Electric current|current]] is used in some logic families.  A threshold is designed for each logic family.  When below that threshold, the signal is ''low'', when above ''high''.

The [[clock signal]] is a special digital signal that is used to [[synchronization|synchronize]] many digital circuits. The image shown can be considered the waveform of a clock signal. Logic changes are triggered either by the rising edge or the falling edge. The rising edge is the transition from a low voltage (level 1 in the diagram) to a high voltage (level 2). The falling edge is the transition from a high voltage to a low one.

Although in a highly simplified and idealized model of a digital circuit, we may wish for these transitions to occur instantaneously, no real world circuit is purely resistive and therefore no circuit can instantly change voltage levels.  This means that during a short, finite [[transition time]] the output may not properly reflect the input, and will not correspond to either a logically high or low voltage.

==Modulation==
{{main article|Modulation#Digital_modulation_methods}}
To create a digital signal, an analog signal must be modulated with a control signal to produce it. The simplest modulation, a type of [[unipolar encoding]], is simply to switch on and off a DC signal, so that high voltages represent a '1' and low voltages are '0'.

In [[digital radio]] schemes one or more carrier waves are [[Amplitude modulation|amplitude]], [[Frequency modulation|frequency]] or [[Phase modulation|phase modulated]] by the control signal to produce a digital signal suitable for transmission.

[[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line]] (ADSL) over [[telephone wire]]s, does not primarily use binary logic; the digital signals for individual carriers are modulated with different valued logics, depending on the [[Shannon capacity]] of the individual channel.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

==Clocking==
[[File:FF Tsetup Thold Toutput.svg|thumb|Clocking digital signals through a clocked flip-flop]]
Often digital signals are "sampled" by a [[clock signal]] at regular intervals by passing the signal through an "edge sensitive" [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]. When this is done the input is measured at those points in time, and the signal from that time is passed through to the output and the output is then held steady till the next clock.

This process is the basis of [[synchronous logic]], and the system is also used in digital signal processing.

However, [[asynchronous logic]] also exists, which uses no single clock, and generally operates more quickly, and may use less power, but is significantly harder to design.

A '''drink carrier''', sometimes also known as a '''cup carrier''', '''beverage carrier''' or '''[[Cup holder (disambiguation)|cup holder]]''' is a device used to carry multiple filled [[beverage]] cups at the same time. 

There are many different designs for drink carriers, but they commonly include relatively deep indentations, holes, or compartments into which the cups are placed. This keeps the drinks from falling over during transport, and distinguishes drink carriers from [[cafeteria]] [[tray]]s, though both may be used to carry both drinks and food.
[[File:Waiter 1732.jpg|thumb|British 1732 style, a waiter or small square [[salver]].]]
Drink carriers may be made from [[paperboard]], [[molded pulp]], [[plastic]] or other materials.

In case of [[instruction level parallelism]], this world is almost equivalent to [[superscalar]].&lt;ref name="Docter 2008"&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Docter|first1=Quentin|last2=Dulaney|first2=Emmett|last3=Skandier|first3=Toby|title=CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide: Exams 220-601 / 602 / 603 / 604|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470297537|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=XXJHxbW9NssC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22dual+pipelining%22|language=en|quote=&lt;br/&gt;With the release of the Pentium chips, ''dual pipelining'' was introduced (also called ''superscalar architecture''), allowing the chip to process two operations at once.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5 microarchitecture]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors is introduced with dual-pipeling.&lt;ref name="Docter 2008"/&gt;
This technology allows the processor to break down a command into two shorter commands and execute them simultaneously when it receives a long command.  If there are separate tasks that must be completed for a result that are independent of one another, they can be executed simultaneously to save time.

Here is an example.  Suppose a command is given to find the result of 14 * 27 + 512^2.  The order of operations requires that 512^2 must be done first and then 14 and 27 must be multiplied.  The result of those two actions would then be added together.  This takes three steps.  With dual pipelining, the first two actions would be computed simultaneously by different pipelines and then those would be added together.  This case takes only two steps, saving one step.  In a more complex command, many more steps can be saved.

'''''Fresh''''' is a 2009 [[documentary]] film directed by Ana Sofia Joanes. The film focuses on [[sustainable agriculture]], and depicts farmers, activists and entrepreneurs who are changing America's [[food system]].

==Synopsis==

Joanes sets out to profile people who are breaking away from conventional models of agriculture and food production. In the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of [[Virginia]], [[Joel Salatin]] explains how he keeps his cows, chickens, pigs and natural grasses flourishing without using artificial fertilizers by closing the nutrient cycle. At [[Growing Power]] farm in [[Milwaukee]], we meet [[Will Allen (urban farmer)|Will Allen]], who is turning three acres of industrial wasteland into nourishing farmland for his neighborhood. In [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], David Ball breaks away from the standard concept of a supermarket by stocking his stores with produce from a [[cooperative]] of local farmers.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that the film "casts a sympathetic eye on farmers under contract to the giants of agribusiness," and is "less judgmental" and "more folksy in tone than the recent ''[[Food, Inc.]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Catsoulis|first=Jeannette|title=What’s the Matter With Corn Syrup?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/movies/09fresh.html|accessdate=April 5, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Feeney of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' wrote, "''Fresh'' may be righteous (as well as right), but it’s not unrealistic," and noted that "not once in the course of the movie is the word 'locavore' used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feeney|first=Mark|title=Fresh: Following produce from seed to plate...to screen|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/06/18/fresh_follows_produce_from_seed_to_plate____to_screen/|accessdate=April 6, 2011|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">The '''Global Internet Freedom Consortium''' is a consortium of organizations that develop and deploy anti-censorship technologies for use by Internet users in countries whose governments restrict Web-based information access.  The organization was reportedly begun in 2001 by Chinese-born scientists living in the United States reacting against Chinese government oppression of the [[Falun Gong]].

==Products==
The main products are [[Freegate]] and [[Ultrasurf]].

==Funding==
The organization states that the majority of its funding comes from its members.  In May 2010, the group was offered a $1.5 million (USD) grant from the United States Department of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/11/AR2010051105154.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&amp;sub=AR |title=U.S. risks China's ire with decision to fund software maker tied to Falun Gong |work=Washington Post |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2010-06-06 | first=John | last=Pomfret}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This move received criticism from representatives of the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith-Spark  |first=Laura |title= US 'to give $1.5m to Falun Gong internet freedom group'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 June 2010|date=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grab-It'''s are microwave-safe cookware easily identifiable by their tab handle. They were introduced by [[Corning Inc.|Corning Glass Works]] in 1977, under the Corning Ware brand and are now sold in a slightly different form by [[Corelle Brands]]. Grab-Its are notable as being among the first cookware specifically designed for microwave use - their design was recognized by the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]]. Grab-Its strongly resemble [[porringer]]s.

Grab-Its were made available in two sizes, smaller 15 ounce and larger "Grab-A-Meal" 24 ounce versions. The 15 ounce Grab-Its were available with a plastic cover and/or a [[Pyrex]] glass lid. 24 ounce versions came with a glass lid only. In addition to microwave use, Corning Ware and Visions Grab-Its made of Pyroceram are safe on the stovetop, in the oven, and under a broiler (without cover). Newer Corning Ware Grab-Its made of stoneware are safe for microwave and oven use only.

== History ==
Grabits were originally produced and sold by Corning Glass Works, and made from opaque [[Pyroceram]] glass-ceramic material.

Corning introduced Grab-Its under the [[Visions (cookware)|Visions]] brand in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leclair.vision/VISIONS/AmberHeatnEat/|title=LeCLAIR.vision: AMBER VISIONS HEAT 'N' EAT|website=leclair.vision|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were made of transparent Pyroceram (known as Celexium in some regions) with an amber tint. A Cranberry variant was introduced in the early 1990s.

Not long after the Corning Consumer Products Company (now known as Corelle Brands) was spun off in 1998, Pyroceram-based Grabits were discontinued in the USA with the close of the Martinsburg, WV plant in the early 2000's.

The 15 ounce versions were re-introduced in the USA as a stoneware product under the Corning Ware brand a short time later. Amber 15 ounce Visions Grab-Its are still made of transparent Pyroceram in France for sales in select European and Asia-Pacific regions.

PARC was unable to commercialize Interpress. Two of its creators, [[Chuck Geschke]] and [[John Warnock]], left  Xerox, formed [[Adobe Systems]], and produced a similar language called [[PostScript]].  Interpress is used in some [[Xerox]] printers, and is supported in [[Corel Ventura|Xerox Ventura Publisher]]. Interpress is also used as the output format for PARC's [[InterScript]] system, which is an editable [[word processor]] format for [[rich text]] documents.

[[File:Elasticsearch Cluster August 2014.png|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating user requests to an [[Elasticsearch]] cluster being distributed by a load balancer. (Example for [[Wikipedia]].)]]
In [[computing]], '''load balancing'''&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; improves the distribution of [[workload]]s across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a [[computer cluster]], [[computer network|network]] links, [[central processing unit]]s, or [[disk drives]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19860014876.pdf Performance Tradeoffs in Static and Dynamic Load Balancing Strategies], NASA March 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize [[throughput]], minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Using multiple components with load balancing instead of a single component may increase reliability and availability through [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]].  Load balancing usually involves dedicated software or hardware, such as a [[Multilayer switch#Layer 4 Load Balancer|multilayer switch]] or a [[Domain Name System]] server process.

Load balancing differs from [[channel bonding]] in that load balancing divides traffic between network interfaces on a [[network socket]] ([[OSI model]] layer 4) basis, while channel bonding implies a division of traffic between physical interfaces at a lower level, either per packet ([[OSI model]] Layer 3) or on a data link ([[OSI model]] Layer 2) basis with a protocol like [[shortest path bridging]].

==Internet-based services==
{{Multiple issues|section=y|
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}
{{refimprove|article's section|date=December 2010}}
}}

One of the most commonly used applications of load balancing is to provide a single Internet service from multiple [[Server (computing)|server]]s, sometimes known as a [[server farm]]. Commonly load-balanced systems include popular [[web site]]s, large [[Internet Relay Chat]] networks, high-bandwidth [[File Transfer Protocol]] sites, [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) servers, [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) servers, and databases.

===Round-robin DNS===
{{Main|Round-robin DNS}}

An alternate method of load balancing, which does not require a dedicated software or hardware node, is called ''[[round robin DNS]]''.  In this technique, multiple [[IP address]]es are associated with a single [[domain name]]; clients are given IP in round robin fashion. IP is assigned to clients for a  time [[quantum]].

===DNS delegation===

Another more effective technique for load-balancing using DNS is to delegate &lt;tt&gt;www.example.org&lt;/tt&gt; as a sub-domain whose zone is served by each of the same servers that are serving the web site. This technique works particularly well where individual servers are spread geographically on the Internet. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;one.example.org A 192.0.2.1
two.example.org A 203.0.113.2
www.example.org NS one.example.org
www.example.org NS two.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;
However, the zone file for &lt;tt&gt;www.example.org&lt;/tt&gt; on each server is different such that each server resolves its own IP Address as the A-record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/a.html IPv4 Address Record (A)]&lt;/ref&gt; On server ''one'' the zone file for &lt;tt&gt;www.example.org&lt;/tt&gt; reports:
&lt;pre&gt;@ in a 192.0.2.1
&lt;/pre&gt;
On server ''two'' the same zone file contains:
&lt;pre&gt;@ in a 203.0.113.2
&lt;/pre&gt;
This way, when a server is down, its DNS will not respond and the web service does not receive any traffic. If the line to one server is congested, the unreliability of DNS ensures less HTTP traffic reaches that server. Furthermore, the quickest DNS response to the resolver is nearly always the one from the network's closest server, ensuring geo-sensitive load-balancing {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. A short [[Time to live|TTL]] on the A-record helps to ensure traffic is quickly diverted when a server goes down. Consideration must be given the possibility that this technique may cause individual clients to switch between individual servers in mid-session.

===Client-side random load balancing===
Another approach to load balancing is to deliver a list of server IPs to the client, and then to have client randomly select the IP from the list on each connection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gameserverarchitecture.com/2015/10/pattern-client-side-load-balancing/ Pattern: Client Side Load Balancing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ithare"&gt;[http://ithare.com/chapter-vib-server-side-architecture-front-end-servers-and-client-side-random-load-balancing/ MMOG Server-Side Architecture. Front-End Servers and Client-Side Random Load Balancing]&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially relies on all clients generating similar loads, and the [[Law of Large Numbers]]&lt;ref name="ithare" /&gt; to achieve a reasonably flat load distribution across servers. It has been claimed that client-side random load balancing tends to provide better load distribution than round-robin DNS; this has been attributed to caching issues with round-robin DNS, that in case of large DNS caching servers, tend to skew the distribution for round-robin DNS, while client-side random selection remains unaffected regardless of DNS caching.&lt;ref name="ithare" /&gt;

With this approach, the method of delivery of list of IPs to the client can vary, and may be implemented as a DNS list (delivered to all the clients without any round-robin), or via hardcoding it to the list. If a "smart client" is used, detecting that randomly selected server is down and connecting randomly again, it also provides fault tolerance.

===Server-side load balancers===
For Internet services, a server-side load balancer is usually a software program that is listening on the [[TCP and UDP port|port]] where external clients connect to access services.  The load balancer forwards requests to one of the "backend" servers, which usually replies to the load balancer. This allows the load balancer to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions. It also prevents clients from contacting back-end servers directly, which may have security benefits by hiding the structure of the internal network and preventing attacks on the kernel's network stack or unrelated services running on other ports.

Some load balancers provide a mechanism for doing something special in the event that all backend servers are unavailable.  This might include forwarding to a backup load balancer, or displaying a message regarding the outage.

It is also important that the load balancer itself does not become a [[single point of failure]]. Usually load balancers are implemented in [[High availability|high-availability]] pairs which may also replicate session persistence data if required by the specific application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/HighAvailability.html|title= High Availability|publisher=linuxvirtualserver.org | accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scheduling algorithms====
Numerous [[scheduling algorithm]]s, also called load-balancing methods, are used by load balancers to determine which back-end server to send a request to.&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Mauro.
[https://www.nginx.com/blog/choosing-nginx-plus-load-balancing-techniques/ "Choosing an NGINX Plus Load‑Balancing Technique"].
2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Simple algorithms include random choice, [[Round-robin scheduling|round robin]], or least connections.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205223948/https://f5.com/resources/white-papers/load-balancing-101-nuts-and-bolts|title=Load Balancing 101: Nuts and Bolts|last=|first=|date=2017-12-05|website=|publisher=[[F5 Networks]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated load balancers may take additional factors into account, such as a server's reported load, least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic it has recently been assigned.

====Persistence====
An important issue when operating a load-balanced service is how to handle information that must be kept across the multiple requests in a user's session. If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ideally the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected.  This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database, for example [[Memcached]].

One basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as ''persistence'' or ''stickiness''. A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic [[failover]]: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost. The same problem is usually relevant to central database servers; even if web servers are "stateless" and not "sticky", the central database is (see below).

Assignment to a particular server might be based on a username, client [[IP address]], or be random. Because of changes of the client's perceived address resulting from [[DHCP]], [[network address translation]], and [[web proxy|web proxies]] this method may be unreliable. Random assignments must be remembered by the load balancer, which creates a burden on storage. If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a timeout period or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table. The random assignment method also requires that clients maintain some state, which can be a problem, for example when a web browser has disabled storage of cookies. Sophisticated load balancers use multiple persistence techniques to avoid some of the shortcomings of any one method.

Another solution is to keep the per-session data in a [[database]]. Generally this is bad for performance because it increases the load on the database: the database is best used to store information less transient than per-session data. To prevent a database from becoming a [[single point of failure]], and to improve [[scalability]], the database is often replicated across multiple machines, and load balancing is used to spread the query load across those replicas.  [[Microsoft]]'s [[ASP.net]] State Server technology is an example of a session database. All servers in a web farm store their session data on State Server and any server in the farm can retrieve the data.

In the very common case where the client is a web browser, a simple but efficient approach is to store the per-session data in the browser itself. One way to achieve this is to use a [[HTTP cookie|browser cookie]], suitably time-stamped and encrypted. Another is [[URL rewriting]]. Storing session data on the client is generally the preferred solution: then the load balancer is free to pick any backend server to handle a request. However, this method of state-data handling is poorly suited to some complex business logic scenarios, where session state payload is big and recomputing it with every request on a server is not feasible. URL rewriting has major security issues, because the end-user can easily alter the submitted URL and thus change session streams.

Yet another solution to storing persistent data is to associate a name with each block of data, and use a [[distributed hash table]] to pseudo-randomly assign that name to one of the available servers, and then store that block of data in the assigned server.

====Load balancer features====
Hardware and software load balancers may have a variety of special features. The fundamental feature of a load balancer is to be able to distribute incoming requests over a number of backend servers in the cluster according to a scheduling algorithm. Most of the following features are vendor specific:

; Asymmetric load
: A ratio can be manually assigned to cause some backend servers to get a greater share of the workload than others. This is sometimes used as a crude way to account for some servers having more capacity than others and may not always work as desired.
; Priority activation
: When the number of available servers drops below a certain number, or load gets too high, standby servers can be brought online.
; [[TLS acceleration|TLS Offload and Acceleration]]
: TLS (or its predecessor SSL) acceleration is a technique of offloading cryptographic protocol calculations onto a specialized hardware. Depending on the workload, processing the encryption and authentication requirements of an [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] request can become a major part of the demand on the Web Server's CPU; as the demand increases, users will see slower response times, as the TLS overhead is distributed among Web servers. To remove this demand on Web servers, a balancer can terminate TLS connections, passing HTTPS requests as HTTP requests to the Web servers. If the balancer itself is not overloaded, this does not noticeably degrade the performance perceived by end users. The downside of this approach is that all of the TLS processing is concentrated on a single device (the balancer) which can become a new bottleneck. Some load balancer appliances include specialized hardware to process TLS. Instead of upgrading the load balancer, which is quite expensive dedicated hardware, it may be cheaper to forgo TLS offload and add a few Web servers. Also, some server vendors such as Oracle/Sun now incorporate cryptographic acceleration hardware into their CPUs such as the T2000. F5 Networks incorporates a dedicated TLS acceleration hardware card in their local traffic manager (LTM) which is used for encrypting and decrypting TLS traffic. One clear benefit to TLS offloading in the balancer is that it enables it to do balancing or content switching based on data in the HTTPS request.
; [[Distributed denial of service|Distributed Denial of Service]] (DDoS) attack protection
: Load balancers can provide features such as [[SYN cookies]] and delayed-binding (the back-end servers don't see the client until it finishes its TCP handshake) to mitigate [[SYN flood]] attacks and generally offload work from the servers to a more efficient platform.
; [[HTTP compression]]
: HTTP compression reduces the amount of data to be transferred for HTTP objects by utilising gzip compression available in all modern web browsers.  The larger the response and the further away the client is, the more this feature can improve response times.  The trade-off is that this feature puts additional CPU demand on the load balancer and could be done by web servers instead.
; TCP offload
: Different vendors use different terms for this, but the idea is that normally each HTTP request from each client is a different TCP connection.  This feature utilises HTTP/1.1 to consolidate multiple HTTP requests from multiple clients into a single TCP socket to the back-end servers.
; TCP buffering
: The load balancer can buffer responses from the server and spoon-feed the data out to slow clients, allowing the web server to free a thread for other tasks faster than it would if it had to send the entire request to the client directly.
; Direct Server Return
: An option for asymmetrical load distribution, where request and reply have different network paths.
; Health checking
: The balancer polls servers for application layer health and removes failed servers from the pool.
; [[HTTP caching]]
: The balancer stores static content so that some requests can be handled without contacting the servers.
; Content filtering
: Some balancers can arbitrarily modify traffic on the way through.
; HTTP security
: Some balancers can hide HTTP error pages, remove server identification headers from HTTP responses, and encrypt cookies so that end users cannot manipulate them.
; [[Priority queuing]]
: Also known as [[rate shaping]], the ability to give different priority to different traffic.
; Content-aware switching
: Most load balancers can send requests to different servers based on the URL being requested, assuming the request is not encrypted (HTTP) or if it is encrypted (via HTTPS) that the HTTPS request is terminated (decrypted) at the load balancer.
; Client authentication
: Authenticate users against a variety of authentication sources before allowing them access to a website.
; Programmatic traffic manipulation
: At least one balancer allows the use of a scripting language to allow custom balancing methods, arbitrary traffic manipulations, and more.
; [[Firewall (networking)|Firewall]]
: Firewalls can prevent direct connections to backend servers, for network security reasons.
; [[Intrusion prevention system]]
: Intrusion prevention systems offer application layer security in addition to network/transport layer offered by firewall security.

==Use in telecommunications==
Load balancing can be useful in applications with redundant communications links.  For example, a company may have multiple Internet connections ensuring network access if one of the connections fails. A [[failover]] arrangement would mean that one link is designated for normal use, while the second link is used only if the primary link fails.

Using load balancing, both links can be in use all the time.  A device or program monitors the availability of all links and selects the path for sending packets. The use of multiple links simultaneously increases the available bandwidth.

===Shortest Path Bridging===

SPB allows all links to be active through multiple equal cost paths, provides faster convergence times to reduce down time, and simplifies the use of load balancing in [[Network topology#Mesh|mesh network topologies]] (partially connected and/or fully connected) by allowing traffic to load share across all paths of a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Routing 1===
{{further|Routing}}

Many telecommunications companies have multiple routes through their networks or to external networks.  They use sophisticated load balancing to shift traffic from one path to another to avoid [[network congestion]] on any particular link, and sometimes to minimize the cost of transit across external networks or improve [[Reliability (computer networking)|network reliability]].

Another way of using load balancing is in [[network monitoring]] activities. Load balancers can be used to split huge data flows into several sub-flows and use several network analyzers, each reading a part of the original data. This is very useful for monitoring fast networks like [[10 Gigabit Ethernet|10GbE]] or STM64, where complex processing of the data may not be possible at [[wire speed]].

==Use in datacenter networks==
Load balancing is widely used in datacenter networks to distribute traffic across many existing paths between any two servers.&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;M. Noormohammadpour, C. S. Raghavendra, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321744877_Datacenter_Traffic_Control_Understanding_Techniques_and_Trade-offs "Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Trade-offs,"] IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials, vol. PP, no. 99, pp. 1-1.&lt;/ref&gt; It allows more efficient use of network bandwidth and reduces provisioning costs. In general, load balancing in datacenter networks can be classified as either static or dynamic. Static load balancing distributes traffic by computing a hash of the source and destination addresses and port numbers of traffic flows and using it to determine how flows are assigned to one of the existing paths. Dynamic load balancing assigns traffic flows to paths by monitoring bandwidth utilization of different paths. Dynamic assignment can also be proactive or reactive. In the former case, the assignment is fixed once made, while in the latter the network logic keeps monitoring available paths and shifts flows across them as network utilization changes (with arrival of new flows or completion of existing ones). A comprehensive overview of load balancing in datacenter networks has been made available.&lt;ref name=architecture/&gt;

==Relationship to failovers==
Load balancing is often used to implement [[failover]]—the continuation of a service after the failure of one or more of its components.  The components are monitored continually (e.g., web servers may be monitored by fetching known pages), and when one becomes non-responsive, the load balancer is informed and no longer sends traffic to it.  When a component comes back online, the load balancer begins to route traffic to it again.  For this to work, there must be at least one component in excess of the service's capacity ([[N+1 redundancy]]).  This can be much less expensive and more flexible than failover approaches where each single live component is paired with a single backup component that takes over in the event of a failure ([[dual modular redundancy]]).  Some types of [[RAID]] systems can also utilize [[hot spare]] for a similar effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">'''Manuterge''' is the name given by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to the towel used by the priest when engaged liturgically.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Manuterge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
There are two kinds of manuterges. One serves the needs of the [[sacristy]]. The priest uses this at the washing of hands before mass, before distributing Communion outside of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and before administering [[Baptism#Baptism_and_salvation_in_Catholic_teaching|baptism]]. It can also be used for drying the hands after they have been washed on occasions not prescribed by the rubrics, but still customary after Mass. There are no prescriptions as to material and form for the towel used in the [[sacristy]]. It is usual to have it hanging over a roller, the two ends being sewn together so as to make it into a circular band. The custom of washing the hands before Mass may date from [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] tradition since the ceremony is expressly mentioned in the sacramentaries of the ninth and tenth centuries.

The other manuterge is used in the Mass for drying both the hands at the [[Lavabo]], an action performed by the priest after the Offertory as he recites the psalm, "Lavabo", and also by the bishop before the [[Offertory]] and after the [[Communion (sacrament)|Communion]]. It is kept on the [[credence table]] with the finger-bowl and [[cruet]]s. There are no ecclesiastical regulations regarding the form and material of this manuterge. The towel, which is used after the Offertory during the recital of the psalm "Lavabo", is usually small (18 in. by 14 in.), only the points of the thumb and two fingers, and not the whole hand, being usually washed. It usually has lace or embroidery at the ends.

The '''atmospheric engine''' was invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712, and is often referred to simply as a '''Newcomen engine'''. The engine was operated by condensing steam drawn into the cylinder, thereby creating a partial vacuum which allowed the atmospheric pressure to push the piston into the cylinder. It was the first practical device to harness [[steam]] to produce [[mechanical work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Charles R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newcomen engines were used throughout [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and Europe, principally to pump water out of [[mining|mines]]. Hundreds were constructed through the 18th century.

[[James Watt]]'s later [[Watt steam engine|engine design]] was an improved version of the Newcomen engine that roughly doubled [[fuel efficiency]]. Many atmospheric engines were converted to the Watt design, for a price based on a fraction of the savings in fuel. As a result, Watt is today better known than Newcomen in relation to the origin of the [[steam engine]].

Prior to Newcomen a number of small [[steam]] devices of various sorts had been made, but most were essentially novelties.&lt;ref name=rochestercapone&gt;[http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html University of Rochester, NY, ''The growth of the steam engine'' online history resource, chapter one.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034636/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html |date=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small [[fountain]]s working like a [[coffee percolator]]. First a container was filled with water via a pipe, which extended through the top of the container to nearly the bottom.  The bottom of the pipe would be submerged in the water, making the container airtight.  The container was then heated to make the water boil.  The steam generated pressurized the container, but the inner pipe, immersed at the bottom by liquid, and lacking an airtight seal at top, remained at a lower pressure; expanding steam forced the water at the bottom of the container into and up the pipe to spurt out of a [[nozzle]] on top. These devices had limited effectiveness but illustrated the principle's viability.

In 1606, the [[Spaniard]], [[Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont]] demonstrated and was granted a patent for a steam powered water pump. The pump was successfully used to drain the inundated mines of [[Guadalcanal, Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garcia|first=Nicolas|title=Mas alla de la Leyenda Negra|year=2007|publisher=Universidad de Valencia|location=Valencia|isbn=9788437067919|pages=443–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1662 Edward Somerset, second [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester|Marquess of Worcester]], published a book containing several ideas he had been working on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/dircks/cover.html Century of Inventions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807134258/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/dircks/cover.html |date=7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains; the device alternately used a partial [[vacuum]] and steam pressure. Two containers were alternately filled with steam, then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a [[water well|well]] to the container. A fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated. By working the two containers alternately, the delivery rate to the header tank could be increased.

===Savery's "Miner's Friend"===
In 1698 [[Thomas Savery]] patented a steam-powered pump he called the "Miner's Friend",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/savery/ The Miners Friend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511121051/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/savery |date=11 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially identical to Somerset's design and almost certainly a direct copy. The process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow, so Savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam.

Savery's invention cannot be strictly regarded as the first steam "engine" since it had no moving parts and could not transmit its power to any external device. There were evidently high hopes for the Miner's Friend, which led Parliament to extend the life of the patent by 21&amp;nbsp;years, so that the 1699 patent would not expire until 1733. Unfortunately, Savery's device proved much less successful than had been hoped.

A theoretical problem with Savery's device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about {{convert|30|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}; to this could be added another {{convert|40|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, or so, raised by steam pressure. This was insufficient to pump water out of a mine. In Savery's pamphlet, he suggests setting the boiler and containers on a ledge in the mineshaft and even a series of two or more pumps for deeper levels. Obviously these were inconvenient solutions and some sort of mechanical pump working at surface level – one that lifted the water directly instead of "sucking" it up – was desirable. Such pumps were common already, powered by horses, but required a vertical reciprocating drive that Savery's system did not provide.  The more practical problem concerned having a boiler operating under pressure, as demonstrated when [[Thomas Savery#Application of the engine|the boiler of an engine at Wednesbury exploded]], perhaps in 1705.

===Denis Papin's experimental steam cylinder and piston===
[[Louis Figuier]] in his monumental work&lt;ref&gt;Figuer, Louis "Merveilles de la science" Furne Jouvet et Cie, Paris 1868. Vol 1, pp. 53,54&lt;/ref&gt; gives a full quotation of [[Denis Papin]]'s paper published in 1690 in ''Acta eruditorum'' at Leipzig, entitled ''"Nouvelle méthode pour obtenir à bas prix des forces considérables"'' (A new method for cheaply obtaining considerable forces). It seems that the idea came to Papin whilst working with [[Robert Boyle]] at the [[Royal Society]] in London. Papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water into the bottom of a vertical cylinder, inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston, placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder. The piston was then temporarily locked in the upper position by a spring catch engaging a notch in the rod. The fire was then removed, allowing the cylinder to cool, which condensed steam back into water, thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston. To the end of the piston rod was attached a cord passing over two pulleys and a weight hung down from the cord's end. Upon releasing the catch, the piston was sharply drawn down to the bottom of the cylinder by the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the created vacuum; enough force was thus generated to raise a {{convert|60|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight. Although the engine certainly worked as far as it went, it was devised merely to demonstrate the principle and having got this far, Papin never developed it further, although in his paper he did write about the potential of boats driven by "firetubes". Instead he allowed himself to be distracted into developing a variant of the Savery engine.

==Introduction and spread==
Newcomen took forward Papin's experiment and made it workable, although little information exists as to exactly how this came about. The main problem to which Papin had given no solution was how to make the action repeatable at regular intervals. The way forward was to provide, as Savery had, a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder, providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam, and disposing of the water once it had been condensed. The power piston was hung by chains from the end of a rocking beam. Unlike Savery's device, pumping was entirely mechanical, the work of the steam engine being to lift a weighted rod slung from the opposite extremity of the rocking beam. The rod descended the mine shaft by gravity and drove a force pump, or pole pump (or most often a gang of two) inside the mineshaft. The suction stroke of the pump was only for the length of the upward (priming) stroke, there consequently was no longer the 30-foot restriction of a vacuum pump and water could be forced up a column from far greater depths. The boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe. Making all this work needed the skill of a practical engineer; Newcomen's trade as an "ironmonger" or metal merchant would have given him significant practical knowledge of what materials would be suitable for such an engine and brought him into contact with people having even more detailed knowledge.

It is possible that the first Newcomen engine was in [[Cornwall]]. Its location is uncertain, but it is known that one was in operation at [[Wheal Vor]] mine in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

H. Andrew and J. S. Allen, 'A confirmation of the location of the 1712 "Dudley Castle" Newcomen engine at Coneygree, Tipton' ''International Journal for the history of Engineering and Technology'' 72(2) (2009), 174–182.&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally accepted as the first successful Newcomen engine, but it may have been preceded by one built a mile and a half east of [[Wolverhampton]].&lt;ref&gt;Suhail Rana, 'New evidence supporting Wolverhampton as the location of the first working Newcomen engine' ''International Journal for the history of Engineering and Technology'' 72(2) (2009), 162–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Both these were used by Newcomen and his partner [[John Calley (engineer)|John Calley]] to pump out water-filled coal mines. A working replica can today be seen at the nearby [[Black Country Living Museum]], which stands on another part of what was [[Edward Ward, 9th Baron Dudley|Lord Dudley]]'s Conygree Park.

Soon orders from wet mines all over England were coming in, and some have suggested that word of his achievement was spread through his [[Baptist]] connections. Since Savery's patent had not yet run out, Newcomen was forced to come to an arrangement with Savery and operate under the latter's patent, as its term was much longer than any Newcomen could have easily obtained. During the latter years of its currency, the patent belonged to an unincorporated company, ''The Proprietors of the Invention for raising water by fire''.

Although its first use was in coal-mining areas, Newcomen's engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native West Country, such as the tin mines of Cornwall. By the time of his death, Newcomen and others had installed over a hundred of his engines, not only in the West Country and the Midlands but also in north Wales, near Newcastle and in Cumbria. Small numbers were built in other European countries, including in France, Belgium, Spain, and Hungary, also at [[Dannemora, Sweden]]. Evidence of the use of a Newcomen Steam Engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in [[Midlothian, VA]] (site of some of the first coal mines in the US).

==Technical details==

===Components===
Although based on simple principles, Newcomen's engine was rather complex and showed signs of incremental development, problems being [[empirical]]ly addressed as they arose. It consisted of a [[boiler]] '''A''', usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. This produced large quantities of very low pressure steam, no more than 1 – 2 psi (0.07 – 0.14 bar) – the maximum allowable pressure for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates. The action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking [[beam engine|"Great balanced Beam"]], the [[Lever|fulcrum]] '''E''' of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building, the engine being located ''in-house''. The pump rods were slung by a chain from the arch-head '''F''' of the great beam. From the in-house arch-head '''D''' was suspended a piston '''P''' working in a [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] '''B''', the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the [[piston]] and the bottom end closed, apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler; early cylinders were made of cast brass, but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce. The piston was surrounded by a seal in the form of a leather ring, but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true, a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston. Installed high up in the engine house was a water tank '''C''' (or ''header tank'') fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head. The header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a ''stand-pipe'' for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes, one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity.

===Operation===
The pump equipment was heavier than the steam piston, so that the position of the beam at rest was pump-side down/engine-side up, which was called "out of the house".

To start the engine, the regulator [[valve]] '''V''' was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The regulator valve was then closed and the water injection valve '''V'''' briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensed]] the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the [[Stroke (engine)|power stroke]], bringing the beam "into the house" and raising the pump gear.

Steam was then readmitted to the cylinder, destroying the vacuum and driving the condensate down the sinking or "eduction" pipe. As the low pressure steam from the boiler flowed into the cylinder, the weight of the pump and gear returned the beam to its initial position whilst at the same time driving the water up from the mine.

This cycle was repeated around 12 times per minute.

====Snifting valve====
Newcomen found that his first engine would stop working after a while, and eventually discovered that this was due to small amounts of air being admitted to the cylinder with the steam. Water usually contains some dissolved air, and boiling the water released this with the steam. This air could not be condensed by the water spray and gradually accumulated until the engine became "wind logged". To prevent this a release valve called a "snifting clack" or snifter valve was added near the bottom of the cylinder. This opened briefly when steam was first admitted to and non-condensable gas was driven from the cylinder. Its name was derived from the noise it made when it operated to release the air and steam "like a Man snifting with a Cold".&lt;ref&gt;"A Course of Experimental Philosophy", John Theophilus Desaguliers, 1744, Vol II p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automation {{anchor|Humphrey Potter}}===
In early versions, the [[valve]]s or ''plugs'' as they were then called, were operated manually by the ''plug man'' but the repetitive action demanded precise timing, making automatic action desirable. This was obtained by means of a ''plug tree'' which was a beam suspended vertically alongside the cylinder from a small arch head by crossed chains, its function being to open and close the valves automatically when the beam reached certain positions, by means of tappets and [[escapement]] mechanisms using weights. On the 1712 engine, the water feed pump was attached to the bottom of the plug tree, but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head. There is a common legend that in 1713 a ''cock boy'' named Humphrey Potter,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oDQDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22humphrey+potter&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22humphrey%20potter&amp;f=false Dionysius Lardner, ''The steam engine familiarly explained and illustrated'']&lt;/ref&gt; whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended, made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Steam Engine |volume=25 |pages=818–850 |first=James Alfred |last=Ewing |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (known as the "potter cord");&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; however the plug tree device (the first form of [[valve gear]]) was very likely established practice before 1715, and is clearly depicted in the earliest known images of Newcomen engines by [[Henry Beighton]] (1717)&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (believed by Hulse to depict the 1714 Griff colliery engine) and by Thomas Barney (1719) (depicting the 1712 Dudley Castle engine). Because of the very heavy steam demands, the engine had to be periodically stopped and restarted, but even this process was automated by means of a buoy rising and falling in a vertical stand pipe fixed to the boiler (the first [[pressure gauge]]?). The buoy was attached to the ''scoggen'', a weighted lever that worked a stop blocking the water injection valve shut until more steam had been raised.

===Pumps===
Most images show only the engine side, giving no information on the pumps. Current opinion is that at least on the early engines, dead-weight force [[pumps]] were used, the work of the engine being solely to lift the pump side ready for the next downwards pump stroke. This is the arrangement used for the Dudley Castle replica which effectively works at the original stated rate of 12 strokes per minute/10 gallons (54.6litres) lifted per stroke. The later [[Watt engine]]s worked lift pumps powered by the engine stroke and it may be that later versions of the Newcomen engine did so too.

==Development and application==
[[File:PSM V12 D142 Newcomen engine as improved by smeaton 1775.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pencil sketch of Newcomen steam engine as improved by [[John Smeaton|Smeaton]], from ''[[Popular Science]]'' monthly circa 1877]]
Towards the close of its career, the atmospheric engine was much improved in its mechanical details and its proportions by [[John Smeaton]], who built many large engines of this type during the 1770s.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The urgent need for an engine to give rotary motion was making itself felt and this was done with limited success by Wasborough and [[James Pickard|Pickard]] using a Newcomen engine to drive a flywheel through a crank. Although the principle of the crank had long been known, [[James Pickard|Pickard]] managed to obtain a 12-year patent in 1780 for the specific application of the crank to steam engines; this was a setback to Boulton and Watt who got round the patent by applying the [[sun and planet gear|sun and planet]] motion to their advanced double-acting rotative engine of 1782.

By 1725 the Newcomen engine was in common use in mining, particularly [[coal mining|collieries]].  It held its place with little material change for the rest of the century.  Use of the Newcomen engine was extended in some places to pump municipal water supply; for instance the first Newcomen engine in France was built at [[Passy]] in 1726 to pump water from the Seine to the city of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Among the earliest examples of this was at [[Coalbrookdale]].  A horse-powered pump had been installed in 1735 to return water to the pool above the Old Blast Furnace.  This was replaced by a Newcomen engine in 1742–3.&lt;ref name="Belford, 2007" &gt;{{Cite journal

Attempts were made to drive machinery by Newcomen engines, but these were unsuccessful, as the single power stroke produced a very jerky motion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=No citation: attempts were made to drive machinery...}}

[[File:Elsecar Newcomen engine.jpg|thumb|right|Newcomen-style engine at the [[Elsecar Heritage Centre]], in 2006]]
The main problem with the Newcomen design was that it used energy inefficiently, and was therefore expensive to operate. After the water vapor within was cooled enough to create the vacuum, the cylinder walls were cold enough to condense some of the steam as it was admitted during the next intake stroke. This meant that a considerable amount of fuel was being used just to heat the cylinder back to the point where the steam would start to fill it again. As the heat losses were related to the surfaces, while useful work related to the volume, increases in the size of the engine increased efficiency, and Newcomen engines became larger in time. However, efficiency did not matter very much within the context of a colliery, where coal was freely available.

Newcomen's engine was only replaced when [[James Watt]] improved it in 1769 to avoid this problem (Watt had been asked to repair a model of a Newcomen engine by [[Glasgow University]]; a small model that exaggerated the problem). In the [[Watt steam engine]], condensation took place in an exterior condenser unit, attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe. When a valve on the pipe was opened, the vacuum in the condenser would, in turn, evacuate that part of the cylinder below the piston. This eliminated the cooling of the main cylinder walls and such, and dramatically reduced fuel use. It also enabled the development of a [[double-acting cylinder]], with both upwards and downwards power strokes, increasing amount of power from the engine without a great increase in the size of the engine.

Watt's design, introduced in 1769, did not eliminate Newcomen engines immediately. Watt's vigorous defence of his [[patents]] resulted in the continued use of the Newcomen engine in an effort to avoid [[royalty payments]]. When his patents expired in 1800 &lt;ref&gt; Michele Boldrin, David K. Levine, and Alessandro Nuvolari, Do Patents Encourage or Hinder Innovation? The Case of the Steam Engine - https://fee.org/media/5345/122008freeman-boldrin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; there was a rush to install Watt engines, and Newcomen engines were eclipsed, even in collieries.

==Surviving examples==
The [[Newcomen Memorial Engine]] can be seen operating in Newcomen's home town of [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], where it was moved in 1963 by the Newcomen Society. This is believed to date from 1725, when it was initially installed at the Griff Colliery near Coventry.&lt;ref name="damu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dartmouthmuseum.org/collections/memories/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112234127/http://dartmouthmuseum.org/collections/memories/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 January 2013|title=Memories of Dartmouth – Dartmouth Museum|publisher=[[Dartmouth Museum]]|accessdate=22 May 2012|quote=The engine on display in Dartmouth was donated by the British Transport Commission to the Newcomen Society in 1963 and erected within an old electricity sub station.

The only Newcomen-style engine still extant in its original location is at what is now the [[Elsecar Heritage Centre]], near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. This was probably the last commercially used Newcomen-style engine, as it ran from 1795 until 1923. The engine underwent extensive conservation works, together with its original shaft and engine-house, which were completed in autumn 2014.

In 1986, a full-scale operational replica of the 1712 Newcomen Steam Engine was completed at the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in Dudley. It is the only full-size working replica of the engine in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclm.co.uk/map8.htm Black Country Living Museum: Newcomen Steam Engine]&lt;/ref&gt; The 'fire engine' as it was known, is an impressive brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall. Rods hang from the outer end of the beam and operate pumps at the bottom of the mine shaft which raise the water to the surface. The engine itself is simple, with only a boiler, a cylinder and piston and operating valves. A coal fire heats the water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated then passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above the boiler. The cylinder is more than 6 1/2 feet (2 metres) long and 20 1/2 inches (52 centimetres) in diameter. The steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/newcomen-engine/8.htm#.WNi91m8rKUk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''No. 100 (Bomber Support) Group''' was a special duties [[Group (air force)|group]] within [[RAF]] [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]]. The group was formed on 11 November 1943 to consolidate the increasingly complex business of [[electronic warfare]] and [[Electronic countermeasures|countermeasure]]s in one organisation. The group was responsible for the development, operational trial and use of electronic warfare and countermeasures equipment. It was based at RAF stations in [[East Anglia]], chiefly [[Norfolk]].

The group was a pioneer in countering the formidable force of [[radar]]-equipped [[Luftwaffe]] [[night fighter]]s, using a range of [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electronic]] 'homers' fitted to [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighters which detected night fighter radar and radio emissions and allowed the RAF fighters to home in onto the [[Axis powers|Axis]] aircraft and either shoot them down or disrupt their missions against the [[bomber stream]]s. Other Mosquitoes would patrol around Luftwaffe fighter airfields ready to attack night fighters as they landed. 

This constant harassment had a detrimental effect on the morale and confidence of many Luftwaffe crews and indirectly led to a high proportion of aircraft and aircrew wastage from crashes as night fighters hurried in to land to avoid the Mosquito threat (real or imagined). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} 

From 1944–45, the Mosquitos of 100 Group claimed 258 Luftwaffe aircraft shot down for 70 losses. The gradually increasing threat from the RAF fighters also created what the Luftwaffe crews nicknamed ''Moskito Panik'' as the night fighter crews were never sure when or where they may come under attack from the marauding 100 Group fighters.

Top Mosquito ace with 100 Group was [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Branse Burbridge]] of [[No. 85 Squadron RAF|85 Squadron]], with 21 claims from 1944–45.

The bomber squadrons of 100 Group utilised various specialist electronic jamming devices to disrupt German [[Radio|radio communications]] and radar. During 100 Group's existence over 32 different devices were evaluated and used. Specially equipped 100 Group aircraft would fly in the bomber stream. Much of this equipment was developed at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE).

Special equipment used included ''Airborne Cigar'' (ABC) jammer, ''Jostle'' (jammer), ''Mandrel'' (jammer), ''Airborne Grocer'' (jammer), ''Piperack'' (jammer), ''[[Perfectos]]'' (homer), ''[[Serrate radar detector|Serrate]]'' (homer), ''Corona'' (spoofer), ''Carpet'' (jammer)  and  ''Lucero'' (homer), used against German equipment such as [[Lichtenstein radar|''Lichtenstein'']], [[Freya radar|''Freya'']], and [[Würzburg radar|''Wurzburg'']] radars.

No. 100 Group was headquartered at [[Bylaugh Hall]], [[Norfolk]] from January 1944, a central location from which to administer the group's airfields in north Norfolk. No 100 Group operated from eight airfields with approximately 260 aircraft, 140 of which were various marks of Mosquito night fighter intruders with the remainder consisting of [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, [[Short Stirling]]s, [[Vickers Wellington]]s, [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Fortresses]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberators]] carrying electronic jamming equipment. The group also operated the [[Bristol Beaufighter]] for a short time.

The group disbanded on 17 December 1945. During its existence it had one commander, [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Edward Addison]].

'''LP ''Odyssey''''' is a self-propelled [[semi-submersible]] mobile [[spacecraft]] launch platform converted from a mobile [[Oil platform|drilling rig]] in 1997.

The vessel was used by [[Sea Launch]] for equatorial [[Pacific Ocean]] launches. She works in concert with the assembly and control ship {{ship||Sea Launch Commander}}.  Her home port is the [[Port of Long Beach]] in the United States.

In her current form, ''Odyssey'' is {{convert|436|ft|m}} long and about {{convert|220|ft|m}} wide, with an empty draft displacement of {{convert|30000|ST}}, and a submerged draft displacement of {{convert|50600|ST}}. The vessel has accommodations for 68 crew and launch system personnel, including living, dining, medical and recreation facilities. A large, environmentally-controlled hangar stores the rocket during transit and then rolls it out and erects it prior to fueling and launch.

In September 2016 the platform along with other Sea Launch assets was sold to [[S7 Group]], the parent company of [[S7 Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url=http://tass.com/science/1029619 |title=Sea Launch floating spaceport’s new owner to resume launches |agency=[[TASS]] |date=12 December 2017 |access-date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2018|11|23}}

==History==
[[File:OceanOdyssey.jpg|thumb|''Ocean Odyssey'' in her original drilling rig configuration]]

The platform was built in 1982 for [[ODECO|Ocean Drilling &amp; Exploration Company (ODECO)]] by [[Sumitomo Heavy Industries]]. It drilled its first exploratory hole about {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat]] for [[ARCO]] Alaska, Inc. The rig cost about {{US$|110 million}} to build during the early eighties oil "boom".

During construction the vessel was called ''Ocean Ranger II'', and was renamed ''Ocean Odyssey'' after {{ship||Ocean Ranger}} capsized with all hands lost during a storm off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] on February 15, 1982.

When built, ''Ocean Odyssey'' was classed +A1 +AMS by the [[American Bureau of Shipping]] for unrestricted worldwide ocean service. She was a {{convert|390|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|226|ft|m|adj=on}} wide, twin-hull design with a {{convert|12450|hp|abbr=on}} propulsion system. The rig's structure was designed to simultaneously withstand {{convert|100|kn|km/h|adj=on}} winds, {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} waves, and a {{convert|3|kn|km/h|adj=on}} current. The derrick was fully enclosed with a heated drill floor permitting operations down to {{convert|-35|C|0}}.

The rig had other advanced extreme-condition features as well. For example, the rig's columns were strengthened to withstand some ice impact and the marine riser had a feature similar to a [[cow-catcher]] to keep floating ice off the marine riser that connected the rig to the well on the ocean bottom.

===1988 North Sea gas blowout===
On September 22, 1988, ''Ocean Odyssey'' suffered a blowout while operated by ODECO (now [[Diamond Offshore Drilling]]) on hire to [[ARCO]] (now a subsidiary of BP), drilling the 22/30b-3 well on a prospect in the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name="ord080414" /&gt; The ultimate direct cause of the incident was a failure of the subsea wellhead equipment after a prolonged period of well control.&lt;ref name="Wann1989" /&gt; During the resulting fire the radio operator, Timothy Williams, was killed. He had been ordered from the lifeboats and back to the radio room by the rig's manager, who failed to countermand the order when the rig was evacuated.&lt;ref name="ord080414" /&gt;

Survivors were picked up by the rig's emergency standby vessel ''Notts Forest'' (38 rescued) and the nearby anchor handling tug ''British Fulmar'' (28 rescued).&lt;ref name="Vinnem2013"/&gt; Four [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopters from {{HMS|Illustrious|R06|6}} and a Sea King from [[RAF Lossiemouth]] assisted rescue operations and transferred survivors from ''Notts Forest'' and ''British Fulmar'' to the drilling rig ''Sedneth 701''.&lt;ref name="upi19880922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSE199704"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rescue"/&gt; A [[Royal Air Force]] [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]] provided coordination on scene.&lt;ref name="rescue" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nstimes19880924"/&gt;

The incident was featured in the 1990 [[Scottish Television|STV]] television series [[Rescue (UK TV series)|''Rescue'']] episode "Missing".&lt;ref name="rescue" /&gt;

===Launch platform conversion===
''Ocean Odyssey'' spent the next several years as a rusting hulk in the docks of [[Dundee]], Scotland. Her availability prompted [[Boeing]] to establish the [[Sea Launch]] consortium, for which she was bought in 1993 by [[Kværner]] Rosenberg of [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]], and renamed LP ''Odyssey''.

From late 1995 to May 1997, Kværner extended the length of the platform and added a pair of support columns and additional propulsion systems. The upper deck &amp;mdash; the location of the former drill floor &amp;mdash; was rebuilt to accommodate the launch pad and launch vehicle service hangar. In May 1997, ''Ocean Odyssey'' arrived at Kværner [[Vyborg]] Shipyard for the installation of the launch vehicle equipment itself.

By 1999, the vessel was ready for service, and on March 27, 1999, a [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit-3SL]] rocket successfully launched a [[DemoSat|demonstration satellite]] to a [[geostationary transfer orbit]].&lt;ref name="demosat launch" /&gt; The first commercial launch occurred on October 9, 1999, with the orbiting of the [[DirecTV]] [[DirecTV satellite fleet#Satellites and their orbits|1-R]] satellite.&lt;ref name="directv1R launch" /&gt;

===2007 launch failure===
[[File:SeaLaunch-Odyssey.jpg|thumb|''Odyssey'' at port, with ''Sea Launch Commander'' behind]]

On January 30, 2007, a Zenit-3SL carrying the [[NSS-8]] satellite exploded aboard ''Odyssey'' at liftoff due to a turbopump malfunction. There were no injuries, as the ship had been evacuated for launch operations. Damage to the launch platform was mostly superficial, though a {{convert|600000|lb|abbr=on}} flame deflector was knocked loose from underneath the platform and lost, along with damage to the hangar doors and antennae. The vessel was repaired at a shipyard in Vancouver, British Columbia.&lt;ref name="seattle20070131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sfn20080115" /&gt;

''Odyssey'' returned to service with the January 15, 2008, successful launch of the [[Thuraya 3]] satellite.&lt;ref name="sl25" /&gt;

===2013 launch failure===
On February 1, 2013, the Zenit-3SL rocket carrying [[Intelsat 27]] suffered a failure after its launch from ''Odyssey'', crashing a short distance from the launch platform. Its first stage engine appeared to shut down around 25 seconds after launch and telemetry from the rocket was lost about 15 seconds later.&lt;ref name="avweek20130201" /&gt; Telemetry indicated that excessive roll was detected 11 seconds after launch.  The guidance system was programmed to shut down the engine, but only after the rocket was safely away from the launch platform.  It is believed that a failure in a hydraulic pump that provides power for gimbaling the RD-171 engine was ultimately the cause.  No damage was done to the launch platform.&lt;ref name="sf101-20130202"/&gt;

'''Osseointegration''' (from Latin ''ossum'' "[[bone]]" and ''integrare'' "to make whole") is the direct structural and functional connection between living [[bone]] and the surface of a load-bearing [[Implant (medicine)|artificial implant]] ("load-bearing" as defined by Albrektsson et al. in 1981). A more recent definition (by [[Schroeder]] et al.) defines osseointegration as "functional [[ankylosis]] (bone adherence)", where new bone is laid down directly on the implant surface and the implant exhibits [[Mechanical properties of biomaterials|mechanical stability]] (also known as ''primary stability'' – i.e., resistance to destabilization by [[mechanical agitation]] or [[shear force]]s). Osseointegration has enhanced the science of [[medicine|medical]] bone and [[Replacement joint|joint replacement]] techniques as well as [[dental implant]]s and improving [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]] for [[amputee]]s.

== Definition ==
Osseointegration is also defined as: "the formation of a direct interface between an implant and bone, without intervening soft tissue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Benjamin F. |last1=Miller |first2=Claire B. |last2=Keane |title=[[Miller-Keane Encyclopedia &amp; Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health]] |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-3456-7}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Osseointegrated implant''' is a type of [[Implant (medicine)|implant]] defined as "an endosteal implant containing pores into which osteoblasts and supporting connective tissue can migrate".&lt;ref name=mosby2002&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Mosby's Medical, Nursing &amp; Allied Health Dictionary]] |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2002 |page=1240 |isbn=0-323-01430-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to oral implantology, this thus refers to [[bone]] grown right up to the [[Dental implant|implant]] surface without interposed soft tissue layer. No [[scar|scar tissue]], [[cartilage]] or [[ligament]] fibers are present between the [[bone]] and implant surface. The direct contact of bone and implant surface can be verified [[microscope|microscopically]].

Osseointegration may also be defined as :
# Osseous integration, the apparent direct attachment or connection of [[osseous tissue]] to an inert alloplastic material without intervening connective tissue.
# The process and resultant apparent direct connection of the endogenous material surface and the host bone tissues without intervening connective tissue.
# The interface between alloplastic material and bone.

== History ==
[[Image:Osseointegration Histology.jpg|thumb|Titanium implant (black) integrated into bone (red): Histologic section]]
Osseointegration was first observed—albeit not explicitly stated—by Bothe, Beaton, and Davenport in 1940.&lt;ref name="Rudy et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudy|first1=Robert|last2=Levi|first2=Paul A|last3=Bonacci|first3=Fred J|last4=Weisgold|first4=Arnold S|last5=Engler-Hamm|first5=Daniel|title=Intraosseous anchorage of dental prostheses: an early 20th century contribution.|journal=Compend Contin Educ Dent|date=2008|volume=29|issue=4|pages=220–229|pmid=18524206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bothe et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bothe|first1=RT|last2=Beaton|first2=KE|last3=Davenport|first3=HA|title=Reaction of bone to multiple metallic implants.|journal=Surg Gynecol Obstet|date=1940|volume=71|pages=598–602}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bothe et al. were the first researchers to implant titanium in an animal and remarked how it had the tendency to fuse with bone.&lt;ref name="Rudy et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bothe et al." /&gt;  Bothe et al. reported that due to the elemental nature of the titanium, its strength, and its hardness, it had great potential to be used as future prosthesis material.&lt;ref name="Rudy et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bothe et al." /&gt;  Osseointegration was later described by Gottlieb Leventhal in 1951.&lt;ref name="Rudy et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leventhal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leventhal|first1=Gottlieb|title=Titanium, a metal for surgery|journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am|date=1951|volume=33-A|issue=2|pages=473–474|pmid=14824196|url=http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;id=14824196&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leventhal placed titanium screws in rat femurs and remarked how "At the end of 6 weeks, the screws were slightly tighter than when originally put in; at 12 weeks, the screws were more difficult to remove; and at the end of 16 weeks, the screws were so tight that in one specimen the femur was fractured when an attempt was made to remove the screw. Microscopic examinations of the bone structure revealed no reaction to the implants.  The trabeculation appeared to be perfectly normal."&lt;ref name="Rudy et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leventhal /&gt; The reactions described by Leventhal and Bothe et al. would later be coined into the term "osseointegration" by [[Per-Ingvar Brånemark]] of Sweden.  In 1952, Brånemark conducted an experiment where he utilized a titanium implant chamber to study blood flow in rabbit bone. At the conclusion of the experiment, when it became time to remove the titanium chambers from the bone, he discovered that the bone had integrated so completely with the implant that the chamber could not be removed. Brånemark called this "osseointegration", and, like Bothe et al. and Leventhal before him, saw the possibilities for human use.&lt;ref name="Rudy et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bothe et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leventhal /&gt;

In [[dentistry|dental medicine]] the implementation of osseointegration started in the mid-1960s as a result of Brånemark's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-3913(83)80101-2 |author=Brånemark PI |title=Osseointegration and its experimental background |journal=The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=399–410 |date=September 1983 |pmid=6352924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Per-Ingvar |last1=Brånemark |first2=George Albert |last2=Zarb |first3=Tomas |last3=Albrektsson |title=Tissue-integrated prostheses: osseointegration in clinical dentistry |publisher=Quintessence |location=Chicago |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=978-0-86715-129-9}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Tomas |last1=Albrektsson |first2=George A. |last2=Zarb |title=The Branemark osseointegrated implant |publisher=Quintessence Pub.

This patient had a cleft palate defect and required implants to support a [[palatal obturator]].  Gösta Larsson died in 2005, with the original implants still in place after 40 years of function.&lt;ref name="mcclarence"/&gt;

In the mid-1970s Brånemark entered into a commercial partnership with the Swedish defense company [[Bofors]] to manufacture dental implants and the instrumentation required for their placement.  Eventually an offshoot of Bofors, Nobel Pharma, was created to concentrate on this product line.  Nobel Pharma subsequently became Nobel Biocare.&lt;ref name="mcclarence"/&gt;

Brånemark spent almost 30 years fighting the scientific community for acceptance of osseointegration as a viable treatment.  In Sweden he was often openly ridiculed at scientific conferences.  His university stopped funding for his research, forcing him to open a private clinic to continue the treatment of patients.  Eventually an emerging breed of young academics started to notice the work being performed in Sweden.  Toronto's George Zarb, a Maltese-born Canadian prosthodontist, was instrumental in bringing the concept of osseointegration to the wider world.  The 1983 Toronto Conference is generally considered to be the turning point, when finally the worldwide scientific community accepted Brånemark's work.  Today osseointegration is a highly predictable and commonplace treatment modality.&lt;ref name="mcclarence"/&gt;
More recently since 2010 [[Munjed Al Muderis|Al Muderis]] in Sydney Australia utilised a high tensile strength titanium implant with high prose plasma sprayed surface as an intramedullary prosthesis that is inserted into the bone residuum of amputees and then connect through an opening in the skin to a robotic limb prosthesis. This allows amputees to mobilise with more comfort and less energy consumption. Al Muderis also published the first series of combining osseointegration prosthesis with Joint replacement enabling below knee amputees with knee arthritis or short residual bone to mobilise without the need of a socket prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khemka A, Frossard L, Lord SJ, Bosley B, Al Muderis M | date = Jul 2015 | title = Osseointegrated total knee replacement connected to a lower limb prosthesis: 4 cases | url = | journal = Acta Orthop | volume = 86 | issue = 6 | pages = 740–4 | pmid = 26145721 | doi=10.3109/17453674.2015.1068635 | pmc=4750776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2015, two Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans, Bryant Jacobs and Ed Salau,  will be the first in America to get a [[percutaneous]] osseointegrated [[prosthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Veteran amputees to undergo first ever prosthetic implants {{!}} KSL.com|url = https://www.ksl.com/?sid=37617374&amp;nid=148&amp;fm=most_popular&amp;s_cid=popular-7|website = www.ksl.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first stage, doctors at Salt Lake Veterans Affairs Hospital will embed a titanium stud in the femur of each patient. About six weeks later, they will go back and attach the docking mechanism for the prosthesis.{{update|date=November 2018}}

==Mechanism==
{{see also|Titanium biocompatibility}}
Osseointegration is a dynamic process in which characteristics of the implant (i.e. macrogeometry, surface properties, etc.) play a role in modulating molecular and cellular behavior. While osseointegration has been observed using different materials, it is most often used to describe the reaction of bone tissues to titanium, or titanium coated with calcium phosphate derivatives.&lt;ref name="Albr 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albrektsson|first1=T|last2=Johansson|first2=C|title=Osteoinduction, osteoconduction and osseointegration|journal=Eur Spine J|date=2001|volume=10|issue=2|pages=S96–S101|doi=10.1007/s005860100282|pmc=3611551}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously thought that titanium implants were retained in bone through the action of mechanical stabilization or interfacial bonding. Alternatively, calcium phosphate coated implants were thought to be stabilized via chemical bonding.  It is now known that both calcium phosphate coated implants and titanium implants are stabilized chemically with bone, either through direct contact between calcium and titanium atoms, or by the bonding to a cement line-like layer at the implant/bone interface.&lt;ref name=davies&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=J|title=Understanding peri-implant endosseous healing.|journal=J Dent Ed|date=2003|volume=67|issue=8|pages=932–949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atoms&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thuvander|first1=M|last2=Andersson|first2=M|title=Atomically resolved tissue integration.|journal=Nano Lett|date=2014|volume=14|issue=8|pages=4220–4223|doi=10.1021/nl501564f|pmid=24989063}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are some differences (e.g. like the lack of chondrogenic progenitors), osseointegration occurs through the same mechanisms as bone fracture healing.&lt;ref name="Colnot 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colnot|first1=C|last2=Romero|first2=DM|last3=Huang|first3=S|last4=Rahman|first4=J|last5=Currey|first5=JA|last6=Nanci|first6=A|last7=Brunski|first7=JB|last8=Helms|first8=JA|title=Molecular analysis of healing at a bone-implant interface.|journal=J Dent Res|date=2007|volume=86|issue=9|pages=109–118|pmid=17720856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albrek osseo 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albrektsson|first1=T|last2=Branemark|first2=PI|last3=Hansson|first3=HA|last4=Lindstrom|first4=J|title=Osseointegrated    titanium implants.

==Technique==
For osseointegrated [[dental implant]]s, metallic, ceramic, and polymeric materials have been used,&lt;ref name=mosby2002/&gt; in particular [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=Arturo N. |editor1-last=Natali |title=Dental biomechanics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Washington, DC |year=2003 |pages=69–87 |isbn=978-0-415-30666-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be termed osseointegration the connection between the bone and the implant need not be 100 percent, and the essence of osseointegration derives more from the stability of the fixation than the degree of contact in histologic terms. In short it represents a process whereby clinically asymptomatic rigid fixation of alloplastic materials is achieved, and maintained, in bone during functional loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=George A. |last1=Zarb |first2=Tomas |last2=Albrektsson |year=1991 |title=Osseointegration: A requiem for the periodontal ligament? |journal=International Journal of Periodontology and Restorative Dentistry |issue=11 |pages=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implant healing times and initial stability are a function of implant characteristics. For example, implants utilizing a screw-root form design achieve high initial mechanical stability through the action of their screws against the bone. Following placement of the implant, healing typically takes several weeks or months before the implant is fully integrated into the surrounding bone. First evidence of integration occurs after a few weeks, while more robust connection is progressively effected over the next months or years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Tomas |last1=Albrektsson |first2=Tord |last2=Berglundh |first3=Jan |last3=Lindhe |chapter=Osseointegration: Historic Background and Current Concepts |editor1-first=Jan |editor1-last=Lindhe |editor2-first=Thorkild |editor2-last=Karring |editor3-first=Niklaus P. |editor3-last=Lang |title=Clinical Periodontology and Implant Dentistry |publisher=Blackwell Munksgaard |location=Oxford |year=2003 |page=815 |isbn=1-4051-0236-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Implants that possess a screw-root form design result in bone resorption followed by interfacial bone remodeling and growth around the implant.&lt;ref name="Coelho 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coelho|first1=P|last2=Jimbo|first2=R|title=Osseointegration of metallic devices: current trends based on implant hardware design.|journal=Arch Biochem Biophys|date=2014|volume=561|pages=99–108|pmid=25010447|doi=10.1016/j.abb.2014.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implants utilizing a plateau-root form design (or screw-root form implants with a wide enough gap between the pitch of the screws) undergo a different mode of peri-implant ossification. Unlike the aforementioned screw-root form implants, plateau-root form implants exhibit de novo bone formation on the implant surface.&lt;ref name="Berglundh 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berglundh|first1=T|last2=Abrahamsson|first2=I|last3=Lang|first3=N|last4=Lindhe|first4=J|title=De novo alveolar bone formation adjacent to endosseous implants.|journal=Clin.

Though the osseointegrated interface becomes resistant to external shocks over time, it may be damaged by prolonged adverse stimuli and overload, which may result in implant failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Tomas |last1=Albrektsson |first2=Tord |last2=Berglundh |first3=Jan |last3=Lindhe |chapter=Osseointegration: Historic Background and Current Concepts |editor1-first=Jan |editor1-last=Lindhe |editor2-first=Thorkild |editor2-last=Karring |editor3-first=Niklaus P. |editor3-last=Lang |title=Clinical Periodontology and Implant Dentistry |publisher=Blackwell Munksgaard |location=Oxford |year=2003 |page=816 |isbn=1-4051-0236-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0501.1996.070208.x |author=Isidor F |title=Loss of osseointegration caused by occlusal load of oral implants.

Other complications may arise even in the absence of external impact. One issue is the growing of [[cementum|cement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pauletto N, Lahiffe BJ, Walton JN |title=Complications associated with excess cement around crowns on osseointegrated implants: a clinical report |journal=The International Journal of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Implants |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=865–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10612925}}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal cases, the absence of cementum on the implant surface prevents the attachment of [[collagen]] fibers. This is normally the case due to the absence of cementum progenitor cells in the area receiving the implant. However, when such cells are present, cement may form on or around the implant surface, and a functional collagen attachment may attach to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=George W. |last1=Bernard |first2=Ferritin A. |last2=Carranza |first3=Sascha A. |last3=Jovanovic |year=1996 |chapter=Biologic Aspects of Dental Implants |pages=685–9 |editor1-first=Fermín A. |editor1-last=Carranza |editor2-first=Michael G. |editor2-last=Newman |title=Clinical Periodontology |isbn=978-0-7216-6728-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advances in materials engineering: metal foams===

Since 2005, a number of orthopedic device manufacturers have introduced products that feature [[metal foam|porous metal construction]].&lt;ref&gt;Biomet Orthopedics, Regenerex® Porous Titanium Construct, http://www.biomet.com/orthopedics/productDetail.cfm?category=2&amp;product=231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer Orthopedics, Trabeluar Metal Technology, http://www.zimmer.com/ctl?template=CP&amp;op=global&amp;action=1&amp;id=33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer Cancellous-Structured Titanium Porous Coating, http://www.zimmer.com/ctl?op=global&amp;action=1&amp;id=7876&amp;template=MP&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinical studies on mammals have shown that porous metals, such as titanium foam, may allow the formation of vascular systems within the porous area.&lt;ref&gt;Osseointegration with Titanium Foam in Rabbit Femur, YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdscnna5r1Q&lt;/ref&gt;  For orthopedic uses, metals such as [[tantalum]] or [[titanium]] are often used, as these metals exhibit high [[tensile strength]] and corrosion resistance with excellent [[biocompatibility]].

The process of osseointegration in metal foams is similar to that in [[bone grafts]].  The porous bone-like properties of the metal foam contribute to extensive bone infiltration, allowing [[osteoblast]] activity to take place.  In addition, the porous structure allows for soft tissue adherence and [[vascularization]] within the implant.  These materials are currently deployed in [[hip replacement]], [[knee replacement]] and [[dental implant]] surgeries.

== Testing procedures ==
There are a number of methods used to gauge the level of osseointegration and the subsequent stability of an implant. One widely used diagnostic procedure is percussion analysis, where a dental instrument is tapped against the implant carrier.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Implant Dentistry - A Rapidly Evolving Practice|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=111–126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the ringing that results is used as a qualitative measure of the implant’s stability. An integrated implant will elicit a higher pitched "crystal" sound, whereas a non-integrated implant will elicit a dull, low-pitched sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=Current trends to measure implant stability|url=|journal=Journal of the Indian Prosthodontic Society|volume=16|pages=124–130|via=|doi=10.4103/0972-4052.176539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method is a reverse torque test, in which the implant carrier is unscrewed. If it fails to unscrew under the reverse torque pressure, the implant is stable. If the implant rotates under the pressure it is deemed a failure and removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2007|title=Methods Used to Assess Implant Stability: Current Status|url=http://www.sld.cu/galerias/pdf/sitios/protesis/methods_used_to_assess_implant_stability.pdf|journal=International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants|volume=22|pages=742–754|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method comes at the risk of fracturing bone that is mid-way in the process of osseointegration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also unreliable in determining the osseointegration potential of a bone region, as tests have yielded that a rotating implant can go on to be successfully integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanoff|first=C. J.|last2=Sennerby|first2=L.|last3=Lekholm|first3=U.|date=1997-08-01|title=Reintegration of mobilized titanium implants. An experimental study in rabbit tibia|journal=International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|volume=26|issue=4|pages=310–315|issn=0901-5027|pmid=9258729|doi=10.1016/s0901-5027(97)80878-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-invasive and increasingly implemented diagnostic method is [[resonance frequency analysis]] (RFA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A resonance frequency analyzer device prompts vibrations in a small metal rod temporarily attached to the implant. As the rod vibrates, the probe reads its resonance frequency and translates it into an [[implant stability quotient]] (ISQ), which ranges from 1–100, with 100 indicating the highest stability state. Values ranging between 57 and 82 are generally considered stable, though each case must be considered independently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications ==
* [[Dental implant]]s are by far the main field of application
* Retention of a [[craniofacial prosthesis]] such as an artificial ear (ear prosthesis), [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|maxillofacial]] reconstruction, eye ([[orbital prosthesis]]), or nose (nose prosthesis)

'''PROBA-V''' is the fourth satellite in the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[PROBA|PROBA series]]; the V standing for vegetation.

==Satellite==
''PROBA-V'' is a small [[satellite]], assuring the succession of the Vegetation instruments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spot-vegetation.com/|title=SPOT-Vegetation |publisher=VITO |accessdate = 2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; on board the French [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT-4 and SPOT-5]] Earth observation missions. PROBA-V was initiated by the Space- and Aeronautics department of the [[BELSPO|BELgian Science Policy Office]]. It is built by QinetiQ Space N.V. and operated by [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and uses a [[PROBA]] platform. PROBA-V will support applications such as land use, worldwide vegetation classification, crop monitoring, famine prediction, food security, disaster monitoring and biosphere studies. The mission was originally conceived as a "gap filler" between the [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT-5]] end-of-life (foreseen mid-2014) and the launch of the constellation of the [[Sentinel-3A]] and -3B satellites. Due to delays of the [[Sentinel (satellite)|Sentinel]] programme and because some instrument specifications of the Sentinel3 satellites have meanwhile changed, PROBA-V no longer is a gap filler mission but will assure the continuation of the Vegetation programme as such. The Vegetation, International User Committee (IUC, an independent body consisting of Vegetation users, that provides user feedback and recommendations to the Vegetation Steering Committee) has recommended to foresee a successor mission for PROBA-V, because the current specifications of the Sentinel3 satellites no longer allow the continuation of the Vegetation products in the long run. This mission is the first full application mission with a PROBA platform and had a very tight development schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacenv.qinetiq.com/experience/remote-sensing/Pages/PROBA-V.aspx |title=PROBA-V |publisher=Qinetiq Space |accessdate=2013-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625074709/http://www.spacenv.qinetiq.com/experience/remote-sensing/Pages/PROBA-V.aspx |archivedate=2013-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and operations==
PROBA-V and its onboard instruments have been developed and built by QinetiQ Space N.V and subcontractors for the Directorate of TEChnology (DTEC) of [[ESA]]. These developments have been paid with Belgian and Luxembourg contributions to ESA. The In Orbit Commissioning Review (IOCR) was successfully achieved on 27/11/2013. After the launch and the commissioning, PROBA-V was handed over from DTEC to the Earth Observation Directorate of [[ESA]] on 12/12/2013. After this handover the Earth Observation Directorate of [[ESA]] will manage the satellite operations, instrument data collection and distribution of the traditional Vegetation products to the users. VITO will actually generate and distribute these products. The management of the new, higher resolution products will be assured by the Space- and Aeronautics department of the [[BELSPO|BELgian Science Policy Office]]. For these products too, VITO will actually generate and distribute these higher resolution products.

==Onboard instruments==
[[File:Image of Belgium, acquired by ESA’s Proba-V satellite.jpg|thumb| Photo made by PROBA-V in 300&amp;nbsp;m per pixel resolution of [[Belgium]], showing land cover and vegetation growth]]
The primary payload of Proba-V is the Vegetation instrument, built by [[OIP Sensor Systems]]. This is a reduced-mass version of the Vegetation instrument which was on board the [[SPOT (satellites)|SPOT-4 and -5]] satellites to provide a daily overview of global vegetation growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/export/SPECIALS/Proba/SEMBHS4PVFG_0.html |title=PROBA-V Misson |publisher=ESA |accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Vegetation products generated by these instruments include the 1-day Synthesis products and the 10-day Synthesis products, both with a ground resolution of about 1&amp;nbsp;km (1&amp;nbsp;km x 1&amp;nbsp;km pixel size). Despite the fact that the Vegetation instrument onboard PROBA-V has a higher spatial resolution (smaller groundpixels) than the Vegetation instruments on board the SPOT satellites, the long time series (15&amp;nbsp;years) of the traditional Vegetation products will be continued by PROBA-V. Thus, PROBA-V will also generate the traditional Vegetation products at approximately 1&amp;nbsp;km x 1&amp;nbsp;km ground resolution. The spectral bands (see [[Electromagnetic spectrum]]) are nearly identical to the spectral bands of the SPOT Vegetation instruments. Other characteristics of the PROBA-V Vegetation instrument are :

==Launch==
PROBA-V was launched from [[ELA-1]] at [[Guiana Space Centre]] on board [[Vega flight VV02]], on {{Date|2013-5-7}} together with the Vietnamese [[VNREDSat 1A]] satellite, and [[Estonia]]'s first satellite, [[ESTCube-1]]. The launch will mark the first test of the new Vespa dual-payload adapter; ''PROBA-V'' will ride in the upper position of the Vespa adapter, and [[VNREDSat 1A]] will sit in the lower position.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1301/04vnredsat1a/ |title=Vietnamese satellite booked for second Vega launch |author=Stephen Clark |date=2013-01-04 |publisher=Spaceflight Now |accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The usable lifetime of PROBA-V highly depends on the local time of the descending node [[LTDN]]. Given that PROBA-V has no onboard propulsion, the natural drift of this LTDN depends on the satellites' in orbit injection accuracy. Based on the injection accuracy specifications of the VEGA launcher, a usable lifetime between 2.5 and 5 years was predicted. The achieved in orbit injection accuracy is such that the LTDN will be out of the specifications after 5 years.

==Data policy==
The data policy for the traditional Vegetation products, as provided by the SPOT-Vegetation instruments, was not freely accessible for all users, meaning that for some products, the user had to pay a fee. Only the products older than 3 months were for free for everybody and were delivered on a best effort basis.

'''Pulse''' is an interbank [[electronic funds transfer]] (EFT) network in the [[United States]]. It serves more than 4,400 U.S. financial institutions and includes more than 380,000 ATMs, as well as POS terminals nationwide. Rivals of the network include [[First Data]]'s [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]] and [[Fidelity National Information Services]]'s [[NYCE]]. It is owned by [[Discover Financial]], issuer of the [[Discover Card]], and is included in Discover's agreement with [[China UnionPay]]; cards can be used on each other's network leading to better acceptance outside large cities than the larger networks.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The Pulse system was based on software that operated the [[TYME|Take Your Money Everywhere]] (TYME) network operating in the central United States. The network was established as the banking rules that limited banks and branches ability to share services were removed. The data processing facilities were originally provided by First City Bank and later transitioned to Texas Commerce Bank.
* 1981, Pulse incorporates and begins operating its regional EFT switching facility.
* 1995, Pulse launches Pulse Pay, a point-of-sale service where cardholders can use their [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] card at retailers.
* 1997, Pulse announced acquisition of [[Gulfnet]], the [[Louisiana]]-based regional EFT network.
* 2000, Pulse announced it would acquire the Cincinnati-based [[MoneyStation]] network.
* 2002, Pulse merged with [[Wisconsin]]-based [[Tyme]] Corporation.
* 2005, Pulse is acquired by the [[Discover Financial Services]]
* Currently, Pulse is a California residential mortgage licensee (License Number MLS-18827).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Merger of Discover Financial Services and Pulse closes following Pulse members approval |publisher=[[Discover Financial Services]] |url=http://investorrelations.discoverfinancial.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=204177&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1005801&amp;highlight= |date= January 12, 2005 |accessdate = October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quitsato Sundial''' is a cultural-tourist place located at La Mitad Del Mundo, near to [[Cayambe (canton seat)|Cayambe]], 47&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Quito]]. It was built in 2006 and inaugurated in 2007 as an independent, non-profit project in a 24,756&amp;nbsp;ft² (2300 m²) area. Its main goal is to share crucial aspects of the [[astronomy|astronomical]] knowledge of the prehispanic cultures of the region. The expositions are carried out by community members as a self-sustaining project. According to Google Maps, the central pillar is 4 meters south of the true equator.

[[File:SundialEquinox.JPG|thumb|180px|Projection of the shadow of the gnomon at the equinox. [[Cayambe (volcano)]] can be seen behind, the only place where the Equator passes through a glacier. Also, it is the highest point on the Equator in the world.]]

== Structure ==
It consists of a circular platform of 177.64&amp;nbsp;ft (54 m) in diameter which forms a mosaic of light and dark [[pebble]]s drawing an eight-pointed star that indicates the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, plus intermediate lines pointing to the [[cardinal direction]]s. In the center of this platform there is a 10&amp;nbsp;m (32.80&amp;nbsp;ft) high, 1.30&amp;nbsp;m (4.27&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter cylindrical orange tube which serves as a [[gnomon]], pointing to the corresponding hours and months of the year in the platform according to the shadow cast by the [[Sun]]. The ten meter high gnomon represents the  [[metric system]], based in the meter, which in its origin was intended to equal one ten-millionth of the quadrant of the Earth's circumference. The purpose of the color difference between the stones, apart from showing equinox and solstice lines, is to explain the meaning of [[albedo]] and its use in astronomical study. The Equator line is drawn by using smaller, darker pebbles between two metal plates.

The angles that form the geometric design of the eight-pointed star are given by the tilt of the Earth with respect to the [[ecliptic]] of the Earth, thus the platform itself also presents a reading of the [[celestial mechanics]]. Detailed positions of the solstices and equinoxes, as well as their respective axes, are presented.

[[File:ECSundialGPS.jpg|thumb|180px|A GPS reading of the Equator north of the sundial.]]

The Ecuadorian Military Geographic Institute has placed two cylinders surrounded by concrete on a platform on top of the Equatorial line, with a 1&amp;nbsp;mm error margin determined by using [[GPS]] and [[GNSS]] equipment.

'''Refmex GL Glass''' is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] manufacturer of high-quality industrial [[glass]] products. Its main markets are [[borosilicate glass]], f-silicate glass, and industrial [[quartz glass]].

The company was founded in 1977 at [[Zapopan]], Mexico as '''Refractarios Mexicanos SA de CV''' .  The company later changed its name to  '''Refmex GL SA de CV'''. It was founded related to the crisis Mexico suffered in 1976 to help the nation out of it creating employment for local people in re-selling glass, later, in 1985, they started producing their own glass for windows, the business was not very successful and they began the borosilicate glass business in Mexico.

The company employs 125 employees worldwide, according to its 2011 reports.

The company currently has four plants, two of them in [[Tesistan]], Mexico, and two located in [[Zapopan]], a nearby territory. The company announced plans for a fifth plant in 2013, but it has not been approved yet.

The '''San Juan-Chama Project''' is a [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] [[interbasin water transfer]] project located in the states of [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]] in the [[United States]]. The project consists of a series of tunnels and diversions that take water from the drainage basin of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] – a tributary of the [[Colorado River]] – to supplement water resources in the [[Rio Grande]] watershed. The project furnishes water for [[irrigation]] and municipal water supply to cities along the Rio Grande including [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].

==Background==
Most major agricultural and urban areas in New Mexico today lie along the narrow corridor of the Rio Grande as it cuts across the center of this predominantly desert state. [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers arrived in the area in the late 1500s, followed by [[Mexico|Mexican]] and American [[settler]]s in the 18th and 19th centuries, building large irrigation systems and [[diversion dam]]s to allow agricultural production in the arid region. In the early 1920s, water supply in the Rio Grande basin was already severely stressed, and studies were conducted as to the feasibility of procuring additional water by [[transbasin diversion]] from tributaries of the San Juan River.&lt;ref name="project"&gt;{{cite web

The 1933-1934 Bunger Survey studied potential locations for diversions and storage reservoirs, and in 1939, the [[Rio Grande Compact]] was signed, dividing Rio Grande waters between Colorado, New Mexico and [[Texas]] including allocations from a potential future diversion from the San Juan basin.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]] was established in 1948, it also included provisions for the tentative diversion project under its water allotment to New Mexico.&lt;ref name="project"/&gt; In the 1950s, post-[[World War II]] population growth in central New Mexico put even larger strains on the Rio Grande's water, and the need for a transbasin water project rose because water supplies in the area quickly became overallocated.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Studies for the project continued through the early 1950s, but actual implementation languished until 1962 when [[United States Congress|Congress]] amended the [[Wayne N. Aspinall#Colorado River Storage Act of 1956|Colorado River Storage Act of 1956]], allowing the diversion of part of New Mexico's share of Colorado River basin waters into the Rio Grande basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The project would be constructed in two phases.&lt;ref name="project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; However, Reclamation ran into difficulties because the [[Navajo Nation]] asserted rights to about {{convert|900000|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}} of water from the San Juan River, which runs through their traditional lands. Resultantly, only the first phase of the project was ever constructed, delivering just under 47% of the original amount proposed by Reclamation.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On December 19, 1964, construction began on the Azotea Tunnel, the main [[Water tunnel (physical infrastructure)|water tunnel]] for the project, running from the Navajo River south to Azotea Creek in the Rio Chama watershed. Work started on the Oso and Little Oso tunnels in February 1966, and construction on the Blanco Tunnel began in March of the same year. In 1967, an enlargement of the outlets of existing [[El Vado Dam]] to accommodate increased flows from the diversion project was completed, and construction began on Heron Dam, which would impound the project's main storage reservoir.&lt;ref name="project"/&gt; Azotea Tunnel was holed through and construction was finished on the project's three diversion dams in 1970. Heron Dam was completed the next year. Nambe Falls Dam, completed in 1976, was the last part of the project to be built. The dam was the only one built of a series of small independent irrigation units originally proposed under the project to serve [[Indigenous peoples of the United States|Native American]] lands. In 1978, Reclamation announced the completion of the San Juan-Chama Project.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Project description==
===Diversion works===
The San Juan-Chama Project taps the water of the Rio Blanco, Navajo and Little Navajo Rivers via a series of small [[diversion dam]]s, tunnels and siphons. Blanco Diversion Dam, with a diversion capacity of {{convert|520|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, sends water into the Blanco Feeder Conduit, which connects to the {{convert|8.64|mi|km|adj=on}}-long Blanco Tunnel and flows south towards the Little Navajo River. The water passes underneath the river via the Little Oso Siphon and connects to the Oso Tunnel. Just upstream from the siphon, Little Oso Diversion Dam sends up to {{convert|150|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water through the Little Oso Feeder Conduit, which also empties into the Oso Tunnel.&lt;ref name="project"/&gt;

Oso Tunnel, with a capacity of {{convert|650|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, travels {{convert|5.05|mi|km}} south to the Navajo River, which it passes under via the Oso Siphon. Oso Diversion Dam on the Navajo diverts additional water into the Oso Feeder Conduit, which joins with water from the Oso Tunnel and Siphon to form the Azotea Tunnel. The Azotea Tunnel, which has a capacity of {{convert|950|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, runs south for {{convert|12.8|mi|km}}, passing under the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]]. The tunnel terminates at Azotea Creek, a tributary of Willow Creek, which is in turn a tributary of the Rio Chama. The lower portion of Azotea Creek has been [[River engineering#Channelization|channelized]] to mitigate erosion from the higher flows.&lt;ref name="project"/&gt;

===Storage facilities===
The main storage facility for the project is [[Heron Lake (New Mexico)|Heron Lake]], a reservoir formed by [[Heron Dam]] on Willow Creek about {{convert|8|mi|km}} downstream of the terminus of Azotea Tunnel and {{convert|20|mi|km}} southwest of [[Chama, New Mexico]]. The reservoir has a capacity of {{convert|401320|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}} and has a surface area of {{convert|5950|acre|ha|abbr=on}}. Heron Dam is an earthfill dam {{convert|269|ft|m}} high and {{convert|1220|ft|m}} long, standing {{convert|249.1|ft|m}} above the streambed. Heron Lake receives water from a catchment of {{convert|193|mi2|km2|abbr=on}}, which has been augmented to over three times this size by the San Juan-Chama diversions.&lt;ref name="project"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nambe Falls Dam is located about {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of Santa Fe on the Rio Nambe, a tributary of the Rio Grande. The dam and reservoir are functionally independent from the other facilities of the San Juan-Chama Project. The curved earthfill dam forms Nambe Falls Lake, which has a capacity of {{convert|2023|acre feet|m3|abbr=on}} and controls runoff from a catchment of {{convert|35|mi2|km2|abbr=on}}. Its main purpose is to provide irrigation water for about {{convert|2800|acre|ha|abbr=on}} in the Pojoaque Valley, which is situated west and downstream of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Water allocations==
Each year, a minimum of {{convert|86210|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}} of San Juan-Chama water is allocated as follows. Because annual diversions average about {{convert|110000|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}}, there is usually a surplus available for other uses along the river. About 75% of the water serves municipal and industrial uses; the remaining fourth furnishes irrigation supplies to approximately {{convert|92500|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land along the Rio Grande and Rio Nambe. Surplus water is also used to maintain a permanent pool at the [[Cochiti Lake]] flood-control reservoir on the Rio Grande.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10788">The '''self-sealing suction cup''' is a [[suction cup]] that exerts a suction force only when it is in physical contact with an object. Unlike most other suction cups, it does not exert any [[suction]] force when it is not in contact with an object.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=May 2010|title=Design, fabrication, and implementation of self-sealing suction cup arrays for grasping|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5509818/|journal=2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation|volume=|pages=|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its grasping ability is achieved entirely through passive means without the use of sensors, valves, or actuators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=November 2011|title=A Self-Sealing Suction Cup Array for Grasping|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265068249_A_Self-Sealing_Suction_Cup_Array_for_Grasping|journal=Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics|volume=3|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1115/1.4004893|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed so that, when used as part of a suction cup array, the suction cups that don’t come in contact with the object remain sealed. By having only the suction cups that are in direct contact of the object to exhibit suction force, the researchers were able to minimize leak points where air could enter and increase the pressure that each active cup receives, maximizing the suction force.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/3-d-printed-octopus-suckers-help-robots-stick/|title=3-D Printed Octopus Suckers Help Robots Stick|last=Harmon|first=Katherine|date=February 21, 2013|work=Scientific American|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an array of self-sealing suction cups can grasp and pick up a wide range of object sizes and shapes. This comes in contrast to conventional suction cups that are typically designed for one specific object size and geometry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, suction cups of various sizes have been manufactured, ranging from the palm of a hand to the point of a fingertip.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/army-uses-3d-printed-tentacles-help-robots-manipulate-objects/139141260531080|title=Army Uses 3D-Printed Tentacles to Help Robots Manipulate Objects|last=Montalbano|first=Elizabeth|date=March 25, 2013|work=Design News|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-sealing suction cup was first developed in 2010 by a collaboration of researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]], the [[Edgewood Chemical Biological Center]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the University of Maryland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Design ==
The design of the self-sealing suction cup was initially inspired by the [[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] of the octopus and its ability to pick up different sized items by individually actuating its suction cups based on the item’s size and physical features.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=1657|title=ECBC, ARL collaborate on octopus-inspired suction cup|last=|first=|date=February 12, 2013|work=Army Research Laboratory|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal geometry of the self-sealing suction cup was designed to the smallest possible size and features a minimum wall thickness of 1.02&amp;nbsp;mm, a tube diameter of 1.59&amp;nbsp;mm, and minimum part spacing of 0.13&amp;nbsp;mm. The suction cup incorporates a mix of rubber and plastic components, where the cup lip, base, tube, springs, and plug are made out of soft rubber while the cup side, collar, hinges, and flange are made out of plastic. As part of its design, a central [[vacuum pump]] can be used to maximize the suction force of the suction cup.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A multi-material [[3d printer|3D printer]] was used to create the prototype of the self-sealing suction cup in about 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Inside the self-sealing suction cup, the plug is positioned close to the tube opening so that it can get sucked into the tube seal the hole when the central suction line is powered. A pair of springs connected to the suction cup’s base helps maintain the plug’s position, restoring the plug seal in the absence of object forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the cup makes contact with an object, a hinge action raises the plug away from the suction tube. The moment the cup’s lips are pushed against the object, the passive reaction forces from the cup lips are transferred to the rubber base of the cup, which stretches over the collar and allow the structure to compress. Acting as a pivot for the hinges, the collar causes the hinges to rotate and the edges of the hinges slide along the underside of the flange and raise the plug away from the suction tube opening. As a result, the suction cup self-seals when not in contact with an object and self-opens the cup’s lips makes contacts with an object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, several improvements were made to the design of the self-sealing suction cup to improve its grasping capabilities. The previous design demonstrated the following flaws:&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=November 21, 2015|title=Compact Hand with Passive Grasping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm3_CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=self-sealing+suction+cup+array+for+grasping+%22army+research%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UNQMkZUWVM&amp;sig=Of1S1QQhxBt2N2Hwa5qkGcQDq_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhqo2yv7rcAhXMUt8KHcSeAnQQ6AEITDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=self-sealing%20suction%20cup%20array%20for%20grasping%20%22army%20research%22&amp;f=false|journal=Experimental Robotics: The 14th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics|volume=|pages=117–126|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The design required a high overall cup height, which increased the bulk of the device.
# The design was relatively fragile with respect to [[Hyperextension|hyper-extension]] as well as [[torsional]] and [[shear force]]s.
# The internal geometry made it difficult to remove the support material inside, varying the quality of the seal.

To address these flaws, researchers from ARL decreased the number of components by consolidating the functions of several parts, which reduced the uncompressed height of the suction cup by almost 50% to 0.72&amp;nbsp;cm. The cup diameter was also reduced to 1.07&amp;nbsp;cm. A [[lever]] system was added to the base of the cup, which pivots the collar to lift the plug. In addition, the tube doubles as a spring, which helps restore the levers and the plug to their closed position. A plastic restraint was added around the cup to aid with handling the hyper-extension, shear, and torsional forces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Performance ==
The self-sealing suction cup has been subjected to a series of tests to determine the quality of its performance. A flexible test rig with four dime-sized suction cups and plastic ribs connected with rubber tubes was created for force-displacement and testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A force-displacement test that compared the performance between the self-sealing suction cup, an identical suction cup, and a commercially available suction cup found that the internal structures of the self-sealing cup allowed more force to be exerted for the same displacement compared to the other cups. However, under identical conditions, the self-sealing cup achieved a maximum force of 12.5 N while the commercially available cup achieved a maximum force of 12.9 N.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A seal quality test measured the pressure generated from each self-sealing suction cup. The results showed that an array of four cups maintained a pressure of 93.8% atmospheric. The test also demonstrated that not all the cups were equally efficient at sealing after object contact. However, this could be the result of variation in the cups’ prior usage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During object grasping testing where the grasping range was examined, the test rig successfully grasped about 80% of the objects attempted. These items consisted of the following: TV remote, pill bottle, glue stick, eyeglasses, fork, disposable bottle, toothpaste, coffee mug, bowl, plate, book, cell phone, bar of soap, paper money, mail, keys, show, table knife, medicine box, credit card, coin, pillow, hairbrush, non-disposable bottle, wallet, magazine, soda can, newspaper, scissors, wrist watch, purse, lighter, compact disc, telephone receiver, full wine bottle, full wine glass, light bulb, lock, padded volleyball, wooden block. (4) As a demonstration of the cups’ strength, the ARL researchers were able to pick up a full bottle of wine using only four of the dime-sized suction cups.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Use in Robotics ==
The self-sealing suction cups have been incorporated in robots to improve their passive grasping capabilities. Due to the design of the suction cups, a central vacuum source can be used to effectively generate suction force from the cups and reduce the number of actuators and sensors for the robot.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|date=February 12, 2016|title=Versatile Passive Grasping for Manipulation|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7406751/|journal=IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1293–1302|doi=10.1109/TMECH.2016.2520306|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from ARL designed and developed a three-finger hand actuator system using a 3D printer in order for the robot to properly utilize the self-sealing suction cups. Four suction cups run along the bottom of each finger, which contains a narrow vacuum channel running through the center. A central vacuum pump serves to power the suction cups and facilitate grasping. The fingers can also curl around the object to better grasp it and release any object in its hold by feeding back the output of the vacuum pump and emitting a burst of [[positive pressure]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The three-finger hand has been used by aerial systems and has demonstrated considerable success in grasping objects on the ground while maintaining flight. According to ARL researchers, the self-sealing suction cups may exhibit higher rates of success underwater due to the extra pressure from the sea depths surrounding and pressing against the object and grasper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, they noted that an underwater environment would require different manufacturing materials that would allow the suction cups to perform well in salt water, such as a thermal plastic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2274">The term '''set-back box''' (SBB) is used in the [[digital TV]] industry to describe a piece of consumer hardware that enables them to access both linear [[broadcast]] and internet-based video content, plus a range of interactive services like [[Electronic program guide|Electronic Programme Guides]] (EPG), [[Pay Per View]] (PPV) and [[Video on Demand]] (VOD) as well as internet browsing, and view them on a large screen television set.  Unlike standard [[set-top boxes]] (STBs), which sit on top or below the TV set, a set-back box has a smaller form factor to enable it to be mounted to the rear of the display panel flat panel TV, hiding it from view.  

To date, set-back boxes have been mainly focused on the cable industry, having been rolled out in four major cable markets in the United States. As of February 2010, these devices are available in both [[standard definition]] (SD) and [[high-definition video|high definition]] (HD) versions, provide a [[DOCSIS]] 2.0 high speed return channel, and are able to receive transmissions in all industry standard compression formats, including [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4/H.264]] and SMPTE-421M/VC-.  This enables [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] to maximise their broadcast bandwidth while creating a new consumer TV experience.

The '''Atos Worldline FASTticket''' system is a passenger-operated, [[self-service]] [[railway]] [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] issuing system, developed by the Guildford-based company Shere Ltd and first introduced on a trial basis in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1996, shortly after [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]].  It has been developed and upgraded consistently since then, and is now used by seven 
[[List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom#Current passenger operators|Train Operating Companies]] (TOCs) as their primary self-service ticket issuing system.  Other TOCs have FASTticket machines at some of their stations, sometimes supplementing other systems.

==History and origins==
In the last years of British Rail, before privatisation, the main passenger-operated ticket issuing system (POTIS) on the network was the [[Ascom B8050 Quickfare|"Quickfare" B8050]], developed in the late 1980s by Swiss company Ascom Autelca AG.  These machines were geared towards high-volume, low-value transactions: they only accepted cash, offered a small and mostly unchanging range of destinations, and were a minor evolution from similar earlier machines whose computer technology was based in the early 1980s.  Quickfares were widespread, especially in the erstwhile [[Network SouthEast]] area, but their limitations were increasing as technology became more sophisticated.

Shere Ltd, founded in its present form in 1992, initially specialised in self-service ticket sales/collection and check-in systems for airlines (notably the former [[bmi (airline)|British Midland]] and [[KLM UK]]).  In the first instance, the FASTticket system was developed directly from these, with early FASTticket terminals resembling their airport equivalents in many respects.  Only a small range of tickets were available, for example - mostly higher-value tickets to important destinations such as London; only [[Payment card|debit and credit cards]] were accepted; [[Touchscreen|touch-screen]] functionality was offered, but there were limited options and sub-menus; and some of the early machines only printed ATB-style tickets ('''A'''utomated '''T'''icket and '''B'''oarding Pass - an international standard format used by airlines, coaches, railways, ferries and other transport undertakings), which are large and inconvenient for passengers to carry, in comparison with standard credit-card-sized tickets.

As more TOCs showed an interest in the system, the hardware and software were developed further, and machines were universally provided with printers able to vend credit-card-sized tickets (although receipts, card sales vouchers and seat reservations were sometimes still printed by a separate printer within the same machine, on glossy flexible paper cut from a roll - batch reference RSP 3598/3: [http://railticketsillustrated.digimig.co.uk/p11659663.html Example]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).

[[File:Shere FAST (Original).JPG|thumb|right|Travel ticket printed in the "original" format - note the different font.]]

Before the now standard "Common Stock" layout and format was devised in 2003, credit-card-sized travel tickets were printed on either RSP 3598 or RSP 7599/SCT orange-banded, round-cornered, hopper-fed ticket stock with pre-printed headings.  From September 2003, machines began to be converted to the Common Stock format, '''(printed by the Newbury Data ND4020 ticket printer)''' with the standard RSP 9599 stock (with no pre-printed headings) being used.  The first machine to be converted in this way was at [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot Parkway]].  Newly installed machines used the Common Stock format as from 2004, and almost all machines have now been converted to do so (as of 2006).

Silverlink: In the autumn of 2007, Shere Fasticket machines were installed at stations on the [[Gospel Oak to Barking Line|Barking &amp; Gospel Oak line]]. These offer a typical [[National Rail]] ticket selection, with no hint that [[Oyster]] PAYG will be valid on the line from 11 November 2007 when TfL take it over. At the time of writing (October 2007) the home screen suggests that prepaid (i.e. TOD) tickets can be printed on these machines, though the on screen buttons to do so aren't presented. The machines are able to take cash, but are (at the time of writing) payment card only, pending cash collection (i.e. emptying) arrangements being put in place. [[Oystercard]] validators have been installed at B&amp;GO (including on platforms) ready for 11 November, and the ticket machines have a circular blanking plate, perhaps for an Oyster reader/writer.

==Features==
[[File:Shere FASTticket (Hassocks).jpg|thumb|right|The machine on the Up platform at [[Hassocks railway station|Hassocks]], installed by Southern on 16 June 2005.  Machine number is 4421.]]

*Some machines, chiefly on the former "Intercity" networks (Virgin Trains, First Great Western, East Coast, East Midlands Trains and Gatwick Express), offer "Ticket On Departure" (TOD) pick-up facilities for tickets purchased online or by phone.  If this option is chosen at the time of booking, an eight-character code is supplied to the person booking the ticket, who can then use a TOD-enabled machine to obtain the tickets at any time.  The process is:
**The payment card used to make the booking is inserted in the machine's card slot (it is not charged at this point, as this will already have happened)
**An alphanumeric keypad appears on the touch-screen
**The code is keyed in. (At least on some machines, such as those at [[Barking station]], if only one ticket order is in hand, the ticket is printed immediately after the payment card is inserted without the need for the code to be entered.)
*Many machines offer Seven Day Season Tickets.  Southern originally planned for monthly Season Tickets to be renewed (although not bought for the first time) through their machines, and the information panels mounted on each machine mention this; however, this function is not yet available, and on most machines the wording "monthly seasons" has been blanked out.
*Some TOCs machines, notably those on the Southern network, allow tickets to be bought for the next day.  This option is only available after 4.00pm, at which point two buttons appear on the main menu screen: one for "travel today", the other for "travel tomorrow".
*Southern uses the name '''QUICKticket''' for its machines, both in publicity material and on the machines themselves, as shown on the Hassocks example above.

[[File:ShereFASTticket-Test.png|thumb|right|One of the pair of test tickets produced by a machine at [[Huddersfield railway station|Huddersfield]]]]
*Until early 2007, a notable feature of these machines was their frequent printer self-test routine, which resulted in the production of two test tickets (one from the main ticket printer, one from the receipt and card sales voucher printer) showing all of the printable characters.  These were also produced when the machine's underlying [[Microsoft Windows]] software is reset.  The test tickets would drop into the collection tray at the bottom of the machine.

'''SmarterChild''' was a [[chatbot]] available on [[AOL Instant Messenger]] and [[Windows Live Messenger]] (previously [[MSN Messenger]]) networks.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

==History==
SmarterChild was an intelligent agent or bot developed by [[ActiveBuddy]], Inc., with offices in New York and Sunnyvale.{{where?|date=May 2018}}{{cn|date=September 2013}} It was widely distributed across global instant messaging and [[SMS]] networks.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

Founded in 2000, ActiveBuddy was the brainchild of [[Robert Hoffer]], Timothy Kay and Peter Levitan. The idea for instant messaging bots came from the team's vision to add natural language comprehension functionality to the increasingly popular instant messaging and SMS platforms.{{cn|date=September 2013}} The original implementation took shape as a word-based adventure game but quickly grew to include a wide range of database applications including instant access to news, weather, stock information, movie times, yellow pages listings, and detailed sports data, as well as a variety of tools (personal assistant, calculators, translator, etc.).{{cn|date=September 2013}} The company had not launched a public bot until the arrival of the eventual new-CEO, Stephen Klein.  Shortly after he arrived at the company in May 2001, he insisted that all of the knowledge domains (sports, weather, movies, etc.) plus the chat functionality be bundled together and launched under the screen name "SmarterChild" which was one of the many test bots that were being run internally (the screen name "SmarterChild" was one of Timothy Kay's personal test bots). The bundled domains were launched publicly as SmarterChild (on [[AOL Instant Messenger]] initially) in June 2001.{{cn|date=September 2013}} SmarterChild acted as a showcase for the quick data access and possibilities for fun personalized conversation that the company planned to turn into customized, niche specific products.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

The rapid success of SmarterChild led to targeted marketing-oriented bots for [[Radiohead]], [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]], [[Intel]], [[Keebler]], ''[[The Sporting News]]'' and others.{{cn|date=September 2013}} ActiveBuddy strengthened its hold on the intelligent agent market by receiving a U.S. patent in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP1767015A1?cl=da&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=September 2013}}

ActiveBuddy changed its name to Colloquis and prospered selling a superior automated customer service SAS offering to large companies (including [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner]], [[Cingular]] and [[Vonage]] among others). [[Microsoft]] acquired Colloquis in 2007 and proceeded to decommission SmarterChild and discontinue the Automated Service Agent business as well.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The '''Snowy Mountains scheme''' or '''Snowy scheme''' is a [[hydroelectricity]] and [[irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] complex in south-east [[Australia]]. The Scheme consists of sixteen major dams; seven power stations; one pumping station; and {{convert|225|km}} of tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts that were constructed between 1949 and 1974. The Scheme was completed under the supervision of Chief Engineer, [[William Hudson (engineer)|Sir William Hudson]] and is the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia.&lt;ref name="The Snowy Mountains Scheme" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis, Wendy|authorlink=Wendy Lewis|author2=Balderstone, Simon|author3=Bowan, John|title=Events That Shaped Australia|pages=189–194|publisher=New Holland|year=2006|isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water of the [[Snowy River]] and some of its [[tributary|tributaries]], much of which formerly flowed southeast onto the river flats of [[East Gippsland]], and into [[Bass Strait]] of the [[Tasman sea]], is captured at high elevations and diverted inland to the [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River]]s irrigation areas, through two major tunnel systems driven through the Continental Divide of the [[Snowy Mountains]], known in Australia as the [[Great Dividing Range]]. The water falls {{convert|800|m}} and travels through large hydro-electric power stations which generate peak-load power for the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/FDE81AE268C76207CA2569DE00274C14?Open#|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|title=The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme|date=1 January 1986|accessdate=20 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009155114/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/FDE81AE268C76207CA2569DE00274C14?Open|archivedate=9 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/422.html|title=The Snowy Mountains Scheme|work=Technology in Australia 1788-1988|publisher=Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre|year=2000|accessdate=20 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916085904/http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/422.html|archivedate=16 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
Since the 1830s, both the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers have been subject to development and control to meet [[water supply]] and irrigation needs. By contrast, the Snowy River, that rises in the [[Australian Alps]] and flows through mountainous and practically uninhabited country until [[debouching]] onto the river flats of East Gippsland, had never been controlled in any way, either for the production of power or for irrigation, and a great proportion of its waters flowed into the sea. The Snowy River has the highest source of any in Australia and draws away a large proportion of the waters from the south-eastern New South Wales snowfields, and was considered a means of supplementing the flow of the great inland rivers, a means for developing hydro-electric power, also a source of increasing agricultural production in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys.&lt;ref name=ABS /&gt;

Following [[World War II]], the [[Government of New South Wales]] proposed that the flow of the Snowy River be diverted into the Murrumbidgee River for irrigation and agricultural purposes; however there was little emphasis placed on the generation of power. A counter proposal by the [[Government of Victoria]] involved a greater generation of power, and involved diversion of the Snowy River to the Murray River.&lt;ref name=ABS /&gt; Additionally, the [[Government of South Australia]] was concerned that downstream flows on the Murray River would be severely jeopardised.&lt;ref name=Bergmann&gt;{{cite web|title=The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme: How did it Manage Without an EIA?|first=Michael|last=Bergmann|date=February 1999|isbn=0-7315-3403-4|publisher=[[Australian National University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], looking at the national implications of the two proposals, initiated a meeting to discuss the use of the waters of the Snowy River, and a Committee was set up in 1946 to examine the question on the broadest possible basis. This Committee, in a report submitted in November 1948, suggested consideration of a far greater scheme than any previously put forward. It involved not only the simple question of use of the waters of the Snowy River, but consideration of the possible diversion of a number of rivers in the area, tributaries, not only of the Snowy, but of the Murray and Murrumbidgee. The recommendations of the Committee were generally agreed to by a conference of Ministers representing the Commonwealth, New South Wales, and Victoria, and it was also agreed that the Committee should continue its investigations.&lt;ref name=ABS /&gt;

However, limitations in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] meant that the Commonwealth Government was limited in the powers it could exercise, without the agreement of the [[States and territories of Australia|States]].&lt;ref name=Bergmann /&gt; Subsequently, the Commonwealth Government introduced legislation into the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] under its defence power;&lt;ref name=Bergmann /&gt; and enacted the {{Cite Legislation AU |Cth|act|smhpa1949251949460|Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949}} that enabled the formation of the [[Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority]].&lt;ref name=ABS /&gt; Ten years later, the relevant States and Territories introduced their own corresponding legislation and in January 1959 the Snowy Mountains Agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States.&lt;ref name=Bergmann /&gt;

The legislation created the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority that was given responsibility for the final evaluation, design and construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.  The final agreed plan was to divert the waters of the Snowy Mountains region to provide increased electricity generating capacity and to provide irrigation water for the dry west. It was "greeted with enthusiasm by the people of Australia" and was seen to be "a milestone towards full national development".{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The chief engineer, [[New Zealand]]-born [[William Hudson (engineer)|William Hudson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/hudson.html|work=The New Zealand Edge: Heroes: Builders|title=William Hudson|publisher=IP Holdings Limited|editor=Sweeney, Brian|year=2011|accessdate=5 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016102259/http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/hudson.html|archivedate=16 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (knighted 1955), was chosen to head the scheme as Chairman of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority, and was instructed to seek workers from overseas.

An agreement between the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] and Snowy Mountains Hydro to provide technical assistance and training of engineers was agreed between the [[United States of America|USA]] and Australia in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 16 November 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loan Agreement (Snowy Mountains Project) between the Commonwealth of Australia and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [1962] ATS 22|url=http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1951/24.html|website=Australian Treaties Library|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A loan for $100 Million was obtained from the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loan Agreement (Snowy Mountains Project) between the Commonwealth of Australia and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [1962] ATS 22|url=http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1962/22.html|website=Australian Treaties Library|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunneling records were set in the construction of the Scheme and it was completed on time and on budget in 1974, at a cost of {{AUD}}820 million; a dollar value equivalent in 1999 and 2004 to A$6&amp;nbsp;[[1,000,000,000|billion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|last=Besley|first=M.

The Scheme is in an area of {{convert|5124|km2}}, almost entirely within the [[Kosciuszko National Park]]. The design of the scheme was modelled on the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]].&lt;ref name="ASCE" /&gt; Over 100,000 people from over 30 countries were employed during its construction, providing employment for many [[Post war migrant arrivals, Australia|recently arrived immigrants]], and was important in Australia's post-[[World War II|war]] economic and social development.

At the completion of the project, the Australian Government maintained much of the diverse workforce and established the [[Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation]] (SMEC), which is now an international engineering consultancy company. The Scheme is the largest [[renewable energy]] [[Electricity generation|generator]] in mainland Australia and plays an important role in the operation of the [[National Electricity Market]], generating approximately 67% of all renewable energy in the mainland National Electricity Market. The Snowy Scheme's primary function is as a water manager, however under the corporatised model must deliver dollar dividends to the three shareholder governments - the NSW, Commonwealth and Victorian Governments.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The Scheme also has a significant role in providing security of water flows to the [[Murray-Darling Basin]]. The Scheme provides approximately {{convert|2100|GL}} of water a year to the Basin, providing additional water for an irrigated agriculture industry worth about A$3&amp;nbsp;bn per annum,&lt;ref name="The Snowy Mountains Scheme"/&gt; representing more than 40% of the gross value of the nation's agricultural production.

The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme, is one of the most complex integrated water and hydro-electric power schemes in the world and is listed as a "world-class civil engineering project" by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref name="ASCE"&gt;{{cite web|year=1997|url=http://www.asce.org/history/landmark/projects.cfm|title=Designated Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks|work=Heritage Knowledgebase Database|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=9 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321063753/http://www.asce.org/history/landmark/projects.cfm|archivedate=21 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme interlocks seven power stations and 16 major dams through {{convert|145|km}} of trans-mountain tunnels and {{convert|80|km}} of aqueducts. The history of the Snowy Scheme reveals its important role in building post World War II Australia.

Sir [[William Hudson (engineer)|William Hudson]] was appointed the first commissioner of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority, serving between 1949 and 1967. The Commissioner's role was the overall management of the Scheme. He represented the Scheme at the highest levels of government, welcomed international scientists and engineers, encouraged scientific and engineering research, as well as attending many social and civic activities. Sir William's management style 'stressed cooperation between management and labour and scientific knowledge (facts) over opinion'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Snowy!

=== Personal stories and memoirs of work on the Snowy Scheme ===
Various stories and memoirs have been written about work on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Most recently, [[Snowy Hydro]], Woden Community Service, Gen S Stories and PhotoAccess partnered for a Digital Storytelling project to present a diverse collection of stories told from the point of view of seven ex-workers, two lifelong employees and a child of a Snowy worker. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcs.org.au/whats-on-at-wcs/latest-news/327-premiere-of-snowy-stories-from-former-workers-and-families-of-the-snowy-mountains-scheme|title=Premiere of Snowy Stories from former workers and families of the Snowy Mountains Scheme|last=|first=|date=29 May 2018|website=Woden Community Service|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the project, participants created a short film about their experience on the Snowy Scheme, each story offering a unique perspective into what life was like building the Scheme between 1949 and 1974. The project's artistic director Jenni Savigny assisted participants to make the short films; enabling them to put together the scripts, record voice overs and edit the short films. In an interview with Andrew Brown ([[The Canberra Times]]), Savigny said it was important to create a history of the Snowy Hydro using the participant's own words,"You just get a personal sense of what it was like to be there, and what it meant to people's lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/canberra-news/personal-stories-of-snowy-hydro-workers-to-be-told-in-new-film-project-20180413-p4z9fh.html|title=Personal stories of Snowy Hydro workers to be told in new film project|last=Brown|first=Andrew|date=15 April 2018|website=The Canberra Times|access-date=11 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711061621/https://www.canberratimes.com.au/canberra-news/personal-stories-of-snowy-hydro-workers-to-be-told-in-new-film-project-20180413-p4z9fh.html|archive-date=11 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current operations ===
The Scheme is operated by [[Snowy Hydro|Snowy Hydro Limited]], an [[unlisted public company]] incorporated pursuant to the {{Cite Legislation AU |Cth|act|ca2001|Corporations Act, 2001}}, owned by the Governments of New South Wales (58%), Victoria (29%) and Australia (13%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/Water-management/Law-and-policy/Managing-the-Snowy/managing-the-snowy/default.aspx|title=Managing the Snowy|work=[[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Primary Industries]]: Office of Water|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411042009/http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/Water-management/Law-and-policy/Managing-the-Snowy/managing-the-snowy/default.aspx|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==

The original plan was for 99% of the water of the [[Snowy River]]'s natural flow to be diverted by the Scheme below [[Lake Jindabyne]]. Releases from the Scheme were based on the needs of only [[wiktionary:riparian|riparian]] users and took no account of ecosystem needs; it soon became known that the lower reaches of the river were in environmental crisis. An extensive public campaign led to the Snowy Water Inquiry being established in January 1998. The Inquiry reported to the [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n Governments in October of that year, recommending an increase to 15% of natural flows. The two Governments were equivocal about this target; aside from economic considerations there was a view that the health of the Murray is more important than that of the Snowy and any extra environmental flows are better used there instead.

In the [[Victorian state election, 1999|1999 Victorian state election]], the seat of [[Electoral district of Gippsland East|Gippsland East]] was won by [[Craig Ingram]], an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and member of the Snowy River Alliance, based in large part on his campaign to improve Snowy flows.&lt;ref name=AG&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Connellan|date=November 2010|title=Fighting for the Snowy River|work=[[Australian Geographic]]|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/fighting-for-the-snowy-river.htm|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521200408/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/fighting-for-the-snowy-river.htm|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Victoria and NSW agreed to a long-term target of 28%, requiring A$375 million of investment to offset losses to inland irrigators.&lt;ref name=AG /&gt; In August 2002 flows were increased to 6%, with a target of 21% within 10 years. However, by October 2008 it was evident that the return of environmental flows to the Snowy River in 2009 would be no more than 4% of natural flow with governments arguing the Snowy River needs to "pay back" the "Mowamba Borrowings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2009/07/03/90705_opinion-news.html|title=Snowy River up the creek|first=Louise|last=Crisp|work=Weekly Times|date=3 July 2009|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421175658/http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2009/07/03/90705_opinion-news.html|archivedate=21 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Victorian state election, 2010|2010 state election]], Ingram lost the seat of Gippsland East to the [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/state-election-2010/nationals-end-a-lone-wolfs-11year-run-20101127-18bjc.html|title=Nationals end a lone wolf's 11-year run|last=Mangan|first=John|work=[[The Age]]|location=Melbourne|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430014302/http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/state-election-2010/nationals-end-a-lone-wolfs-11year-run-20101127-18bjc.html|archivedate=30 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, it was announced that the 21% target would be reached for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/national/snowy-river-deal-delivers-on-its-target-18-years-on/news-story/14cd66c654cbaf1e7a211a6498814a62 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419165147/http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/national/snowy-river-deal-delivers-on-its-target-18-years-on/news-story/14cd66c654cbaf1e7a211a6498814a62 |archivedate=19 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some concerned water managers, conservationists, politicians and farmers continue to advocate for the return of environmental flows to the Snowy River. The Dalgety District and Community Association commemorates Snowy River Day annually, towards the end of August, to mark the 2002 anniversary of when the governments of Victoria, NSW and the Commonwealth first released water into the Snowy River over the Mowamba Weir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.summitsun.com.au/story/223490/dalgety-celebrates-snowy-river-day/|title=Dalgety celebrates Snowy River Day|date=16 August 2012|work=Summit Sun|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325065830/http://www.summitsun.com.au/story/223490/dalgety-celebrates-snowy-river-day/|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Snowy Water Licence, Snowy Hydro Limited has 're-commissioned' the Mowamba Aqueduct. Seasonal variable flows are essential to river ecology including flushing flows to support vital ecosystems for the Australian platypus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/1park_display.cfm?park=186 Snowy River National Park] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523125734/http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/1park_display.cfm?park=186 |date=23 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and native [[Australian Bass]], the species over which Ingram initially fought for flows into the Snowy River.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} A major spillway upgrade now facilitates these flows.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Pumping Stations ===
The Snowy Mountains Scheme has two pumping stations. The Jindabyne Pumping Station pumps water from [[Lake jindabyne|Lake Jindabyne]] through to the Snowy-Geehi Tunnel at Island Bend.

The pump storage facility at [[Tumut Hydroelectric Power Station|Tumut 3]] Power Station returns water to [[Talbingo Reservoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/energy/hydro/pumping-stations/|title=Pumping Stations • Snowy Hydro|language=en-US|access-date=4 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004064053/http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/energy/hydro/pumping-stations/|archivedate=4 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion plans ====
In March 2017, the Australian government suggested a $2 billion project expanding the 4.1 GW Snowy Mountains Scheme by 2 GW of pump storage for a week, building new tunnels and power stations, but no new dams. The 80% efficiency of such storage can be sufficient in leveling differences between supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/snowy-hydro-20-malcolm-turnbull-announces-plans-for-2-billion-expansion-20170315-guyozj.html|title='Snowy Hydro 2.0': Malcolm Turnbull announces plans for $2 billion expansion|date=15 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|via=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317193301/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/snowy-hydro-20-malcolm-turnbull-announces-plans-for-2-billion-expansion-20170315-guyozj.html|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/turnbull-drives-stake-through-heart-of-fossil-fuel-industry-48916/|title=Turnbull drives stake through heart of fossil fuel industry|date=15 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|quote=minus 20 per cent losses|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317202901/http://reneweconomy.com.au/turnbull-drives-stake-through-heart-of-fossil-fuel-industry-48916/|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
The Snowy Scheme is a major tourist destination. Sightseeing driving tours to the key locations of the Scheme are popular out of regional centres like [[Cooma]], [[Adaminaby]] and  [[Jindabyne]] along roads built for the Scheme like the [[Snowy Mountains Highway]] and [[Alpine Way]] and towards sights like Cabramurra, as Australia's highest town, spectacular dam walls, and scenic lakes. Trout fishing is popular in the lakes of the Scheme, notably Lake Jindabyne and Lake Eucumbene.

The [[Snowy Scheme Museum]] opened at Adaminaby in 2011 to profile the history of the Scheme.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-17/snowy-scheme-museum-opens/3574192|title=Governor-General opens Snowy museum|work=ABC News|location=Australia|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017010950/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-17/snowy-scheme-museum-opens/3574192|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[skiing in Australia]] began in the northern Snowy Mountains in the 1860s, it was the construction of the vast Snowy Scheme from 1949, with its improvements to infrastructure and influx of experienced European skiers among the workers on the Scheme, that really opened up the mountains for the large scale development of a ski industry, and led to the establishment of [[Thredbo]] and [[Perisher Ski Resort|Perisher]] as leading Australian resorts.&lt;ref name="thredbo.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thredbo.com.au/village-life/about-thredbo/|title=History|work=About Thredbo|publisher=Kosciuszko Thredbo Pty Ltd|year=2013|accessdate=20 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501120115/http://www.thredbo.com.au/village-life/about-thredbo/|archivedate=1 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perisherblue.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perisher.com.au/resort-information/history.html|title=The History of Perisher|publisher=Perisher Blue Pty Limited|year=2013|accessdate=20 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006165957/http://www.perisher.com.au/resort-information/history.html|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of [[Guthega Dam]] brought skiers to the isolated [[Guthega]] district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianacapital.com/Text/1201316577093-6700/|title=Guthega Ski Resort|publisher=Christiana Capital Group|work=Project management|year=2012|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Anton, a snowy worker identified the potential of the Thredbo Valley.

The term '''structural system''' or '''structural frame''' in [[structural engineering]] refers to the [[structural load|load]]-resisting [[sub-system]] of a building or object. The structural system transfers loads through interconnected [[structural element|elements]] or members.

Commonly used structures can be classified into five major categories, depending on the type of primary stress that may arise in the members of the structures under major design loads. However any two or more of the basic structural types described in the following may be combined in a single structure, such as a building or a bridge in order to meet the structure's functional requirements.&lt;ref name="Kassimali"&gt;Kassimali, A. (1999). Structural analysis. 2nd edition. Pacific Grove, C.A.: PWS Pub&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tensile structure]]s: Members of tensile structures are subject to pure tension under the action of external loads. Because the [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile stress]] is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of members, the material of such a structure is utilized in the most efficient manner.
*[[Compressive strength|Compressive structures]]: Compression structures develop mainly compressive stresses under the action of axial loads. Because compressive structures are susceptible to buckling or instability, the possibility of these failures should be considered in their design. If necessary, adequate bracing must be provided to avoid such failures.
*[[Truss]]es: Trusses are composed of straight members connected at their ends by hinged connections to form a stable configuration. Because of their light weight and high strength, they are among the most commonly used types of structure.
*[[Shear strength|Shear structures]]: These are structures such as reinforced concrete or wooden [[shear wall]]s, which are used in multistory buildings to reduce lateral movements due to wind loads and earthquake excitations. Shear structures develop mainly in-plane shear with relatively small bending stresses under the action of external loads.
*[[Bending]] structures: Bending structures develop mainly bending stresses under the action of external loads. The shear stresses associated with the changes in bending moments may also be significant, and should be considered in their design.

==High-rise buildings==
The structural system of a [[high-rise]] building is designed to cope with vertical gravity loads as well as [[lateral load]]s caused by wind or seismic activity. The structural system consists only of the members designed to carry the loads, all other members are referred to as non-structural.

A classification for the structural system of a high-rise was introduced in 1969 by [[Fazlur Khan]] and was extended to incorporate interior and exterior structures. The primary lateral load-resisting system defines if a structural system is an interior or exterior one.&lt;ref name=AliStruct&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Structural Developments in Tall Buildings: Current Trends and Future Prospects|first1=Mir M.|last1=Ali|first2=Kyoung Sun|last2=Moon|journal=Architectural Science Review|volume=50|issue=3|year=2007|pages=205–223|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/asre/2007/00000050/00000003/art00002|accessdate=2011-04-14|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.3763/asre.2007.5027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following interior structures are possible:
*[[Hinged frame]]
*[[Rigid frame]]
*[[Braced frame]] and [[Shear wall|Shear-walled frame]]
*[[Outrigger]] structures (supporting [[overhang (architecture)|overhangs]])

The following exterior structures are possible:
*[[Buttress]]es
*[[Diagrid]]
*[[Exoskeleton]]
*[[Space truss]]
*[[Superframe (structure)|Superframe]]
*[[Tube (structure)]]

A '''TeachMeet''' is an organised but informal meeting (in the style of an [[unconference]]) for teachers to share good practice, practical innovations and personal insights in teaching. These events are often organised to coincide with other educational events like the [[Scottish Learning Festival]] and the British Educational Technology and Training Show [[BETT]].

Participants volunteer (via the TeachMeet website) to demonstrate good practice they've delivered over the past year, or discuss a product that enhances classroom practice.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Learning Festival and TeachMeet [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/scotlandlearning/2009/09/scottish-learning-festival-and.shtml] - www.bbc.co.uk/blogs, 22 September 2009, Claire McCallum |&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Learning Festival - Mini presentations make micro waves for ideas [http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6023418] - Times Educational Supplement - Published in TESS on 18 September 2009, Douglas Blan&lt;/ref&gt;

TeachMeet events are open to all and do not charge an entry fee.

==History==
Originally conceived in the summer of 2006 in Edinburgh, Scotland, under the name "ScotEduBlogs Meetup". The new name, TeachMeet, was created by Ewan McIntosh and agreed upon by the attendees of the first event. The 2nd Edition was held in Glasgow on 20 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2006/06/teachmeet06_is_.html TeachMeet06 is open for business]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th TeachMeet was the first to be held at the [[BETT]] Show in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/11/teachmeet08---m.html TeachMeet08 - Mark it in your diaries now!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 TeachMeet 'Takeover' was introduced at BETT, where teachers took over vendors stands in the main conference to bring the TeachMeet discussion out of the Apex Room and onto the exhibition floor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/resource/two-minutes Teachers use 'speed dating' technique to swap ideas at Bett 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

TeachMeets are now regular occurrences in Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, Australia, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Malaysia, Sweden, the USA, New Zealand.
In New Zealand the TeachMeet is virtual and is run totally via Google+ Hangout.

==Common features==
The following features are often part of a Teachmeet, but the format changes according to the size of the meeting and the preferences of the organisers:
* Micro-presentations - lasting 7 minutes
* Nano-presentations - lasting 2 minutes nano presentation (3-5 one after the other)
* Round-table break-outs - lasting 15 minutes or so, allowing focussed discussion around a theme, with a volunteer facilitator
* Random selection of speakers - from a pool of willing participants
* [[Backchannel]] - to let non-participants participate

'''VLF cable testing''' is a technique for testing of medium and high voltage (MV and HV) cables. VLF systems are advantageous in that they can be manufactured to be small and lightweight; making them useful – especially for field testing where transport and space can be issues. Traditionally and more commonly, DC Hi-Pot testing has been used for field testing of cables.&lt;ref&gt;https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/what-is-hipot-testing-dielectric-strength-test&lt;/ref&gt; 

VLF testing of cables is supported in IEC 60502 (up to 35kV) and in IEEE 400.2 (up to 69 kV). As higher voltage VLF equipment is developed, standards may be adapted to increase the voltage level for application.

The VLF test can be used in a number of ways:

* Apply VLF to power cables in a simple withstand approach to detect potential failures ([[Fault (power engineering)|faults]]) in the cable [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation]] during a planned outage. The tested cable must withstand an [[AC voltage]] for a specified testing time without [[Electric arc|flashover]]. This method yields a "Go/No Go" statement. VLF cable testing uses different wave shapes, typically sine and square and care must be taken when describing the voltage to be used. RMS and peak voltages have different relationships to each other depending on the wave shape and IEEE 400.2 uses the peak voltage level to equate the wave shapes. Frequency ranges used are within the range of 0.01&amp;nbsp;Hz to 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz, where frequency selection depends on the load presented by the cable. Test voltage levels are either calculated using a multiple of the cable's nominal phase-phase voltage or via tables in IEEE 400.2; typically they are in the range of 1.5 U0 to 3 U0. The VLF cable testing time varies from 15 to 60 minutes. IEEE Guide 400.2 establishes some suggested test voltages and times. Subsequent work by the CDFI has shown there to be no change in efficacy of a VLF test conducted over the frequency range 0.1 to 0.01&amp;nbsp;Hz when the IEEE 400.2 voltages and times are used.
* Apply VLF to XLPE cables in a monitored withstand approach where a diagnostic measurement is made before and during the course of the withstand test. Monitoring a diagnostic enables some additional decision making before the final test voltage is reached. Some cables are not good candidates for withstand testing and a diagnostic indication obtained at a lower voltage can negate the need to perform withstand testing. During the test measurement of a diagnostic parameter can be used to optimise test times. Test times can be shortened for cables with good diagnostic indications or lengthened for cables that show deteriorating diagnostic measurements during the test.
* Apply VLF to measure [[Tan delta test|insulation losses]] (i.e. the insulation dissipation factor or Tan-delta) at different VLF frequencies that are typically in the range of 0.01 to 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz. In this case, the [[IEEE]] Guide. 400.2 establishes the criteria for assessment. The test is typically performed over a range of test voltages from 0.5 Uo to 2 Uo depending on the standard/guide that is being followed.
* Apply VLF in order to detect and measure [[Partial Discharge]] at different VLF frequencies that are typically in the range of 0.01 to 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz. In this case, the [[IEEE]] Guide. 400.3 outlines a procedure for assessment and IEC 60270 provides the background for Partial Discharge testing of High Voltage Apparatus.

== VLF withstand testing ==

[[High voltage]] withstand tests are used in conjunction with partial discharge measurements on solid dielectric cable and accessories within manufacturing plants to ensure the quality of completed cable system components from MV to EHV. Thus, it is quite natural for [[utilities]] to also use withstand and partial discharge tests as commissioning and maintenance tests for cable systems in the field. The goal of these tests is the same as in the factory test, namely to detect any defective components of the cable system before failure.  Withstand tests can be conducted using a variety of voltage sources from DC to 300&amp;nbsp;Hz and are simple to operate and the equipment may be inexpensive. Some observations for the VLF withstand test are (Based on CDFI results):
* VLF tests are simple for a utility to perform and do not require specialized services
* The on-test failure rates on a cable system are in the range of 0.2 to 4% for 30 min tests performed at the IEEE Guide 400.2 voltage levels.
* IEEE Std. 400.2 provides suggested time and voltage test levels but exact parameters are not possible since defect growth rates are not known and can vary widely.
* VLF tests at IEEE Guide 400.2 test levels do not damage cable systems' 'good' insulation but are used to degrade existing insulation defects to failure during the test rather than in-service. The reasoning is that the low-energy failure of the cable under test results in less collateral damage and a reduced likelihood of unplanned outages due to in-service failure.
* Data has been collected using both of the commonly used VLF waveforms, there is little evidence of a significant difference in failure rate outcomes that can be ascribed to the voltage waveform when the recommend voltages are used.

== VLF tan delta testing ==

Medium voltage [[Electric power distribution|distribution cables]] and their accessories form a critical part of [[Electric power transmission|power delivery systems]]. The systems employ insulation materials that have a low permittivity and loss. The permittivity and the loss are [[dielectric]] properties of the insulation material. As the systems age, these dielectric properties can change. The dielectric loss can be assessed since it can increase several orders of magnitude during the service life of the systems. This approach correlates well some lossy growths in aged polymeric insulation such as water trees.

Tan delta measurement constitutes a cable diagnostic technique that assesses the general condition of the cable system insulation, which can be represented in a simplified equivalent circuit that consists of two elements; a resistor and a capacitor. When voltage is applied to the system, the total current is the result of the contributions from the capacitor current and the resistor current. The tan delta is defined as the ratio between the resistive current and the capacitive current. The measurements are carried out offline.

In practice, it is convenient to measure the dielectric properties at a VLF of 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eager|first=G.S.|author2=Katz, C. |author3=Fryszczyn, B. |author4=Densley, J. |author5= Bernstein, B.S. |title=High voltage VLF testing of power cables|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|date=Apr 1997|volume=12|issue=2|pages=565–570|doi=10.1109/61.584323|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=584323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This both reduces the size and power requirements of the energizing source and increases the resolution of the resistive component (near DC component) of dielectric loss (not the capacitive component).

Using the IEEE 400.2 guide, three different criteria are applied for diagnosing a cable insulation system using the Tan δ value. One criterion uses the magnitude of the Tan δ value as a tool for diagnostics while the other uses the difference in Tan δ values for particular electrical stresses or voltage levels. The latter is commonly known as the “Tip-Up” of the Tan δ value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE Guide 400-2, Guide for Field Testing of Shielded Power Cable Systems Using Very Low Frequency (VLF)|url=http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/400.2-2004.html|publisher=IEEE-SA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results for both criteria are often interpreted using recommendations given in the guide. The guide provides a hierarchical level that evaluates the cable insulation system. The major caveats with this approach are:

* The source of the losses cannot be located by the test and may need further testing in order to be identified.
* For longer cables the loss contributions and from damaged portions (both insulation and shield damage) may be diluted in the measurement. 
* Some paper insulation defects are not associated with losses and most solid dielectric (plastic and rubber) material defects not associated with losses and cannot be detected by tangent delta.

== VLF Partial Discharge testing ==
A VLF source can be used to energise insulation and initiate partial discharges from defects within the insulation. As the test is offline, the test voltage can be varied in order to measure the inception and extinction voltages of the partial discharge. TDR techniques can be used to localise the source of the discharge and a reference measurement can be made with a calibrator in order to present the measured pd in pC.

VLF PD measurements have the same benefits and limitations as other PD measurements and the data that is obtained using different voltage sources has the same uncertainties.

It must be noted that different defects may exhibit different characteristics dependent upon the environment and the excitation source. The impact of this on the final decision is likely insignificant. Even at higher voltages the criteria for detection (e.g. in Cigre WG B1.28) and severity calculation are not defined and not dependent on the measured properties of the PD. Therefore, the detection of PD sources is currently more important than the characterisation of the defects.

Detection of defects is especially useful for new cables where the severity analysis is perhaps less important to the decision that is made. ANy defects in new installations should be corrected. For aged systems the PD severity can be assessed by consideration of the various PD characteristics. Unfortunately there is no independent guide that can be used to classify the severity after a single measurement. A trend can be established from repeat measurements and it is therefore important that measurement conditions are carefully controlled and repeated so that the comparison of repeated measurements is valid.

Typical characteristics of PD that can contribute to severity analysis include:
* Inception and extinction voltages
* PD type classification (Internal, surface, corona)
* PD Magnitude (in mV/pC)
* PD repetition rate
* Location of defect

== Comparison with other voltage sources ==
There is some industry debate (much of it commercially driven) over the use of different voltage sources to energise cables and on the benefits of the different diagnostic techniques when used in conjunction with the different sources.

Theoretical Approach

The cable is subject to operational stresses at the system voltage and frequency and voltage sources that are different (in magnitude, waveshape or frequency) will provide different stresses to the cable than those experienced under operational conditions. Defects and damage may also respond differently and the diagnostic indications may be different depending upon the types of defects. Proponents of this approach will argue that these differences detract from the commercial benefits offered by the competing voltage sources.

Practical Approach

Electrical equipment has a failure rate which is the inverse of its reliability. Test techniques have the intention of improving the reliability of the insulation system and an analysis of the impact of the testing on the reliability of the network under test is evidence of the efficacy of the test technique; irrespective of the differences from operational stresses.

Probability

Insulation failure is a stochastic process and it is erroneous to identify single events and attribute this to a particular source. Failure of an insulation system after a good diagnostic indication (or vice versa) is to be expected for any test using any voltage source. Better tests will be better predictors of condition but no tests should be considered infallible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2241">A '''voice browser''' is a software application that presents an interactive [[voice user interface]] to the user in a manner analogous to the functioning of a [[web browser]] interpreting [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML). Dialog documents interpreted by voice browser are often encoded in standards-based markup languages, such as [[VoiceXML|Voice Dialog Extensible Markup Language]] (VoiceXML), a standard by the  [[World Wide Web Consortium]].

A voice browser presents information aurally, using pre-recorded audio file playback or [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] synthesis software.  A voice browser obtains information using [[speech recognition]] and keypad entry, such as [[DTMF]] detection. 

As speech recognition and web technologies have matured, voice applications are deployed commercially in many industries and voice browsers are supplanting traditional proprietary [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) systems. Voice browser software is delivered in a variety of implementations models.

Systems that present a voice browser to a user, typically provide interfaces to the [[public switched telephone network]] or to a [[private branch exchange]].

[[File:Professionelle reinigung (W).svg|thumb|Laundry symbol for professional wet cleaning]]
'''Wet cleaning''' refers to methods of professional cleaning that, in contrast to traditional [[dry cleaning]], avoids the use of chemical solvents, the most common of which is [[tetrachloroethylene]] (commonly called perchloroethylene or "perc"). Environmental groups and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] have indicated that such alternative "wet cleaning" methods are better for the environment than perc, and proponents of wet cleaning state that these methods can be used without shrinking or otherwise damaging garments that typically require dry cleaning.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Renee Montagne]], [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4276177 "Some Dry Cleaners Turning to... Wet Cleaning"] and [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-112042956.html "Interview: Peter Sinsheimer on wet cleaning"], ''[[Morning Edition]]'', January 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eviana Hartman, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/07/AR2008080702759.html "The Messy Truth About Dry Cleaning"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jill Leovoy, [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-11/local/me-45632_1_wet-cleaning "A Greener Kind of Cleaner"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',
March 11, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not the use of water that makes wet cleaning a safest method for cleaning clothes. Computer-controlled wet cleaning machines, special dryers, safe detergents and non-toxic spot removers are what make wet cleaning an environmentally sound method. Wet cleaning machines have controls  that allow them to safely and efficiently clean a wide variety of garments in water. Detergents and spot removers are made of ingredients that are safer for workers and the environment, yet are as safe and effective at removing soils, stains and odors as dry cleaning solvents. Equipment, detergents and skill all contribute to successful wet cleaning. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/200019GN.txt?ZyActionW=Download&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1995+Thru+1999&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=FNAME=910146HA.TXT+or+(+Lead+or+Cleaning+or+Efficacy+or+Follow+or+Up+or+Study)&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;Search|title=EPA - Home Page for the Search site|website=nepis.epa.gov|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), wet cleaning is the most environmentally sensitive professional method of garment cleaning. It does not use hazardous chemicals,  it does not generate hazardous waste, nor does the process create air pollution and it reduces the potential for water and [[soil contamination]]. The specialized detergents and conditioner used in the wet clean process are milder than home laundry products. All of the products are disposed of down the drain and easily handled by the local waste water treatment facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/garment/wsgc/wetclean.htm|title=Safer Choice - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OCSPP,OPPT,EETD|website=US EPA|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For professional cleaners, wet-cleaning is argued to offer several advantages, such as lowered costs for start-up capital, supplies, equipment and hazardous waste disposal, as well as less reliance on skilled labor.&lt;ref&gt;(2007). ''EPA Fact Sheet - Wet Cleaning: An Alternative to Dry Cleaning that Is Safe For You, Your Clothes and Your Cleaner''. Available: http://www.deq.state.va.us/osba/factsheets/wetclean.html. Last accessed 2008 January 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  

From American Dry Cleaner, "74.7% of dry cleaners use wet cleaning when cleaning casual clothing and sportswear; specialty items, like draperies and gowns (42.3%); “business casual” or softly tailored clothing (38%); restoration work (25.4%); and tailored workwear (16.9%). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://americandrycleaner.com/articles/survey-majority-dry-cleaners-immersed-wet-cleaning-process|title=Survey: Majority of Dry Cleaners Immersed in Wet Cleaning Process|date=14 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some clothing manufacturers may mislabel their clothing "Dry Clean Only", even though there is no "reasonable basis"  for making the claim that the garment will be harmed if it is not dry cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;(2001). ''Don't Say 'Dry Clean Only' If It Can Be Washed''. Available: http://webharvest.gov/peth04/20041022004143/http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/textile/alerts/dryclean.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
