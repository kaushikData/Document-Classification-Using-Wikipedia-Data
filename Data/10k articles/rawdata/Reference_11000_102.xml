'''''22 Jump Street''''' is a 2014 American [[action film|action]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]], written by [[Jonah Hill]], [[Michael Bacall]], Oren Uziel and [[Rodney Rothman]] and produced by and starring Hill and [[Channing Tatum]]. [[Ice Cube]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Amber Stevens West]] and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2012 film ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', based on&lt;!--Please do not change. A film based on a TV series is never referred to as a "loose sequel" even if it takes place within the same continuity after the series has ended.--&gt; the [[21 Jump Street|television series of the same name]]. The plot follows police officers Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko as they go undercover at a college in order to find the supplier of a new drug.

Plans for a ''Jump Street'' sequel began the week of the first film's release. Hill and Tatum were quickly confirmed to be reprising their roles, while Miller and Lord announced they'd be returning to direct in July 2013. Filming took place from September to December 2013 in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, as well as [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].

''22 Jump Street'' was released on June 13, 2014, by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. The film received positive reviews, with some critics calling it one of the best comedy sequels of all time, and grossed $331 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Two years following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt ([[Jonah Hill]]) and Jenko ([[Channing Tatum]]) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost ([[Peter Stormare]]), Deputy Chief Hardy ([[Nick Offerman]]) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson ([[Ice Cube]]) – now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as "WHY-PHY" (Work Hard? Yes, Play Hard? Yes) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus from a dealer.

At college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook ([[Wyatt Russell]]) and Rooster ([[Jimmy Tatro]]), they later become the prime suspects of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya ([[Amber Stevens]]), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Maya's roommate Mercedes ([[Jillian Bell]]), and Schmidt later finds that Maya is the daughter of Captain Dickson, whom Schmidt bragged to about "getting laid", much to Dickson's fury. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.

When Schmidt and Jenko are unable to identify the dealer, they visit Mr. Walters ([[Rob Riggle]]) and Eric ([[Dave Franco]]) in jail for advice. After confessing the two are having regular intercourse, Walters points out a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook's arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks, but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two as Jenko passes their requirements. They later realize that Zook is not the dealer but rather another customer. Soon afterwards, they find Ghost and his men on campus, but Ghost again evades them. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he has been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is uncertain about his future as a police officer. Afterwards, Schmidt reveals his true identity and moves out of the dorm, angering Maya.

Spring break arrives, and Schmidt goes after Ghost. He is joined by Jenko, so the two can have one final mission together. The pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHY-PHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, who is Ghost's daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson and the rest of Jump Street, ambush the meeting. Ghost flees, while Mercedes is knocked out by Schmidt. While pursuing Ghost, Jenko is shot in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter; Schmidt and Jenko manage to jump across to it, but they fall into the sea due to Jenko's injured arm. However, Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter. Ghost celebrates his victory prematurely while the grenade explodes, sending the totalled remains into the sea. Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd. Dickson approaches them claiming to have a new mission undercover at a med school.

During the credits, Jenko and Schmidt go on to a variety of undercover missions to different schools, which are portrayed as fictional sequels, an animated series, and a toy line. One mission features [[Booker (TV series)|Detective Booker]] ([[Richard Grieco]]) while another sees the return of Ghost, who survived the helicopter explosion. In a post-credits scene, Walters reveals to Eric that he is [[menstrual cycle|late]], implying he is pregnant.

The site's critical consensus reads, "Boasting even more of the bromantic chemistry between its stars -- and even more of the goofy, good-natured humor that made its predecessor so much fun – ''22 Jump Street'' is the rare sequel that improves upon the original."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/22_jump_street/ |title=22 Jump Street |website=Rotten Tomatoes |date=June 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/22-jump-street |title=22 Jump Street Reviews |work=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inkoo Kang of ''[[The Wrap]]'' gave the film a positive review, saying "If ''22'' isn't as trim and tight as its predecessor, it's certainly smarter and more heartfelt. Whether this sequel is better than the original is up for debate, but the franchise has definitely grown up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/22-jump-street-review-channing-tatum-jonah-hill/ |title='22 Jump Street' Review: Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill Star in a Funnier, Smarter, Sexier Sequel |website=TheWrap |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B−, saying "Hill's neurotic-motormouth act and Tatum's lovable-lunkhead shtick still shoot giddy sparks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20824999,00.html |title=22 Jump Street Review &amp;#124; Movie Reviews and News |publisher=EW.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2014 |first=Chris |last=Nashawaty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "This is the ultimate meta movie.

Sean Fitz-Gerald of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "''Jump Street'' knows you know about the predictability and cheapness of sequels and rip-offs – and in this case, to avoid the downfalls of other summer comedy sagas, embracing that problem might have been the best move for this absurd, unique franchise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitz |first=Sean |url=http://www.denverpost.com/movies/ci_25944592/review-22-jump-street-jonah-hill-slings-self |title="22 Jump Street": Jonah Hill slings self-aware comedy |publisher=The Denver Post |date= June 13, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the film a positive review, saying "This sequel's spoof of its predecessor's riff on the original 1980s-era buddy-cop TV show coalesces into a raucous, raunchy, irreverent, imperfect riot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-22-jump-street-review-20140613-column.html |title='22 Jump Street' pokes its R-rated finger at everything — hilariously – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date= June 12, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying "Lord and Miller are on a roll, and there may be no better moviemakers at playing to our modern need for irony – at giving us the entertainment we crave while acknowledging our distrust of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/06/12/jump-street-deconstructs-that-useless-hollywood-artifact-blockbuster-sequel/UySIuZcYppYnonkOnKB3AO/story.html |title=‘22 Jump Street’ deconstructs that useless Hollywood artifact the blockbuster sequel – Movies |publisher=The Boston Globe |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rene Rodriguez of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "There's something going on at the edges of the frame in practically every scene of ''22 Jump Street'', a testament to the care and attention to detail directors Lord and Miller bring to this potentially silly material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Rene |url=http://www.miami.com/03922-jump-street039-r-article |title='22 Jump Street' (R) |publisher=miami.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "At what point is sarcasm just a cheap substitute for wit?

== Career in film, writing, and poetry ==
Child began making films in the 1970s, producing seven independent documentaries shot on 16mm.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt; From the middle of the 70s she turned to experimental montage and in the 80s her work explores gender and strategies for remaking narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmvideo.walkerart.org/detail.wac?id=2682&amp;title=Articles |title=Query: Abigail Child |accessdate=2008-10-20|work=[[Walker Art Center]] |date=February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    ''Is This What You Were Born For?'' is a major, seven-part experimental work from this period, completed over nine years, which included the cult classics ''Mayhem'' and ''Covert Action''.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Todd|last=Haynes|title=A Queer Kind of Film|url=http://afterimage.carpe-datum.com/afterimage/articles/detail/513537|work=Afterimage|date=Dec 1988}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;{{cite news |title=none|first=Jan |last=Stuart |work=Film Comment |volume=23 |issue=6|date=Nov–Dec 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite book |title=Women Film Directors |last=Foster |first=Gwendolyn Audrey |year=1995 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=0-313-28972-7 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kJHa7KqnQ4C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=Perils+%22Abigail+Child%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=cjNN_9cYYB&amp;sig=Le4wGaW5lHaW8lL44i4pud59oCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt;    (see Filmography). In the 90s Child poetically envisioned and interrogated public spaces in such films as ''B/side''(1996), about urban homelessness on the Lower East Side of New York city,  and ''Below the New: A Russian Chronicle'' (1999), filmed in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Skoller |title=Home sweet home.(Abigail Child's 1996 documentary film 'B/side') |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53436065.html |work=Afterimage |date=1998-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smfa.edu/Programs_Faculty/Faculty/C/Child_Abigail.asp |title=SMFA Boston - Abigail Child |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=[[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011043201/http://www.smfa.edu/Programs_Faculty/Faculty/C/Child_Abigail.asp |archivedate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etc"&gt;These artworks can be found in {{cite web|title=The repository of the Experimental Television Center|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/8946249a|website=[[Experimental Television Center]]- [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]]|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Child’s film and video has explored history, memory, and cultural experiences—the politics of place and identity.  Digital works like ''Cake + Steak'' (2004) and ''The Future Is Behind You'' (2005)&lt;ref name="etc"&gt;These artworks can be found in {{cite web|title=The repository of the Experimental Television Center|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/8946249a|website=[[Experimental Television Center]]- [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]]|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigate the awkward drama of the everyday, often utilizing found material to examine the past. ''Mirror World'' (2006) is a multi-screen installation that incorporates parts of Child’s “foreign film” series to explore narrative excess.  Key works include ''Surface Noise'' (2000), ''Dark Dark'' (2001), ''Where The Girls Are'' (2002), ''Cake and Steak'' (2004), ''The Future Is Behind You'' (2004), ''To and No Fro'' (2005), and ''Mirror World'' (2006). Her feature video documentary ''On The Downlow'' (2007)), is an exploration of bisexuality and an intimate look at a little-viewed underground scene.

In 2012, Child completed a feature film, ''Shape of Error,'' an imaginary “home movie”  based on the diaries of Mary Shelley during her marriage with Percy Shelley.

Child is also the author of five books of poetry (published between 1983 and 2012) &lt;ref name="Petrolle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janine"/&gt; and a book of critical writings: ''This Is Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film'' (2005).

A collection of writings by various authors on ''Is This What You Were Born For?'', including a DVD of the film series, was published in 2011.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

The '''''Annales Barenses''''' is an anonymous set of [[annals]] written in the city of [[Bari]] in the late eleventh century. At the time of its composition, Bari was the chief city of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref name=Kumper&gt;{{citation |author=Hiram Kümper |chapter=Annales Barenses |title=Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle |editor=Graeme Dunphy |accessdate=17 September 2016 |year=2012 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2213-2139_emc_EMCSIM_00116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annales Barenses'' are closely related to the chronicle of [[Lupus Protospatharius]] and the ''[[Anonymi Barensis Chronicon]]''. The ''Annales Barenses'' cover the period from the death of Pope [[Gregory the Great]] in 605 until the election of [[Peter III (archbishop of Acerenza)|Peter III]], [[Archbishop of Acerenza]], in 1102. They are at their most useful for the short period 1041–43.&lt;ref name=Churchill&gt;{{citation |author=William J.

Anti-Romanian discrimination and sentiment has been present in various degrees among the peoples and/or governments of countries bordering on [[Romania]], either toward Romania itself or towards Romanian ethnic minorities residing in these countries. Similar patterns have existed toward other groups both in the region and elsewhere in the world, especially where political borders do not coincide with the patterns of ethnic population.

==Kingdom of Hungary==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Transylvania]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was organized according to the system of [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], which were privileged groups (''universitates'') with power and influence in socio-economic and political life, being nonetheless organized according to certain ethnic criteria as well. The first Estate was the lay and ecclesiastic aristocracy, ethnically heterogeneous, but undergoing a process of homogenization  around its [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nucleus. The other Estates were [[Saxons]], [[Székelys|Szeklers]] and [[Romanians]] (or [[Vlachs]] - ''[[Universitas Valachorum]]''), all with an ethnic and  ethno-linguistic basis (''Universis nobilibus, Saxonibus, Syculis et Olachis''). The general assembly (''congregatio generalis'') of the four Estates had mainly supra-legislative powers in Transylvania, but it sometimes took measures regarding order in the country, relationships between the privileged, military issues, etc.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The turning point in the history of the Romanian population in Transylvania was in 1366, when through the [[Decree of Turda]] the king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I Anjou of Hungary]] redefined nobility in terms of membership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and, thus specifically excluding the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Romanians. The only possibility for Romanians to retain or access nobility was through [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Roman Catholicism. Some Orthodox Romanian nobles converted, being integrated in the Hungarian nobility, but the most of them declined, thus losing their status and privileges. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

As a result, gradually, after 1366 Romanians lost their status as an Estate and were excluded from Transylvania's assemblies. This meant that the Romanian population of Transylvania was never directly represented in the Transylvanian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]], which consisted of Hungarian nobles, German and Székely nobles (the [[Unio Trium Nationum]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Moreover, in [[Medieval]] times, the Romanians were not allowed to reside within the walls of such Transylvanian cities as [[Sibiu]] (''Nagyszeben''/''Hermannstadt''), [[Braşov]] (''Brassó''/''Kronstadt'') or [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] (''Kolozsvár''/''Klausenburg''). This led to extensive persecution against the under-represented Romanians. For example, in the 16th century, Transylvanian laws of justice separated the rights of Hungarians, Saxons and Szeklers from the rights of the Romanians.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

As a consequence, Romanian peasants would sometimes revolt and demand better treatment. These revolts, such as the [[Revolt of Horea, Cloşca and Crişan|1784 Romanian peasant uprising]], were ruthlessly suppressed as [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] after learning the escalated situation ordered the army to intervene. Horea and Cloșca were caught by Romanians in their subterfuge and handled them to [[Paul Kray]] general. Horea and Cloșca were executed by [[breaking on the wheel]].&lt;ref name=HegyesMarczali&gt;Hegyes András - Marczali Henrik: Erdély története (Budapest, 2002) 141-147 o. {{ISBN|9639452297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of execution consisted of the victim being laid on the ground whilst the executioner would break the prisoner’s bones with a spiked wheel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Other peasants would be forced to watch the executions in order to frighten them from attempting future uprisings. Crișan committed suicide in the prison.&lt;ref name="HegyesMarczali"/&gt;

In 1918, after the First World War, the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]] was declared at [[Alba Iulia]] by an assembly of the delegates of ethnic Romanians in Transylvania. Following the Treaty of Trianon, eventually Transylvania became part of Romania.

==Bulgaria==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Bulgaria and Romania are neighbors, however, both two countries have been in conflicts in the past, especially over the [[Dobruja]] region. In the 1st millennium AD, [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] owned the territory of modern-day Romania. For many Bulgarians{{which|date=August 2017}}, at that time, Romanians were considered as being just Bulgarians, who spoke Bulgarian and belonged to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], a fact denied by the Romanians{{which|date=August 2017}}. It remained controversial even until the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s arrival to the Balkans.

After 1878, when Romania became independent, the two countries tried to resolve the conflict until the [[Second Balkan War]], when Romania attacked [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and took [[Tutrakan]] from the country, causing anti-Romanian sentiment to raise to higher levels. During [[World War I]], Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] and occupied [[Bucharest]] and Dobruja including the now retaken Tutrakan, which is still a part of Bulgaria today. After the end of the war, however, relations cooled down. In 1940, by the [[Treaty of Craiova]] Dobruja was divided between them with Bulgaria getting the Southern part and Romania getting the Northern part. After, in [[World War 2]], the two countries were allies. After the establishment of the Eastern Bloc, both countries became [[socialist]] republics, which furthered the friendship. The two countries currently have strong ties and have a very special relationship (both joined the [[EU]] in 2007), considering their opposed linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

Although the 1940 issue was reaffirmed later in 1947 by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]], today, most Romanians and Bulgarians get along with each other, but Romania is still being held at a negatively by certain groups{{which|date=August 2017}}, which still believe the whole of Romania belongs to them or at least all the Dobruja region.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Russian Empire==

[[Bessarabia]] became a part of the [[Russian Empire]] according to the 1812 [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. &lt;!---DO NOT USE ANNEXATION HERE! One cannot "annex" through the treaty. Read [[annexation]]---&gt; A period of autonomy followed, after which all Romanian government institutions, schools and presses were closed and replaced by a [[Russia]]n-style provincial administration in 1828. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Bessarabia saw an intense process of [[Russification]]. Military service also became a new instrument of Russification. The process of Russification and colonization of this territory started to be carried out by representatives of other ethnic groups of the Russian Empire, including [[Jew]]s, [[Bessarabia Germans|Germans]], [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]], [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]], and [[Ukrainians]].

== Soviet Union (including the 1917 Revolution) ==

When the Russian Empire collapsed after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], a local body called “[[Sfatul Ţării]]” ("Council of the Country") was created in Bessarabia. Moldova became an independent republic on December 2, 1917. Given that Soviet raids already menaced the newly formed authority, the local body ("Sfatul Ţării") called in support troops from the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The troops entered [[Bessarabia]] on December 13. On March 27, 1918, the local body ([[Sfatul Ţării]]) voted to unite with [[Romania]]. Subsequently, the Soviet Union refused to recognize the union, and supported an intense propaganda stating that the Kingdom of Romania was an imperialistic multi-ethnic state.

Bessarabia was a part of Romania until 1940 when the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] re-annexed the territory as well as Northern [[Bukovina]].

The convention of October 28, 1920, whereby the [[British Empire]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] recognized Romanian sovereignty in Bessarabia, was rejected as invalid by the USSR. Moscow even denied the validity of that part of the convention that stipulated that, upon Russian request, the Council of the League of Nations could be empowered to arbitrate the Russo-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia. In short, the Kremlin insisted that Romania was illegally occupying Bessarabia. Moscow also encouraged revolutionary activities by Bolshevik elements in Bessarabia.

The exact position of the USSR on these issues is unknown except for Moscow's unwillingness to make any concessions to [[Bucharest]] on Bessarabian issues. Recent tracts by Romanian historians have emphasized the support given by Romanian Communists to the "democratic forces" opposed to alteration of the status quo in [[Transylvania]] in 1938 and subsequent years. True as this may be, there has been no evidence presented in support of any fundamental change in Moscow's positions with respect to Bessarabia in 1938 and subsequent years.

According to official NKVD documents, over 15,000 Romanians from Northern Bukovina were deported to [[Siberia]] in 1940 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriel Gherasim, [http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=3 Românii din Ucraina (2), p. 3] ("Romanians in Ukraine (2)", p. 3), ''Noi, NU! Revistă de atitudine şi de cultură'', August 7, 2005. Accessed online December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet action culminated with the [[Fântâna Albă massacre]] when 2,500 to 3,000 Romanian refugees who were attempting to leave Northern Bukovina for Romania were blocked by the [[USSR Border Troops]] and about 200 of them were shot, at a place called "Fântâna Albă" (''White Fountain'' in Romanian). This policy resulted in a substantial shrinkage of the Romanian population in the province. By 1941, out of 250,000 Romanians in Northern Bukovina, only 192,000 were left.

The territory of the [[Moldavian SSR]] was composed of Bessarabia (except for Southern Bessarabia, assigned to [[Ukraine]]) and a part of the territory of the former [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] ([[Transnistria]]), founded in 1924 within the territory of Ukraine. In the document confirming the establishment of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) of 12 October 1924 the West frontier of the republic was traced out not along the Dniester River but the [[Prut River]]. In the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|MASSR]] the ideology of a separate Moldovan identity was pursued, including the introduction of [[Moldovan language]], distinct from Romanian. The Cyrillic alphabet and abundant [[Russianism|Russisms]] were introduced.

Another historical event which contributed to the future implementation of the anti-Romanian feelings was [[Romania during World War II|Romania’s behaviour in World War II]], when the Romanian regime allied itself with [[Nazi Germany]].

In Bessarabia, the Soviet government pursued a policy of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the native Romanian population. First, the province was divided into a "Moldovan" Socialist Republic and a southern region known as [[Budjak]], which was renamed [[Izmail Oblast]] and attached to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Elite elements of the Romanian population were then deported to Siberia much like their Bukovinian counterparts. Russian and Ukrainian settlers were used to fill the vacant areas caused by the deportation of Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nina Negru, [http://www.jurnal.md/articol.php?id=3652&amp;editie=409 Nu-i lua cu fericirile - disciplinează-i cu decalogul] ("Don't reach out to them with promises of happiness, discipline them with the Ten Commandments"), ''Jurnal de Chişinău'', Edition 409, 30 August 2005. Accessed online 20 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946-1947, as a result of the famine organised{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} in the [[Moldavian SSR|MSSR]] (according to some data of certain scientists; official data has not yet been published), around 300,000 died and many cases of cannibalism occurred{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. In addition, the population of the former MASSR, as a part of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], also suffered from the artificial famine in the 1930s when several million people died in Ukraine (''see also [[Holodomor]]'').

The territory of Transnistria was more industrialised in comparison with the other part of [[Moldova]] and the industrialisation process of Transnistria was accompanied by a population flow from other areas of the USSR, especially from Russia. Although in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] the level of population density was the highest one in the USSR, [[Moscow]] continued to stimulate the arrival of labour force from outside, including that with a poor qualification. Even [[Igor Smirnov]] himself, current leader of the separatist regime of Transnistria, was sent in 1987 from [[Russia]] to [[Tighina|Bender]] to be the director of an enterprise. This process was also amplified by the excessive militarization of the area.

The 1989 adoption of the Law on state language (official language) and Law on functioning of languages on the territory of the MSSR generated an extremely negative reaction in the industrial centres of Transnistria, where the largely [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking population was not being consulted, and felt threatened by the prospects of [[Romanianization]]. These laws proclaimed the Moldovan (Romanian) language, written in the Latin alphabet, as the only state language. The fact that [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] are identical was recognised. Although a majority of the Transnistrian population never read these laws which served as a reason for the conflict's outburst, they feared that by the application of the new linguistic legislation, [[Russian language]] speakers would become second-class citizens. At the industrial enterprises, including those of the military-industrial complex of the USSR, strikes occurred protesting against granting official language status to the Moldavian (Romanian) language.

==Post-Soviet Moldova==

After the breakup of the USSR, various legislative reforms consolidated the position of ethnic Romanians/Moldovans, especially by establishing the [[Moldovan language]] as the official language. The 2001 parliamentary elections, won by the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], initially brought a series of attempts to raise Russian to the status of a state language. However, the project was dropped by popular opposition.

Relations between the Moldovan and Romanian governments have initially included some tension as the Moldovan government led by President [[Vladimir Voronin]] accused Romania of ''[[imperialism]]''. Nevertheless, in the recent past relations have improved and President Voronin as well as Romanian President [[Traian Băsescu]] have called for cooperation between the two sovereign states.

In 2006, the [[Gheorghe Asachi]] Romanian-French School was forced by the government to change its name to the Gheorghe Asachi Moldovan-French School. Critics argued that the government acted unilaterally and discriminated against Romanians, as other schools such as the Necui-Leviţki Russian-Ukrainian School were allowed to continue using that name. In protest, four high school students from Asachi replaced the new high school sign with another with the old name. They were charged with "group-committed aggravated hooliganism".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.gandul.info/articol_10181/4_elevi_moldoveni_risca_inchisoarea__pentru_ca_sustin_ca_sunt_romani.html 4 elevi moldoveni risca inchisoarea, pentru ca sustin ca sunt romani] ("Four Moldovan students risk imprisonment for sustaining that they are Romanians"), ''Gândul'', 8 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Transnistria, the situation is considered to be far worse than the rest of Moldova. After the [[War of Transnistria|1992 war]], the Romanian population was substantially persecuted, causing at least 5,000 to 10,000 Romanians to flee the region. Although the number of Romanians in Transnistria is significant, Romanian is almost never used in public.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Romanian schools comprise about 11% of the total schools in Transnistria. Most of the schools are forced to teach in the [[Cyrillic]] script and use outdated, 40-year-old, communist-era books, and 6 schools are permitted to teach in Romanian using the [[Latin script]]; however, pressure is often put on the institutions to close. The [[Moldovan schools in Transnistria|2004 school crisis]] is a prime example of this, when the pro-Russian government in [[Tiraspol]] forcefully attempted to close down 2 of the schools. In the orphanage of [[Tighina]], Romanian children returning from vacations found the orphanage locked by police. After spending a night outdoors, they forced their way into the building and had to stay there without water and electricity for a few months, until pressure from the Moldovan and Romanian governments and from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) made the conflict get resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/publications/sg/2005/07/15621_425_en.pdf OSCE report about Romanian language in Transnistria]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Romanian parents were arrested or fired from their jobs for their political views and their determination to keep their children in Romanian-language schools.

Citizens who express pro-Romanian or pro-Moldovan attitudes are likewise persecuted in Transnistria. The [[Ilie Ilaşcu]] group is the most commonly known and well-documented of organisation.

==Ukraine==
[[Northern Bukovina]], as well as the [[Tiachiv]] and [[Rakhiv]] [[raion]]s (districts) of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] (Transcarpathia), are the regions in Ukraine with considerable Romanian minorities, according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]].

The Ukrainian Census of 2001 was criticized by Dr. Ion Popescu, leader of the National Council of the Interregional Union of the Romanian Community in Ukraine and also one of the authors of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], who claims that the very existence of the classification of Moldovans as a separate ethnic group in census results is a "continuation of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and Soviet policies of artificially dividing Romanians into [[Romanians]] and [[Moldovans]]"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141344/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=19.]&lt;!---is this a quote? than quotation marks are in order if not, pls replace with the exact quote---&gt;. However, the response to the census question about the ethnicity had to be written in into the census form rather than picked from a pre-determined set of choices and the census respondents were free to claim their ethnicity as they wished &lt;ref name=Censform&gt;[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/organization/ The Census form] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830230721/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/organization/ |date=August 30, 2006 }} at the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine web-site.&lt;/ref&gt;  not to respond to this or any other particular census question or not answer any questions at all; besides, no allegation of counting fraud were ever brought up. It is therefore unclear if Dr. Popescu criticizes the way in which the census was conducted or the way in which data was processed.

The number of Romanian students at [[Chernivtsi University]] declined sharply in Soviet times. In 1991-92, the last year of Soviet rule, the number of Romanian students was only 4.44% (434 out of 9,769) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141344/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=19.]. Among teaching faculty, under-representation of Romanians is also evident. The breakdown by nationalities (in the same year) reveals: Ukrainian teachers 465 (77.1%), Russians 102 (16.9%), Moldovans 9 (1.4%), Romanians 7 (1.1%), Belorussians 6 (0.9%), etc. Even after Ukrainian independence, the number of Romanian students at the University continued to decline, to only 3.9% in 1992-93, which is much less than the overall percentage of Romanians in the region's general population. Since 1997, arrangements have been made for some students to study at universities in Romania [http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.phparticleID=149&amp;document=19]. In 2001 the [[Christian-Democratic Alliance of the Romanians]] from Ukraine reported that Romanians in [[Chernivtsi]] lack an opportunity to study at the university level in their native language.[http://www.minelres.lv/minelres/archive/04052001-10:44:51-22702.html]

However, it should be noted that according to the Ukrainian Constitution adopted after its 1991 independence, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the only [[state language]] in the country, and the state higher education system was switched to Ukrainian, according to the common practice in many countries worldwide and this practice was not directed specifically at the Romanian population. For example, the majority of Ukrainian universities do not provide education in [[Russian language|Russian]] either, despite the fact that Russian is the native language of a much more considerable part of the population in Ukraine.

At the same time, there are schools teaching Romanian as a primary language, as well as newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting in Romanian [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3384&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090514084325/http://www.saske.sk/cas/1-2000/gulpa-petrisce.html], [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3377&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0]. Future teachers for Romanian schools are trained in at the Chernivtsi University in the fields of Romanian philology, mathematics and physics [http://www.chnu.cv.ua/index.php?page=ua/gradinf/rules/02bac_d]. Romanian organizations still complain that despite this, 19 villages inhabited by Romanians have been deprived of schooling in their native language, therefore creating a worse situation than that which existed under the repressive Soviet regime [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141332/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=146&amp;document=3].

==Yugoslavia and modern Serbia==
The [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanians]] living in the Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]] are very well represented at the provincial level despite their small presence (about 30,000 people, 1.5% of the province's population of around 2 million), and Romanian is one of the six official languages of the province. However, their counterparts in Eastern [[Central Serbia]] (mostly in the [[Timočka Krajina|Timok Valley]] and [[Braničevo (region)|Branicevo]]), known as [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and outnumbering the Vojvodinian Romanians, have not had any privileges. As example from [[Negotin]] in [[Vrsac]], the Romanian local television station door was vandalized with the inscription "Out Romanians, Serbia!!!" (Serbian: ''Napolje Rumuni, Srbija!!!'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/342455/Grafiti-mrznje-u-Vrscu-Napolje-Rumuni|title=Blic Online - Grafiti mržnje u Vršcu: "Napolje Rumuni!"|work=Blic Online|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timok Vlachs speak the same dialect ([[Daco-Romanian]]) as is spoken to the north, in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Thede Kahl, Ethnizität und räumliche Verteilung der Aromunen in Südosteuropa.

These people declare themselves on census forms as ethnic [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and their number is about 40,000. Nevertheless, older Serbian censuses counted up to 200,000 Romanians (Vlachs) in present-day Central Serbia (the 1895-census counted 159,510 Romanians, the 1921-census counted 150,098 Romanians, the 1953-census counted 198,793 [[Vlach language in Serbia|Vlach (Romanian)]] - speakers).

Since 2004 they are regular clashes between the Serbian authorities and the Romanian community in Timok when [[Bojan Aleksandrovic]], a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest decided to build a small church where he would hold services in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. The priest has been subjected to threats while children attending mass with their parents have been humiliated in the village school by their Serbian teacher. Romanians in Serbia proper do not have the right to schooling and public worship in their native language.&lt;ref name="Protests on the Council of Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10533.htm|title=Assemblée parlementaire du Conseil de l'Europe|work=coe.int|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,850103,00.html] April 25, 2003 on [[Deutsche Welle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, having had their windows broken and deaths threats made against them, twenty Romanian families were forced from their homes in [[Lisburn Road]], [[Belfast]], in [[Northern Ireland]].

Based on growing dissatisfaction with the European Union, several British politicians have posed a stance against the free movement of Romanians (and Bulgarians) within the E.U. and subsequently in the United Kingdom. As a result, multiple British newspapers have started publishing discriminatory articles about Romanian citizens, thus inciting an anti-Romanian sentiment; mainly against the Roma minority.

In 2013, Romanian ambassador [[Ion Jinga]] stated that a part of the British media launched a series of negative articles concerning Romanians, with reference to their “invasion”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2686/uk-cannot-afford-eu-open-borders-any-longer&lt;/ref&gt; to the United Kingdom, criminality, social benefits abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Public service Europe: http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2686/uk-cannot-afford-eu-open-borders-any-longer&lt;/ref&gt; and accusing Romania of involvement in the [[2013 horse meat scandal|meat adulteration scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2277223/Horsemeat-central-Inside-abattoir-Romania-revealed-main-source-contaminated-products.html|title=Horsemeat central: Inside the abattoir in Romania revealed as main source of contaminated products - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Jinga responded to these allegations through a series of interviews and articles in British newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;ITV: Alarmist predictions' over immigrants can cause racism:  www.itv.com/news/update/2013-02-22/alarmist-predictions...

:''"Now, almost on a daily basis I am asked where I am originally from, and I have to face a racist attitude following my answer."''

In 2013, the [[Daily Express]] newspaper launched a 'Crusade' against new [[European Union]] migrants from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. The frontpage on Thursday 31 October declared 'Britain is full and fed up. Today join your Daily Express Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants'. [[UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] declared that he had signed the petition, and urged other to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/440538/I-ve-signed-the-Express-petition-you-should-too-Remember-it-ll-be-Albanians-next|title=I’ve signed the Express petition – you should too!

===Germany===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In 2013 a prominent German newspaper, Der Spiegel, has published a short video displaying Roma-Romanians living in the city of Duisburg. The video shows a small number of Roma-Romanians and uncensored under-aged children living in a ghetto-like part of the city, without access to proper public services and living in poor housing conditions. Although there is no proof that the Romanian citizens were unemployed, the video claims they are a burden on the local welfare system. The discriminatory aspect of this video is visible through the fact that a number of German citizens are shown living in the same conditions; yet blaming the foreign citizens. This further increases the anti-Romanian sentiment, in a country where the majority of Romanian (and Bulgarian) citizens are well integrated.

===France===
Historically, France had cultivated a [[France–Romania relations|close relationship]] with the [[Romanian Principalities]] being a strong supporter of their independence and unification in 1859 and ultimately  of Greater Romania in 1918. Many of the prominent Romanian scientists and artists like [[Henry Coanda]] and [[Constantin Brancusi]] had studied and worked in Paris and Bucharest was nicknamed Le Petit Paris for its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Furthermore, the [[Romanian flag]] bears homage to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and has been interpreted as Liberty (blue) Justice (yellow) Fraternity (Red). 
Following the deportation of [[Roma-Romanian]] citizens from France, and numerous discriminatory articles in the French media, a small protest occurred in front of the French embassy in Bucharest, against the discrimination against Romanians in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/romanians-protest-discrimination-french-media-111226486.html|title=Romanians protest discrimination in French media|date=13 October 2011|work=[[Yahoo News]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===

A Dutch right wing political party ([[Wilders’ Freedom party]] (PVV)), launched a website aimed at gathering denunciations against Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/justice/dutch-website-causes-stir-centra-news-510729|title=Dutch website causes stir in Central Europe|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denunciations consist of competition on the job market, and others, with the slogan: “Are they causing you problems? Or did you lose your job to a Pole, Bulgarian, Romanian or other Central or East European? We would love to hear from you,”; thus inciting social tension between European Citizens exercising their treaty right of freedom of movement and the local population. The Netherlands is one of the main countries blocking Romania and Bulgaria from joining the [[Schengen Agreement]]; as well as one of the countries with growing populism.

'''BIOSIS Previews''' is an English-language, [[bibliographic]] database service, with abstracts and [[citation indexing]]. It is part of ''[[Clarivate Analytics]] [[Web of Science]]'' suite. BIOSIS Previews indexes data from 1926 to the present.&lt;ref name=coverage/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dialog-biosis/&gt;

BIOSIS Previews is part of the ''Life Sciences'' in [[Web of Science]]. Its coverage encompasses the  [[life sciences]] and [[biomedical sciences]] literature, with deep global coverage on a wide range of related subject areas. This is accomplished with access to indexed journal content from ''[[Biological Abstracts]]'', and supplemental indexed non-journal content from ''[[Biological Abstracts/RRM|Biological Abstracts/Reports, Reviews, Meetings]]'' (''BA/RRM'' or ''Biological Abstracts/RRM)'' and the major publications of BIOSIS.  This coverage includes literature in pre-clinical and experimental research, methods and instrumentation, animal studies, environmental and consumer issues, and other areas.&lt;ref name=coverage&gt;

==History==
In 1926, the [[Society of American Bacteriologists]] and the [[Botanical Society of America]], acknowledging the need for greater integration of life science information, agreed to merge their two publications, ''Abstracts of Bacteriology''&lt;ref&gt;''Abstracts of Bacteriology'' began publication in 1917 under the editorship of A. Parker Hitchens, as an outgrowth of the ''Journal of Bacteriology''. {{OCLC|1460582}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Botanical Abstracts'',&lt;ref&gt;''Botanical Abstracts'' was published under the direction of the Board of Control of Botanical Abstracts, Inc. During its publication it had two editors: September 1918–March 1921, B.E. Livingston and April 1921–November 1926, J.R. Schramm; at which point it was merged into ''Biological Abstracts''. {{OCLC|1536892}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating ''Biological Abstracts''.  A not-for-profit company was formed to administer the publication on a financially sound basis. In 1964, the company's name was changed to ''BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts (BIOSIS)''.&lt;ref name="Kennedy-309"&gt;Kennedy, H. E. (1988) "BIOSIS to the Rescue" ''BioScience'' 38(5):  pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steere&gt;Steere, William Campbell; Parkins, Phyllis V. and Philson, Hazel A.

In 2004 the company was purchased by ''[[Thomson Scientific]]'' &lt;ref name="BW-2004"&gt;Staff (12 January 2004) "Thomson Acquires BIOSIS Publishing Assets" ''Business Wire''&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now part of [[Thomson Reuters]] Science &amp; Healthcare division.&lt;ref name="BW-2004"/&gt; The proceeds from that sale were applied to fund an endowment and create a new grant-making foundation. The Board of Directors of that foundation selected as the organization’s new name: ''J.R.S. Biodiversity Foundation''. This reflected both the historic legacy of the Foundation and its future grant-making domain. The initials J.R.S. stand for the name of one of the founders of BIOSIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About JRS |publisher=JRS Biodiversity Foundation |url=http://jrsbdf.org/v3/About.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820021406/http://www.jrsbdf.org/v3/About.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=23 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Wolters Kluwer]] announced the digital availability of the BIOSIS Archive and Zoological Record Archive databases, via their [[Ovid Technologies]] online services.&lt;ref name="WKH-2007"&gt;[http://www.wolterskluwer.com/WK/Press/Latest+News/2007/Mar/pr_06Mar07a.htm "Ovid Expands Portfolio of Archive Content with BIOSIS Archive and Zoological Record Archive"] ''Wolters Kluwer Health'' 6 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The BIOSIS Archive consists of the data from the print volumes of ''[[Biological Abstracts]]'' from 1926 to 1968, and the Zoological Record Archive contains the data published in print in ''The Zoological Record'' from 1864 to 1977.&lt;ref name="WKH-2007"/&gt; In 2010 Biosis Citation Index was released on the Web of Knowledge Platform, combining extensive indexing and database coverage of Biosis Previews with the Web of Science's citation tracking features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biosis Citation Index |work=Products and tools |publisher=Web of Knowledge |url=http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/specialized/bci/ |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beast of Bladenboro''' refers to the creature responsible for a string of deaths amongst [[Bladenboro, North Carolina]] animals in the winter of 1953-54. According to witnesses and trackers it was likely a [[wildcat]], but the uncertain nature of its identity lends itself to speculation. According to reports, the entity was known to most commonly crush or decapitate its victims, which were mostly dogs.

==Deaths==
Possibly related to the Bladenboro incidents, a dog was found dead in [[Clarkton, North Carolina]] (about eight miles from Bladenboro), killed by what Police Chief Roy Fores reported witnesses as describing as "sleek, black, about 5 feet long...." on December 29, 1953.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"&gt;('Vampire' Charges Woman, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, two dogs belonging to a Bladenboro man named Johnny Vause were found dead. There was reportedly a significant amount of blood at the scene near their kennels.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 4"&gt;(Mystery Beast Slays Dogs of Bladenboro, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; The two dogs were "torn into ribbons and crushed," according to Vause.

On the next day, January 1, 1954, two more dogs were found dead in Bladenboro at Woodie Storm's farm. One was "sort of eaten up," according to a witness.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 4"/&gt;

On the night of January 2, a farmer named Gary Callahan reported that a dog of his had been killed.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

Two more dogs were found dead on January 3. One of the dogs was autopsied, and according to Police Chief Roy Fores "...there wasn't more than two or three drops of blood in him [...] The victim's bottom lip had been broken open and his jawbone smashed back." Fores also said of the dogs found dead so far, "The ear of one dog was gnawed off and the tongues of two had been chewed out."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"&gt;(Vampire Tendencies Found In Bladenboro's 'Monsters', 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Charlotte News'', on the night of the 5th a pet rabbit was found "cleanly decapitated and still warm."&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"&gt;(The Beast Of Bladenboro - They All Know 'It'll Come Back', 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 7, a dead dog was found in a pasture near the Bladenboro swamp.&lt;ref name="WN Jan 8"&gt;(Fresh Dogs Seek 'Beast' At Bladenboro, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian "Tater" Shaw, who owned a local gas station, heard that a goat had died in a strange way and traveled to the edge of town to see for himself. According to him, "His head was flat as a fritter [...] it had a great big ol' track... It was weird." Shaw also claimed that whatever killed the goat killed cows and hogs.&lt;ref name = "SN Oct 2006"&gt;(The Beast Of Bladenboro, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encounters and descriptions==
Resident Malcolm Frank reported seeing the animal crossing the street. He described it as "about four and a half feet long, bushy, and resembling either a [[bear]] or a [[Panthera|panther]]," according to the January 4 edition of the ''Wilmington Morning Star''.&lt;ref name = "WMS Jan 4"/&gt; A son of a Bladenboro man named Carl Pate reported seeing the monster as well on the night of January 3. According to him, "it was small, and a little one just like it was running beside it."  A third sighting on January 3rd was reported by James Pittman: "[...] about 11:00 o'clock I heard a strange noise outside my window, like a baby crying." He went outside to follow the noise for "close to a mile [...] I saw bushes moving, but I never did actually see whatever it was. However, I think it must have been close to 150-pounds, the way it went through the bushes."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"/&gt;

Around 8 o'clock in the evening on January 4, Lloyd Clemmons claims to have seen the beast. The following account, reported in the ''Wilmington Morning Star'', contains a physical description.

{{quotation | I got two dogs, Niggy, the little black one, and Peewee, a brown one, that's bigger. Me and my wife were sitting here in the living room. We heard the dogs get awful restless. My front light was on and Larry Moore [...] had his back light on. I glanced out the window and saw this thing. It had me plumb spellbound. It was bout 20 inches high. It had a long tail, about 14 inches. The color of it was dark. It had a face exactly like a cat. Only I ain't ever seen a cat that big. It was walking around stealthy, sneaky, moving about trying to get to Niggy and Peewee. I jumped for my shotgun and loaded it and went out to shoot it, but it moved into the darkness right away and I couldn't find him again.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 6"&gt;(Bladen Beast Still Prowls, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; }}A group of hunters from Wilmington including S. W. Garret, G. V. Garret, and Joe Gore spent that night tracking the creature for three miles around swampland. According to them, the tracks showed claws at least an inch long and indicated an 80&amp;nbsp;lb. to 90&amp;nbsp;lb. animal. The beast's circling movement suggested it might have had offspring or a mate nearby, the hunters said.&lt;ref name = "RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

During the early hours of January 5, Chief Fores and one D.G. Pait witnessed the beast attacking a dog from a hundred or so feet away. According to them, the dog ran away, yelping, and was not found. Pait also reported seeing tracks along a creek bank near one of the attack sites. He said that there were two sets of prints, and one was smaller.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 6"/&gt; Later that day, in the early evening, Mrs. C. E. Kinlaw went to her front porch upon hearing whimpering dogs. She saw what she described as looking like "a big [[mountain lion]]" near the dogs, three houses down. The creature ran toward her, but turned and fled when she screamed. Outside her home, the tracks left in the dirt road were "bigger than a silver dollar" according to Police Chief Fores.&lt;ref name = "RNO Jan 6"/&gt; {{quotation | After we first saw it, and my husband [scared it away], it circled back and came running toward the porch where I was standing. I screamed and it stopped on all fours, turned and ran off. [...] You know, the Bible speaks of sights and wonders before the end of time. This could be one of them. The Bible's coming true, day by day.&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"/&gt;|C. E. Kinlaw}}

A young boy named Dalton Norton reported seeing what he called "a big cat" on January 6. According to him: "We heard a noise on the porch [...] whatever it was made a noise like a baby crying. It jumped off the porch and I watched it through the window. It went over to one house, then went off towards another and I didn't see it anymore."&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"/&gt;

On January 11, two cars stopped for an animal reported to be four feet long. Jeff Evers, one of the men in the cars, was quoted as saying the animal had "runty-looking ears" and being "brownish and tabby." Fores said the animal "really upset the women. They were wringing their hands and like that."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 12]"&gt;(Beast Takes Stroll; Frightens Autoists, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunt for the Beast==
[[File:Davis's Bobcat and Mayor Fussell.png|thumbnail|left|Luther Davis and Mayor Woodrow Fussell next to the bobcat Davis trapped.]]
The night of January 3, Police Chief Roy Fores searched for the creature with his dogs, but they reportedly would not follow the trail.&lt;ref name="WN Jan 4"&gt;(Mysterious Beast Still At Large, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

"A half-dozen brave youths" and their dogs spent January 4 searching for the creature responsible for the deaths. That night, Police Chief Roy Fores and eight to ten other officers conducted their own hunt.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"/&gt; Hunters who traveled to Bladenboro from Wilmington also searched for the beast that evening, reportedly tracking it for 3 miles around the swamp.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

On the night of January 5, more than 500 people and dogs hunted through the woods and swamps for the creature.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

On January 6, more than 800 people turned out to hunt for the beast in the swamps. Fores planned to tie up dogs as bait to lure the creature in. This particular plan was called off, and the hunt itself was also ended by officials as safety became a concern.&lt;ref name="WN Jan 7"&gt;(Hunters, Dogs Tracking Bladen Mystery Killer, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, another 800 to 1,000 people gathered to hunt the creature.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 8"&gt;(Monster Strikes Again, Slays Dog, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the evening of the 8th, four fraternity brothers from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] were the only reported hunters. Mayor Fussell officially called off the hunt unless the creature made another obvious kill or there was a legitimate sighting. The armed hunting parties of previous nights had become too large for safety, and Fores received a telegram from a humane society in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] protesting his plan to stake out dogs as bait for the creature.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 9"&gt;(Vampire Beast Wins Battle Of Bladenboro, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Amy Hotz for ''Star News'', Julian "Tater" Shaw recalled, "Everybody was scared. Everybody, near ‘bout, that had a gun was carrying it. [...] Anyhow, it was getting so bad, it was getting in the newspapers and the radio [...] There came hunters from all over, I mean big hunters." Another gas station owner, Jabe Frink, said the panic "[...] kept snowballing and snowballing. It got so nobody would walk out on the street at night."&lt;ref name="SN Oct 2006"/&gt;

Luther Davis, a local farmer, produced a dead [[bobcat]] on January 13. He found the bobcat struggling with a steel trap in Big Swamp, four miles from the city, at 6:00AM. He proceeded to shoot it in the head at about 8:30AM.&lt;ref name = "WMS Jan 14"&gt;(Bladen Man Traps Bobcat; Is It The Ferocious Beast?, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Woodrow Fussell, the mayor of Bladenboro, told newspapers that the beast of Bladenboro had been found and killed. According to Gallehugh, however, it was unlikely that such a small cat could have killed and mangled the dogs.&lt;ref name="Gallehugh"&gt;(Gallehugh, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Bruce Soles from Tabor City was leaving Bladenboro when he hit a cat with his vehicle. According to reports, it was "spotted like a leopard," about 20 to 24 inches high, and weighed between 75 and 90 pounds. He took the cat home with him to Tabor City.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 14"/&gt; Yet a third man is credited in some newspapers as having killed the animal. There are conflicting newspaper reports about whether it was Davis's or "professional hunter and guide" Berry Lewis's cat that Mayor Fussell photographed and sent out to the press. According to Corey, from ''The Carolina Farmer'', Lewis was hunting in a different part of Bladen county when he shot and killed his bobcat.&lt;ref name="CF 1958"&gt;(Is The Beast Dead?, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculation==
Many reported accounts describe the Beast of Bladenboro as feline, but do not agree on any one species.

Malcolm Frank described the animal as "[...] resembling either a [[bear]] or a [[Panthera|panther]]." Wilmington hunter S.W. Garrett claimed to have heard the creature scream while hunting, and likened it to that of a [[Panthera|panther]].&lt;ref name = "WMS Jan 7"&gt;(Guns, Dogs Circle Blood-Lusty Beast, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Davis, curator at the Raleigh State Museum, has said that a panther "[...] never occurs in this country [...] We've checked on panther stories before. One turned out to be a big house cat." He was of the opinion that it might have actually been a [[coyote]]: "[...] they've been traded around quite a bit, brought East as pets and released after owners got tired of them."&lt;ref name="CF 1958"/&gt;

James Pittman claimed the beast had tracks like those of a dog, but he also said "only I've never seen a dog that large." Chief Fores was also reported as believing the beast to be a mad [[wolf]]. He said that "old folks say they remember seeing wolves in the bay-swamp area and talk about them every now and then."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"/&gt;

C.E. Kinlaw described the creature as looking like "a big [[mountain lion]]" when it charged her on January 5. ('Mountain lion' is another name for '[[cougar]]'.)
The January 7 edition of ''The Bladen Journal'' reports that some people described the animal as likely being a [[wolverine]]. The article goes on to mention that there is speculation the creature may have been a "wild police dog."&lt;ref name="BJ Jan 7"&gt;(Hunt Animal Blamed With Killing Eight Dogs At Bladenboro In Week, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

The game warden of [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]], Sam Culberth, said that the tracks he investigated indicated a "[[catamount]]."&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"/&gt; (This is yet another name for a [[cougar]].)

A.R. Stanton, a man from [[Lumberton, North Carolina]] thought that the beast of Bladenboro was a German Shepherd and Hound mix named "Big Boy" that he gave to a Native American boy who lived along the edge of Big Swamp. Big Boy was dark and had a "long, bushy tail." Stanton was quoted as saying: "I raised him from a pup [...] but if I met him in the woods I wouldn't call him I'd kill him." He claimed Big Boy was capable of leaping over a six-foot fence and killed chickens from time to time.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 13"&gt;(Thinks Bladen Killer Dog He Gave Indian, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Lumberton veterinarian N.G. Baird said, in regards to Big Boy, that it was "very feasible" he was responsible for the attacks. Baird also said that it was possible Big Boy (or another dog) could have killed the other dogs and lapped up blood, rather than sucking it.&lt;ref name="ROB Jan 13"&gt;('Vampire' Theory Fails To Draw Comment From Officer, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor of ''The Robesonian'', Daisy Morris claimed to have heard a wild panther years before, and remarked "a dog can't scream or cry like a baby - and I can testify that towns mean nothing to a hungry panther and certainly not to a mad panther."&lt;ref name="ROB Jan 14"&gt;(Screams Of Panther Recalled; Likened to Bladenboro Beast, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Literature about the events of the winter of 1953-54 tends towards skepticism, particularly because of the publicity involved for the town through the sensational news reports.

Mayor Woodrow Fussell, who operated the town theater, went to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] on January 6 to book the film [[The Big Cat (1949 film)|''The Big Cat'']] for a day. Leaflets published by the theater proclaimed "Now you can see the 'Cat.' We've got him on our screen! And in Technicolor too! 'The Big Cat.' All day Saturday, Jan 9."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 8 2"&gt;(Enterprise!, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with John Corey, Fussell said that he believed the creature to be a hoax, even though he was the one who called the Wilmington newspapers about the dead dogs. He found the manner of their deaths strange, and said that "a little publicity never hurts a town." What he didn't anticipate however, was how far the ''Wilmington Morning Star'', ''The Wilmington News'', and other newspapers would take the story.
{{quotation | We had to do something. The town was armed to the teeth. Even small boys carried guns. Chief of Police Roy Fores and I knew someone would be shot accidentally. [...] The animal was about 90 percent imagination, 10 percent truth. Newspaper reporters labeled it 'The Beast of Bladenboro' and called it a vampire.|Woodrow Fussell, mayor of Bladenboro during the Beast of Bladenboro incident}}

Corey writes that a "one-arm sign painter" tailored his art to fit the sensationalism surrounding the incidents in 1954, making bumper plates proclaiming "Home of the Beast of Bladenboro."&lt;ref name="CF 1958"/&gt;

On the morning of December 15, 1954 on a tenant farm near Robeson Memorial Hospital, a man named Marvin McLamb found "five mediumsized pigs and three chickens" dead. According to ''The Robesonian'', "[...] strewn around a sty approximately 10 by 15 feet in area. The animals were mutilated and four had crushed skulls. Three of the pigs had legs torn apart from their bodies. Strangely enough, no blood was evident, indicating the killer employed the same blood-sucking traits as the Bladenboro beast."&lt;ref name="ROB Dec 15"&gt;('Beast Of Bladenboro' Type Killer Strikes In Robeson, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a stray dog weighing 65 pounds was killed. Carol Freeman, the County Dog Warden, said it was "most probably" the killer from the day before, even though the tracks found at the farm were not compared to the dead dog's, and it was not explained how the dog could have reached the chickens, who McLamb said were roosting in a tree. According to Dog Warden Raymond Kinlaw, the feeding of raw meat to pet dogs "[...] definitely would cause a dog to become blood thirsty."&lt;ref name="ROB Dec 16"&gt;('Beast Of Bladenboro' Scare Ends In Death Of Large Dog, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boost The 'Boro, a community booster for Bladenboro, holds an annual "Beast Fest" in which the Beast of Bladenboro (or 'BOB', as they call him) serves as mascot. Boost The 'Boro makes use of the beast's sensational history amongst locals to generate excitement for the community event.&lt;ref name="Hester"&gt;(Hester, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''architectural brief''' is a statement of a client's requirements, which form the basis for appointing an [[architect]]. The brief describes the requirements that need to be reconciled and accommodated, and is developed first as a design which is submitted for approval, and subsequently constructed as a building or other structure. A brief is a written document that might be anything from a single page to a multiple volume set of documents. 
The term '''program''' is often used today, in conjunction with, and in part as a [[synonym]] of, an "architectural brief". "Program" is used more often in the United States whereas 'brief' is used more outside the United States, internationally. An architect's design is considered the response to the building program.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/o/ogorman-abc.html |title=ABC of Architecture |last1=O'Gorman |first1=James |date=1998 |work=New York Times |access-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the brief==
The architectural brief is often formulated by, or in collaboration with, the architect. It often includes [[SWOT analysis|opportunities assessed, constraints identified]] and needs for further investigation clarified.

In the early stages of the design process the brief may be continuously reappraised as the requirements become clearer - this is known as 'firming up the brief'. Ultimately, a clear set of instructions setting out the overarching goals and  detailed requirements will emerge which form the starting point of the architect's designs and will be continually tested against, as designs are progressed.

==Schedule of accommodation==
In the later stages of writing a brief, a '''schedule of accommodation''' is sometimes drawn up that will specify precisely the number and size of rooms that will be required, the relationships between rooms and groups of rooms, the finishes, equipment, furniture that will fit the room for its functional purpose and the environmental conditions that will assist the purpose. Environmental conditions might include temperature range, humidity, air movement, acoustic isolation, etc..The schedule of accommodation is prepared by an expert to help in determining the minimum space required on site to develop and finish a given design .The schedule of accommodation is guided by the brief analysis of every space since every space have set standards and requirement.

==Complex briefs==
For complex facilities, the brief may be prepared by a specialist consultant, separate from the design architect. In such projects, workshops are often employed with project participants: owners, users, customers, [[Facility management|facility experts]], [[General contractor|builders/contractors]] and other designers brought together for an intensive one- or two-day period to devise the critical aspects of the brief.

If the brief will provide a large number of similar spaces, for example, in a hospital, then room/space 'types' might be defined, as a type of 'space dictionary' that is then used to inform room or space groupings. These space groupings are then assembled into related sets of rooms to meet a functional or service requirement. The critical component of the related sets is that the interactions between rooms are set out, with details as to the type of interaction. For example, if escorted patients, beds and medical equipment are to be moved, or if individuals or groups of people will move between spaces, the architect's design will need to acknowledge the different design responses to be made.

The information used to assemble a 'space dictionary' can be quite detailed, with a schedule produced that lists, for each room, parameters, the requirement against the parameter, and any particular performance needs.

Parameters might include: population (median and peak), area, minimum height, floor [[Structural load|loading]], [[Flooring#Flooring materials|floor finish]] and [[Skirting board|skirting]] requirements, including any plinths, hobs or set-downs, wall finishes, including wall protection needs (pertinent in hospitals, warehouses, etc.), ceiling finish, including acoustic needs, engineering services required: power, lighting, [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]], water, drainage, communications, etc.; environmental conditions: air temperature, humidity, noise level, air movement; access and security needs; FFE (furniture, fittings and equipment), with note made of mass, dimensions, power requirements, energy evolved, noise produced, ventilation and extraction needed, service and operating clearances; fire safety.

A thorough brief will start with a definition of the services or functions to be accommodated, decomposing these functions into specific sub-functions and then to activities. A '[[functional brief]]' is thus compiled. This brief is used to, in turn, create the architectural brief, that sets out the accommodation specifics for preparation of design options.

==Evaluation==
For critical facilities, the [[project manager]] or owner may require the architect to validate the design against the brief, producing a report that shows in tabular form, how and where, the design meets the brief. This avoids misunderstanding of drawings that can arise when non-experts are asked to review them. A graphical validation might include demonstration of the movement expected between spaces, and show how a proximity diagram is modeled onto the design layout.

The '''''Chronicle of Melrose''''' is a medieval [[chronicle]] from the [[Cottonian Manuscript, Faustina]] B. ix within the [[British Museum]]. It was written by unknown authors, though evidence in the writing shows that it most likely was written by the monks at [[Melrose Abbey]]. The chronicle begins on the year 735 and ends in  1270, consisting of two separate segments.

The first part of the chronicle from the year 745 to about 1140 (the year Melrose Abbey was founded), is a compilation from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' as well as other historical works written by [[Simeon of Durham]] and [[Hoveden]].

The second portion starts from 1140 until the end of the chronicle in 1270. It contains original work and is considered by [[historian]]s to be more credible than the first segment.

The chronicle is currently in the British Museum, taken away from [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] possibly during the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] period.

In 2014, it was discovered that the ''Chronicle'' contains the oldest independent account of the sealing of [[Magna Carta]].{{sfn|Stevenson|1270|p=999}}

[[File:Képes Krónika 1360.jpg|thumb|250px|The first page of the ''Chronicon Pictum'']]

The '''''Chronicon Pictum''''' (Latin for ''illustrated chronicle'', {{lang-en|Illuminated Chronicle}} or ''Vienna Illuminated Chronicle'', {{lang-hu|Képes Krónika}} also referred to as ''[[Chronica Hungarorum]]'', ''Chronicon (Hungariae) Pictum'', ''Chronica Picta'' or ''Chronica de Gestis Hungarorum'') is a medieval illustrated chronicle from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from the second half of fourteenth century. It represents the international artistic style of the royal courts in the court of [[Louis I of Hungary]].

Its full name is: ''Chronicon pictum, [[Mark of Kalt|Marci de Kalt]], Chronica de gestis Hungarorum'', that is ''Illustrated Chronicle, Mark of Kalt's Chronicle About the Deeds of the Hungarians''.

== History of the chronicle ==
The chronicle was written by Márk Kálti (lat. ''Marci de Kalt'') shortly after the year 1358, with the last of the illuminations being finished between 1370 and 1373. The chronicle was given by the Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] to the French king [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], when the daughter of Louis, [[Catherine of Hungary (1370–1378)|Catherine]], was engaged to Charles' son [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]].&lt;ref name=praz&gt;{{Cite book|title = Legendy a kroniky koruny Uherské (Legends and chronicles of Hungarian crown)|last = Pražák, Nechutová, Bartoňková|first = |publisher = Nakladatelství Vyšehrad|year = 1988|isbn = |location = Prague|pages = 340–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then gifted to [[Đorđe Branković]] in 1456, where it was copied, and later lost, possibly spending some time in Turkish possession.&lt;ref name=praz/&gt;

The chronicle reappears in the first half of the 17th century in royal archives of Vienna by unknown means, this is why it is also referred as the ''Vienna Illuminated Chronicle''. The manuscript is now kept in the [[National Széchényi Library]] in Budapest (Országos Széchényi Könyvtár, Budapest).&lt;ref name=praz/&gt;

== Depicted history ==
The 147 pictures of the chronicle are great source of information on medieval Hungarian cultural history, costume, and court life in the 14th century. Many [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s seen inside this chronicle are painted with gold. The artistic value of the miniatures are quite high, if we compare similar miniatures from other parts of Western Europe from the same time. The characters are drawn with detail and with knowledge of [[anatomy]]. Even the eyeballs are painted, which can only be checked through microscope.

All miniatures showing [[Attila the Hun]] are disrupted or even rubbed out (especially the last, showing Attila's death); this cannot be due to the time as all other miniatures and text are preserved well. The miniatures make use of [[symbol]]ism, i.e. "primus ingressus" ('first incoming') is with a [[camel]], while the "secundus ingressus" ('second incoming') is with a white horse, probably meaning that entering the [[Carpathian Basin]] the first time was not a successful or was a culturally diverted act (as the camel is a "diverted" horse and white horse is the "pure quality"). The text of [[Latin]] is without error and is representing a high quality.

'''Community paper''' is a term used by publishers, advertisers and readers to describe a range of publications that share a common service to their local community and commerce. Their predominant medium being newsprint, often free and published at regular weekly or monthly intervals, Community Papers are distinguished by their demonstrable levels of local engagement, rather than by the scope of their content. While Merriam-Webster and other dictionaries have yet to define Community Paper, the term has long been incorporated into the actual name of six state, five regional and one national trade association &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paperchain.com/associations.html, see PaperChain, Your National Connection to Local Media, Advisory Board and Associations&lt;/ref&gt; of hometown publishers of passing events, both general and commercial. While the diverse composition of their membership may cast a wide tent over the term, all Community Papers have a [[Nameplate (publishing)|Nameplate]], bear a [[Masthead (publishing)|Masthead]], are fixed in print and dated by edition, are published at regular intervals, and are archived internally at a minimum. Whether a specific Community Paper might more resemble a [[Pennysaver|Shopper]] or a [[Newspaper]], all such local papers fit the dictionary definition of Publication and Periodical,&lt;ref&gt;http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/dmm300_landing.htm, as opposed to the Classification for Rates at the United States Postal Service. Subchapter 707 of the Domestic Mail Manual, Special Standards, Periodicals, provides for free newspapers, paid publications consisting predominantly of advertising, and more broadly for publications containing up to 75% advertising, with at least half of copies paid for, paid meaning no less than half a nominal established price&lt;/ref&gt; and are clearly distinguished from ''Flyers'', ''Handbills'' and ''Circulars'' which are printed, usually at sporadic intervals, and serve a limited, often singular commercial interest.

== History ==

While free community papers may have complicated Professor Pollard's quest to craft the ultimate description of "legitimate newspaper," their emergence becoming increasingly common with the establishment of Third Class Mails in 1928, the explosive growth and real birth of an industry came after his exercise in publishing segregation. Less than half a decade hence, notes free paper publishing pioneer Victor Jose notes in his treatise on the industry, the wave of returning veterans of World War Two came home to plant publishing flags in their own hometowns, in service to the obvious communications needs and giving rise to free community papers for all.&lt;ref&gt;The Free Paper In America: Struggle for Survival, Victor Jose, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, the trade associations representing free community paper publishers began their universal embrace of independent audits of circulation, and soon into the new century the industry was governed by the strict standards and scrutiny of Circulation Verification Council &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cvcaudit.com/&lt;/ref&gt;). Today, the weekly, audited reach of free community papers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cowichanvalleyvoice.com/issues/vvdecemberweb.pdf Cowichan Valley Voice]&lt;/ref&gt; exceeds 65,000,000 according to the collaborative initiative, PaperChain &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paperchain.com/media.html, see PaperChain, Media Facts&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Mary Alfonsi''' (May 23, 1942 &amp;ndash; August 25, 2011), better known by her ring name '''Donna Christanello''' (also billed as '''Donna Christianello''', '''Donna Christenello''', '''Donna Christiantello''', and '''Donna Christantello''', the name which she went by on her official website), was a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] trained by [[The Fabulous Moolah]]. She was active from the late 1960s through the 1980s. She frequently wrestled women such as [[Ann Casey]], [[Vicki Williams]], Evelyn Stevens and [[Leilani Kai]] throughout the 1970s.

==Professional wrestling career==

===National Wrestling Alliance===
Christanello was employed at a restaurant in Pittsburgh when she decided to contact a wrestling promoter to become a professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=lady/&gt; Male wrestlers [[Waldo Von Erich]] and [[Klondike Bill]] helped set her up with women's wrestling trainer [[The Fabulous Moolah]].&lt;ref name=phof/&gt; She moved to South Carolina in 1963 to train with Moolah.&lt;ref name=phof/&gt; In 1969, Christanello competed during an Australian tour with [[Toni Rose]], Jessica Rodgers, [[Betty Boucher|Betty]] and Rita Boucher, Ramona Isbell, Marva Scott and Evelyn Stevens.

She was the frequent [[tag team]] partner of Toni Rose. She and Rose won the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=phof/&gt; In 1972, she competed at the [[Superbowl of Wrestling]], where she and Rose defended the time World Women's Tag Team Championship against [[Sandy Parker]] and Debbie Johnson. They eventually lost the title in October 1973 to [[Joyce Grable]] and [[Vicki Williams]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. There is also an unrecorded title change. [[Sue Green|Susan Green]] and Sandy Parker won the World Tag Team title from Christanello and Rose in November 1971 in Hawaii and lost them in February 1972 to Christanello and Rose in Hong Kong. They also defended the title in the NWA and [[American Wrestling Association]], and the title was eventually integrated into the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).&lt;ref name=phof/&gt; As a result, they were recognized as the first WWF Women's Tag Team Champions.&lt;ref name=phof/&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation===
During the mid-1980s she competed in the WWF's women's division. Christianello continued to wrestle in tag team matches. On May 5, 1984, Susan Starr and Christianello defeated [[Wendi Richter]] and [[Peggy Lee Leather|Peggy Lee]]. On June 5, 1984, Peggy Lee and Christianello defeated [[The Fabulous Moolah]] and [[Desiree Petersen]]. The next day Moolah and Petersen defeated the team of Christianello and [[Judy Martin (wrestler)|Judy Martin]]. On June 9, Moolah and Petersen defeated Martin and Christianello. The following day, Moolah and Petersen once again defeated Christianello and Judy Martin.

In August 1984, Christianello wrestled primarily singles matches. On August 19, [[Sue Green|Susan Green]] defeated Christianello. In matches on both August 20 and 21, Susan Starr defeated Christianello. In 1987, she wrestled as part of [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri's]] team at the [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view.&lt;ref name=phof/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Christanello was born and raised in Pittsburgh and was of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent.&lt;ref name=lady/&gt; She lived with [[The Fabulous Moolah]] on-and-off for forty years, ending in May 1999 when she moved back to Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=fab143&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; While living with Moolah, she helped train women wrestlers [[Sherri Martel]] and [[Brittany Brown]].&lt;ref name=phof/&gt; After retiring from the ring, she was employed by [[Wal-Mart]] in the accounting department.&lt;ref name=phof/&gt;

Her niece, Marie Minor, was trained by Christanello and worked as a wrestler under the ring name Angie Minelli for several years in the 1980s.

On August 25, 2011, she died from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD].&lt;ref&gt;her brother&lt;/ref&gt; She was 69 years old.

'''Dudley Tunnel''' is a [[canal]] [[tunnel]] on the [[Dudley Canal|Dudley Canal Line No 1]], [[England]]. At about {{convert|3172|yd|m|1}} long, it is now the second longest canal tunnel on the [[Canals of the United Kingdom|UK canal network]] today. ([[Standedge Tunnels|Standedge Tunnel]] is the longest, at {{convert|5456|yd|m|1}}, and the {{convert|3931|yd|m|1}} [[Thames and Medway Canal#Higham and Strood tunnel|Higham and Strood tunnel]] is now rail only). However, since the Dudley Tunnel is not continuous this status is sometimes questioned:{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} (the main tunnel is {{convert|2942|yd|m|1}}, Lord Ward's tunnel is {{convert|196|yd|m|1}} and Castle Mill basin is {{convert|34|yd|m|1}}).

In 1959 the [[British Transport Commission]] sought to close the tunnel but this led to an [[Inland Waterways Association]]-organised massed protest cruise in 1960. The tunnel was however closed in 1962; and was further threatened with permanent closure by [[British Railways]] who wished to replace a railway viaduct at the [[Tipton]] portal with an embankment and a [[culvert]].&lt;ref name=gittings&gt;Gittings, Derek A. (1973). "The Restoration". Chapter 3, in: ''TRAD 1973''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this never happened as the railway was closed in 1968 and the disused bridge demolished in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="dudleytunnel.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.dudleytunnel.co.uk/fifty_nine.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel was reopened in 1973, as a result of restoration, which had been a collaboration between local volunteers (originally the Dudley Canal Tunnel Preservation Society, later the Dudley Canal Trust), and the local authority, Dudley Borough Council. The opening ceremony was advertised as ''"TRAD 1973 - Tunnel Reopening at Dudley"''.&lt;ref name=gittings/&gt;

==Construction of the tunnel(s)==
{{Dudley Tunnel map}}
A private [[Act of Parliament]] to construct the tunnel and associated canal, later to be known as the Dudley Canal Line No. 1, was passed in 1776. However [[John Ward, 2nd Viscount Dudley and Ward|Lord Dudley and Ward]] started building a canal and tunnel, in 1775, to link his Tipton Colliery and his lime works to the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]], at [[Tipton]], on the 473&amp;nbsp;ft ''[[Wolverhampton Level]]''. The work was completed in 1778 and was known as Lord Ward's canal.&lt;ref name=MEB&gt;{{cite book |title=Dudley Canal Tunnel |year=1992 |publisher=Dudley Canal Trust |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later agreed to sell the canal and tunnel to the Dudley Canal Company. The Dudley Canal Line No. 1 and Dudley Tunnel were reported as finished on 25 June 1791.

The earliest part of tunnel system was built to help with the transport of [[limestone]] extracted from the [[Mining|mines]] inside [[Dudley Castle|Castle Hill]] through which the tunnel runs. This was Lord Ward's tunnel, which leads to Castle Mill Basin. From there the main tunnel runs, via the Cathedral Arch, to Parkhead, near [[Netherton, West Midlands|Netherton]]. At Cathedral Arch a branch canal led into the Little Tess Cavern mine workings. This route is now blocked, but has been by-passed by two new tunnels (see below). The southern end, including the southern portal, of the tunnel had to be rebuilt in 1884 due to subsidence caused by adjacent [[coal]] mines. This section of the tunnel was built several feet wider than the original tunnel bore. The southern portal bears a brick ''date stone'' of 1884.

Another {{convert|1227|yd|m|adj=on}} canal tunnel at Castle Mill Basin, now blocked off by a [[dam]], leads under [[Wren's Nest]] to two under ground basins, east basin and west basin, and was used to transport limestone from the underground mine workings. Surface quarries were also opened; they outlasted the underground workings and were last used in the early 1920s. The land above the underground workings, together with the surface quarries, became a [[National Nature Reserve]].

==Closure and re-opening==
By 1959, the tunnel was virtually disused, and [[British Waterways]] announced plans to officially close it. A number of protest groups organised cruises through the tunnel during 1960 in hope of it being kept open, but in 1962 the tunnel was finally closed. Its very existence was threatened the following year when the railway viaduct above it was found to be structurally unsafe; this was largely a goods line since the closure of passenger stations along it the previous year, but the railway authorities planned to preserve the railway line and wanted to replace the viaduct with an embankment. The plans involved sealing the tunnel off. 

However, the railway closed completely in 1968 and so the tunnel was saved. Following several years of preparation work, the tunnel was officially re-opened in 1973.&lt;ref name="dudleytunnel.co.uk"/&gt;

==Dudley Tunnel today==
In 1989 two completely new canal tunnels were made, linking Singing Cavern and the Rock Tunnel, via Little Tess Cavern, to Castle Mill Basin (the northern portal of the main tunnel).

The restrictive dimensions of the tunnel and the absence of a [[towpath]] mean that many boats are unable to pass through it. Those that can are not allowed to use [[diesel engine]]s due to the lack of ventilation in the tunnel.

Visitors may take a [[Lead-acid battery|battery]]-powered [[narrowboat]] trip operated by Dudley Canal Trust either through the tunnel or partway through the tunnel and the adjacent mines; and, also, try [[Legging (canals)|legging]] the boat.

The rock of Castle Hill into which the tunnel is dug, [[oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]], allows visitors to see [[trilobite]] [[fossil]]s preserved within it. Some fossils which were considered notable and were located close to the waterline, have been removed to prevent them from being eroded and attacked by visitors. Other parts of the tunnel pass through a [[dolerite]] known locally as [[Rowley Regis|Rowley]] Rag; and through [[Pennine Coal Measures Group|Coal Measures]] rocks.

The [[Netherton Tunnel Branch Canal|Netherton Tunnel]] follows a parallel route 1½ miles to the south east; it is much larger and has twin towpaths running through it. It was built to ease congestion in the Dudley Tunnel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18392">'''Ecclesiastical letters''' are publications or announcements of the organs of Roman Catholic ecclesiastical authority, e.g. the [[synod]]s, but more particularly of [[pope]] and [[bishop]]s, addressed to the faithful in the form of letters.

== Letters of the Popes in the period of the early church ==
The popes began early, by virtue of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff]], to issue [[canon law]]s as well for the entire Church as for individuals, in the form of letters which popes sent either of their own will or when application was made to them by synods, bishops or individual Christians.
 
Apart from the Epistles of the [[Apostle Peter]], the first example of this is the Letter of Pope [[Clement I]] (90-99?) to the Corinthians, in whose community there was grave dissension. Only a few papal letters of the first three Christian centuries have been preserved in whole or part, or are known from the works of ecclesiastical writers. Among them are Adversus Aleatores by [[Pope Victor I]], some fragments of a letter by [[Pope Stephen I]], three letters by [[Pope Cornelius]], and one by [[Pope Dionysius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyandapologetics.com/p/ancient-papal-documents.html Ancient Papal Documents]&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the Church was recognized by the (Roman) State and could freely spread in all directions, the papal primacy of necessity began to develop, and from this time on the number of papal letters increased.
 
No part of the Church and no question of faith or morals failed to attract the papal attention. The popes called these letters with reference to their legal character, ''decreta, statuta, decretalia constituta'', even when the letters were often hortatory in form. Thus [[Siricius]], in his letter of the year 385 to [[Himerius of Tarragona]], a Greek Sophist, Rhetorician and [[archbishop of Tarragona]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum" (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1885-88), I, no. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Or the letters were called sententiæ, i. e. opinions;&lt;ref&gt;Syn. Tur., II, an. 567, c. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; præcepta;&lt;ref&gt;Syn. Bracar., I, an. 561, præf.&lt;/ref&gt; auctoritates.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, an. 417; Jaffé, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, more general letters, especially those of dogmatic importance, were also called at times ''tomi; indiculi; commonitoria; epistolae tractoriae'', or simply ''tractatoriae''.
 
If the matter were important, the popes issued the letters not by their sole authority, but with the advice of the Roman presbytery or of a synod. Consequently, such letters were also called ''epistolae synodiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Syn. Tolet., III, an. 589, c. i.&lt;/ref&gt; By ''epistola synodica'' was also understood in Christian antiquity the letter of the newly elected bishop or pope by which he notified the other bishops of his elevation and of his agreement with them in the Faith. Thus an epistola of this kind had a certain relationship to the ''litterae formatae'' by which a bishop certified, for presentation to another bishop, to the orthodoxy and unblemished moral character of an ecclesiastic of his diocese. Closely related to the litterae formatae are the ''litterae dimissoriae'' (dimissorials) by which a bishop sends a candidate for ordination to another bishop to be ordained.
 
While these names indicate sufficiently the legal character of the papal letters, it is to be noted that the popes repeatedly demanded in explicit terms the observance of their decrees; thus Siricius, in his letter of the year 385 to Himerius,&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Innocent I]] in his letter of the year 416 addressed to Decentius, [[Bishop of Gubbio]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same manner they repeatedly required from the persons to whom they wrote that these should bring the letter in question to the notice of others. Thus again Siricius, in his letter to Himerius;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 255&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope Zosimus]], in the year 418 to Hesychius of [[Sabona]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In order to secure such knowledge of the papal laws, several copies of the papal letters were occasionally made and dispatched at the same time. In this way arose the letters a pari: ''a paribus uniformes, ta isa''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, nos. 331, 334, 373.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following the example of the Roman emperors, the popes soon established [[archives]] (''scrinium'') in which copies of their letters were placed as memorials for further use, and as proofs of authenticity. The first mention of papal archives is found in the Acts of a synod held about 370 under Pope [[Damasus I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Coustant]], "Epistolæ Romanorum Pontificum", Paris, 1721, 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Zosimus also makes mention in 419 of the archives.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, forged papal letters appeared even earlier than this. But by far the greater number of the papal letters of the first millennium have been lost; only the letters of [[Pope Leo I]], edited by the [[Ballerini brothers]], the "Registrum Epistolarum" of [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]], edited by Ewald and Hartmann, and the "Registrum Epistolarum" of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], edited by Jaffé, have been more or less completely preserved.
 
As befitted their legal importance, the papal letters were also soon incorporated in the collections of [[canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Maassen]], "Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des kanonischen Rechts im Abendlande bis zum Ausgang des Mittelalters", Graz, 1870, 231 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; The first to collect the epistles of the popes in a systematic and comprehensive manner was the monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]], at the beginning of the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;Maassen, "Geschichte der Quellen", 422 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the papal letters took rank with the [[Canon law|canons]] of the synods as of equal value and of equal obligation. The example of Dionysius was followed afterwards by almost all compilers of the canons, [[Pseudo-Isidore]] and the Gregorian canonists, e.g. [[Anselm of Lucca]], [[Deusdedit of San Pietro in Vincoli|Deusdedit]] etc.

== Letters of the medieval Popes ==
With the development of the [[papal primacy]] in the Middle Ages the papal letters grew enormously in number. The popes, following the earlier custom, insisted that their [[rescript]]s, issued for individual cases, should be observed in all analogous ones. According to the teaching of the canonists, above all of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], every papal letter of general character was authoritative for the entire Church without further notification.
 
The names of the letters of general authority were very varied: constitutio(n);&lt;ref&gt;c. vi, X, De elect., I, vi.&lt;/ref&gt; edict(um);&lt;ref&gt;c. unic., in VIto, De postul., I, v.&lt;/ref&gt; statutum;&lt;ref&gt;c. xv, X, De sent. excomm., V, xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; decretum;&lt;ref&gt;c. i, in VIto, De præb., III, iv.&lt;/ref&gt; decretalis;&lt;ref&gt;c. xxix, in VIto, De elect., I, vi.&lt;/ref&gt; sanctio.&lt;ref&gt;c. unic., in VIto, De cler. ægrot., III, v.&lt;/ref&gt; Decrees (decreta) was the name given especially to general ordinances issued with the advice of the cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;Schulte, "Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des kanonischen Rechtes", Stuttgart, 1876, I, 252 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ordinances issued for individual cases were called [[rescript]]a, responsa, mandata. Thus a [[Papal Constitutions|(papal) constitution]] was always understood to be a papal ordinance which regulated ecclesiastical conditions of a general character judicially, in a durable manner and form, for all time; but by a rescript was understood a papal ordinance issued at the petition of an individual that decided a lawsuit or granted a favour. Compare the Bulls of promulgation prefixed to the "Decretals" of [[Gregory IX]], the "Liber Sextus" of [[Boniface VIII]] and the "[[Clementinæ]]"; also the titles, "De constitutionibus" and "De rescriptis" in the "Corpus Juris Canonici". Notwithstanding all this, usage remained uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;c. xiv, in VIto, De præb., III, iv.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The above-mentioned distinctions between papal documents were based on the extent of their authority. Other names again had their origin in the form of the papal documents. It is true they all had more or less evidently the form of letters. But essential differences appeared, especially in regard to the literary form (''stylus'') of the document and the method of [[Seal (emblem)|sealing]], these depending in each case on the importance of the contents of the respective document. It was merely the difference in the manner of sealing that led to the distinction between Bulls and Briefs. For [[Papal Bull]]s, legal instruments almost entirely for important matters, the seal was stamped in wax or lead, seldom in gold, enclosed in a case, and fastened to the document by a cord. For Briefs, instruments used as a rule in matters of less importance, the seal was stamped upon the document in wax. Curial letters (''litterae curiales'' or ''litterae de curia'') denoted particularly letters of the popes in political affairs.
 
During the Middle Ages, just as in the early Church, the letters of the popes were deposited in the papal archives either in the original or by copy. They are still in existence, and almost complete in number, from the time of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198–1216). Many papal letters were also incorporated, as their legal nature required, in the "Corpus Juris Canonici". Others are to be found in the [[Formulary (model documents)|formularies]], many of which appeared unofficially in the Middle Ages, similar in kind to the ancient official ''[[Liber Diurnus]]'' of the papal chancery in use as late as the time of Gregory VII. The papal letters were forwarded by the papal officials, above all by the [[Apostolic Chancery]], for whose use the chancery rules, ''regulae cancellariae Apostolicae'', were drawn up with regard to the execution and dispatch of the papal letters, dating back to the twelfth century. Nevertheless, the forging of papal letters was even more frequent in the Middle Ages than in the early Church. Innocent III&lt;ref&gt;in c. v, X, De crimine falsi, V, xx.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to no less than nine methods of falsification. From the thirteenth century on to  January, 1909 it sufficed, in order to give a papal document legal force, to post it up at Rome on the doors of St. Peter's, of the [[Lateran]], the [[Apostolic Chancery]] and in the Piazza del Campo di Fiori, but since they acquired force only by publication in the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]].

== Letters of the Popes in modern times ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
In the modern period also, papal letters have been constantly issued, but they proceed from the popes themselves less frequently than in the Middle Ages and Christian antiquity; most of them are issued by the papal officials, of whom there is a greater number than in the Middle Ages, and to whom have been granted large delegated powers, which include the issuing of letters. Following the example of [[Paul III]], [[Pius IV]] and [[Pius V]], [[Sixtus V]] by the [[Papal Bull]] "Immensa aeterni" of 22 January 1587, added to the already existing bodies of papal officials a number of congregations of cardinals with clearly defined powers of administration and jurisdiction. Succeeding popes added other congregations.
 
[[Pius X]] in the Constitution "Sapienti consilio" of 29 June 1908, reorganized the papal Curia, papal writings being divided into (Apostolic) Constitutions, (papal) Rescripts, (Papal) Bulls, (Papal) Briefs and Apostolic Letters (''Litterae Apostolicae'').
# The Litterae Apostolicae are further divided into Litterae Apostolicae simplices or Brevetti, Chirographa, Encyclicae (Encyclicals) and Motus Proprii. By Litterae ''Apostolicae simplices'' are understood all documents drawn up by virtue of papal authorization, and signed with the pope's name but not by the pope personally. Documents signed by the pope personally are called ''Chirographa''. [[Encyclical]]s are letters of a more hortatory nature, addressed to all or to a majority of the higher officials of the Church. A [[Motu Proprio]] is a document prepared at the personal initiative of the pope, without previous petition to him, and issued with a partial avoidance of the otherwise customary forms of the chancery.
# By Constitution is understood, as in the Middle Ages, a papal document of general authority; by Rescript, a similar document applicable to an individual case.
# Bulls and Briefs are distinguished from each other by characteristics of form which have always remained essentially the same.
 
The papal documents are still deposited in the Roman archives. There are no official collections of them corresponding to the medieval "Corpus Juris Canonici". The last(?) official collection is that of the Constitutions of [[Benedict XIV]] (1740–1758). From the sixteenth century, on the other hand, private collections have appeared, some of which are called ''[[bullaria]]'', from the more important part of their contents. Many papal letters are also found in the collections of the Acts of the Councils. The documents issued by the officials of the Curia and the Congregations of Cardinals contain either resolutions (decisions) for individual cases, or declarations (extensivae or comprehensivae) interpreting laws, or decrees, which are entirely new laws. Some congregations of cardinals have issued official collections of their decisions.

== Collections of the letters of the Popes and of the Roman officials ==
Coustant, "Epistolæ Romanorum Pontificum et quæ ad eos scriptæ sunt a S. Clemente I usque ad Innocentium III" (Paris, 1721), goes to only 440; Schönemann, "Pontificum Romanorum a Clemente I usque ad Leonem M. genuinæ ... epistolæ" (Göttingen, 1796); Thiel, "Epistolæ Romanorum Pontificum genuinæ ... a S. Hilaro usque ad Pelagium II" (Brunsberg, 1868).

From 1881 the École Française of Rome has published, with particular reference to France, the "Registra" of Gregory IX, Innocent IV, Alexander IV, Urban IV, Clement IV, Gregory X, John XXI, Nicholas III, Martin IV, Honorius IV, Nicholas IV, Boniface VIII, and Benedict XI. The "Registra" of the Avignon popes are also in course of publication. Cf. "Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire", XXV, 443 sqq.; [[Joseph Hergenröther]], "Leonis X Pontificis Maximi Regesta" (Freiburg, 1884-); "Regesta Clementis Papæ V cura et studio monachorum ordinis S. Benedicti" (Rome, 1885-); [[Pressuti]], "Registrum Honorii III" (Rome, 1888-).

There are innumerable collections of papal letters issued from a partisan point of view. All known papal letters up to 1198 are enumerated by [[Philipp Jaffé|Jaffé]] in the "Regesta Rom. Pont." The papal letters of 1198-1304 are found in [[August Potthast]], ''Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab anno 1198 ad annum 1304'' (Berlin, 1874).

[[Paul Kehr]] prepared a critical edition of all papal letters up to Innocent III. See the "Nachrichten", of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, 1896, 72 sqq.; "Pii IX acta" (Rome, 1854-); "Leonis XIII acta" (Rome, 1881); "Pii X acta" (Rome, 1907). For the Bullaria, see Tomasetti, "Bullarum, diplomatum et privilegiorum s. Romanorum Pontificum Taurinensis editio locupletissima" (Turin, 1857-); for collections of the Acts of the Councils, Mansi, "Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio" (Florence and Venice, 1759), goes to 1439. It is continued by "Collectio conciliorum recentioris ecclesiæ universæ", ed. Martin and Petit (Paris, 1905); "Decreta authentica S. Congregationis Indulgentiarum edita jussu et auctoritate Leonis XIII" (Ratisbon, 1883); "Jus Pontificium de Propaganda Fide Leonis XIII jussu recognitum" (Rome, 1888); "Decreta authentica Congregationis S. Rituum ... promulgata sub auspiciis Leonis XIII" (Rome, 1898).

The above-mentioned ''Sapienti Consilio'' of [[Pope Pius X]] decreed, that ''all'' papal laws were to be promulgated through publication in an official bulletin called the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]], the first issues of which, at intervals of about twice a month, appeared in 1909. From 1865 to 1908, papal documents had been published in a similar series under the title [[Acta Sanctae Sedis]], which was declared official in 1904. Before 1865, papal documents were not systematically published in documentary fashion and were promulgated by other means such as being affixed to the doors of basilicas in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Edictrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 1821&lt;/ref&gt;

== Letters of bishops ==
Just as the popes rule the Church largely by means of letters, so also the bishops make use of letters for the administration of their dioceses. The documents issued by a bishop are divided according to their form into pastoral letters, synodal and diocesan statutes, mandates or ordinances or decrees, the classification depending upon whether they have been drawn up more as letters, or have been issued by a synod or the diocesan chancery.
 
The pastoral letters are addressed either to all the members of the diocese (''litterae pastorales'') or only to the clergy, in this case generally in Latin (''litterae encyclicae''). The mandates, decrees or ordinances are issued either by the bishop himself or by one of his officials.
 
The synodal statutes are ordinances issued by the bishop at the diocesan synod, with the advice, but in no way with the legislative co-operation, of the diocesan clergy. The diocesan statutes, regularly speaking, are those episcopal ordinances which, because they refer to more weighty matters, are prepared with the obligatory or facultative co-operation of the [[cathedral chapter]].
 
In order to have legal force the episcopal documents must be published in a suitable manner and according to usage. Civil laws by which episcopal and also papal documents have to receive the approval of the State before they can be published are irrational and out of date according to the [[First Vatican Council]] (Sess. III, De eccles., c. iii). (See [[Exequatur]].)

[[File:Conger conger Gervais.jpg|thumb|253px|The [[European conger]] is the heaviest of all eels.]]

An '''eel''' is an aquatic animal belonging to the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Anguilliformes''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ŋ|ˌ|ɡ|w|ɪ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|f|ɔːr|m|iː|z}}), which consists of four suborders, 20 [[Family (biology)|families]], 111 [[genus|genera]] and about 800 [[species]]. Eels undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage, and most are [[predator]]s. The term “eel” originally referred to the [[European eel]], and the name of the genus means “European-eel-shaped.”

The term “eel” is also used for some other eel-shaped fish, such as [[electric eel]]s (genus ''Electrophorus''), [[spiny eel]]s (family Mastacembelidae), and [[deep-sea spiny eel]]s (family Notacanthidae). These other [[clade]]s, however, evolved their eellike shapes independently from the true eels.

==Description==
Eels are elongated fish, ranging in length from {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on}} in the one-jawed eel (''[[Monognathus]] ahlstromi'') to {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} in the [[slender giant moray]].&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N. |author= McCosker, John F. |year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 86–90|isbn = 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults range in weight from {{convert|30|g|abbr=on}} to well over {{convert|25|kg|abbr=on}}. They possess no [[pelvic fin]]s, and many species also lack [[pectoral fin]]s.

Most eels live in the shallow waters of the [[ocean]] and burrow into sand, mud, or amongst rocks.  A majority of eel species are nocturnal, thus are rarely seen.  Sometimes, they are seen living together in holes, or "eel pits". Some species of eels also live in deeper water on the continental shelves and over the slopes deep as {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}}. Only members of the [[Anguilla (genus)|''Anguilla'']] regularly inhabit fresh water, but they, too, return to the sea to breed.&lt;ref name=EoG&gt;{{cite book |author= Prosek, James |year=2010|title=Eels: An Exploration|publisher= HarperCollins |location=New York|isbn = 978-0-06-056611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heaviest true eel is the [[European conger]]. The maximum size of this species has been reported as reaching a length of 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) and a weight of 110&amp;nbsp;kg (240&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/summary/speciessummary.php?id=301 Conger conger, European conger: fisheries, gamefish, aquarium]. Fishbase.org&lt;/ref&gt; Other eels are longer, but do not weigh as much, such as the [[slender giant moray]] which reaches 4&amp;nbsp;m (13&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fishbase.mnhn.fr/Summary/speciesSummary.php?ID=8595&amp;genusname=Strophidon&amp;speciesname=sathete&amp;lang=French FishBase] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110144455/http://fishbase.mnhn.fr/Summary/speciesSummary.php?ID=8595&amp;genusname=Strophidon&amp;speciesname=sathete&amp;lang=French |date=10 November 2013 }}.

==Life cycle==
{{main|Eel life history}}

Eels begin life as flat and transparent [[larvae]], called [[leptocephali]]. Eel larvae drift in the surface waters of the sea, feeding on [[marine snow]], small particles that float in the water.  Eel larvae then metamorphose into glass eels and then become elvers before finally seeking out their juvenile and adult habitats.&lt;ref name= EoF/&gt; Many eels remain in the sea throughout their lives, but freshwater elvers of eels in the family anguillidae travel upstream and are forced to climb up obstructions, such as weirs, dam walls, and natural waterfalls.

[[Gertrude Elizabeth Blood|Lady Colin Campbell]] found, at [[Ballisodare]], the eel fisheries were greatly improved by the hanging of loosely plaited grass ladders over barriers, enabling the elvers to ascend.&lt;ref name=Blood_RunningBrook&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Lady Colin|title=A Book of the Running Brook: and of Still Waters|year=1886|publisher=O.

==Classification==
This classification follows [[FishBase]] in dividing the eels into 20 families. Additional families included in other classifications (notably [[ITIS]] and [[Systema Naturae 2000]]) are noted below the family with which they are synomized in the Fish Base system.

Identifying the origin of the freshwater species has been problematic. Genomic studies indicate they are a [[monophyletic]] group which originated among the deep-sea eels.&lt;ref name="Inoue2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Inoue |first=Jun G. |year=2010 |title=Deep-ocean origin of the freshwater eels |journal=[[Biology Letters|Biol.

In some classifications, the family [[Cyematidae]] of [[bobtail snipe eel]]s is included in the Anguilliformes, but in the FishBase system that family is included in the order [[Saccopharyngiformes]].

The [[electric eel]] of South America is not a true eel, but is a [[Gymnotiformes|South American knifefish]] more closely related to the [[carp]]s and [[siluriformes|catfishes]].

Freshwater eels (''[[unagi]]'') and marine eels ([[conger eel]], ''[[anago fish|anago]]'') are commonly used in [[Japanese cuisine]]; foods such as [[Unadon|''unadon'' and ''unajū'']] are popular, but expensive.  Eels are also very popular in [[Chinese cuisine]], and are prepared in many different ways. [[Hong Kong]] eel prices have often reached 1000 [[HKD]] (128.86 US Dollars) per kg, and once exceeded 5000 HKD per kg. The [[European eel]] and other freshwater eels are eaten in [[Europe]], the [[United States]], and other places. A traditional east London food is [[jellied eels]], although the demand has significantly declined since World War II. The [[Spanish cuisine|Northern Spanish]] delicacy ''angulas'' consists of elver (young eels) [[sautéing|sautéed]] in [[olive oil]] with [[garlic]]; elvers usually reach prices of up to 1000 [[euro]] per kg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buber.net/Basque/Food/food1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[New Zealand longfin eel]] is a traditional [[Māori people|Māori]] food in [[New Zealand]]. In [[Italian cuisine]], eels from the [[Valli di Comacchio]], a swampy zone along the [[Adriatic]] coast, are especially prized, along with freshwater eels of [[Bolsena Lake]] and pond eels from [[Cabras, Sardinia]]. In northern [[Germany]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]], smoked eel is considered a [[delicacy]].

Elvers, often fried, used to be a cheap dish in the [[United Kingdom]]; but, during the 1990s, their numbers collapsed across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Champken | first = Neil | date = 2 June 2006 | title = Would you pay £600 for a handful of baby eels? | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/jun/02/foodanddrink.features11 | website = theguardian.com | accessdate = 7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now not just a delicacy, but the UK's most expensive species.&lt;ref name = "STimes edict"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Leake | first = Jonathan | date = 7 February 2015 | title = EU's eel edict costs UK £100m | url = http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1516718.ece | newspaper = The Sunday Times | accessdate = 7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==

The large lake of [[Almere (lake)|Almere]], which existed in the early Medieval [[Netherlands]], got its names from the eels which lived in its water (the Dutch word for eel is aal or ael, so: "ael mere" = "eel lake"). The name is preserved in the new city of [[Almere]] in [[Flevoland]], given in 1984 in memory of this body of water on whose site the town is located.

The daylight passage in the spring of [[Elvers]] upstream along the [[Thames]] was at one time called "eel fare". The word 'elver' is thought to be a corruption of "eel fare."&lt;ref name=Blood_RunningBrook /&gt;

A famous attraction on the [[French Polynesia]]n island of [[Huahine]] (part of the [[Society Islands]]) is the bridge across a stream hosting 3- to 6-ft-long eels, deemed sacred by local culture.

Eel fishing in [[Nazi]]-time [[Danzig]] plays an important role in [[Günter Grass]]' novel ''[[The Tin Drum]]''. The cruelty of humans to eels is used as a metaphor for Nazi atrocities, and the sight of eels being killed by a fisherman triggers the madness of the protagonist's mother.

Sinister implications of eels fishing are also referenced in [[Jo Nesbø]]'s ''[[The Cockroaches (novel)|The Cockroaches]]'', the second book of the [[Harry Hole]] detective series. The book's background includes a Norwegian village where eels in the nearby sea are rumored to feed on the corpses of drowned humans – making the eating of these eels verge on cannibalism.

In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the [[European eel]], [[Japanese eel]], and [[American eel]] to its seafood red list.&lt;!-- "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries." --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/which-fish-can-I-eat/red-list-of-species/|title=Greenpeace Seafood Red list|work=Greenpeace International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan consumes more than 70% of the global eel catch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/07/29/national/indonesia-eel-hot-item-for-smugglers/#.Ufcwixb1s08|title=Indonesia eel hot item for smugglers|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English name "eel" descends from [[Old English]] ''ǣl'', [[Common Germanic]] ''*ēlaz''. Also from the common Germanic are [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''iel'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''aal'', [[German language|German]] ''Aal'', and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''áll''. Katz (1998) identifies a number of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] cognates, among them the second part of the Latin word for eels, ''[[Anguilla (genus)|anguilla]]'', attested in its simplex form ''illa'' (in a glossary only), and the Greek word for "eel", ''egkhelys'' (the second part of which is attested in [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] as ''elyes'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Katz |chapter=How to be a Dragon in Indo-European: Hittite illuyankas and its Linguistic and Cultural Congeners in Latin, Greek, and Germanic |title=Mír Curad. Studies in Honor of Calvert Watkins |editor1-last=Jasanoff |editor2-last=Melchert |editor3-last=Oliver |location=Innsbruck |publisher= |year=1998 |pages=317–334 |isbn=3-85124-667-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first compound member, ''anguis'' ("snake"), is cognate to other Indo-European words for "snake" (compare Old Irish ''escung'' "eel", Old High German ''unc'' "snake", Lithuanian ''angìs'', Greek ''ophis, okhis'', [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''[[vrtra|áhi]]'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''aži'', Armenian ''auj, iž'', [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''*ǫžь'', all from Proto-Indo-European ''*og&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;is, ēg&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;is'').The word also appears in the Old English word for "hedgehog," which is ''igil'' (meaning "snake eater"), and perhaps in the ''egi-'' of Old High German ''egidehsa'' "wall lizard".

According to this theory, the name [[Bellerophon]] (Βελλεροφόντης, attested in a variant Ἐλλεροφόντης in [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]]),  is also related, translating to "the slayer of the serpent" (''[[ahihán]]''). On this theory, the ελλερο- is an adjective form of an older word, ελλυ, meaning "snake", which is directly comparable to Hittite ''ellu-essar-'' "snake pit". This myth likely came to Greece via Anatolia. In the Hittite version of the myth, the dragon is called ''[[Illuyanka]]'': the ''illuy-'' part is cognate to the word ''illa'', and the ''-anka'' part is cognate to ''angu'', a word for "snake". Since the words for "snake" (and similarly shaped animals) are often subject to taboo in many Indo-European (and non-Indo-European) languages, no unambiguous Proto-Indo-European form of the word for eel can be reconstructed. It may have been ''*ēl(l)-u-'', ''*ēl(l)-o-'', or something similar.

The book also contains many letters from the [[correspondence of Charles Darwin]], Emma's husband.  It is therefore a very early example of a [[Darwin Industry]] book, along with ''[[The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin]]'' which was edited by Charles's son (and Etty's brother) [[Sir Francis Darwin]], and ''[[More Letters of Charles Darwin]]'' edited by Frank and [[A. C. Seward]].

The book was dedicated by Etty to her niece, Emma's granddaughter, [[Frances Cornford]].

''[[The Times]]'' described it as "an admirable piece of work, in which the editor, while largely effacing herself, yet gave a notable picture of an interesting family life".&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, December 24, 1927; pg. 10; Issue 44773; col B&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was reviewed in ''[[The Eugenics Review]]'' by [[A. C. Seward]] who concluded that the book "bring[s] to us into the closest touch with wise and attractive personalities and at the same time they record facts of great scientific interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=2987148 | page=300 | volume=7 | issue=4 | journal=The Eugenics Review | title=Emma Darwin: a century of family letters, 1792-1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[R. B. Freeman]]'s Charles Darwin bibliography, he noted that the publication "contains a large number of letters from Charles and is an important source of information about his day to day and family life".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_EmmaDarwin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1915 edition also contains a brief biography of [[Erasmus Darwin IV]], Emma's grandson who had been recently killed in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Emma Darwin: A Century of Family Letters, 1792–1896|chapter=Erasmus Darwin (1881–1915)|year=1915|volume=vol. 2|pages=i–vi|chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015082577738;view=1up;seq=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''''Extra Dimension v Kruger''''', an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], the second applicant was employed by Kogiso Khulani Supervision Services (KKS). During March 2000, he wished to [[Resignation|resign]] when it came to his attention that there were allegations of [[fraud]] against him. He withheld his resignation and resigned only in August 2001.

During May 2002, he bought the membership interest in Extra Dimensions, after which he was requested by the investigating officer to go to him so that a warning statement could be taken from him, but his [[Lawyer|attorney]] told him that there was no need.

The second applicant's [[Lawyer|attorney]] thereafter telephoned the regional [[prosecutor]]. She was also of the opinion that there was not sufficient evidence to initiate a criminal prosecution. She said that she would withdraw the charges and send a motivated memorandum to the DPP.

While she was under the impression that certain documentation had to be obtained, the second respondent's officials got hold of the docket and obtained a [[search warrant]].

On June 18, 2002, members of the second respondent and the third respondent seized certain items on the second applicant's premises in terms of the warrant, annexure to the papers. This happened in the absence of the second applicant, who became aware of the seizure at 15:00 the same day, when he arrived at his premises.

The [[court]] held that a warrant authorizing private individuals to search premises is clearly ultra vires sections 20 and 21 of the CPA, as warrants must be executed by police officials.

'''''F for Fake''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Vérités et mensonges}}, "Truths and lies") is a 1973 [[docudrama]] film co-written, directed by, and starring [[Orson Welles]] who worked on the film alongside [[François Reichenbach]], [[Oja Kodar]], and [[Gary Graver]]. Initially released in 1974, it focuses on [[Elmyr de Hory]]'s recounting of his career as a professional [[art forger]]; de Hory's story serves as the backdrop for a fast-paced, meandering investigation of the natures of [[authorship]] and [[Authentication|authenticity]], as well as the basis of the value of art. Loosely a documentary, the film operates in several different genres and has been described as a kind of [[Essay#Film|film essay]].

Far from serving as a traditional documentary on Elmyr de Hory, the film also incorporates Welles's companion [[Oja Kodar]], notorious "hoax-biographer" [[Clifford Irving]], and Orson Welles as himself.

In addition to the 88-minute film, in 1976 Welles also shot and edited a self-contained 9-minute short film as a "trailer", almost entirely composed of original material not found in the main film itself.

== Background ==
Orson Welles was hired to edit a documentary by François Reichenbach about the art forger Elmyr de Hory.  The film grew over time to encompass de Hory, as well as de Hory's biographer Clifford Irving, who was revealed to be a forger himself.  Welles used these circumstances to produce a meditation on the nature of fakery.  

Several storylines are presented in the film, including those of de Hory, Irving, Welles, Howard Hughes and Kodar.  About de Hory, we learn that he was a struggling artist who turned to forgery out of desperation, only to see the greater share of the profits from his deceptions go to doubly unscrupulous art dealers. As partial compensation for that injustice, he is maintained in a villa in Ibiza by one of his dealers. What is only hinted at in Welles's documentary is that de Hory had recently served a two-month sentence in a Spanish prison for [[homosexuality]] and consorting with criminals. (De Hory would commit [[suicide]] two years after the initial release of Welles' film, on hearing that Spain had agreed to turn him over to the French authorities.)

Irving's original part in ''F for Fake'' was as de Hory's biographer, but his part grew unexpectedly at some point during production. There has not always been agreement among commentators over just how that production unfolded, but the now-accepted story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewag.net/film/f_for_fake.html| title=Hanky-Panky Men: Orson Welles' F for Fake| author=Childers, Doug| date=21 June 2005| accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the director François Reichenbach shot a documentary about de Hory and Irving before giving his footage to Welles, who then shot additional footage with Reichenbach as his cinematographer.

In the time between the shooting of Reichenbach's documentary and the finishing of Welles', it became known that Irving had perpetrated a hoax of his own, namely a [[Clifford Irving#Fake autobiography of Howard Hughes|fabricated "authorized biography"]] of [[Howard Hughes]] (the hoax was later fictionalized in ''[[The Hoax]]''). This discovery prompted the shooting of still more footage, which then got woven into ''F for Fake''. Interweaving the narratives even more, there are several pieces of footage in the film showing Welles at a party with De Hory, and, at one point, De Hory even signs a painting with a forgery of Welles' signature. Some of Hughes' career is outlined in the form of a parody of the "News on the March" sequence in ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Welles also draws parallels between the De Hory and Irving hoaxes and his own brush with early notoriety by including a recreation of part of his 1938 ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|War of the Worlds]]'' radio drama, which had simulated a newscast about a Martian invasion and sparked panic among some listeners.

The story about Kodar, her grandfather, and Picasso and some forger paintings that the grandfather supposedly made is presented at the end of the film before Welles reminds the viewer that he only promised to tell the truth for an hour and that "for the last 17 minutes, I've been lying my head off."  In the commentary to the Criterion Collection DVD release of ''F for Fake'', Kodar claims the idea for this segment as her own. She also claims credit for the movie's opening sequence, which consists of shots of a miniskirt-clad Kodar walking down streets while rubbernecking male admirers (unaware that they are being filmed) stop and openly stare. This sequence is described by Kodar as inspired by her feminism; in his narration, Welles claims the footage was originally shot for an unrelated production.

== Plot ==
The film opens with Welles performing magic tricks for some children while Kodar watches nearby.  Welles quotes [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]] to the effect that a magician is just an actor.  Welles promises that for the next hour everything in the film will be based on solid fact.  Kodar is then shown strolling around a street in a miniskirt while being ogled by the men on the street.  Welles reveals the footage is taken from another experiment about girl-watching, where Kodar deliberately drew attention to herself and the men were unaware they were being filmed.  Welles says her story will continue later in the film, and then narrates the story of Elmyr de Hory, an art forger who sold many fake paintings to museums and collectors all over the world.  Elmyr is shown throwing a dinner party at his home in [[Ibiza]] and being feted by European society, although he dances around the question of whether he is guilty or not.  One of those filmed is [[Clifford Irving]], who had published a biography of Elmyr called ''Fake'', and later in a notorious scandal was revealed to have been the forger of Howard Hughes's diary.  Welles discusses the irony of Irving commenting on Elmyr's forgery while having committed a version of it himself.  Irving and Elmyr tell about the art dealers who were fooled by the forgeries, and Welles considers the question whether this means art dealers and appraisers are fake also.  

Welles presents more of Irving's story of having had secret contact with Hughes, and the odd stories of Hughes's behavior that may or may not have been true.  He wonders if believing such stories makes a person credulous or not, and questions the true wisdom of so-called experts, who verified Irving's forgery as authentic.  Reichenbach is shown telling how Elmyr provided him with several paintings of questionable authenticity, but the art dealers he gave them to were willfully blind to it.  Welles notes that Elmyr doesn't even own the house he lives in; it's provided for him by an art dealer.  Welles recounts his own past use of fakery: how he got a job in Ireland by falsely claiming to be a famous New York actor, and how his broadcast of [[War of the Worlds]] made deliberate use of fake news to enhance the story.  He also notes the coincidence that his first film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' was originally going to be a fictionalized version of Howard Hughes.

Irving describes how Elmyr was nearly destitute when younger and subsisted in America by making and selling forgeries that were indistinguishable from the real works, while remaining one step ahead of the law through frequent relocations.  He finally moved to Ibiza, but was not prosecuted for lack of witnesses to the actual forging, as well as the scandal that might be aroused by revealing the depth of the art market's complicity in the deception.  Elmyr insists he never signed any forgery, and Welles wonders whether, given the fact that all art eventually falls away to ruin, a signature truly matters to any art work. He illustrates the point by shots of the cathedral of [[Chartres]], pointing out that the names of the men who created the magnificent building and the sculptures which adorn it are unknown. They did not sign their work, but it has endured.

Welles finally presents Kodar's story: she holidayed in the same village as Picasso, who noticed her and painted 22 pieces with her as the model.  She insisted she be allowed to keep the paintings, but later when Picasso read about an acclaimed exhibit of 22 new pieces of his, he flew there in a rage, only to discover the pieces were all forgeries.  Kodar took Picasso to her grandfather, the forger, who defended his work with pride while Picasso angrily demanded the paintings back.  This dialogue is presented by Welles and Kodar re-enacting the parts of the grandfather and Picasso respectively.  Welles then confesses that he had promised everything in the "next hour" was true, and that hour had already passed.  He admits the entire story of Kodar, her grandfather, and Picasso was made up.  He apologizes, quotes Picasso's statement that art is a lie that makes us see the truth, and bids the audience good night.

== Trailer ==
''F for Fake'' was not released in the USA until 1976. When it finally came out, Welles produced a preview "trailer" for it, which was effectively a wholly original 9-minute film, shot and edited in a similar style to the film itself. Apart from some very brief split-second camera shots, the entire film is a self-contained short containing original material starring Welles, [[Gary Graver]] and [[Oja Kodar]]. The trailer has subsequently been restored in colour, and is included as an extra on some DVD versions of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Graver]] and Andrew J. Rausch, ''Making Movies With Orson Welles: A Memoir'' (Scarecrow Press, New York, 2008) p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''F for Fake'' faced widespread popular rejection. Critical reaction ranged from praise to confusion and hostility, with many finding the work to be self-indulgent and/or incoherent. ''F for Fake'' has grown somewhat in stature over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2596622281/orson-welles-s-complicitous-critique-postmodern| title=Orson Welles's: "Complicitous Critique: Postmodern Paradox in ''F for Fake'' | last=Jackson |first= Ayres| accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that the film embraces everything from self-conscious notation of the film process to ironic employment of 1950s-era [[B movie]] footage (''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]''), Welles thought he was creating not so much a documentary as a "new kind of film," as he once told writer [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]].&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/364| title=Orson Welles's Purloined Letter: ''F For Fake''| last=Rosenbaum |first= Jonathan| date=25 April 2005| accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''F for Fake'' is now sometimes referred to as a "[[Essay#Film|film essay]]." It currently holds an 88% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 49 critics.

{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
According to some reviews, the ''F for Fake'' [[mashup (video)|mash-up]] has possibly paved the way for the modern "attention-deficit" style of [[film editing|editing]].&lt;ref name="Bromley, Patrick"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/fforfake.php| title=Review of ''F For Fake'': Criterion Collection| author=Bromley, Patrick| date=6 June 2005| work=DVD Verdict| accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More likely, Welles was influenced by those that came before, such as the [[French New Wave]] director [[Jean Luc Godard]] and [[Dadaist]] filmmakers like [[René Clair]] who used editing to alternately build and deconstruct. What is unique to the film is the concept of the [[unreliable narrator]] — a key subject of the film itself, which at many points shows Welles sitting at an editing controller, as he narrates and draws self-reflexive attention to the problems with veracity in life and filmmaking.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"/&gt; Several filmmakers contributed to the forgery that is ''F for Fake'' including B-movie cinematographer [[Gary Graver]] (who contributes all footage filmed in the U.S., as well as some very choppy editing, and his own voice/image as the dubious on-screen "newscaster") as well as Welles' girlfriend and muse, [[Oja Kodar]] (who at one point appears in a series of butt shots as she is ogled both by Welles' camera and by stock footage of males who "see" her). It is in fact a trick of editing and/or creative geography and Welles' first lie in the film, or is it? Who directed these shots? Kodar claims she did. It is unclear where Welles' participation stops and his lesser-known collaborators begins, as the film employs multiple editors, multiple directors, multiple cross cuttings of unrelated footage and the often erratic use of [[creative geography]] as well as multiple voice overs. An example of this appears with a series of near wordless shots of Irving and de Hory seemingly in debate as to whether de Hory ever signed his forgeries (the shots of Irving and de Hory were in fact taken at different times).&lt;ref name="Bromley, Patrick"/&gt;

Welles's autobiographical asides in the film reflect on his [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|1938 radio adaptation]] of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', which caused a nationwide panic with its fake news broadcast. In introducing this chapter of his life, Welles declares his uncertainty as to his own authenticity, as he believes he too has engaged in fraud. While the basic facts of ''The War of the Worlds'' incident are correctly given, the apparent excerpts from the play featured in the movie are complete fabrications, including a scene in which President Roosevelt meets the Martian invaders—something which did not happen in the original (fabricated) broadcast.

== Questions of truthfulness ==
Author [[Robert Anton Wilson]], a great fan of the film, argued in ''[[Cosmic Trigger III: My Life After Death]]'' that the film was itself largely an intentional effort at fakery by Welles in support of the film's themes. Most directly, Wilson reports that in the BBC documentary ''Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film'', Welles stated that "everything in that film was a trick."  Secondly, many of the interviews in the film were with people who were themselves directly involved with forgery in one way or another, often making statements that would have been known by the filmmakers to be false, but which were allowed to pass without comment in the film. Similarly, Welles himself made numerous false statements about Oja Kodar in the film. Finally, Wilson points out several scenes which, while presented in a way that implies they were filmed in real time, were upon further inspection clearly fabricated from unrelated pieces of footage in a way guaranteed to mislead the casual viewer.

In his address at the Inaugural Ceremony, Hyun Jin Moon expressed that the Family Peace Association was created to carry on the trans-religious work his late father, [[Sun Myung Moon]], sought to accomplish with the establishment of the [[Family Federation for World Peace and Unification]] (FFWPU). Hyun Jin Moon held a key leadership role in FFWPU from 1998 to 2008. He stated, "I can no longer work through the FFWPU because it is not true to my father’s original mission", and dedicated the Family Peace Association as the "new vehicle" to realize his father's intentions of "creating a global movement to inspire all humanity to establish God-centered families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Peace Association Inaugural Ceremony Founder's Address - Family Peace Association|url=https://family-peace.org/2017/12/family-peace-association-inaugural-ceremony-founders-address/|website=Family Peace Association|accessdate=28 February 2018|date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested that the Family Peace Association could play a leadership role in the reunification of the Korean peninsula through a focus on reuniting families divided between North and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rai|first1=Markandey|title=Indo-Korean Emotional Connect - THE DAYAFTER|url=https://www.dayafterindia.com/2018/02/02/indo-korean-emotional-connect/|website=THE DAYAFTER|accessdate=13 March 2018|date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification and Sun Myung Moon ==

The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FFWPU International Headquarters – Practicing True Love in Resemblance to Heavenly Parent|url=http://familyfedihq.org/|website=familyfedihq.org|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1994 by [[Sun Myung Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Together as Families|url=http://familyfed.org/news-story/twih/together-as-families-26314/|website=familyfed.org|publisher=FFWPU USA|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Myung Moon]] stated at the founding of the FFWPU that he never intended to create a new religion, but to open an age after religion where families would serve as the core of spiritual and character growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Marc|last2=Leen|first2=Jeff|title=WashingtonPost.com: The Cult Controversy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/part2.htm|website=www.washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Introvigne|first1=Massimo|title=CESNUR - From the Unification Church to the Unification Movement, 1994-1999: Five Years of Dramatic Changes|url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/moon_1199.htm|website=www.cesnur.org|publisher=Center for Studies on New Religions|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Myung Moon]] has even stated that the HSA-UWC, the predecessor to FFWPU which he established in 1954, was meant to foster ecumenical cooperation among Christian sects to promote families with deep spirituality and a commitment to serving their larger society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moon|first1=Sun Myung|title=Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity - Sun Myung Moon|url=https://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/SunMyungMoon63/SunMyungMoon-630522.htm|website=www.tparents.org|accessdate=28 February 2018|quote=There are so many religions, while separated and disintegrated, are proud of only their respective historical backgrounds, and wield power that influences many nations, and has separate traditions firmly established. This is the sad reality seen from Heaven's side who wants to unify the world... what the members of Unification church should know is how we can bring the unity among these religions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moon|first1=Sun Myung|editor1-link=The Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity|title=God's will and the world|date=1985|publisher=Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity|location=New York|isbn=978-0910621472|url=https://www.tparents.org/Moon-Books/sm-gww/GWW-34.htm|accessdate=28 February 2018|language=English|chapter=34|quote=So why the term, "Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity"? ...when a marginal man such as Reverend Moon is attempting to unite world Christianity, everybody always feels uncomfortable... By what means can I unite Christianity throughout the world? By the Holy Spirit. Hence the name Holy Spirit Association… The Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity means an association, not a church.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1994, HSA-UWC had evolved into an entity that resembled a church for people who ascribed to shared beliefs and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, Massimo, 2000, ''The Unification Church Studies in Contemporary Religion'', Signature Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}}, pages 47-52&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in 1994, HSA-UWC was closed, and the FFWPU was launched as a new entity. The FFWPU was created as a broad-based social movement to promote healthy families and strong societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moon|first1=Sun Myung|title=THE FAMILY FEDERATION FOR COSMIC PEACE AND UNIFICATION AND THE COSMIC ERA OF BLESSED FAMILY|url=http://www.unification.net/1997/970504.html|website=Unification.net|accessdate=28 February 2018|quote=Up until now, the religions of the world have focused upon individual level salvation. But once we come out of that shell and follow True Parents we enter into the family level.... For this purpose, Father took down the HSA-UWC sign and placed a new sign: The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification... we are living in the cosmic era of Blessed families... The members of the Family Federation for World Peace are not just Christians. They are the sovereigns of nations and powerful leaders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a memo from the HSA-UWC North America Headquarters in 1997, from the beginning it was clear that the two entities, FFWPU and HSA-UWC, were separate entities, both in objectives and legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendricks|first1=Tyler|title=The Relation Between HSA-UWC and FFWPU|url=https://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Talks/Hendrcks/Hendricks-HSA-FFWPU.htm|website=www.tparents.org|publisher=HSA-UWC North America Headquarters|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hyun Jin Moon was appointed vice-president of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Today's World - July 1998 - Volume 19, Number 7|url=https://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Publications/TodaysWorld/TodaysWorld-98/TodaysWorld-9807.pdf|website=Unification.net|publisher=World Mission Department of the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His leadership style and proposed reforms to dismantle the church structure and create a family-based peace movement were met with resistance and accusations of being unorthodox, eventually leading to his replacement in 2008 with his younger brother, Hyung Jin Sean Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Introvigne|first1=Massimo|title=Unification Movement Schismatic Groups (2012-Present) – WRSP|url=https://wrldrels.org/2017/04/23/unification-movement-schisms-2/|website=wrldrels.org|publisher=World Religions and Spirituality|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Family Peace Association maintains that it was established to carry on the original mission of the FFWPU to expand certain universal principles and values related to God-centered families to a broader, non-sectarian audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Introvigne|first1=Massimo|title=Family Peace Association – WRSP|url=https://wrldrels.org/2017/04/19/family-peace-association/|website=wrldrels.org|publisher=World Religions and Spirituality|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="868">The '''Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas''' was developed by [[ProFantasy Software]], the creators of [[Campaign Cartographer]] for [[Wizards of the Coast]], who publish the [[Forgotten Realms]] [[role-playing game|RPG]] [[Campaign setting (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|setting]].  The developers created vector version of the published maps for the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting and included many new maps, including a globe of the entire Forgotten Realms world, [[Abeir-Toril]].  There have been three updates published for the application that deliver over 800 maps. The maps were hyperlinked within a customised viewer, or could be accessed via an interactive globe. The product was discontinued after selling through its entire print in its first year.

The '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' (DFI) is an independent non-profit organization devoted to research on and documentation of contemporary [[Franco-German relations]].

[[Image:DFI Villa.jpg|thumb|The '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' in Ludwigsburg.]]
The institute is funded by the [[German Foreign Office]], the regional government of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the town of [[Ludwigsburg]]. Projects are also funded by external partners.

== History ==
The Institute was established in 1948, with the aim of promoting Franco-German cooperation in all areas of public life and academia. It is based in  [[Ludwigsburg]], a Paris office being opened in 2004. In 1990 the Frankreich-Bibliothek, a library and documentation centre, was opened in Ludwigsburg. 

Founding members of the DFI included prominent figures, such as [[Joseph Rovan]] and Alfred Grosser, on the French side, and the Germans [[Theodor Heuss]] and [[Carlo Schmid (German politician)|Carlo Schmid]]. The first director was Fritz Schenk (1948-1972), followed by [[Robert Picht]] (1972-2002) and Frank Baasner (2002- ). The titular head of the Institute is the president, currently the former prime minister of Baden Württemberg, [[Erwin Teufel]]. 

The Institute currently has approximately 20 members of staff, including 5 researchers.

== Profile and activities ==
The dfi conducts applied research and provides consultancy on social, political and economic developments in France and on topics relating to Franco-German relations. The core research areas of economic policy, social policy, European policy, and [[intercultural communication]] form the focus of its activities, which are mainly long-term projects, partially or wholly funded by external financing from foundations or businesses. With the aim of promoting links between research and practice, the dfi hosts conferences and seminars, publishes extensively, and provides background information for the media.

In addition to this, the Institute holds seminars and training sessions for various groups. Participants include journalists and students from France and Germany. The research staff also teach at German and foreign universities.

The Institute’s activities are chiefly directed at decision makers and those occupying positions of influence in politics, business, education and the media, but also at the German and French public.

== Frankreich-Bibliothek ==
[[Image:DFI Bibliothek.JPG|thumb|The Frankreich-Bibliothek of the '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' in Ludwigsburg.]]
The open access library and documentation centre was opened in 1990,  the collection focusing on contemporary France and Franco-German relations. The library currently holds around 37,000 volumes. In addition, there is a press cuttings archive containing over half a million articles, covering the period from 1975 to the present. The press archive has been online since summer 2009, although older material has not yet been retro-digitalised.

The dfi, represented by the Frankreich-Bibliothek, is a member of the information network “International Relations and Area Studies” (FIV) and thus participates in the production of the World Affairs Online database (WAO). All literature, including relevant journal articles and book chapters, is catalogued in the FIV database and can be searched via the dfi catalogue, as well as through further regional and national online catalogues. The Frankreich-Bibliothek is an associate member of the Südwestdeutschen Bibliotheksverbund, a union catalogue.

With the support of the Wüstenrot Foundation, the dfi offers a limited number of grants for short-term research in the library for both undergraduate and post-graduate students from Germany and abroad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1516">The '''Guide Bleu''' is a series of French-language [[guidebook|travel guides]] published by [[Hachette Livre]], which started in 1841 as the ''[[Guide Joanne]]''.

Among Hachette's several guidebook series, the Guide Bleu is addressed to those seeking "discovery in depth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hachette.com/editeur/pratique-tourisme-0004/hachette-tourisme-034.html "Hachette Tourisme"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Guide bleu Johanne 05131.jpg|left|thumb]]
Starting with a guide to Switzerland (1841), [[Adolphe Joanne]] published a series of guidebooks in France under the name '''Guides Joanne'''.  This was sold to [[Louis Hachette]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Allain Collomp, ''La découverte des gorges du Verdon : histoire du tourisme et des travaux hydrauliques'', Édisud, 2002, {{ISBN|2-7449-0322-1}}, p 22&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 to 1933, Hachette collaborated with the publisher of the British [[Blue Guide]] series, and the Guides Joanne were renamed the '''Guides bleus''' in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliomonde.com/collection/guides-bleus-202.html|title=Guides bleus|publisher=bibliomonde.com|accessdate=27 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueguides.com/our-guide-books/history-of-the-blue-guides/ "History of the Blue Guides", Blue Guides Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314043104/http://blueguides.com/our-guide-books/history-of-the-blue-guides/ |date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Marshall first traveled to the [[Kalahari Desert]] and met the Ju/'hoansi of the Nyae Nyae area in 1950 on a trip initiated by his father to search for the "Lost World of the Kalahari." &lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;&lt;ref name="founder"&gt;[http://www.der.org/films/filmmakers/john-marshall.html DER founder and filmmaker, John K. Marshall], der.org. Retrieved 1 Aug 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;   Before his second trip to the Kalahari, one year later, Marshall received a 16mm Kodak camera and advice from his father, "Don't direct, John, don't try to be artistic, just film what you see people doing naturally." Marshall employed this advice during the 1950s, his films anticipated the [[cinema verite]] movement of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;  Throughout the 1950s and 1960s members of the Marshall family - John Marshall, his sister [[Elizabeth Marshall Thomas]], [[Lorna Marshall]], and Laurence Marshall - returned to the Kalahari Desert numerous times to conduct an ethnographic study of the Ju/'hoansi and document one of the last remaining hunter gatherer cultures.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;  From 1950-1958 Marshall filmed the hunting and gathering life of the Ju/'hoansi.&lt;ref name="founder"/&gt; His first edited film, [[The Hunters (1957 film)|''The Hunters'']], was released in 1957. "The Hunters" told the story of a Ju/'hoansi giraffe hunt. Marshall later realized he had unintentionally romanticized Ju/'hoan life. "The Hunters," portrayed the Ju/'hoansi as if they continued to live as they always had, where their main conflict was a struggle with nature. But when Marshall filmed them, they were actually suffering from having collided with the modern world and were subsisting primarily on gathered food and struggling to find enough to eat. Recognizing this discrepancy between reality and the portrayal of Ju/'hoansi life in "The Hunters," Marshall was determined to produce more objective, and less mediated films about the Ju/'hoansi. He produced a series of short films designed to educate without exoticizing or "imposing western narrative structures on the subjects."&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;

During the 1960s and most of the 1970s, Marshall, and nearly all anthropologists and filmmakers were banned from visiting the Ju/'hoansi by a government that saw them as "a threat to the status quo."&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt; So during this period, Marshall produced many short films about the Ju/'hoansi of Nyae Nyae from the footage he had collected in the 1950s&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;&lt;ref name=KungShortFilms&gt;{{cite web|title=!Kung Short Films|url=http://www.der.org/films/kung-short-films.html|publisher=Documentary Educational Resources|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and pursued other film projects in the United States. He was the cinematographer for [[Fred Wiseman]]'s first documentary film, [[Titicut Follies]]. Marshall also shot and produced a series of short films about police work in Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;ref name=PittsburghPolice&gt;{{cite web|title=Pittsburgh Police Film Series|url=http://www.der.org/films/pittsburgh-police.html|publisher=Documentary Educational Resources|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Marshall and [[Tim Asch]] founded [[Documentary Educational Resources]], a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to facilitating the use of cross-cultural documentaries in the classroom.&lt;ref name="founder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der.org/about/ About]. der.org. Retrieved 1 Aug 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall became involved in grassroots organizing and development in Nyae Nyae in the 1980s, forming a foundation that would become the Nyae Nyae Development Foundation of Namibia and devoting himself to advocating on behalf of the Ju/'hoansi.&lt;ref name="founder"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CulturalSurvival&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert K. and Megan Biesele|title=Controlling Their Destiny: Ju{{!}}'hoansi of Nyae Nyae|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/botswana/controlling-their-destiny-juhoansi-nyae-nyae|publisher=Cultural Survival Quarterly|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Society for Visual Anthropology bestowed on Marshall a lifetime achievement award for his 50 years of work among the [[hunter gatherer]] society.&lt;ref name=remembering/&gt;

Two million feet of Marshall's 16mm documentary footage along with thousands of hours of video footage as well as edited films and videos of Ju/'hoansi are held at the [[Human Studies Film Archives]], [[Smithsonian Institution]].  Known officially as the John Marshall Ju/'hoan Bushman Film and Video Collection, 1950–2000, the collection was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] for documentary heritage of world importance in July 2009.  Cynthia Close, former Executive Director of Documentary Educational Resources, called the collection, "unparalleled in the history of film and in the history of documenting humanity".&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;

==Evolution of Reality Filmmaking==
John Marshall produced realistic films that combined documentary media and ethnographic film.  His work offers an evolving, original and unique view on what was technically possible and stylistic in documentary through his more than fifty years as a filmmaker.  Marshall was a pioneer in the [[cinema verite]] style.  He is quoted as saying, "I began shooting events from angles and distances that approximated the perspectives of the people I was filming, I tried to film as a member of the group rather than shoot standing outside as an observer." He began thinking about his position vis-à-vis the people he was filming, asking, "Am I someone in the group? Who? Why am I looking at the other person? Am I an outside observer? If I am an observer who am I? Is there anyone else observing from this angle and distance? What are they seeing and thinking?" Marshall’s shooting style evolved to reflect his position within the society he was filming, that of participant more than outside observer.  As similar as this approach sounds to [[cinema verite]], Marshall employed sit down interviews in many of his films such as "[[N!ai, the Story of a !Kung Woman]]" and [[cinema verite]] does not use sit down interviews.&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;

In his early films, and indeed, most of his films about the Ju/'hoansi, Marshall presents realistic views of the changing life of the once hunter-gatherer culture, but he himself is never a central character in those films. However, in his 2002 6-episode film "A Kalahari Family," the curtain is pulled and John Marshall, as well as his family, who have been involved in both ethnographic and then political efforts with the Ju/'hoansi since the early 1950s, are revealed. This may be the ultimate in reality filmmaking, as the Marshalls have been intimately involved in the Ju/'hoansi culture, making both positive and negative impacts, and finally in "A Kalahari Family," their impact is explored.&lt;ref name=remembering /&gt;

The '''Langley Gold Medal''', or '''Samuel P. Langley Medal for Aerodromics''', is an award given by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for outstanding contributions to the sciences of [[aeronautics]] and [[astronautics]].  Named in honor of [[Samuel P. Langley]], the Smithsonian's third Secretary, it was authorized by the Board of Regents in 1909.&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt;

The medal was suggested by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. It is awarded for "meritorious investigations in connection with the science of aerodromics and its application to aviation".&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9907/20/apollo.11.awards/|title=Apollo 11 astronauts honored for 'astonishing' mission|date=July 20, 1999|publisher=CNN|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The museum has  extensive collections [[Punic]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] culture of [[North Africa]].  The Mahdia Museum also has a section dedicated to [[underwater archaeology]] including  the ''Mahdia shipwreck''. The wreck is a [[Hellenistic period]] Greek merchant vessel sunk during a storm in the 1st century BC.  It contained a rich cargo of works of art and architectural elements including many columns, as well as many sculptures of [[marble]] and [[bronze]]. The museum maintains strong ties to the  national [[Bardo Museum]].

The Islamic collections include works back to the 10th century, when the area was ruled by the [[Fatimid]]s. The artifacts include, 
[[woodwork]]s, [[mosaic]]s, [[stucco]] work, [[ceramic]]s, [[pottery]], fabrics and traditional costumes.

'''''Muslim Power 100''''' is a 2007 list published by The Power 100 website compiled of the top 100 [[British Muslims]] who have contributed positively to the United Kingdom.

==Overview==
The Power 100 website compiled the ''Muslim Power'' list to recognise Muslims who have made "significant contributions to the social, cultural and economic well-being of Britain."&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-leading-muslims-power-list-celebrates-the-top-100-players-boosting-the-nation-435941.html|title=Our leading Muslims: Power list celebrates the top 100 players boosting the nation|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=11 February 2007|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website said it was "applauding the vital achievement and contribution being made by the British Muslim community to the social, cultural and economic well-being of Britain."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6351057.stm|title=Muslim top 100 list is published|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=11 February 2007|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim minority contributes over £31 billion to the British economy each year.&lt;ref name="islamicvoice"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://islamicvoice.com/March2007/CoverStory/|title=Muslim Power 100 Honours|work= |location=London|publisher=''Islamic Voice''|date=March 2007|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremony==
On 10 February 2007, the list was announced at a ceremony in the Hilton Hotel on [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] in [[London]], after nine months preparation and voting.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

The list consisted of business leaders, writers, academics, doctors, campaigners, aid agency founders,&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; lords, lawyers, authors, sporting icons, to giants of industry, actors, journalists and police officers.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

The event also saw the winners of the Muslim Power 100 Excellence Awards announced,&lt;ref name="enfieldindependent"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/1190707.print/|title=Muslim top 100 list is published|work= |location=Enfield|publisher=''[[Enfield Independent]]''|date=12 February 2007|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was divided into nine categories, the awards celebrate their winners' contribution to these sectors in British society.&lt;ref name="enfieldindependent"/&gt;

The Power 100 website received 5,200 nominations, which were a 16-strong panel including Sir [[Iqbal Sacranie]] (Muslim Council of Britain), [[Amir Bhatia, Baron Bhatia|Lord Amir Bhatia]] (House of Lords), Dr [[Ghayasuddin Siddiqui]] (Muslim Parliament of Great Britain).&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enfieldindependent"/&gt;[http://www.therevival.co.uk/forum/general/2244]

The list was sponsored by the [[Islamic Bank of Britain]].&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; [[Sultan Choudhury]], managing director and spokesman for the Islamic Bank of Britain, said: "We wanted to highlight the positive contributions made by British Muslims to society - contributions that are in complete contrast with media connotations that somehow Muslims are linked to terrorism, are not as educated, or are segregating themselves. The opposite is true - we are integrating and contributing across a wide range of fields."&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; He added: "Not only does this list recognise exceptional achievements, but it also illustrates the opportunities for success available for Muslims in Britain."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="islamicvoice"/&gt;

[[Image:Hermann Paradisus Batavus.jpg|thumb|''Paradisus batavus'' by Paul Hermann, Leyden, 2nd Edn. 1705]]

'''Paul Hermann''' (30 June 1646, [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] – 29 January 1695, [[Leiden]]) was a German-born physician and botanist who for 15 years as director of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]].

Born in Halle, [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Germany, Paul Hermann was the son of Johann Hermann, a well-known organist, and Maria Magdalena Röber, a clergyman's daughter. Hermann studied theology and medicine in Wittenberg and botany in Leipzig.
After graduating from Europe's finest medical school, [[Padua]] in 1670, he was then engaged by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and went to Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) as a Ship's Medical Officer. He was in their employ from 1672 to 1677. During his stay there, he made a scientific collection of this island's plants and other organisms. He was then offered the job at Leiden and took up the Chair of Botany at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]] in 1679 and took up his residence in 1680 at Leiden where he spent the rest of his professional life.  He immediately set to making it the finest botanical garden in Europe.

[[File:Hermann Lilium africanum polyanthos.jpg|thumb|''[[Cybistetes|Lilium Africanum Polyanthos]]'' in ''Paradisus batavus'', 1698]]
Hermann's ''Paradisus batavus'', a description of the plants of the Leyden university botanical garden, was published three years after his death in 1698 and edited by [[William Sherard]].  There was a second edition published in 1705. Sherard edited his notes and solicited patronage for the publication of this important book. They were students together of [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort |Tournefort]] in Paris in 1688. This is where Hermann perfected his botanical draughtsmanship. Later Sherard collected more of his notes and produced a catalog published as ''Musaeum Zeylanicum'' (1717, 2nd edn.: 1727). Hermann's original Ceylon collection was used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] when he wrote his ''Flora Zeylanica'' (1747) and [[Species Plantarum|''Species plantarum'']] (1753), using the abbreviation "Hermann herb." in those publications. After Hermann's collections had passed through many hands, they were eventually purchased by Sir [[Joseph Banks]]. Now they are kept at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London.  Hermann was a very good [[botanical illustrator]] and had an excellent botanical grasp as declared by Linnaeus himself.

''''Plantarum seu stirpium historia'''' is an illustrated botanical text by the [[Flemings|Flemish]] physician Lobelius ([[Matthias de l'Obel]] (1538–1616) and published in [[Antwerp]] in 1576. Later, he translated it into [[Flemish]] in 1581 with the title ''Kruydtboeck''. This was l'Obel's second work, following publication of the ''Stirpium adversaria nova'' in London in 1570. This work was intended as a companion publication to his ''Stirpium adversaria nova'', and incorporates a revised version of the latter, as ''Nova stirpium adversaria''.

== History ==

L'Obel's first work was the ''Stirpium aduersaria noua'',{{efn|[[:wikt:stirpium|''Stirpium'']], from Latin ''stirps'', a plant. [[:wikt:adversaria|''Adversaria'']] - a daybook or journal&lt;ref name=arber78/&gt;}}{{sfn|l'Obel|1571}} published in London in 1571.{{efn|''Stirpium'': Title page inscribed 1570; final page of manuscript ([[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]) inscribed 1571}} The ''Plantarum seu stirpium historia'' of 1576{{sfn|l'Obel|1576b}} was intended as a companion piece, and was published in conjunction with a re-issue of ''Stirpium aduersaria noua'', as ''Nova stirpium adversaria''{{sfn|l'Obel|1576a}} In 1571 l'Obel published his Flemish translation of ''Plantarum'', as ''Kruydtboeck'' (Herb book),{{sfn|l'Obel|1581}} and in 1605 he reissued the ''Stirpium''.

The ''Plantarum'' deals with a number of subjects, including descriptions and illustrations (more than 2,000) of plants known to l'Obel, with plant names given in Latin, German, English, French, Flemish, Italian and Spanish. It also includes a history of botany and the use of plants in treating diseases. It was published by [[Christophe Plantin]], whose [[Plantin Press|workshop]] handled most of the major botanical works of the period and accumulated a large stock of [[woodcuts]] which were recycled between all these publications. The work is notable as one of the earliest attempts to classify plants by their natural characteristics rather than medicinal properties. 

== Structure ==

The initial section is the new ''Stirpium observationes'' (671 pages), which is liberally illustrated, followed by the revised ''Nova stirpium adversaria''. The former contains 1,473 woodcuts. While many of these were reused from other botanical works, about half were original to this publication. In addition to the ''Nova stirpium'' the work includes a work by [[Guillaume Rondolet]], l'Obel's mentor at the [[University of Montpellier]]. This is a 15 page publication entitled ''Formulae Aliquot Remediorum, Guillielmi Rondelletii, libro de internis remediis omissae''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5431">'''''Power politics''''' is a book by [[International Relations]] scholar [[Martin Wight]], first published in 1946 as a 68-page essay.  After 1959 Wight added twelve further chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hall]], ''The International Thought of Martin Wight, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Other works of Wight's were added by his former students, [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Carsten Holbraad]], and a combined volume was published in 1978, six years after Wight's death.  The book provides an overview of international politics featuring many elements of ''[[Realpolitik]]'' analysis.

==Religion==
Wight, a pacifist and devout Christian, was appalled by [[World War II]]. He favoured a revival of the biblical term [[Antichrist]] to describe recurrent warlike situations in history - Antichrist in this context meaning a "demonic concentration of power" rather than a person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hall]], ''The international thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter one he observes that the modern state has become "the ultimate loyalty for which men will fight. The mediaeval world of 'rights and wrongs' has been replaced by a modern one of 'powers, forces, dynasties and ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power Politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Wight begins: "Power politics is a colloquial phrase for international politics."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains that states exploit power to achieve expansion and dominance; "every dominant power aspires... to become a universal empire."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  For diplomatic reasons, "dominant powers" are euphemized as "Great Powers ... who wish to monopolise (sic) the right to create international conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Powers win and lose their status through violence, and are defined by their ability to wage war; they are decreasing in number, but those remaining are increasing in size.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that War and revolution go together:  communism provoked fascist and Nazi responses; and both ideologies were led by "gangsters" seeking to rule the world.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  To suppose that revolutionary ideologies have now been discarded is to show ignorance of human nature, says Wight.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wight, though states are few in number, they are widely diverse and atypical in character.  States are more or less immortal,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore unindictable in law.  International law is weak, unclear, decentralized, unpoliced, and therefore unenforceable; there is no sovereign power above states.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, pp. 110-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, he concludes "domestically, power is constrained by law; but internationally, law is governed and constrained by the struggle for power ... There is no international society, only "international anarchy". International politics is really "power politics", and the causes of war are inherent therein".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, pp. 102-5.&lt;/ref&gt; And, furthermore, '"diplomacy is a 'European invention imposed on the world,'"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; which "consists in information, negotiation, and communication, but also, covertly, in espionage, subversion and propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chapters examine alliances, the "balance of power", arms races, disarmament, and the supra-national authority of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].  Wight concludes that "security" is inseparable from moral behavior and cites [[Gladstone]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] as examples of the latter.

==Reputation==
According to [[Charles Manning]], [[Hedley Bull]], [[Sir Michael Howard]], and [[Hans Morgenthau]] Martin Wight is one of the finest international thinkers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Porter]], review of [[Ian Hall]], ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', in ''[[International Affairs]]'', 83:4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; M. Nicholson &lt;ref&gt; 'The enigma of Martin Wight', ''[[Review of International Studies]]'', 1981&lt;/ref&gt; says: "Within the 'English school' of International Relations, the work of Martin Wight is placed in particularly high esteem. More perhaps than anyone else, he is the scholar who did IR as it ought to be done." Reviewing ''Power Politic'', F.P. King calls it a delightful book "to browse through, contemplate, refute and enjoy more than once ... Resplendent history, allusions, wit and reasoning."&lt;ref&gt; F. P. King, "[[The American Historical Review]]", volume 84/3, 1/6/1979, pp. 710-711. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Hall]] has written a detailed resumé of Wight's work:  ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2006.

==Biography==
Szondi's father was the Hungarian-Jewish psychiatrist and psychoanalyst [[Léopold Szondi]], who settled in Switzerland after his 1944 release after five months in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.szondiforum.org/showdoc.php?id=481|title=The Leopold Szondi Forum|first=Leo|last=Berlips|website=www.szondiforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, he became a Professor at the [[Free University of Berlin]], where he led the Institute for General and Comparative Literature. His fields were the [[history of literature]] and [[comparative literature]]. 

He committed suicide in 1971, leaving unfinished his book about the work of his friend [[Paul Celan]], who had killed himself the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=3504|title=Celan Studies|publisher=SUP|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v DB''''', 2008 SCC 25 is a [[Canadian constitutional law|constitutional law]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] wherein a split Court held 5-4 that "presumptive offences" (offences where the offender is prosecuted as an adult) found in the ''[[Youth Criminal Justice Act]]'' is unconstitutional for violating [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In its analysis, the majority found that it was a [[principle of fundamental justice]] that young people should be entitled to a presumption of diminished moral culpability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">The '''sales order''', sometimes abbreviated as '''SO''', is an [[Order (business)|order]] issued by a business or sole trader to a customer. A sales order may be for products and/or services. Given the wide variety of businesses, this means that the orders can be fulfilled in several ways. Broadly, the fulfillment modes, based on the relationship between the order receipt and production, are as follows:

*[[Digital copy]] – Where products are digital and inventory is maintained with a single [[digital master]]. Copies are made on demand in real time and instantly delivered to customers.
*[[Build to stock]] – Where products are built and stocked in anticipation of demand. Most products for the consumer would fall into this category
*[[Build to order]] – Where products are built based on orders received. This is most prevalent for custom parts where the designs are  known beforehand.
*[[Configure-to-order]] – Where products are configured or assembled to meet unique customer requirements, e.g. computers
*[[Engineer to order]] – Where some amount of product design work is done after receiving the order

A sales order is an internal document of the company, meaning it is generated by the company itself. A sales order should record the customer's originating [[purchase order]] which is an external document. Rather than using the customer's purchase order document, an internal sales order form allows the internal audit control of completeness to be monitored. A sequential sales order number may be used by the company for its sales order documents. The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the sales order. A sales order, being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a sales order can be converted into a [[work order]] to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.

==Electronic sales order==
Many sales orders are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over a corporate Intranet. These sales orders may be communicated across different [[enterprise application|enterprise]] [[business application]]s. The automated sales and purchase order process enables customers to place orders 24/7, even when offices are closed.

==Common types==
*Quotes
**[[Sales quote]]
**[[Financial quote]]
*[[Invoice]]
*[[Estimation (project management)|Estimate]]
*[[spot market|Spot order]]
*Return order
*Product Number
*Rush Order

==Customer order fulfillment==
The steps involved in fulfilling the demands made in a sales order make up the [[order fulfillment]] process.

A '''Schedule of Values''' (SOV) is a detailed schedule apportioning the original contract sum and all change orders, among all cost code divisions or portions of the work. The Schedule of Values shall be based on the approved budget or the approved Fixed Price, or GMP, Cost-Plus Contract type as applicable. See the executed contract agreement for additional language regarding the Schedule of Values. Each Project/Job shall have a separate Schedule of Values. If multiple Projects/Jobs are included in one contract, then the Contractor/Vendor must create a separate Schedule of Values which clearly segregates costs among each Job for billing, reporting and audit purposes." &lt;ref&gt;[The Contractor Payment Application Audit: Guidance for Auditing AIA Documents G702 &amp; G703]&lt;/ref&gt;

"For Projects/Jobs with multiple “extra” categories, the Contractor/Vendor must create separate Schedule of Values which clearly segregates costs among each “Extra” category for billing, reporting and audit purposes (breakdown to be determined by Owner.) The Schedule of Values must be approved prior to first Payment Application. Schedule of Values can only be changed with approved Budget Transfer process in project accounting software, or by Change Order. After the Schedule of Values is approved, it becomes the basis for all Contractor/Vendor invoices for hard and soft costs."&lt;ref&gt;[The Contractor Payment Application Audit: Guidance for Auditing AIA Documents G702 &amp; G703]&lt;/ref&gt;

When using the Schedule of Values (SOV) for pay applications the submitter will typically bill on a percentage basis. That is to say that the amount billed that month is __% of the overall line item. This value is then added to the total amount billed from previous pay requests. This total amount would be the total work completed to date. The balance to finish is then calculated by subtracting the total completed to date from the original line item total. The Architect or Owner’s representative will then review and approve the amount due to the contractor during that pay period.

A template that can be used for a typical SOV is the ConsensusDocs 293 - Schedule of Values&lt;ref&gt;https://www.consensusdocs.org/Catalog?globalcategoryid=8a14e9ec-e247-4602-bae1-e73e9b67afda&lt;/ref&gt;. The American Institute of Architects Contract Documents department does not currently publish a standard schedule of values form&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aiacontracts.org/contract-documents/20631-continuation-sheet-&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''The Ashley Book of Knots''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] of [[knot]]s written and illustrated by the American artist [[Clifford W. Ashley]].  First published in 1944, it was the culmination of over 11 years of work.  The book contains exactly 3854 numbered entries and an estimated 7000 illustrations.&lt;ref name="abokdj"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Clifford W.|title=The Ashley Book of Knots|origyear=1944|year=1993|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-04025-3 | page=[[Dust jacket]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entries include knot instructions, uses, and some histories, categorized by type or function.  It remains one of the most important and comprehensive books on knots.

==Use as a reference==
Due to its scope and wide availability ''The Ashley Book of Knots'' has become a significant [[reference work]] in the field of knotting.  The numbers Ashley assigned to each knot can be used to unambiguously identify them. This helps to identify knots despite local colloquialisms or identification changes. Citations to Ashley numbers are usually in the form: "[[Constrictor knot|The Constrictor Knot]] (ABOK #1249)", "ABOK #1249" or even simply "#1249" if the context of the reference is clear or already established.&lt;ref name="hsok"&gt;{{Citation| last1=Warner| first1=Charles|last2=Turner|first2=John| author-link=| year=1996| editor-last=Turner| editor-first=J.C.| editor2-last=van de Griend| editor2-first=P.| title=History and Science of Knots| series=K&amp;E Series on Knots and Everything| publication-place=Singapore| publisher=World Scientific Publishing| volume=11| pages=22, 274–275| isbn=981-02-2469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some knots have more than one Ashley number due to having multiple uses or forms.  For example, the main entry for #1249 is in the chapter on [[Binding (knot)|binding knots]] but it is also listed as #176 in a chapter on occupational knot usage.

''The Ashley Book of Knots'' was compiled and first published before the introduction of [[synthetic fiber]] ropes, during a time when [[natural fiber]] cordage - typically twisted, laid, or braided rope - was most commonly used. The commentary on some knots may fail to address their behavior when tied with modern [[synthetic fiber]] or [[kernmantle rope|kernmantle]] style ropes.

==Corrections and additions==
Ashley suffered a debilitating [[stroke]] the year after the book was published.&lt;ref name="KM11"&gt;{{Cite journal|editor1-last=Budworth|editor1-first=Geoffrey|journal=Knotting Matters|title=Profile of Knotsman Clifford W.

'''''The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why it Matters''''' is a 2010 book by [[Brian Reynolds Myers]]. Based on a study of the [[Propaganda in North Korea|propaganda produced in North Korea]] for internal consumption, Myers argues that the guiding ideology of [[North Korea]] is a [[Korean ethnic nationalism|race-based nationalism]] derived from [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese fascism]], rather than any form of [[Communism]]. The book is based on author's study of the material in the [[Information Center on North Korea]].

==Author==
[[Brian Reynolds Myers]] was born in the U.S. and was educated on the graduate level in Germany.&lt;ref name="Kotkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/26/AR2010022603052.html|title=Book review of "Nothing to Envy," by Barbara Demick, and "The Cleanest Race," by B.R. Myers|first=Stephen|last=Kotkin|authorlink=Stephen Kotkin|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2012-02-28|accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an editor of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine and the author of ''[[A Reader's Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/books/27book.html|title=North Korea Keeps Hiding, and Fascinating|first=Dwight|last=Garner|authorlink=Dwight Garner (critic)|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2012-12-23|work=Books of the Times|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of ''Han Sorya and North Korea Literature'' (1994), which was the only book in English about [[North Korean literature]] until Tatiana Gabroussenko's literary history ''Soldiers on the Cultural Front'' (2010). Myers has studied [[North Korea]] for twenty years and is fluent in [[Korean language|Korean]].&lt;ref name="feer"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://feer.wsj.com/reviews/2009/december51/the-cleanest-race-how-north-koreans-see-themselves-and-why-it-matters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504031200/http://feer.wsj.com/reviews/2009/december51/the-cleanest-race-how-north-koreans-see-themselves-and-why-it-matters|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-04|title=The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves-And Why It Matters|first=Andrei|last=Lankov|date=2009-12-04|authorlink=Andrei Lankov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds an assistant professorship in international studies at [[Dongseo University]] in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

For the book, Myers studied North Korean [[mass culture]] with reference to domestically published novels, films, and serials available at the [[Ministry of Unification]] in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name="feer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rank"/&gt; Myers claims his analysis differs from that of conventional North Korea watchers, because he focuses on internal Korean-language propaganda, rather than on [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA) external broadcasts and English-language reports from South Korea.&lt;ref name="Rank"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LD10Dg02.html|title=Lifting the cloak on North Korean secrecy: ''The Cleanest Race, How North Koreans See Themselves'' by B R Myers|first=Michael|last=Rank|date=2012-04-10|accessdate=2012-12-23|publisher=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

==Contents==
''The Cleanest Race'' is divided into two sections: the first covers North Korean [[Korean nationalist historiography|history through its propaganda]], from [[Korea under Japanese rule]] to the [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea]].&lt;ref name="David-West"/&gt; The second section analyzes themes in the propaganda, including chapters such as "Mother Korea", [[Kim Il Sung]], [[Kim Jong Il]], perceptions of foreigners, and South Korea.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamesacrl.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/aames-newsletter-spring-2012.pdf#page=4|title=Review of the book The Cleanest Race|series=World Beat|journal=Asian, African, and Middle Eastern Section newsletter|publisher=Association of College and Research Libraries|date=Spring 2012|first=Blake|last=Robinson|volume=9|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques of propaganda analysis by Myers include translation of poems, discussion of [[metaphor]]s and monumental [[architecture]], and description of racist tropes.&lt;ref name="David-West"/&gt; The book also contains sixteen separate pages of color illustrations,&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; including reprints of posters that ethnically caricature Japanese and Americans&lt;ref name="Hitchens"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2243112/|title=A Nation of Racist Dwarfs|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|date=2010-02-01|accessdate=2012-12-23|work=Fighting Words|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which portray the late leaders [[Kim Il Sung]] and [[Kim Jong Il]] as paternal figures.&lt;ref name="Bunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/5362|title=North Korea's Cultural Shackes.

===Racial identity===
{{main|Korean ethnic nationalism}}
[[File:Demilitarized Zone of Korea 03.JPG|thumb|Pro-[[Korean unification|unification]] propaganda on the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].]]
''The Cleanest Race'' argues that the overarching ideology of the North Korean government's is founded on [[far-right politics]] rather than [[far-left politics]]. It notes that the North Korean government is xenophobic and militaristic. It cites a report of a mob attack on [[Afro-Cuban|Black Cuban]] diplomats and the forcing of female North Koreans to abort mixed-ethnicity children.&lt;ref name="Rank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitchens"/&gt; It says that the 2009 [[Constitution of North Korea|North Korean constitution]] omits all mention of Communism.&lt;ref name="Hitchens"/&gt; The author argues that ''[[Juche]]'' is not the leading ideology of North Korea. Rather, he surmises, it was designed in order to trick foreigners.&lt;ref name="Rank"/&gt;

Myers says North Korea's government does not base its ideology on [[Marxism–Leninism]] or [[Neo-Confucianism]]. He instead links it to [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese fascism]].&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tnr.com/book/review/maternalism|title=Maternalism|author=Martin, Bradley K.|date=2010-04-08|accessdate=2012-12-23|work=The Book|publisher=[[The New Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the government's racist criteria for national identity paints its genetically Korean citizens as innocent and morally virtuous (as opposed to foreigners) but militarily weak,&lt;ref name="David-West"/&gt; requiring Kim Il Sung's charismatic guidance and protection.&lt;ref name="feer"/&gt; The author supposes that this may be a strategy by the government to decrease the amount of [[Human rights in North Korea|repression and surveillance]] needed to control that public.&lt;ref name="feer"/&gt;

===Foreign policy implications===
According to Myers, North Korean government propaganda portrays South Korea as a land polluted by foreign domination, particularly by the permanent presence of U.S. soldiers. [[Anti-Americanism]] is the cornerstone of North Korean foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Rank"/&gt;

Similarly, internal propaganda within North Korea portrays U.S. humanitarian efforts such as [[food aid]] as signs of U.S. cowardice and make no distinction "between 'good' American workers and 'bad' American capitalists" as the Soviet Union's regime in the Cold War did.&lt;ref name="feer"/&gt; He laments that North Koreans openly flout the "dictates of an impure world" as inapplicable to the pure Korean race.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Press reviews===
Upon its release, ''The Cleanest Race'' received significant media attention and "rave reviews" in the United States press.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trends in the Study of North Korea|first=Charles K|last=Armstrong|journal=[[The Journal of Asian Studies]]|volume=70|issue=2|date=May 2011|pages=357–371|authorlink=Charles K. Armstrong|doi=10.1017/s0021911811000027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] (who had visited North Korea at the beginning of the 21st century) recounted that after reading the book, he concluded that his earlier view of the country as [[Stalinist]] was simplistic and incorrect.&lt;ref name="Hitchens"/&gt; Some reviewers confirmed anecdotal instances of North Korean xenophobia and alarm at the rate of [[interracial marriage]] in South Korea.&lt;ref name="Hitchens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Hitchens also notes some "obscene corollaries" from Myers' conclusions, including that many South Koreans feel the North Korean regime to be more "'authentically' Korean" than their own government.&lt;ref name="Hitchens"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' characterized the book as "often counterintuitive" and its arguments as "wily and complex".&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; Bradley K. Martin of ''[[The New Republic]]'', however, warned that the book could "[play down] the Stalinist, Maoist, and traditional East Asian contributions" to North Korean ideology.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Martin argues that North Korean ideology can be understood in the terms of Japanese pre-fascist psychology, including ''[[amae]]'' (dependence on parents) and ''[[Ten thousand years|banzai]]'' (wishing long life for the ruler).&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

===Academic reception===

====Journals====

[[Charles K. Armstrong]] in ''[[The Journal of Asian Studies]]'' states that the conclusions of the book are "not news".&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; He explains that historian [[Bruce Cumings]], whom Myers excoriates, addresses the influence of "Japanese colonial militarism" on North Korea. Armstrong faults Myers for exaggerating the Japanese angle and suggests that North Korea is "actually ''closer'' to European fascism" than to Imperial Japanese fascism, because Imperial Japan lacked a [[charismatic leader]] and a mass-mobilizing party.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;

[[Alzo David-West]] in ''[[Journal of Contemporary Asia]]'' claims Myers writes "in the tradition of '[[axis of evil]]' cultural criticism", obscures the [[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism|differences between Nazism and Stalinism]], and overlooks the historical influence of [[Maoism]] in North Korea. He also says Myers does not cite the relevant North Korean studies scholarship of [[Han Park|Han S. Park]], most notably ''North Korea: The Politics of Unconventional Wisdom'' (2002); makes scarce treatment of the ''[[Songun]]'' military-first ideology; and claims ''[[Juche]]'' ideology is [[universalism|universalist]]-[[humanism|humanist]] rather than [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]].&lt;ref name="David-West"&gt;{{cite journal|title=North Korea, Fascism, and Stalinism: On B. R. Myers' ''The Cleanest Race''|first=Alzo|last=David-West|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|volume=41|number=1|date=February 2011|authorlink=Alzo David-West|pages=146–156|doi=10.1080/00472336.2011.530043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerd Jendraschek]] in ''[[Studies on Asia]]'' says that Myers "downplays synchronic and diachronic variation"; he "does not explain"; he "ignores counter-evidence&amp;nbsp;... while exaggerating"; he "contradicts himself"; and he is "anecdotal&amp;nbsp;... biased and speculative".&lt;ref name="Jendraschek"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Review: B. R. Myers, ''The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters''|first=Gerd|last=Jendraschek|journal=Studies on Asia|volume=3|number=1|date=March 2013|authorlink=Gerd Jendraschek|pages=261–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzy Kim]] in ''[[Critical Asian Studies]]'' explains that Myers reads North Korea through an “infantilizing [[Orientalism (book)|Orientalist]] gaze”; he "lack[s]&amp;nbsp;... understanding of&amp;nbsp;... [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] relations", "denies Confucian influence" and "chooses to ignore North Korean kinship metaphors"; he has "his own preconceptions"; he "conflat[es] [[national solipsism|North Korean solipsism]] and [[nationalism]] with [[racism]]" and "whitewash[es] [[Racism in the United States|American racism]] and Orientalism"; he "never interrogates&amp;nbsp;... representations and lived realities"; he "never contextualizes the different kinds of sources he is using" but "lumps together" a "Text" that "becomes a [[straw man]]&amp;nbsp;... to serve his own arguments"; and he "takes at face value" the "simple dichotomy between 'Koreans' and 'foreigners'.'"&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal|title=(Dis)Orienting North Korea|first=Suzy|last=Kim|journal=Critical Asian Studies|volume=42|number=3|date=2010|authorlink=Suzy Kim|pages=481–495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig MacKie in ''[[The Political Economy of Affect in East Asia]]'' says, "Myers' formulation of the 'child race' is deeply problematic as a result of the instrumental way he uses it in his text" even though the "work does correctly register&amp;nbsp;... filial and familial themes and the fixation on the dead father that characterizes propaganda in North Korea."&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, Craig. "Familial Communism and Cartoons: An Affective Political Economy of North Korea", ''The Political Economy of Affect and Emotion in East Asia''. Jie Yang, ed. New York: Routledge, 2014. 219–239; 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felix Abt]], a business affairs specialist who lived in North Korea for seven years, observes that Myers's book is "flawed"; makes "shaky," "absurd," and "questionable" claims; and takes North Korean "propaganda more seriously than North Koreans do themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Abt, Felix.

'''U.S. Space Camp''' is a camp and related programs owned and operated by the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission's [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Space Camp|url = http://www.spacecamp.com/space|website = www.spacecamp.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp provides residential and educational programs for children and adults. These programs include space oriented camp programs, aircraft themed Aviation Challenge camps, and robotics themed programs, which are designed to promote science, engineering, aviation and technology. More than 750,000 campers have graduated since 1982.

== History ==
Space Camp was founded in 1982 as an educational camp program for children using the United States [[NASA|space program]] as the basis to promote math and science to children. The idea for the camp came about as a result of a discussion between [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Edward O. Buckbee]]. Von Braun was touring the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] with Buckbee in 1977 when he noticed children studying rockets and making notes. According to Buckbee, von Braun commented, "You know, we have all these camps for youngsters in this country - band camps and cheerleader camps and football camps. Why don't we have a science camp?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pQCEqGZ5KHwC&amp;pg=PT151&amp;lpg=PT151|title=Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun|page=151|isbn=978-1591149279|author=Bob Ward and [[John Glenn]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer 2017 was the 35th anniversary of Space Camp and the related programs. The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center added to the museum the Space Camp Hall of Fame, in which the first inductee was [[Wernher von Braun]].

=== U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center Education Foundation ===
The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center and Space Camp (formerly U.S. Space Camp) in Huntsville are operated by the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission, which is a state agency whose members are appointed by the [[Governor of Alabama]].

The non-profit U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center Foundation is a separate entity and members of its board are not appointed by the governor. It is responsible for scholarship fund-raising and the licensing of camps outside the United States. There are a number of internationally licensed Space Camps, including [[Space Camp Turkey]], [[Cosmodome (Laval)|Space Camp Canada]] (known as "Camp Spatial" in French), and Space Camp Belgium.

=== Space Camp Florida ===
[[Space Camp Florida]] opened in 1988 and shared facilities with the [[Astronaut Hall of Fame]] in [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]], [[Florida]], both of which were operated by the now defunct U.S. Space Camp Foundation. The Space Camp facility closed in 2002, due to low attendance leading to financial difficulties. About 50,000 children attended the camp during its run, but in its final year as few as 14 participants filled 276 slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=|title=Titusville, Fla., Space Camp's Mission Is to Remain Open.|date=14 September 2002|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel | first=Laurin | last=Sellers |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Astronaut Hall of Fame was sold to [[Delaware North]] and currently remains open as added attraction to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex with several simulators previously used by the camp now available to all visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPACE CAMP WILL KEEP SIMULATORS, NEW OWNER SAYS|date=November 10, 2002|newspaper=The Miami Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Program names are used to define the age or focus group for which the specific program targets, with ''Space Camp'' referring to both a camp program and the parent organization.  The camp offers programs for various ages and durations of visit.  The majority of attendees visit during the summer, though spring and fall often see many school group visits, parent and child bonding camps, and adult or corporate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spacecamp.com|title=www.spacecamp.com|website=www.spacecamp.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space Camp is a six day program offered for children between 9 and 11 years old.  The curriculum is designed to balance education and entertainment.  Children enrolling in Space Camp can choose from one of three "tracks" of activities and study: space, aviation and robotics. Space Camp was the first of the camp programs offered, and is used as the umbrella organization name.

[[Image:SpaceShuttleAtSpaceCamp.jpg|right|187x187px|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle Pathfinder]] based at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center.]]Space Academy is a program intended for ages 12–14, offered in six-day sessions.

Advanced Space Academy is designed for 15- to 18-year-olds. The program was originally known as Space Academy Level II and was started in Fall of 1987.  In 1987 the Space Academy Level II program was college accredited (1 hour) through the University of Alabama Huntsville.  It also offered programs for adults as the first class to go through Level II were adults.  The [http://www.spacecamp.com/family Family Camp]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spacecamp.com/family|title=Family Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=Space Camp|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; program allows parents or guardians to attend Space Camp with their child aged 7–12 years.  The program is run throughout the year, lasts three to four days, and includes activities in which the adult and child work together. Family Camp also has an Aviation Challenge option, designed for children and their accompanying adult, offered during the summer months.

=== Scholarships ===
Space Camp offers scholarships for kids with disabilities, academic greatness, excellence in leadership, and financial needs or disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scholarships|url = http://www.spacecamp.com/scholarships|website = www.spacecamp.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SCI-VIS ===
In cooperation with teachers of [[visually impaired]] students, Space Camp operates a week-long ''Space Camp for Interested Visually Impaired Students'' by providing the same experience to visually impaired students as sighted students.  Adaptations are made to the computer systems campers use in activities and simulations to provide speech and large print output.  Adapted materials, including handbooks translated in [[Braille]], and equipment are used during the camp.

=== Deaf Space Camp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/deafspacecamp/history-of-the-program|title=History of the program - DeafSpaceCamp|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
In cooperation with teachers, Space Camp operates a week-long  program for [[Deaf]] and [[hard of hearing]] students by providing the same experience to hearing-impaired students as hearing students.  Communication is supported by a dedicated team of [[American Sign Language]] interpreters as well as through visual and written media.  To allow equal access to the audio of films, most museum &amp; camp movies have open or closed captions; the theater provides a rear-window captioning system.  To  augment or replace microphone/headset technology, students use live stream video between mission control and the shuttle simulator.

In addition to participating in typical camp activities and simulations, students often have the opportunity to meet and interact with deaf adults who work in science-related fields and learn about the many contributions deaf individuals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twu.edu/dsc/|title=Deaf Scientist Corner|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Annie Jump Cannon]] (astronomer),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/mobile/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134386&amp;org=NSF|title=Pioneering women in STEM - National Science Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lang, H. 1994"&gt;Lang, H.

=== Other programs ===
Other programs include corporate programs, programs for adults and educators and educational field-trip programs for school groups, and the X-Camp outdoor leadership camp.  There were also special alumni sessions during the summer of the 25th anniversary.

Occasionally themed camps have been offered, usually in conjunction with museum exhibits.  During the summer of 2010 a Jedi Experience camp was offered in connection with the museum traveling exhibit [[Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=STAR WARS: Where Science Meets Imagination (Press Materials)|url=http://www.spacecamp.com/news/node/1902|accessdate=23 November 2010|date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aviation Challenge ===
{{main|Aviation Challenge}}
Aviation Challenge, or AC, is an umbrella branding for a set of aviation oriented camps at Space Camp, consisting of three main programs for children from ages 9–18.  As an aviation oriented camp the fundamental teaching aids are computer based flight simulators, which are intended to train attendees to fly, act, and think like [[United States Air Force]], Navy or Marine [[fighter pilot]]s.

== Facilities ==

===Simulators ===
There are simulators at Space Camp, such as:

*The MAT ([[Multi-axis trainer]]) &amp;ndash; Simulates [[disorientation]], similar to the Multiple Axis Space Test Inertia Facility (MASTIF) developed for [[Project Mercury]]
*The 1/6 Chair &amp;ndash; Simulates walking on the [[Moon]]
*The 5DF Chair &amp;ndash; Simulates the [[frictionless]] environment of [[space]] in five [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]
*The MMU ([[Manned Maneuvering Unit]]) – Simulates working untethered in a frictionless environment, such as during [[Extravehicular Activity]] (also known as an EVA or Spacewalk).

Space Camp additionally uses rides or attractions that are on site at the [[U.S. Space and Rocket Center]] as instructional tools.  While these are not true simulators, the use of these rides is designed to allow the rider to better understand some aspect of space travel. The [[Space Shot (ride)|Space Shot]] simulates [[rocket launch|liftoff]], and the [[Gravitron|G-Force Accelerator]] simulates the [[G-force]]s put on [[astronaut]]s while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere or during launch.

The Spacedome [[IMAX]] Theater provides a venue for presenting some of the space and science oriented films produced through the IMAX camera/projection system.  The theater is part of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center museum complex.  As Space Camp is operated by the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, it makes regular use of the theater.

=== Accommodations ===
[[Image:The SpaceCamp habitat.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Space Camp Habitat 1 facility]]
If a Space Camp program takes more than one day, "campers" stay at the space camp's Habitat 1 or Habitat 2. Habitat 1 is a large building designed to house young people. It is manned by staff and has full [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]. Male and female campers are usually assigned to separate floors.

Aviation Challenge trainees stay in Habitat 3 where they are required to maintain military standards to their bays and racks. There are two floors to Hab 3. Males live on half of the ground floor and all of the second floor. Female trainees stay on the other half of the first floor. The bays are named after famous aircraft carriers. The camp has a cafeteria where campers receive meals.

* [https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/kathleen-rubins Dr. Kate Rubins] became the third Space Camp alumna to fly in space when she launched to the International Space Station in July 2016. Kate dreamed of becoming an astronaut as a child and did chores around the house to earn her trip to Space Camp in seventh grade. She left camp knowing she needed to take as many math and science courses as she could, and that focus paved the way to her study of viral diseases and, ultimately, the NASA astronaut corps. Kate received a bachelor's degree in molecular biology and a Ph.D. in cancer biology. Selected by "Popular Science" magazine as one of its "Brilliant 10" in 2009, Kate was a Fellow and Principal Investigator at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before becoming a member of the 20th NASA astronaut class. On July 7, 2016, Kate launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station aboard the first test flight of the new Soyuz MS spacecraft. Together the international crew of Expeditions 48 and 49 conducted or participated in more than 275 different scientific experiments, including research in molecular and cellular biology, human physiology, fluid and combustion physics, Earth and space science and technology development. Kate was the first person to sequence DNA in space, eventually sequencing more than 2 billion base pairs of DNA during a series of experiments to analyze sequencing in microgravity. She also grew heart cells (cardiomyocytes) in cell culture, and performed quantitative, real-time PCR and microbiome experiments in orbit. Kate conducted two spacewalks totaling 12 hours, 46 minutes. During her first spacewalk, Kate and astronaut Jeff Williams installed the first International Docking Adapter, a new docking port for U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. During the second, they performed maintenance of the station external thermal control system and installed high-definition cameras, enabling never-before seen images of the planet and space station. They also successfully captured the SpaceX Dragon commercial resupply spacecraft and then returned science experiment samples to earth.
