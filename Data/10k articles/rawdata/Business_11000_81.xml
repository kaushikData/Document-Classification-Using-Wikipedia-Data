'''240 Centre Street''', formerly the '''New York City Police Headquarters''' building, between [[Broome Street (Manhattan)|Broome]] and [[Grand Street (Manhattan)|Grand]] Streets in the [[Nolita]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], was built in 1905-1909, and was designed by the firm of [[Hoppin &amp; Koen]]. It housed the headquarters of the [[New York City Police Department]] from 1909 to 1973, and was converted into luxury [[condominium]]s in 1988 by the firm of Ehrenkranz Group &amp; Eckstut.  It is now known as the '''Police Building Apartments'''.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, pp. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cusack, Andrew.

''The Making of an American''. 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1898 consolidation of the [[five boroughs]] into the city of [[City of Greater New York|"Greater New York"]], the police department also expanded and needed a new headquarters building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3447">'''Allotments''' in the [[tourism industry]] are used to designate a certain block of pre-negotiated [[Common carrier|carrier]] seats or [[hotel]] rooms which have been bought out and held by a [[travel]] organizer with a huge buying power like a wholesaler, tour operator or [[hotel consolidator]], and more rarely by a retail [[travel agent]].&lt;ref name=what&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismnt.com.au/nt/system/galleries/download/Industry/DD_FS_Allotment.pdf |title= What are allotments?|publisher=Tourismnt.com.au|accessdate=2008-08-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080721194355/http://www.tourismnt.com.au/nt/system/galleries/download/Industry/DD_FS_Allotment.pdf| archivedate= 21 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allotments can be purchased for a specific period of time such as a whole [[season]], part of a season or for any single dates and then resold to travel partners and final customers around the globe. A couple of days prior to carrier departure/hotel [[check-in]] any unsold seats/rooms may be released back to the supplier if such an agreement exists between the two parties. An allotment release back period is also negotiated as part of the allotment contract (e.g. four days prior to check-in/departure).

==Negotiating allotments==
Allotments can be negotiated between a tour operator and a travel service supplier such as airline company/hotel chain, or between two travel organizers such as a tour operator and a retail travel agent. Either way the buyer needs to prove a consistent level of business, because allotments are hardly granted without any previous sales history.

Rooms or seats that have not been contracted between the travel company and the product supplier are handled as ‘on-request’, where each booking of an [[airline seat]] or hotel room needs to be confirmed with the supplier before being confirmed with the client.

==The allotment or allocation contract==
The amount of the contracted rooms/seats to be specified in the allotment contract is a result of the estimated, during the negotiation, volume of sales to be realized by the [[tour operator]]. Tour operators book a certain number of rooms in hotels or seats on carriers and have the right to use them by a given date, also known as a release date, that usually is some days prior to [[tourist]]'s arrival (hotels)/departure(carriers). The allotment contract reduces the risk of any unsold products by the supplier and grants relative price advantage to the travel organizer helping him to stay competitive on the market by offering extra [[discounts]].&lt;ref name=efficiency&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esade.edu/cedit2004/pdfs/64_succurro.pdf|title= The efficiency of allotment contracts with option|publisher= Marianna Succurro|accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tour operators obtain discounts, through allotment or commitment contracts, primarily depend on the firm size and the bargaining power exercised; they can vary from 10% to 50% according to the period of the year, the destination, the quantity and quality of services contracted upon. Some big tour operators are able to obtain up to 70% of discount.&lt;ref name=tourism&gt;{{citation |title= Tourism Distribution Channels. Practices, Issues and Transformations.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations." [[Emma Goldman]]. "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg."

Most anarchist commentators do not consider [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a legitimate form of anarchism due to perceived coercive characteristics of capitalism. In particular, they argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion in violation of anarchist principles.&lt;ref name=AFAQV1&gt;{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Iain|title=An Anarchist FAQ, Volume I|year=2007|publisher=[[AK Press]]|isbn=978-1-902593-90-6|url=http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|chapter=Section F - Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128135116/http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|archivedate=2012-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFAQinfoshop&gt;{{cite web|title=Section F - Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism? |url=http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionF |work=[[An Anarchist FAQ]] |publisher=[[Infoshop.org]] |accessdate=3 December 2011 |author=Iain McKay |date=21 January 2010 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205172644/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionF |archivedate=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalists argue that capitalism is the absence of coercion and therefore fully compatible with the philosophy of anarchism.

==Anarchist criticisms of capitalism==
{{see also|Criticism of capitalism#Anarchist criticisms of capitalism}}
=== Private property ===
There is some debate about the question of private property and economic organization. [[Social anarchists]] claim that the existence of [[private property]] results in [[wage slavery]] while certain [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] argue for private property and wages owned and controlled directly by workers themselves in the form of [[worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms and associations]].&lt;ref&gt;quoted by James J. Martin. Men Against the State, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, pp. 190-1&lt;/ref&gt; For Proudhon, "strong workers' associations…would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984, p. 230 and p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage labor===

Traditional individualist anarchists, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] (who identified his [[American individualist anarchism]] as "anarchistic socialism") are opposed to both capitalism and [[Anarcho-communism|anarchist-communism]]. They support [[wage labor]] as long as the employers and employees are paid equally for equal hours worked&lt;ref&gt;Cheyney, Ryan C. Social Justice and the Right to the Labor Product. Political Theory, Vol. 8, No. 4. (Nov., 1980), p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; and neither party has authority over the other (this approach was put into practice in American individualist anarchist colonies such as [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]], which was organized by [[Josiah Warren]]). By following this principle, no individual profits from the labor of another. Tucker described the wages received in such an employer-employee relationship as the individual laborer's "full product". He envisioned that in such a society, every worker would be self-employed and own their own private means of production, free to walk away from employment contracts. Tucker called communist-anarchism "pseudo-anarchism" because it opposes wages and private property, fearing that collectivization would subdue individuals to group mentality and rob workers of the full product of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407014846/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html |archivedate=2005-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preamble to the Constitution of the [[Anarcho-Syndicalism|Syndicalist]] [[Industrial Workers of the World]] labor union states unequivocally:&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of the conservative motto, "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work," we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, "Abolition of the wage system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/culture/official/preamble.shtml |title=Preamble to the IWW Constitution &amp;#124; Industrial Workers of the World |website=Iww.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Equality===
Many anarcho-capitalists believe that inequality is not a major concern so long as everyone has "equality of opportunity". Anarcho-capitalist [[Murray Rothbard]] argued "the 'rightist' libertarian is not opposed to inequality".&lt;ref&gt;For a New Liberty, p. 47For a New Liberty, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that because of a person's self-ownership, that any freedom given up in a ''laissez-faire'' marketplace would be a voluntary contract (consent) and believe there is nothing authoritarian about capitalist employer-employee relationships in such a condition: "There is nothing authoritarian, dictatorial or exploitative in the relationship. Employees order employers to pay them amounts specified in the hiring contract just as much as employers order employees to abide by the terms of the contract".&lt;ref&gt;Markets, Entrepreneurs and Liberty, p. 136, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray Rothbard defines equality as "A and B are 'equal' if they are identical to each other with respect to a given attribute…There is one and only one way, then, in which any two people can really be 'equal' in the fullest sense: they must be identical in all their attributes"&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. Egalitarianism as a Revolt against Nature and Other Essays, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and argues "men are not uniform, [...] the species, mankind, is uniquely characterised by a high degree of variety, diversity, differentiation: in short, inequality".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. Egalitarianism as a Revolt against Nature and Other Essays, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; This runs counter the concept of equality amongst most social and mutualist anarchists. Most anarchists would argue that freedom without equality simply gives more freedom to those who are supposedly "superior" and that equality without freedom is a form of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. What is Property? p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ABC of Anarchism, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chomsky Reader, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchist Alexander Berkman argued:

{{quotation|Equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity…Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse, in fact. Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality. Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse, and only the repression of this free diversity results in levelling, in uniformity and sameness. Free opportunity and acting out your individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and variations…Life in freedom, in anarchy will do more than liberate man merely from his present political and economic bondage. That will be only the first step, the preliminary to a truly human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Berkman, Alexander. The ABC of Anarchism, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Some anarcho-capitalists, who consider themselves part of the individualist anarchist tradition, draw upon the writings of early individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and [[Lysander Spooner]] who argued that unequal wealth would not equal an unequal society. However, said anarchists believed that equality of condition, equality of access to the means of production and equal opportunity would counteract any potential tyranny in a market society. "Spooner and Godwin insist that inequality corrupts freedom. Their anarchism is directed as much against inequality as against tyranny" and "[w]hile sympathetic to Spooner's individualist anarchism, they [Rothbard and [[David D. Friedman]]] fail to notice or conveniently overlook its egalitarian implications".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Newman, Liberalism at Wit's End, p. 74, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker himself argued for a society with "the greatest amount of liberty compatible with equality of liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic issues==
{{main|Anarchist economics}}
Some anarchists object to the portrayal of economics as a "value-free science": {{quote|[A]ll the so-called laws and theories of political economy are in reality no more than statements of the following nature: 'Granting that there are always in a country a considerable number of people who cannot subsist a month, or even a fortnight, without accepting the conditions of work imposed upon them by the State, or offered to them by those whom the State recognizes as owners of land, factories, railways, etc., then the results will be so and so.' So far middle-class political economy has been only an enumeration of what happens under the just-mentioned conditions – without distinctly stating the conditions themselves. And then, having described the facts which arise in our society under these conditions, they represent to us these facts as rigid, inevitable economic laws.|[[Peter Kropotkin]], ''Revolutionary Pamphlets'', p. 179|source=}}

It has also been pointed out that historically the anarchist-communist economic theories published by [[Peter Kropotkin]] and others have been ignored or intentionally sidelined by historians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/31-A-3.pdf Microsoft Word - HER31Knowles.doc&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050615022420/http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/31-A-3.pdf|date=June 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the realm of anarchist labor issues is the issue of the monetary system. While all anarchists are against the current monetary system, there is disagreement as to whether or not there should be a monetary system. [[Alexander Berkman]] was an anarchist against the monetary system. In his book ''[[Now and After|What is Anarchism?]]'', Berkman argues that in an anarchist society money would become unnecessary. Within anarchy, all occupations are viewed as equally beneficial to society. Since the concept of value is different for everyone and cannot be determined, it is argued that it should not be set and one's contribution to society through their occupation entitled them to be a part of it. Within this system, there is a free distribution of goods without the need for money. Money in its current form is a hierarchical system, the exception being when all people are paid equal salaries. However, the argument goes further to question the purpose of money if people are paid equally. Certainly those who agree with this would also note that a monetary system would open a vulnerability for some to acquire more of it and create a class system.

Not all anarchists oppose the idea of money. Individualist and mutualist anarchists see currency as a tangible form of workers receiving the "full product of their labor". They support mutual banking (some individualists support no banking at all to keep exchange rates constant) and local currency as opposed to national currency.&lt;ref&gt;Citizens' money, a lecture on the "National banking system." Delivered in Chicago and published in "Liberty," of Boston, in 1888. San Fran: Equity publishing co, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/westrup/citizensmoney.pdf Citizens' money, a critical analysis in the light of free trade in banking a lecture by Alfred B. Westrup ... delivered in Chicago, Sunday, June 3, 1888, and in Toledo, O., under the auspices of the Society for Economic Inquiry, Feb. 19, 1891.

Ben Hatskin was born in 1917 in [[Winnipeg]] to [[Russian-Jewish]] parents. As a standout football player in high school, he became one of the first Canadian students to win an [[athletic scholarship]] to an American university. He played football for the Sooners at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. He also played junior hockey in Winnipeg with the 1936 Kildonan Stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honoured Members: Hatskin, Ben|url=http://www.mbhockeyhalloffame.ca/people/ben-hatskin/|website=Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Hatskin signed with the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], playing six years and helping the team win Grey Cup championships in 1939 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://honouredmembers.sportmanitoba.ca/inductee.php?id=57 |title=Ben Hatskin |publisher= Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=2017-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
During [[World War II]] Hatskin began raising racehorses and his wealth grew as the Hatskin family invested in everything from lumber companies to juke box distributorships.

==Winnipeg Jets==
In 1967, Ben Hatskin tried to win a [[National Hockey League]] franchise during the league's expansion. His bid failed, which fueled his desire to help create a new, rival league, the [[World Hockey Association]], in 1972. Hatskin knew that the credibility of the WHA depended on getting established hockey stars to join its teams. He aggressively sought out the services of [[Bobby Hull]] for his team, the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]], and eventually signed Hull to a contract estimated to be worth at least $1.75 million.

Although it was one of the more successful teams in the WHA, winning 3 [[Avco Cup]]s in [[1975–76 WHA season|1976]], [[1977–78 WHA season|1978]] and [[1978–79 WHA season|1979]]. Hatskin had to ask for a public subsidy to keep the financially troubled Jets alive after 1974.

The team was absorbed into the NHL in [[1979–80 NHL season|1979]] with Hatskin selling the Jets to Barry Shenkarow. The club later relocated to [[Arizona]] and became the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] following the [[1995–96 NHL season|1995-96 season]].

==Honours==
The [[Ben Hatskin Trophy]] given to the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]]'s best goaltender was named in his honour.

In 2010, he was elected as an inaugural inductee into the [[World Hockey Association Hall of Fame]] in the builders category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whahof.com/hofmembers.html WHA Hall of Fame Members]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://honouredmembers.sportmanitoba.ca/inductee.php?id=57 |title=Ben Hatskin |publisher= Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=2017-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council''' ('''BBSRC''') is a UK [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]] and [[non-departmental public body|NDPB]]  and is the largest UK public funder of non-medical bioscience. It predominantly funds [[science|scientific]] research institutes and [[university]] research departments in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

==Purpose==
Receiving its funding through the science budget of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS), BBSRC's mission is to "promote and support, by any means, high-quality basic, strategic and applied research and related postgraduate training relating to the understanding and exploitation of biological systems".&lt;ref&gt;BBSRC mission http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/organisation/mission.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
BBSRC's head office is at Polaris House &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=polaris+house+swindon&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Polaris+House,+N+Star+Ave,+Swindon+SN2+1UJ&amp;gl=uk&amp;ei=A92UTbvfEdG5hAfc9en8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ8gEwAA&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Swindon]] - the same building as the other Research Councils, [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]], [[Economic and Social Research Council|ESRC]], [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]], [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]], and [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]], as well as [[Research Councils UK|RCUK]] and the [[UK Space Agency|UKSA]].  Funded by Government, BBSRC invested over £509M in world-class bioscience in 2014-15. BBSRC also manages the joint Research Councils' Office in Brussels - the [[UK Research Office]] (UKRO).

==History==

BBSRC was created in 1994, merging the former [[Agricultural and Food Research Council]] (AFRC) and taking over the biological science activities of the former [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC).&lt;ref name="BBSRC history"/&gt;

The Council approves policies, strategy, budgets and major funding. On 11 February 2016, the Minister for Universities and Science, [[Jo Johnson]], announced the appointment of Professor Melanie Welham as interim Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof Melanie Welham appointed BBSRC Chief Executive|url=http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/news/people-skills-training/2016/160211-pr-melanie-welham-interim-bbsrc-chief-executive/|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Welham was previously Executive Director of Science at BBSRC.

A Research Panel provides expert advice which BBSRC Council draws upon in making decisions. The purpose of the Research Panel is to advise on:

* the development and implementation of the Council's strategic plans
* the competitiveness, relevance, economic impact, and societal considerations of the science and innovation activities funded by BBSRC
* opportunities for partnership with national and international organisations

===Boards, panels and committees===
In addition to the Council and the Research Panel, BBSRC has a series of other internal bodies for specific purposes.

* Appointments Board
* Audit Board
* Remuneration Board
* Strategy Panels - eight Panels advise and report to the BBSRC Chief Executive
* Research Committees - five Committees award research grants in specific science areas

==Institutes of BBSRC==

The Council strategically funds eight research institutes in the UK, and a number of centres ([http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/organisation/institutes BBSRC: Institutes and centres]).

The Institutes are tasked with delivering innovative, world class bioscience research and training, leading to wealth and job creation, generating high returns for the UK economy.{{cn|date=October 2015}} They have strong links with business, industry and the wider community, and support policy development.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The institutes' research underpins key sectors of the UK economy such as agriculture, bioenergy, biotechnology, food and drink and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the institutes maintain unique research facilities of national importance.

'''California and Hawaiian Sugar Company''' ('''C&amp;H Sugar''') is an American [[sugar]] processing and distribution company. Originally organized as a co-operative in 1921, it encountered a severe decline in sugar markets and passed through a series of owners in the last half of the 20th Century. In 2017, its Crockett, California refinery processed its last shipment of Hawaiian sugar but continues to produce Pure Cane Sugar sourced from other locations. The C&amp;H Sugar Crockett Refinery employs more than 450 people and produces 14% of the nation's cane sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibabuzz.com/westcounty/2016/03/18/crockett-ch-will-douse-the-lights-on-its-famous-sign-for-an-hour-saturday/|title=Crockett: C&amp;H will douse the lights on its famous sign for an hour – West County|website=www.ibabuzz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The California and Hawaiian Sugar Company was founded in 1906 and operated from 1921 to 1993 as an [[agricultural cooperative]] marketing association owned by the member [[sugar]] companies in [[Hawaii]]. Its headquarters are in [[Crockett, California|Crockett]] under the [[Carquinez Bridge]] in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Contra Costa County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chsugar.com/Consumer/contact.php Contact Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323113844/http://www.chsugar.com/consumer/contact.php |date=2010-03-23 }}." C&amp;H Sugar. Retrieved on April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDPMap"&gt;"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US0617274&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on Crockett CDP, California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606084253/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US0617274&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on |date=2011-06-06 }}." [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. Retrieved on April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the member companies sold their interests in C&amp;H to [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]] in [[Honolulu]], and the refining company's status changed from a cooperative to a corporation. Alexander &amp; Baldwin subsequently sold its majority share to an investment group, Citicorp Venture Capital (CVC) in 1998, retaining a 40% common stock interest in the recapitalized company. [[American Sugar Refining]] bought C&amp;H in 2006, merging it with its other sugar operations.{{efn|ASR, better known as [[Domino Foods|Domino Sugar]]), a company owned by [[Florida Crystals]] and the [[Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida]]. Florida Crystals is a privately held company that is part of [[FLO-SUN]], a sugar empire of the [[The Fanjul Brothers|Fanjul family]] whose origins trace to Spanish-Cuban sugar plantations of the early 19th century.}} C&amp;H revenues and profits continued to decline into the 21st Century.

==Products and market==
The C&amp;H brand is one of the leading sugar brands in the company's markets (where it is not the de facto leader), largely due to advertisements stressing their exclusive use of [[sugarcane|cane sugar]], believed by some to be superior to sugar from the [[sugar beet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sugar, Sugar: Cane and beet share the same chemistry but act differently in the kitchen |author= Miriam Morgan |date= March 31, 1999 |newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle |url= http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/SUGAR-SUGAR-Cane-and-beet-share-the-same-2939081.php |accessdate= 2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; C&amp;H sells a variety of cane sugar products, including white granulated, brown, baker's (superfine), powdered and organic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= C&amp;H Pure Cane Sugar - Explore our sugar products |work= official web site |url= http://www.chsugar.com/Consumer/our-products.html  |year= 2011 |accessdate= 2012-09-30  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

C&amp;H's primary market is west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the United States, although some sugar is sold in various east coast stores. A number of high-profile restaurants, bakeries and hotels have C&amp;H sugar shipped directly to them where it is not available through local distribution channels. More than 70 types, grades, and package sizes are sold within the two major groupings of grocery and industrial products. About {{convert|700000|short ton|metric ton}} of sugar per year are processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= C&amp;H Pure Cane Sugar |work= official web site |url= http://www.chsugar.com |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2010-01-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery at [[Crockett, California]], refines, packages, and markets all of the output from Hawaii's sugar factories, such as the remaining factory of Alexander &amp; Baldwin, the Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company on [[Maui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= HC&amp;S - Operations |publisher= Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company |work= web site |url= http://www.hcsugar.com/factory_operations.shtml#about |accessdate= 2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, citing a loss of profitability, the Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company harvested its last Hawaiian sugar cane crop, and will cease refining operations there. Lands still owned by the company will be converted to other crops and uses, such as [[sorghum]] and [[biofuel]] crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Final Days Of Hawaiian Sugar |work= KQED Public Media |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/17/505861855/the-final-days-of-hawaiian-sugar |year= 2016 |accessdate= 2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coinjection''' is a [[polymer injection]] technology in which different [[polymer]]s are injected into the same [[mold]]. 

Reasons for using coinjection are:
# reducing cost by using a cheaper fill material as the non-visible core of a product{{ref|cheap}}
# combining desired properties of polymers, such as colour (the differently colored parts in car tail lights), feel (soft-touch toothbrush) or mechanical properties.
# alter the density and elasticity of the final project making it either float in water or shock absorbent. 

Despite these advantages, coinjection requires machinery that is more expensive and difficult to maintain than standard single injection machines.  The coinjection process also has difficulty with complex geometric shapes.{{ref|machine}}

The development includes approximately 4,000 residential apartments.

==Early Years and Family==

Dionisio Gutierrez is the second son of Dionisio Gutierrez and Esperanza Mayorga&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikiguate.com.gt/juan-bautista-gutierrez-blanco/|title=Juan Bautista Gutiérrez|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

His grandfather, Juan Bautista Gutierrez, was a Spaniard businessman and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] who established in [[Guatemala]] in the first years of the 20th Century.  

He was one of the founders of Multi Inversiones, S. A. According to Francisco Pérez de Antón&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikiguate.com.gt/francisco-perez-de-anton/|title=Wikiguate Francisco Pérez de Antón|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, “…for Mr. Juan Gutierrez, life had only two purposes: to work and to create a heritage for his descendants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorial de cocinas y batallas.|last=Pérez de Antón,|first=Francisco|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial México|year=2012|isbn=|location=https://books.google.com/books/about/Memorial_de_Cocinas_y_Batallas.html?id=uREWrSqMQWMC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;” which led him to build “one of the most solid and solvent groups in [[Central America]]”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorial de cocinas y batallas|last=Pérez de Antón|first=Francisco|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial México, 2012.|year=2012|isbn=9929576584|location=https://books.google.com/books/about/Memorial_de_Cocinas_y_Batallas.html?id=uREWrSqMQWMC|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the decade of the 20’s, Juan Bautista Gutierrez opened a small store in San Cristobal Totonicapan, a small town in the western region of Guatemala.  

In 1936 he founded Molino Excelsior; in 1965 he started operations in the poultry industry with the Villalobos farm. In the decade of the 70’s, by initiative of his son, Dionisio Gutierrez (father) and Francisco Pérez de Antón, he started in the business of fried chicken, with what would become the most emblematic company of the then Grupo Gutierrez (today, Corporación Multi Inversiones): Pollo Campero. 

Today, Corporación Multi Inversiones has diversified into different industries: food, livestock, energy, finance, real estate development, telecommunications, among others, adapting to both local and international market trends.
=== Family Tragedy ===
On October 3, 1974, the Gutierrez family suffered a painful and sad tragedy, when the small plane bound to Honduras, filled with medicine that had been collected by the Guatemalan Rotary Club for the victims of hurricane Fifi, and piloted by Dionisio Gutierrez father and Alfonso Bosch, plummeted in the midst of San Jose Pinula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorial de cocinas y batallas|last=Pérez de Antón|first=Francisco|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial México|year=2012|isbn=9929576584|location=https://books.google.com.gt/books/about/Memorial%20de%20Cocinas%20y%20Batallas.html?id=uREWrSqMQWMC&amp;redir_esc=y|pages=105-106}}&lt;/ref&gt;, causing the death of them both.

According to Francisco Perez de Antón, that tragedy led to a “generational void” inside the Gutierrez family, since the sons of both Dionisio Gutierrez father and this business partner Alfonso Bosch, were too young to take on management roles in the family business. This is why Dionisio Gutierrez began to work in Grupo Gutierrez since 1976, when he was only 17 years old. 

Besides, those years were socially and politically convulsive; violence from the local armed conflict and the consolidation of military governments, scourged practically all the Central American region.

==Business career==

By the end of the 70’s, Dionisio Gutierrez and his cousin Juan Luis Bosch took on a shared Chief Executive Officer role at Corporación Multi Inversiones&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmi.co/es/quienes-somos/historia|title=Coporación Multi Inversiones|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a family owned multinational corporation with over 45,000 employees, and presence in 14 countries in three continents. 

For 33 years, Dionisio Gutierrez held the presidency role in the multinational company, founded by his grandfather in 1936. Currently, he is member of the Management Board at CMI. 

He has also been Director of the Guatemalan Manager’s Association (Asociación de Gerentes de Guatemala), Director of the Trade Chamber, Director of Banco Occidente, and Vicepresident of Banco Reformador.

==Civic career==

His foray into politics starts in the sunset of the military regime, and the beginnings of the democratic era, towards the end of the 80’s. Therefore, for almost forty years, Dionisio Gutierrez has had a permanent participation in the critical moments of the Central American region.

=== First incursions in the civic scene ===
Since his college years, Dionisio Gutierrez got involved in projects of several student associations and groups, where he denounced both the actions of the military government and the Marxist guerrilla.  

Among them Electorama 82,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/biografia|title=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an effort by young people to audit the questioned electoral process of March 7, 1982. A few weeks later, on March 23, General Efraín Ríos-Montt came to power through a coup d’état to the then president Fernando Lucas García&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breve historia contemporánea de Guatemala|last=Luján Muñoz|first=Jorge|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=|isbn=9681666070|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPZqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=breve+historia+contempor%C3%A1nea+de+guatemala&amp;dq=breve+historia+contempor%C3%A1nea+de+guatemala&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkl8a9k_XcAhVJ0FkKHYlxCDkQ6AEIKDAA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Gutierrez also participated with the “Student Committee Against Terrorism” and the “Civil Student Front”, with several publications in the independent journal El Imparcial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/hemeroteca/el-recordado-diario-el-imparcial|title=Surge El Imparcial|last=Prensa Libre|first=Guatemala|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, when he was only 24 years old, takes on a role as a member of the board of the Guatemalan Trade Chamber.

=== Free Enterprise Chamber ===
For seven years he was president of the Free Enterprise Chamber and led one of the first programs of political surveys in the country. The first publication “Guatemala Responde 1987”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biblioteca.ufm.edu/library/index.php?&amp;title=Special:GSMSearchPage&amp;process=&amp;field1=encabezamiento&amp;value1=DEMOCRACIA%20GUATEMALA%20HISTORIA%20&amp;mode=advanced&amp;page=1|title=Cámara de la Libre Empresa|last=|date=1989|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Guatemala Answers 1987) revealed Guatemalan citizen’s opinion about the economic, political and social situation in the first years of Vinicio Cerezo. 

Later, in 1989, he published a second edition “Guatemala Responde IV: Percepciones y opiniones del pueblo guatemalteco después de 37 meses de gobierno democrático” and in 1990, he issues a political&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/biografia?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImZbk__m13QIVwmSGCh3nLwY0EAAYASABEgLH2_D_BwE|title=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; survey about the voter’s preferences on the presidential elections of that year.

=== Libre Encuentro ===
This was a TV show hosted by Dionisio Gutierrez broadcast in Guatemala, other cities in Central America and the United States during twenty years.  Libre Encuentro &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/libre-encuentro|title=Libre Encuentro|last=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;encouraged thought and debate among leaders from different sectors of the society, and became a referent for the public opinion in Guatemala, where he reached record rating levels. In his emissions, Gutierrez stirred debate and controversy among guests from all social sectors and experts. In many occasions even abandoning his role as moderator, and participating in the arguments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title="Insoportable Prepotencia"|last=Zarco|first=José Eduardo|date=|work=Prensa Libre, 5/28/2006|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Serranazo ===
Six days after the rupture of the constitutional order perpetrated on Tuesday, May 25, 1993, by Jorge Antonio Serrano Elías&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/un-escenario-politico-similar|title=El Serranazo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which he tried to dissolve the Congress, dismiss the Supreme Court of Justice, the Constitutional Court and the Human Rights Delegate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Serranazo|last=Luján Muñoz|first=Jorge|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Several Guatemalan civil citizens, among whom was Dionisio Gutiérrez, issued a declaration "Given the political crisis the country is undergoing", better known as the document of "Los Abajo Firmantes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/los-abajo-firmantes/|title=Los Abajo Firmantes|last=Prensa Libre|first=Guatemala|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where they rejected the violations of the Constitution by Serrano Elías, calling him "dictator" and demanding his irrevocable resignation as well as the restitution of the Public Powers of the republic. 

In addition to this document, Gutiérrez, along with other actors of civil society, organized citizen protests, marches and rallies in front of the National Palace, through a platform called the National Consensus Instance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nomada.gt/pais/los-13-dias-de-agonia-del-expresidente-serrano-y-sus-diferencias-con-opm/|title=“Cómo fue el Serranazo, el último golpe en Guatemala hace 25 años”|last=Nómada gt|first=Guatemala|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Presidency of Alfonso Portillo (2000-2004) ===
In early 2003, then president Alfonso Portillo attacks media calling them “clowns”, and stated they were “at the service of obscure interests”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Portillo ataca a la prensa|last=Siglo 21|first=“Portillo ataca a la prensa”|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to Dionisio Gutierrez as “the circus owner”. Dionisio Gutierrez issued an answer stating that “the government called conspirator and subversive to any person who speaks the truth about the President”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Nos gobiernan tres chiflados|last=Sexto Estado|first=7 de febrero de 2003|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Jueves Negro (2003) ===
On July 24, 2003, in the streets of several zones of Guatemala City, the General and former President Efraín Ríos-Montt, in an action that has been described as a "populist ruse"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/hemeroteca/jueves-negro-el-ardid-populista-de-efrain-rios-montt|title=Jueves Negro|last=Prensa Libre, 07/24/2003|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, demanded that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal register him as a presidential candidate, despite being banned for having led a coup d'état.  

A few days before the event, on July 14 of that year, the Constitutional Court issued a decision denying the petition. For this reason, on Monday, July 21, the General indirectly led his followers to rebellion, and warned that he would not be held responsible if the protests got out of control.

On July 24, several people took different points of the city, and one of the most threatened places was the Centro Empresarial building, where the corporate offices of Multi Inversiones  is located. One of the most fierce opponents of the inscription of Ríos Montt was Dionisio Gutierrez. According to Prensa Libre: &lt;blockquote&gt;'''''“That day, the lives of hundreds of employees in that building was put at risk, because several tires were set on fire, which made the air unbreathable, and the mob threatened to burn the building”.'''''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After being besieged for twelve hours, 900 people who had been trapped in the Centro Empresarial building were rescued and the protesters withdrew. The damage to property, life and production was invaluable.

==== Opposition to the government of the UNE (2010) ====
On Thursday, July 1, 2010, the government of then President Álvaro Colom denounced a "destabilization plan composed of attacks on security forces and reports in some media outlets" in the public complaint, the president accused Dionisio Gutiérrez as one of the responsible for that plan. In response, the businessman said "With all due respect, I ask you not to fall into the totalitarian trap".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/gutierrez-pide-a-colom-evitar-caer-en-tentacion-totalitaria/|title=Gutiérrez pide a Colom evitar caer en tentación totalitaria|last=Siglo 21, 7/05/2010|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later, Dionisio Gutiérrez started one of the most controversial episodes of 2010 due to a comment against President Álvaro Colom and his wife Sandra Torres at the National Entrepreneurs Conference.&lt;ref&gt;''El Periódico''. Guatemala, viernes 24 de diciembre de 2010. Página 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Dionisio Gutierrez ended up taking distance from the “Libre Encuentro" program and the country, alleging, among other reasons, the "evident increase in  forms of harassment and intimidation, even constant death threats" against him&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/noticias/justicia/Dionisio-Gutierrez-programa-Libre-Encuentro_0_355764450.html|title=Dionisio Gutiérrez deja el programa Libre Encuentro|last=Prensa Libre|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo==
In 2012, already back in Guatemala City, Dionisio Gutiérrez created the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo (Freedom and Development Foundation), which is an independent, private and proactive think tank dedicated to the study and analysis of social, economic and political issues to promote values and principles of a free society. As president of the Foundation, Gutiérrez leads a team of intellectuals with whom he works in multiple civic activities and develops the articulation of long-term state proposals for Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/somos|title=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|last=Quienes somos|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensión ===
On January 27, 2013 was born the television show "Dimension", sponsored by the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo, which was broadcast weekly on Canal 3, under the direction of Dionisio Gutiérrez until August 2018. The show dealt with social issues and tried to promote participation "to generate reflection on the complex problems that afflict Guatemalan and Central American societies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/dimension|title=Dimensión|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confrontation with the Partido Patriota Government (2015) ===
In August 2015, following the announcement of the participation of Vice President Roxana Baldetti and President of the Republic Otto Pérez Molina in a structure dedicated to customs fraud in Guatemala known as La Línea, Dionisio Gutiérrez asks the resignation of the then President Otto Pérez Molina in a Public Letter from the Libertad y Desarrollo Foundation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://republica.gt/2015/08/24/dionisio-gutierrez-a-perez-molina-general-marchese-usted/|title=Dionisio Gutiérrez a Pérez Molina: “General, márchese usted”|last=República GT, 08/24/2015|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview in a local media outlet, Dionisio Gutiérrez said about Otto Pérez Molina:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''“An individual I met in the Serranazo days, and with whom I no longer had a significant contact until the end of 2010, when he was the most persecuted opposition politician, and I was the most persecuted civil citizen by the government of the UNE party. And four months after he was appointed President, I denounced his would be another government taking Guatemala towards lost paths”.''''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/dionisio-gutierrez-esta-claro-el-lado-correcto-de-la-historia-para-que-el-pais-avance|title=Dionisio Gutiérrez: Está claro el lado correcto de la historia para que Guatemala avance|last=Prensa Libre, 03/05/2018|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Encuentros Ciudadanos ===
In September 2016, through the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo, Dionisio Gutierrez opened the first Encuentros Ciudadano (Citizen Encounters) with a speech focused on inequality in the country. Since then, these meetings have become an annual experience that is replicated in other cities in Guatemala, where key personalities from different sectors of the society get together to discuss about different topics of national interest. In April 2017, the second Encuentro Ciudadano was held, in which the country reality was analyzed, with emphasis in politics, inequality and underdevelopment. 

On March 7, 2018, the main topic on the third Encuentro Ciudadano focused on the importance of the fight against corruption in Guatemala. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/eventos/encuentros-ciudadanos|title=Encuentros Ciudadanos|last=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Then Attorney General Thelma Aldana and the Chief of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Iván Velásquez were invited as panelists, the latter participated through a pre-recorded interview. In his keynote, Gutierrez said that president Jimmy Morales had not been invited and encouraged him to “''stop shaming Guatemala''” and to “''stop representing the obscure forces that don’t want the country to change. Your actions contradict your words''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/el-tercer-encuentro-ciudadano-estado-democratico-o-capturado-lo-preside-dionisio-gutierrez|title=Tercer Encuentro Ciudadano {{!}} Participantes coinciden en que prevalece captura del Estado|last=Prensa Libre, Guatemala|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Position regarding CICIG and the fight against corruption ===
In late February 2018, Gutierrez makes a public appearance, in the days of the formation of the Frente Ciudadano Contra la Corrupción (Citizen Front Against Corruption), formed by businessmen, activists, Mayan authorities, communicators and several personalities from the society, who manifested their commitment in the fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala, and also their commitment to support the permanence of Iván Velásquez as Chief of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), and the work of Thelma Aldana as Attorney General of the Ministerio Público.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elperiodico.com.gt/nacion/2018/02/28/diversos-sectores-conforman-frente-ciudadano-contra-la-corrupcion/|title=“Diversos sectores conforman Frente Ciudadano Contra la Corrupción”|last=El periódico, Guatemala|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Gutierrez at the front of the fight against corruption has earned him several criticism from different sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elfaro.net/es/201809/centroamerica/22405/Siete-tesis-para-el-desconcierto-de-Guatemala.htm?st-full_text=all&amp;tpl=11|title=Siete tesis para el desconcierto de Guatemala|last=Enrique|first=Naveda|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2018, given the smear campaign against CICIG and the lobby that was being made in Washington against the Commission, Dionisio Gutierrez sent a letter to twelve Senators and Congressmen of the United States, about the importance of the permanence of CICIG in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/carta-de-dionisio-gutierrez-a-senadores-y-congresistas-de-estados-unidos/|title=Carta a Senadores y Congresistas de Estados Unidos|last=Dionisiogutiérrez.gt|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that letter, Gutierrez lists a number of prosecuted officials by the Guatemalan justice due to corruption. He also stated that CICIG “has demonstrated its ability to bring justice to Guatemala, and for the first time in recent history, let Guatemalans have trust and faith in their government institutions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guatevision.com/noticias/nacional/empresario-dionisio-gutierrez-envia-carta-a-senadores-de-eeuu-por-cicig/|title=Empresario Dionisio Gutierrez envía carta a senadores de EEUU por CICIG|last=Guatevisión|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Razón de Estado==
On September 19, 2018, after three years away from the television, Dionisio Gutierrez makes a comeback to the screen with the show “Razón de Estado”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/razon-de-estado/|title=Razón de Estado|last=Dionisiogutierrez.gt|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast through Guatevisión channel, on Wednesdays at 9:30 PM. According to the show’s website, “it is a tribune for debate and reflection, engaged with freedom, democracy, and rule of law”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/television/|title=Razón de Estado|last=Dionisio Gutiérrez|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several content formats are used in this show: documentaries, interviews, discussion panels, and coverages.

==Awards, acknowledgments and relevant positions==
In 2012, the Power Awards and the American Business Council Foundation of the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.estrategiaynegocios.net/empresasymanagement/empresas/460363-330/poder-awards-reconoce-al-dr-dionisio-gutierrez|title=Poder Awards reconoce al Dr. Dionisio Gutiérrez|last=Estrategia y Negocios|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the efforts and trajectory of  Gutiérrez by bestowing upon him the award “Empowering Democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/GUATEMALA/es/Embajada/Documents/boletin%20n%C2%BA%2024.pdf|title=El Embajador impone la condecoraciones a Dionisio Gutiérrez y a la Hermana Uti|last=Exteriorres.gob.es|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, His Majesty, King Felipe VI of Spain, awarded him the high honor of the Order of Civil Merit in Commendation to Gutiérrez.

He is also a founder and trustee of the School of Government in Guatemala, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edg.org.gt/|title=Escuela de Gobierno|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an educational entity whose mission is to transform the way government and politics are conducted in Guatemala.

'''Downtown Yangon''' (also known as the '''Yangon Central Business District''' or Yangon CBD; formerly the '''Cantonment''') is the [[central business district]] of [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]], located close to the geographic centre of the [[metropolis|metropolitan]] area. The area features many of the city's major arts institutions and sports facilities.

==History==
[[File:Public Gardens, Rangoon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Cantonment Gardens (now People's Park and Square) in 1868.]]
The east-west grid of downtown Yangon was laid out by British military engineers Alexander Fraser and Montgomerie after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Falconer| first=John| year=2001| title=Burmese Design &amp; Architecture| isbn=962-593-882-6| publisher=Periplus| location=Hong Kong|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers.

The majority of sites on the [[Yangon City Heritage List]] are located in Yangon's CBD.

==Architecture==
[[File:Yangon Region Court.jpg|thumb|The Yangon Region Court building on [[Strand Road, Yangon|Strand Road]].]]
Yangon's CBD is known for its leafy avenues and fin-de-siècle architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123266507433707833 | title=Asia's Lost Treasure Trove| author=Tom Wright| date=2009-01-23| work=WSJ Weekend Journal | publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former British colonial capital has the highest number of colonial period buildings in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="bygone"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Martin |first=Steven |date=2004-03-30 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3578993.stm |title=Burma maintains bygone buildings |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBD is still mainly made up of decaying colonial buildings. The former [[High Court (Burma)|High Court]], the former [[Ministers' Building|Secretariat buildings]], the former [[BEHS 6 Botataung|St. Paul's English High School]] and the [[Strand Hotel]] are excellent examples of the bygone era. Most buildings in the CBD from this era are four-story mix-use (residential and commercial) buildings with {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} ceilings, allowing for the construction of [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanines]]. Despite their less-than-perfect conditions, the buildings remain highly sought after and most expensive in the city's property market.&lt;ref name=oldies&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Demand for downtown’s golden oldies still strong |url=http://mmtimes.com/no449/b007.html |date=2008-12-15 |publisher=The Myanmar Times |author=Htar Htar Khin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214145346/http://mmtimes.com/no449/b007.html |archivedate=2012-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Yangon City Development Committee]] created a [[Yangon City Heritage List]] of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/colonial-past-could-be-the-saving-of-rangoon-2219991.html|title=Colonial past could be the saving of Rangoon|last=Kennedy|first=Phoebe|date=20 February 2011|work=The Independent|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the city of Yangon imposed a 50-year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2012/news/619/news61901.html|title=Historic Yangon cityscape thrown a lifeline|last=Kean|first=Thomas|date=19 March 2012|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rob"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/366b4332-69b5-11e1-8996-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ohjcvgh1|title=Myanmar pushes to save colonial buildings|last=Robinson|first=Gwen|date=9 March 2012|work=Financial Times|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yangon Heritage Trust]], an NGO started by [[Thant Myint-U]], aims to create heritage areas in Downtown, and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use.&lt;ref name="rob"/&gt;

==Boundaries==
Geographically, the CBD is bounded by the Pun Hlaing River to the west, the [[Hlaing River]] to the south and [[Pazundaung Creek]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2012/business/622/biz62206.html|title=Industry backs 30-year Yangon master plan|date=9 April 2012|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=28 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720075158/http://www.mmtimes.com/2012/business/622/biz62206.html|archivedate=20 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.

For instance, the {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} Lanmadaw Road is followed by {{convert|30|ft|m|sing=on}}-wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}} Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.

The roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (née Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.

The CBD's road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:
* Broad 160-foot (49-m) wide roads running west to east
* Broad 100-foot (30-m) wide roads running south to north
* Two narrow 30-foot (9.1-m) wide streets running south to north
* Mid-size 50-foot (15-m) wide streets running south to north

Since February 2010, [[pickup truck]] bus lines have been forbidden to run in 6 townships of the CBD, namely [[Latha Township|Latha]], [[Lanmadaw Township|Lanmadaw]], [[Pabedan Township|Pabedan]], [[Kyauktada Township|Kyauktada]], [[Botahtaung Township|Botahtaung]] and [[Pazundaung Township]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html|title=Authorities ban light truck buses in downtown areas|author=Nay Nwe Moe Aung|work=Myanmar Times|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=18 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143017/http://mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of The CBD to reduce [[noise pollution]].&lt;ref name="symo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no396/n008.htm|title=Vehicle horn penalties increased|author=Shwe Yinn Mar Oo|date=10 December 2007|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.&lt;ref name="symo"/&gt;

'''Ecoleasing''' is a system in which goods (mainly from the [[Cradle-to-cradle design|technical cycle]], i.e. appliances, ...) are rented to a client for a certain period of time after which he returns the goods so the company that made it can recycle the materials.

==Terminology==
The term ecoleasing has been used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their book Cradle_to_Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.&lt;ref&gt;Term found in Dutch version of the book&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to distinct itself from regular [[Lease|leasing]] in that:

* the operation is similar to regular [[Purchasing|purchasing of goods]], so not requiring a contract to be made up as with leasing
* it is done with appliances and other products used for the household, rather than with land or very expensive products (cars, ...)
* the period of time the product is rented would be about the same as the lifespan of the product, so it can only be rented once before it is taken back by the company to recover the materials (and to create another product with it)

==Examples==
Ecoleasing can for instance be done with TV's. Instead of the consumer purchasing the TV, by ecoleasing it, he is entitled to say 10 000 service hours. After this, he can send the TV back to the company.

==Advantages==
* Since materials are reclaimed, fewer or no materials end up in landfills, or require other forms of waste disposal. As such, it is quite environmental.
* Materials are recovered by which the company can make new products, so the material costs for this new product are much lower for the company.
* Since new products can be made at a lower expense, the sale price of these products can also be comparatively lower than similar products made by the competition (if they use a system of purchasing the goods)

'''Enrique Jacobo Emilio Zóbel-Roxas y Olgado''' (January 7, 1927&amp;ndash;May 17, 2004), better known as '''Enrique J. Zóbel''' and '''EZ''', was a prominent [[Filipino people|Filipino]] businessman and [[polo]] player.

==Early life==

The only child of Col. Jacobo Zóbel y Roxas and Ángela Olgado, he was a grandson and namesake of [[Enrique_Zobel_de_Ayala|Enrique Zóbel de Ayala]].

After the Japanese forces entered [[Manila]] in 1941,  the 14-year-old Enrique displayed his resourcefulness and audacity, having to care for his mother while his father was with the [[USAFFE]] forces in [[Bataan]]. To generate income for their daily needs, he used his father's [[polo pony|polo ponies]] to offer [[kalesa]] rides and even befriended General Ota, the head of the [[Kempeitai]] in the process.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.inquirer.net/current/may-2010-elections/&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the favorite of his aunt, Doña Mercedes Zobel McMicking (matriarch of the [[Zobel de Ayala family|Zóbel de Ayala family]] after the deaths of her brothers, Jacobo and Alfonso), and her husband, Col. Joseph McMicking. The couple took interest in his education and growth and groomed him, together with other clan members for the family businesses.

==Career==

Zóbel joined Ayala y Compañia in 1955 and worked closely with his uncle, Col. McMicking, who was credited for engineering the transformation of Makati from vast tracts of swamplands into the Philippines' premier financial and commercial district. When the Ayala y Compañia partnership became a [[Ayala Corporation|corporation]] in 1967 (after the retirement of Col. McMicking), Zóbel became its first chief executive. Like McMicking, Zóbel showed great strength and business savvy in contributing to the growth of Ayala as one of the Philippines' biggest and most respected conglomerates. He sustained McMicking’s vision for the Ayala group. He professionalized the Ayala group and was instrumental in fulfilling Ayala’s goal to become a major player in the banking sector, as the company gained control of the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]]. Ayala also moved into new industries - [[semiconductor]] ([[Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc.]]), [[food processing]] (Pure Foods Corporation - now, [[San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc.]]), [[agribusiness]] (Ayala Agricultural Development Corporation) and [[telecommunications]] (Globe-Mackay Cable &amp; Radio Corporation - now, [[Globe Telecom]]). In 1973, Zóbel welcomed the [[Mitsubishi]] group as partners and took Ayala Corporation [[IPO|public]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111172325/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 1976, Ayala Corporation was listed in the Makati Stock Exchange (now [[Philippine Stock Exchange]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayala.com.ph/governance_organization_shareholder_info.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, he founded the [[Makati Business Club]] (MBC) to support or oppose policies which affected national life. He felt that the business community needed to speak out as a single solid voice and  not lobby for its own corporate or sectoral interest.  From 1983 to 1986, MBC would be the prime advocate of [[EDSA_revolution|political change]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbc.com.ph/the-mbc/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he fought with his third cousin [[Andres Soriano Jr.|Andrés Soriano, Jr.]] for control of [[San Miguel Corporation]] (SMC). After losing the battle for control, he sold the Zóbel de Ayala family's shares (equivalent to 19% of SMC) in SMC to [[Danding Cojuangco|Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/97/1212/biz2.html&lt;/ref&gt; His controversial move was met with the displeasure of his aunt, Doña Mercedes, and cost him his position at Ayala. He was succeeded by his first cousin [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala|Jaime Zóbel de Ayala]] in 1984.

On his own, he took on projects of unprecedented dimensions in 1984, building the [[Istana Nurul Iman]] (official residence of the [[Sultan of Brunei]], [[Hassanal Bolkiah]]) at a total cost of around $1.4 Billion USD under his company, Ayala International, Inc.

==Philanthropy==

The [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School|De La Salle-Santiago Zóbel School]] located in [[Ayala Alabang Village]] (an Ayala real estate development) was named in memory of son, Jacobo Santiago "Santi" (1954-1965), who died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 11.

In 1990, he established the Enrique Zóbel Foundation, which focuses on social and economic development projects in [[Calatagan]], [[Batangas]].

==Later life==

On May 10, 1991, Zóbel suffered a spinal injury and was paralyzed from the waist down after an accident in [[Sotogrande]], [[Spain]] while playing [[polo]]. He had to stop all physical activities and instead devoted his time to his foundation.

He was a recipient of the [[TOFIL Award]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tofil.ph/awardee_profile.php?id=70&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a consummate pilot and was equally at home with jets and propeller [[airplane]]s. Even just before his death, he was looking for a small jet that could fly the distance from Manila to Hawaii, where he had a vacation home.

==Personal life==

He was first married to [[Rocio Urquijo]] with whom he had three children - Jacobo Santiago "Santi" (1954-1965), Mercedes and Iñigo. He later separated from Urquijo and married Dee Anne Hora, an American. After his death, Hora became the chairwoman of the Enrique Zobel Foundation and continues his good works.

He was also known by his employees as a fluent Tagalog speaker with a twist of Batangueno accent given his sojourn in Batangas. 

==Death==

Zóbel died on May 17, 2004 at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/headlines/250442/enrique-zobel-ayala-founder-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/be/be002837.htm Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous==

Zóbel was an avid [[polo]] player and was the first Filipino president of Manila Polo Club (1963-1964).  In honor of his memory, the East Polo Field of the club was renamed Enrique Zóbel Field on January 9, 2005. The Enrique Zóbel Memorial Polo Cup was launched on January 30, 2005 at the club and has been held annually since.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&amp;dat=20060317&amp;id=ylM1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=943,13725142&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''entrenched player's dilemma''' is a concept featured in ''[[Wikinomics]].'' It is the choice faced by existing businesses in a changing marketplace. To embrace new ideas fully, they must abandon their current revenue streams.

Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams explain the concept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The problem with mature companies is that the very commercial success of their products increases their dependency on them. Making radical changes in the product's capabilities, underlying architecture or associated business models could cannibalize sales or lead to costly realignments of strategy and business infrastructure. It's as though popular and widely adopted products become ossified, hardened by the inherent incentives to build on their own success. The result is that entrenched industry players are generally not motivated to develop or deploy disruptive technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, Don ''[[Wikinomics]]'' (New York 2006) 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ford Otomotiv Sanayi A.Ş.''' (''Ford Automotive Industry'') is an [[automotive]] manufacturing company based in [[Turkey]] that is equally owned by [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[Koç Holding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Motor Company and Koç Holding celebrate 50th anniversary of Ford Otosan joint venture|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32868|publisher=Ford Motor Company|date=28 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in its current form in 1977, with original relations dating back to 1928.&lt;ref name="2009_report"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Annual Report|url=http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/downloads/yatirimciiliskileri/2009_Annual_Report_FO.pdf|publisher=Ford Otosan|date=23 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915065412/http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/downloads/yatirimciiliskileri/2009_Annual_Report_FO.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently operates five facilities throughout the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facilities|url=http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/en/facilities.htm|publisher=Ford Otosan|accessdate=16 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010042316/http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/en/facilities.htm|archivedate=10 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is headquartered in [[Gölcük, Kocaeli|Gölcük]], with a second location in [[İnönü, Eskişehir|İnönü]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Otosan|url=http://www.osd.org.tr/otosan.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528030228/http://www.osd.org.tr/otosan.htm|archivedate=28 May 2013|publisher=Otomotiv Sanayii Derneği|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The collaboration began in 1928, when [[Vehbi Koç]] was assigned as Ford dealer in [[Ankara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford dünyasının en kalitelisi oldu yeni projeleri almakta zorlanmadı|url=http://otomobil.milliyet.com.tr/ford-dunyasinin-en-kalitelisi-oldu-yeni-projeleri-almakta-zorlanmadi/otonostalji/haberdetay/22.04.2012/1531579/default.htm|publisher=Milliyet|date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Turkish national assembly granted to Ford the right to install a local assembly operation in a free zone located in Istanbul's port area. Limited numbers of vehicles were assembled there until 1934, when these activities were suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the foundation of the '''Otosan''' factory was held in [[Istanbul]], and in 1960 the [[Ford Consul]] was the first model to be produced at the plant, followed by the [[Ford Thames 300E|Thames]] and the [[Ford Thames 400E|Thames Trader]] van.&lt;ref name="tarihce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tarihçe|url=http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/tarihce.htm|publisher=Ford Otosan|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the D1210 truck was added to production, and in 1966, the [[Anadol]], the first mass-production passenger vehicle developed in Turkey. In 1967, the [[Ford Transit]] also began production and in 1973, the Anadol STC-16, the first sports car developed in Turkey.

In 1977, the company signed a license agreement with Ford and the company's name was changed to '''Ford Otosan'''. In 1979, took place the groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory in [[İnönü, Eskişehir]], which began production of the [[Ford Cargo]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="2009_report"/&gt; Also that year, Ford increased its share of ownership in the company to 30 percent.&lt;ref name="tarihce"/&gt; In 1985, the [[Ford Taunus TC#Turkey|Ford Taunus]] begins production at the Istanbul plant, and in 1986 the official opening ceremony for the İnönü engine plant is held.

In 1992, the newer [[Ford Transit]] was put into production, and in 1993 the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] replaced the Ford Taunus on the production lines.&lt;ref name="tarihce"/&gt; In 1997, Ford further increased its share in the company to 41 percent, becoming equal partner with Koç Holding in the joint venture. In 1998, the groundbreaking ceremony was held for the new factory in [[Gölcük, Kocaeli]], that became operational in 2001, replacing the Istanbul facility.

==Career==

===Literary criticism===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
In 1953, Plimpton joined the influential literary journal ''The [[Paris Review]]'', founded by [[Peter Matthiessen]], [[Thomas H. Guinzburg]], and [[Harold L. Humes|Harold L. "Doc" Humes]], becoming its first editor in chief. This periodical has carried great weight in the literary world, but has never been financially strong; for its first half-century, it was allegedly largely financed by its publishers and by Plimpton. Two articles by [[Richard Cummings (writer)|Richard Cummings]], "An American in Paris" (''The American Conservative'') and "The Fiction of the State" (''Lobster''), disclosed that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] provided funds for ''The Paris Review'', using publisher [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]]'s foundation as a conduit, and that Plimpton was an "agent of influence" for the CIA. Peter Matthiessen took the magazine over from Humes and ousted him as editor, replacing him with Plimpton, using it as his cover for his CIA activities. [[Jean Stein]] became his co-editor. Plimpton was associated with the literary magazine in Paris, ''Merlin'', which folded because the State Department withdrew its support.{{Why|date=October 2015}} Future [[Poet Laureate]] [[Donald Hall]], who had met Plimpton at Exeter, was Poetry Editor. One of the magazine's most notable discoveries was author and screenplay writer [[Terry Southern]], who was living in Paris at the time and formed a lifelong friendship with Plimpton, along with writer [[Alexander Trocchi]] and future classical and jazz pioneer [[David Amram]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Sports journalism===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Outside the literary world, Plimpton was famous for competing in professional sporting events and then recording the experience from the point of view of an amateur.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1958, prior to a post-season exhibition game at Yankee Stadium between teams managed by [[Willie Mays]] (National League) and [[Mickey Mantle]] (American League), Plimpton pitched against the [[National League]]. His experience was captured in the book ''Out of My League''. (He intended to face both line-ups, but tired badly and was relieved by [[Ralph Houk]].) Plimpton sparred for three rounds with [[boxing]] greats [[Archie Moore]] and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], while on assignment for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1963, Plimpton attended preseason training with the [[Detroit Lions]] of the [[National Football League]] as a backup [[quarterback]], and ran a few plays in an intrasquad scrimmage. These events were recalled in his best-known book ''[[Paper Lion]]'', which was later adapted into a feature film starring [[Alan Alda]], released in 1968. Plimpton revisited pro football in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5AkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xecDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6673,5627547|title=Plimpton trying football again|work=The Free-Lance Star|first=Bill|last=Buttram|date=August 19, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; this time joining the [[Baltimore Colts]] and seeing action in an exhibition game against his previous team, the Lions. These experiences served as the basis of another football book, ''Mad Ducks and Bears'', although much of the book dealt with the off-field escapades of football friends such as [[Alex Karras]] and [[Bobby Layne]]. Another sports book, ''Open Net'', saw him train as an [[ice hockey]] goalie with the [[Boston Bruins]], even playing part of a [[National Hockey League]] preseason game.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Plimpton's ''The Bogey Man'' chronicles his attempt to play professional golf on the [[PGA Tour]] during the [[Jack Nicklaus|Nicklaus]] and [[Arnold Palmer|Palmer]] era of the 1960s. Among other challenges for ''Sports Illustrated'', he attempted to play top-level [[Contract bridge|bridge]], and spent some time as a [[tightrope walking|high-wire circus performer]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Some of these events, such as his stint with the Colts, and an attempt at stand-up comedy, were presented on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network as a series of specials.

In 1994 Plimpton appeared several times in the [[Ken Burns]] series ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' where he shared some personal baseball experiences as well as other memorable events throughout the history of baseball.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/baseball/ Baseball: A film by Ken Burns], ''PBS'', 2010, Retrieved December 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sidd Finch===
In the April 1, 1985 issue of ''Sports Illustrated'', Plimpton pulled off one of the greatest [[April Fools' Day]] pranks of all time. With the help of the [[New York Mets]] organization and several Mets players, Plimpton wrote a convincing account of a new unknown pitcher in the Mets spring training camp named [[Sidd Finch|Siddhartha Finch]] who threw a baseball over 160&amp;nbsp;mph, wore a heavy boot on one foot, and was a practicing [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] with a largely unknown background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/43450/76/2|title=SI Vault – April 1, 1985 – Page 76|website=www.si.com|accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prank was so successful that many readers believed the story, and the ensuing popularity of the joke resulted in Plimpton writing an entire book on Finch.

===Other writing===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
A personal friend of the New England Sedgwick family, Plimpton edited ''Edie: An American Biography'' with [[Jean Stein]] in 1982. He also appeared in a brief interview footage about [[Edie Sedgwick]] in the DVD extra for the film ''[[Ciao! Manhattan]]''. In addition, he appeared in the [[PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' documentary on [[Andy Warhol]]. Plimpton also appeared in the closing credits of the 2006 film, ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]''.

Between 2000 and 2003, Plimpton wrote the [[libretto]] to a new opera Animal Tales, commissioned by [[Family Opera Initiative]], with music by [[Kitty Brazelton]] directed by [[Grethe Barrett Holby]]. He wrote, "I suppose in a mild way there is a lesson to be learned for the young, or the young at heart – the gumption to get out and try one's wings."

===Acting===
Plimpton also appeared in a number of feature films as an extra and in cameo appearances. He had a small role in the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/9/29/legendary-humorist-poonster-dies-at-76/|title=Legendary Humorist, Poonster Dies at 76 {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing a psychologist.

In this campaign, Plimpton aggressively touted the superiority of Intellivision video games over those of competitors such as the [[Atari 2600]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/12/george-plimpton-pitches-video-games-for-the-mattel-intellivision.html|title=George Plimpton, Paris Review Founder, Pitches 1980s Video Games for the Mattel Intellivision|work=Open Culture|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of her original supporters and had published an article about her work in ''The Paris Review''. He also appeared in the 1996 documentary ''[[When We Were Kings]]'' about the "Rumble in the Jungle" 1974 Ali-Foreman Championship fight opposite [[Norman Mailer]] crediting [[Muhammad Ali]] as a poet who composed the world's shortest poem: "Me? Whee!!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/6/9/professor-muhammed-ali-delivers-lecture-poems/|title=Professor Muhammed Ali Delivers Lecture; Poems and Parables Fill Talk on Friendship {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plimpton was a member of the cast of the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] TV series ''[[A Nero Wolfe Mystery]]'' (2001–02). In 2013, the documentary ''[[Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself]]'', directed by Tom Bean and Luke Poling, was released. The film used archival audio and video of Plimpton lecturing and reading to create a posthumous narration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/george-plimpton-film-plimpton-starring-george-plimpton-as-himself/2946/|title=George Plimpton {{!}} Full Film {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=2014-05-16|work=American Masters|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fireworks===
Plimpton was a demolitions expert in the post-[[World War II]] Army. After returning to New York from Paris, he routinely fired off [[fireworks]] at his evening parties.&lt;ref name="CSMp7"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/1981/0813/081355.html/%28page%29/7|title= George Plimpton|last= McBride|first= Stewart|date= August 13, 1981|website= The Christian Science Monitor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102170239/http://www.csmonitor.com/1981/0813/081355.html/%2528page%2529/7|archivedate= November 2, 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His enthusiasm for fireworks grew, and he was appointed Fireworks Commissioner of New York by Mayor [[John Lindsay]],&lt;ref name="CSMp7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PeoplePunk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20074425,00.html|title=George Plimpton, Still Burning His Punk at Both Ends, Finds a Sport in Which He Can Sparkle|last=Dowling|first=Kevin|date=August 27, 1979|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102175150/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20074425,00.html|archivedate=November 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-11-02|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unofficial post he held until his death.&lt;ref name="Plimpton1"/&gt;

With [[Felix Grucci]], Plimpton competed in the 16th International Fireworks Festival in 1979 in [[Monte Carlo]]. After several problems with transporting and preparing the fireworks, Plimpton and Grucci became the first competitors from the United States to win the event.&lt;ref name="PeoplePunk"/&gt; Plimpton later wrote the book ''Fireworks'', and hosted an [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] Home Video with the same name featuring his many fireworks adventures with the Gruccis of New York in Monte Carlo and for the 1983 Brooklyn Bridge Centennial.&lt;ref name="Plimpton1"/&gt;

===Parodies of Plimpton's career===
A November 6, 1971, cartoon in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' by [[Whitney Darrow Jr.]] shows a cleaning lady on her hands and knees scrubbing an office floor while saying to another one: "I'd like to see George Plimpton do ''this'' sometime."

'''''Globes''''' ({{lang-he|גלובס}}) is a [[Hebrew-language]] daily evening financial newspaper, the largest and the oldest of its kind in Israel. Globes was founded in the early 1980s and published in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. It deals with economic issues and news from the Israeli and international business worlds. The color of the paper is pink, inspired by the British ''[[Financial Times]]''.

''Globes'' was one of the first Israeli dailies to publish its contents on the World Wide Web, dating back to April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=64899|title=The Man Who Said Yes to the Internet|last=Yaakobson|first=Dror|date=16 March 1998|website=Globes|language=Hebrew|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to TGI 2017 media survey ''Globes''′ market share is 4.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.globes.co.il/en/article-tgi-survey-weekend-israel-hayom-overtakes-yedioth-ahronoth-1001198125|title= TGI survey: Weekend "Israel Hayom" overtakes "Yedioth"|author=Yonatan Kitain |date= 20 July 2017|work= |publisher= Globes |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main competitors in printed media are ''[[TheMarker]]'' of the [[Haaretz]] group and ''[[Calcalist]]'' published by [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] Group. 

==History==
The daily paper founded by Haim Bar-On, the publisher of the newspaper, on the basis of a small, [[Haifa]]-based financial newspaper, in partnership with businessman Eliezer Fishman.

Following the success of ''Globes'', it had a competitor in the form of ''Telegraph'', which had a lower subscription price and was also printed on Saturday. ''Telegraph'' was closed after several years. A few years later, the Schocken Media Network published ''[[TheMarker]]'' economic newspaper as a competitor to ''Globes''.

The chief editor of ''Globes'' is Naama Sikuler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globes.co.il/en/article-naama-sikuler-appointed-globes-editor-1001198230|title=Naama Sikuler appointed "Globes" editor|last=|first=|date=23 July 2017|work=Globes|access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the regular contributors to the newspaper are Yoav Karni, Tal Schneider, Eli Tsipori, Matti Golan, Stella Korin-Lieber, and Dror Foer.

==''Globes'' sections and inserts==
''Globes'' is distributed each night Sunday through Thursday, with two major parts:

==History==
Hanes was founded in 1900 by John Wesley Hanes at [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston, North Carolina]] under the name Shamrock Knitting Mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/northwest-almanac-shamrock-knitting-mills-helped-build-winston-salem/article_1da40381-c52f-52de-995d-44ca40e53991.html|title=Northwest Almanac: Shamrock Knitting Mills helped build Winston-Salem|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=2018-03-19|accessdate=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1903. In 1911, Shamrock Knitting Mills built a new plant at 3rd and Marshall Streets; it was sold in 1926 and occupied by a [[Cadillac]] dealership after a larger plant was built on West 14th Street.  Known as [[Shamrock Mills]], the original building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  Shamrock Knitting Mills was named Hanes Hosiery Mills Company in 1914.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | author=Gwynne S. Taylor | title=Shamrock Mills | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =n.d.| url = http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/FY0014.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2014-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wesley Hanes' brother Pleasant H. Hanes founded the [[P.H. Hanes Knitting Company]] in 1901.  The brothers previously operated a tobacco manufacturing business, that they sold to [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] in 1900.  The P.H. Hanes Knitting Company merged with Hanes Hosiery in 1965. The P.H. Hanes Knitting Company complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref name = nrhpinv1&gt;{{Cite web | author=Sherry Joines Wyatt | title=P.H.

In September 2006, [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]] Corporation [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] its branded clothing Americas and Asia business as a separate company called [[Hanesbrands Inc.]], which designs, manufactures, sources and sells a broad range of clothing essentials. The company's portfolio of brands include Hanes (its largest brand), [[Champion (sportswear)|Champion]] (its second largest brand), [[Playtex]] (its third largest brand), [[Bali (lingerie)|Bali]], Just My Size, Barely There, [[Wonderbra]], [[L’eggs]], C9 by Champion, Duofold, Beefy-T, Outer Banks, Sol y Oro, Rinbros, Zorba and Ritmo.

==Advertising==
During the 1970s and 1980s, their women's hosiery tagline was "Gentlemen Prefer Hanes". In the early 1990s, the slogan was turned around as "The lady prefers Hanes".{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

From 1992 to 1999, the brand's main slogan was "Just wait'll we get our Hanes on you."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/24/business/media/hanes-revives-a-successful-campaign-from-the-90s.html|title=Hanes Revives a Successful Campaign From the 90's|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=2005-02-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan was revived in 2005, with celebrity endorsements including  [[Michael Jordan]], [[Damon Wayans]], [[Matthew Perry]] and Marisa Tomei, as "Look who we've got our Hanes on now."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 2000s, an ad campaign began for their Hanes "Go Tagless" [[T-shirt]], featuring various celebrities including Jordan, Phillip Brooke, Big Ben Kennedy, [[Jackie Chan]], and [[Brian Regan (comedian)|Brian Regan]].

As of July 2008, [[Charlie Sheen]] joined Jordan as the next Hanes celebrity spokesman. The commercials (along with the previous Cuba Gooding, Jr. commercials) were created by writer [[Brett Baker]] and Art Director David McKay of The Martin Agency in Richmond, Virginia. Hanesbrands has ended its advertising campaign featuring Sheen because of domestic violence charges filed against the actor in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2010-01-06-sheen-hanes_N.htm|title=Hanes drops ads featuring Charlie Sheen|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=7 January 2010|date=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">[[File:Jean-Pierre Pescatore (tableau).jpg|thumb|357x357px]]
'''Jean-Pierre Pescatore '''(11 March 1793 - 9 December 1855)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondation.lu/Fr/Fondation/textes--jean-pierre-pescatore-biographie-succinct|title=Jean-Pierre PESCATORE – Biographie succinct|website=www.fondation.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Luxembourgish-French businessman, banker, art collector, and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Born in [[Luxembourg City]] as the fourth child of Dominique Pescatore, a merchant in the city, and Marie-Madelaine Geschwind, he came from a family of colonial commodity traders, originally from [[Ticino]], who had settled in Luxembourg in 1736. In 1811, at the age of 18, he enlisted in the army of [[Napoleon]]. Promoted to ''[[Maréchal des logis]]'' in 1813, after several campaigns he deserted and returned to Luxembourg in 1814.

He then entered the world of business and took to selling tobacco like his father and grandfather. Together with his brother Antoine, he was the director from 1814 to 1816 and then again from 1822 to 1844 of the tobacco factory in the [[Fishmarket]] neighbourhood which had been founded by their grandfather Jules Joseph Antoine Pescatore.

==Marriages==
In 1816 he married Marguerite Beving,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and settled with her in Luxembourg City. She died of illness, and without children, in June 1821.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1837 Pescatore met the Swiss Anne-Cathérine Weber, with whom he lived together and whom he married in 1851 in the church (but not civilly), in order to render this relation acceptable to the public. Due to this confusion there were arguments after his death about the inheritance.

==Move to France==
In 1817 he received long-term permission from the French authorities to import Havana tobacco to France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pescatore's good relations with the ''Régie française des tabacs'', the Belgian annexation of the French-speaking part of Luxembourg in 1839, and Luxembourg's accession to the [[Zollverein]] (the German customs union), exposing Luxembourgish tobacco manufacturing to strong competition from abroad, were damaging to Pescatore's business interests in the Grand-Duchy. He therefore established himself in [[Paris]], in order to concentrate solely on the French markets, and would become a naturalised French citizen on 3 September 1846. In addition to trading in tobacco, he also dabbled in finance, founding the bank "J.P. Pescatore et Cie" on 27 December 1844 with the Austrian Frédéric Adolphe Grieninger.

==Property and hobbies==
On 11 August 1844 he bought the [[Chateau de la Celle Saint-Cloud|Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud]] from the Viscount de Morel-Vindé's heirs.&lt;nowiki/&gt; In 1849 he also bought a vineyard at [[Médoc]], near [[Giscours]]. In 1852 he became mayor of [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]], which he remained until his death.

Jean-Pierre Pescatore had various hobbies, including collecting works of art, rare plant specimens and breeding horses. He acquired paintings and drawings from prestigious backgrounds, such as the galleries of the [[King of the Netherlands]] and of [[Louis Philippe I]]. He amassed more than 800 plant specimens, including a collection of the first [[orchid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in France, with the help of [[Jean Linden]]. The latter named a publication with orchids from his collection, ''Pescatorea. ''[[Empress Eugénie]], and her husband [[Napoleon III]], came to see the collection twice. Pescatore renovated his château to house his fragile plants, constructing an orangery and three greenhouses. He became president of the horticultural society of Seine-et-Oise and of the floral society of Versailles. A recipient of the [[Légion d'honneur]], in 1852 he was also appointed Consul-General of the Netherlands. He died on 9 December 1855 at his Paris house, and was buried in [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]]. He left the considerable sum of 10 millions francs. Without a direct heir, his inheritance was the subject of a dispute between his partner, Anne Catherine Weber, and his other heirs.

Finally, the Château de La Celle was awarded to his niece, Elisabeth (Lily) Dutreux-Pescatore, with [[usufruct]] for life to Anne Catherine Weber. The heirs of Pescatore-Dutreux owned the château until 1951.

In 1940, [[Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]] stopped at the Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud for a few days, while fleeing the German [[invasion of Luxembourg]]. The Germans then occupied the castle until August 1944. After the liberation of France, Auguste Dutreux regained his property. He donated the castle and its gardens, to the [[French Foreign Ministry]] on 7 February 1951, which still owns it today.

==Legacy==
In 1853 he donated half a million francs to Luxembourg City, in order to build an old people's home, the later ''Fondation Pescatore'', opened in 1892. The city also received his art collection, housed in the Musée Jean-Pierre Pescatore, on the first floor of the town hall. In 1953 it was moved to the [[Villa Vauban]].

In 2005 the Luxembourgish postal service put out a stamp commemorating his philanthropy in the Grand Duchy. Two streets are also named after him, one in La Celle Saint-Cloud and one in Luxembourg.

He was born at the Tyler estate, [[Sherwood Forest Plantation]], near [[Charles City, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Sherwood Forest Genealogy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherwoodforest.org/Genealogy.html |title=Genealogy of John Tyler at Sherwood Forest Plantation |author= |date=January 27, 2009 |location=Charles City, VA, USA |publisher=[[Sherwood Forest Plantation|Sherwood Forest Plantation Foundation]] |accessdate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Civil War==
After the death of his father, at age 14 he ran away from home to enlist in the [[Confederate States Army]], but was rejected as too young. His mother, [[Julia Gardiner Tyler]], eventually allowed him to join the [[Confederate States Navy]] because it had a lesser casualty rate than the Confederate Army. However, Tyler spent most of his time on a ship quarantined due to [[yellow fever]] and left naval service in 1864. After attending college for three months, he left and joined the First Virginia Battalion of Artillery under General [[Robert E. Lee]], just prior to Lee's surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], which effectively ended the war.&lt;ref name="Quinn-Musgrove"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Quinn-Musgrove |first1=Sandra L |last2=Kanter |first2=Sanford |title=America's royalty : all the presidents' children |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6egBFIqZJQC&amp;dq=editions:gcQKbp0nHrgC&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22john%20alexander%20tyler%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22john%20alexander%20tyler%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 25, 2012 |year=1995 |origyear=1983 |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |location=Westport, CT, USA |isbn=978-1-56750-893-2 |oclc=501482396 |pages=64–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite book |last1=Todd |first1=Charles Burr |authorlink1=Charles Burr Todd |editor1-first=Henry Reed |editor1-last=Stiles  |editor1-link=Henry Reed Stiles |title=In olde New York; sketches of old times and places in both the state and the city |url=https://archive.org/stream/inoldenewyorkske00toddch#page/174/mode/2up |accessdate=February 25, 2012 |type= |edition= |series=The Grafton historical series |year=1907 |publisher=The Grafton press |location=New York, NY |oclc=3985699 |pages=174–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==
In 1865, he and his brother, [[David Gardiner Tyler]], traveled to [[Germany]] to attend college, where he studied in [[Karlsruhe|Carlsruhe]], [[Baden]] and [[Freiberg, Saxony]]&lt;!--[[Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg]]?--&gt; to become a [[Mining engineering|mining engineer]]. Still in Germany in 1870 at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Tyler enlisted in the [[Prussian Army]] and joined the [[1st Guards Uhlans|First Uhlan]] regiment under the command of King [[John of Saxony]]. He served with distinction in the occupation of [[France]] in 1871.&lt;ref name="Quinn-Musgrove"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Todd/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1873, Tyler returned to the United States and attempted to find work as a mining engineer near [[Salt Lake City]], but was unable to find a position, probably due to the [[Long Depression|Depression of 1873–79]]. Although he did find a job with a railroad, the salary did not allow him to meet his debts, and he had financial problems until he married a wealthier [[Cousin#Explanation chart|third cousin]], [[Sarah Griswold Gardiner]],&lt;ref name="Quinn-Musgrove"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LIHS&gt;{{cite journal |author=Long Island historical society |journal=The Long Island historical journal |page=16 |location=Stony Brook, NY |publisher=Dept. of History, [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]] |issn=0898-7084 |oclc=754563051 |accessdate=February 25, 2012 |title=Julia's son John Alexander Tyler, who married Sarah (Sally) Griswold Gardiner, a third cousin ... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAoqAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22John+Alexander+Tyler%22+OR+%22John+Alex+Tyler%22&amp;dq=%22John+Alexander+Tyler%22+OR+%22John+Alex+Tyler%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6HZJT8HcJIOSiQLc_-DcDQ&amp;ved=0CIkCEOgBMCU }}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 5, 1875.&lt;ref name=Welles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welles |first1=Albert |title=History of the Buell family in England : from the remotest times ascertainable from our ancient histories, and in America, from town, parish, church and family records ... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ma4aAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22John%20Alexander%20Tyler%22%20OR%20%22John%20Alex%20Tyler%22&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Alexander%20Tyler%22%20OR%20%22John%20Alex%20Tyler%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 25, 2012 |series=Genealogy &amp; local history, G32 |year=1881 |publisher=Society Library |location=New York, NY |oclc=181016428 |at=p. 303, 6.

'''Henry John Heinz III''' (October 23, 1938&amp;nbsp;– April 4, 1991) was an [[United States|American]] businessman and politician from [[Pennsylvania]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Heinz served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1971 to 1977, and in the [[United States Senate]] from 1977 until he was killed in a plane crash in [[Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania]], in 1991.&lt;ref name=congbio&gt;{{cite web|title=HEINZ, Henry John, III, (1938 - 1991)|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000456|publisher=Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and early career==
Henry John Heinz III was born on October 23, 1938, in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, the son of Joan (Diehl) and [[H. J. Heinz II]], heir to the [[H. J. Heinz Company]]. An only child, Heinz moved to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], with his mother and stepfather, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Captain Clayton Chot "Monty" McCauley following his parents' divorce in 1942. Although he was raised and primarily resided in San Francisco throughout his childhood, Heinz often spent the summer months with his father in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: In His Own Words|url=http://www.johnheinzlegacy.org/heinz/johnheinz.html|work=John Heinz and the Heinz Family|publisher=Senator John Heinz Regional History Center|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Heinz graduated from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].&lt;ref name=congbio/&gt; He then attended and graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1960, majoring in History, Arts and Letters, and subsequently graduated from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1963. It was during his years at Harvard, during summer break, that he met his future wife, [[Teresa Heinz|Teresa Simões Ferreira]], who attended the [[University of Geneva]]. Upon graduating from Harvard Business School in 1963, Heinz served in the [[United States Air Force Reserve]] and was on active duty during the same year.&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt; He remained in the Air Force Reserve until 1969.&lt;ref name=congbio/&gt;

Before entering politics, Heinz served as an assistant to Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senator [[Hugh Scott]] and played an active role as assistant campaign manager during Scott's campaign for re-election. Heinz then worked in the financial and marketing division of the H. J. Heinz Company between 1965 and 1970, after which he became a professor of business at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Tepper School of Business|Graduate School of Industrial Administration]].&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt;

==Political career==

===U.S. House of Representatives===
In 1971, Heinz entered politics after Representative [[Robert J. Corbett|Robert Corbett]], who represented [[Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district]], died in office. After winning the Republican primary, Heinz won the special election on November 2, 1971, to fill the vacancy created by Corbett's death. Heinz was re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1972|1972]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1974|1974]].&lt;ref name=congbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt;

===U.S. Senate===
Heinz opted not to run for re-election to his seat in the House of Representatives, choosing instead in 1976 to run for Pennsylvania's open [[United States Senate]] seat created by the retirement of incumbent [[Hugh Scott]]. Heinz won the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1976|election]], and was subsequently re-elected in [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1982|1982]] and in [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1988|1988]].&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt;

In the Senate, Heinz was a moderate-to-liberal Republican.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/05/obituaries/john-heinz-52-heir-to-a-fortune-and-senator-from-pennsylvania.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]], the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Committee on Finance]], the [[Greenspan Commission|National Commission on Social Security Reform]], the National Commission on Health Care Reform, the Northeast Coalition, and the Steel Caucus. He also served as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policies, the [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging|Special Committee on Aging]], and the Republican Conference Task Force on Job Training and Education.&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt;

He was elected chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] for two terms, 1979-1981 and 1985-1987.

The ''New York Times'' noted that Heinz built a solid record in the Senate as "a persistent defender of the nation's growing elderly population and of the declining steel industry", that he was "instrumental in pushing through legislation that put the Social Security system on sounder financial footing," and "played a major role in strengthening laws regulating retirement policies, pension plans, health insurance and nursing homes", and "pushed successfully for trade laws that encourage American exports and protect American products, like steel, from foreign imports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ayres|first1=B.

==Death==
{{Main|Merion air disaster}}
On April 4, 1991, Heinz and six other people, including two children, were killed when a Sun Co. Aviation Department [[Bell 412]] helicopter and a [[Piper Aerostar]] with Heinz aboard collided in mid-air above [[Lower Merion School District|Merion Elementary School]] in [[Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania]]. All aboard both aircraft, as well as two children at the school, were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berry|first=Lynn|title=Sen.

Heinz's long time friend, [[Tim Wirth|Senator Tim Wirth]] of Colorado, remarked: "He really believed he could make the world a better place, such a contrast to the jaded resignation of our time. He could send the Senate leadership up a wall faster than anyone I've seen." Heinz's son André said at the services: "Dad, I am so grateful for the time we had, and I miss you and I love you."&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LLgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KrUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=masloff%20grateful&amp;pg=2352%2C1755232&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinz's widow, [[Teresa Heinz]], in 1995 married Heinz's U.S. Senate colleague and future Secretary of State [[John Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Kerry|url=http://www.johnkerry.com/pages/about/|publisher=Senator John Kerry|accessdate=11 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65104goTA?url=http://www.johnkerry.com/pages/about/|archivedate=27 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum]] (formerly known as the Tinicum Wildlife Preserve) was renamed in his honor following his death. The 1,200 acre (4.9&amp;nbsp;km²) refuge includes the largest remaining freshwater tidal [[marsh]] in Pennsylvania, as well as other habitats that are home to a variety of plants and animals native to Southeastern Pennsylvania.

His family established the [[Heinz Award]]s in 1993, which honor individual innovation in five categories. One of the [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service]] annual awards, for "Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official", is named in his honor.

Several institutions bear his name, including:

'''José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz''' (13 August 1925 – 16 March 2013) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] executive and policy maker. He served as Minister of the Economy under ''de facto'' President [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] between 1976 and 1981, and shaped economic policy during the [[National Reorganization Process]] [[military dictatorship]].

==Biography==

===Early career===
Martínez de Hoz, scion of one Argentina's oldest cattle ranching families, was born in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.  Pursuing higher studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], he returned and in 1955, following the coup against President [[Juan Domingo Perón]], he was appointed his province's Minister of the Economy.  Though democracy returned to Argentina three years later, the [[Military of Argentina|armed forces]] continued to exercise vetting power over most policy and in 1963, Martínez de Hoz became one of a series of conservative Argentine Economy Ministers during [[Jose Maria Guido]]'s brief presidency (an interlude marked by squabbles among the military brass and recession).

Becoming an influential lobbyist for [[Acindar]], one of Argentina's largest steel manufacturers, Martínez de Hoz became its CEO in 1968.  Seven years later, after union labourers at Acindar's [[Villa Constitución]] plant elected a socialist [[shop steward]], Martínez de Hoz retaliated by using his family's long-standing connections with the armed forces to have them brutally repressed. Supported by Metalworkers Union leader [[Lorenzo Miguel]], security forces abducted the new shop steward, Alberto Piccinini, and about 300 others (most of whom were murdered).&lt;ref name=rio&gt;[http://www.rionegro.com.ar/diario/tools/imprimir.php?id=9132 Significativa propuesta realizada a Acindar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125024159/http://www.rionegro.com.ar/diario/tools/imprimir.php?id=9132 |date=25 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work as Minister of Economy===
By 1975, Argentina had considerably developed, but was nevertheless in the throes of some of the worst instability since 1930. Argentine public opinion turned to the [[Military of Argentina|military]], who deposed [[Isabel Perón]]'s weak regime in a [[March 1976 coup]]. Inheriting a wave of violence and 700% inflation, the new regime called on Martínez de Hoz, appointing him Minister of the Economy. Anxious to restore business confidence, announced a plan to further open Argentina's markets, believing that the country's national industry was inefficient and uncompetitive internationally. He moved to lessen Argentina's trade barriers quickly, which he believed to be a cause of economic isolation. He enjoyed the personal friendship of [[David Rockefeller]], who facilitated [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] loans of nearly US$1&amp;nbsp;billion following his appointment.&lt;ref name=saga&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-89533-La-saga-de-los-Martinez-de-Hoz-y-el-banquero-arrepentido.html Buenos Aires Económico: La saga de los Martínez de Hoz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710180711/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-89533-La-saga-de-los-Martinez-de-Hoz-y-el-banquero-arrepentido.html |date=10 July 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He decreed a general freeze on wages, and instituted a [[value-added tax]] while rescinding the [[inheritance tax]]. As a result of the changes instituted by Martínez de Hoz, inflation fell sharply; but, many local retailers and home builders became incapable of coping with the fall in demand and declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=LewisA&gt;Lewis, Paul.''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, the billion-dollar trade deficit had turned around and business investment had soared by about 25%. However, real wages had lost nearly 40% of their purchasing power, and while consumer spending remained weak, the shock might have been worse but for hitherto high savings rates. Inflation revived again, and Martínez de Hoz responded in June 1977, with deregulation of the financial markets, removing checks on banks and transferring responsibility for any bad loans to the state, which took charge of their debt as needed.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, Eduardo. ''Argentina: A House Divided''. St. Martin's Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]], like many key economic posts in the Martínez de Hoz era, was led by one of a number of [[Chicago Boys]]: [[Adolfo Diz]]. Diz enacted much of the Economy Minister's [[Big Bang (financial markets)|financial deregulation]] policy, while moving to limit domestic credit. He enacted the Monetary Regulation Account Law of 1977, which raised [[reserve requirement]]s to 45% of deposits, thereby doubling borrowers' interest rates while eliminating yields on [[demand deposit]]s.&lt;ref name=pablo&gt;[http://www.ucema.edu.ar/publicaciones/download/documentos/149.pdf de Pablo, Juan Carlos. ''Economists and Economic Policy: Argentina since 1958.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-term [[shadow banking|financial speculation]] flourished, while chronic [[tax evasion]] and budget deficits remained high. Frequent wage freeze decrees continued to depress living standards generally and income inequality increased.&lt;ref name="LewisB" /&gt;
During his tenure, the [[foreign debt]] increased fourfold, and disparities between the upper and lower classes became much more pronounced.&lt;ref name=LewisB&gt;Lewis, Paul.''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The period ended in a [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|tenfold devaluation]] and one of the worst financial crises in Argentine history.&lt;ref&gt;''Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth'', [[World Bank]] Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Sweet money"====
Again in recession by 1978, the economy continued to be saddled with inflation around 175%. Image-conscious and so, fearful of possible riots, Martínez de Hoz relented and in December, he issued new, more generous wage guidelines.  To address his fellow conservatives' fear that this might lead to even higher inflation, he introduced a novel take on the currency [[crawling peg]]: fixed, progressively smaller devaluations of the official [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|exchange rate]] between the [[Peso ley|Argentine peso]] and the US dollar set by a monthly timetable, popularly known as the ''Tablita''.

The ''Tablita'' invariably set a slower depreciation of the [[Peso ley|peso]] value than what local inflation warranted and although inflation did ease somewhat, imported goods and foreign credit soon became much cheaper than those locally available. Imports almost tripled in volume and by 1980, the peso became one of the most overvalued currencies in the world; its high purchasing power abroad soon had many referring to it as ''plata dulce'' ("sweet money").  Record numbers of Argentines now vacationed abroad, often stocking up on appliances; between the suddenly negative trade deficit and tourists' foreign spending, however, this chalked up a then-record US$4&amp;nbsp;billion annual loss for the national balance sheet in both 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref name="LewisB" /&gt;

Having already suffered from weakened demand, many industries (particularly smaller factories) could not compete with the flood of imports and a second wave of industry bankruptcies began.  Ostensibly to avoid a sharp rise in unemployment, Martínez de Hoz took an even more controversial step when he decided to begin absorbing private sector debts (mostly those of the well-connected, including US$700&amp;nbsp;million of Acindar's)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weblogs.clarin.com/secretos/archives/2007/07/acindar-inversiones-millonarias-en-medio-de-los-cortes-de-energia.html Inversiones millonarias en medio de los cortes de energía] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907080513/http://weblogs.clarin.com/secretos/archives/2007/07/acindar-inversiones-millonarias-en-medio-de-los-cortes-de-energia.html |date=7 September 2008 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the national debt. One of his chief business interests, the insolvent ''Compañía Italo Argentina de Electricidad'', was [[nationalised]] at his orders at a reported cost of US$394&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=saga/&gt;

The economy was still in relatively high gear and, with rising fiscal revenues, the nation's finances appeared healthy during 1979 and 1980.&lt;ref name="LewisB" /&gt; Secretly, however (as much of this data was censored at time), local speculators were taking advantage of the overvalued peso by taking up over US$30&amp;nbsp;billion in loans overseas.&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Magazine''. Argentina's New Beginning, August 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; This money soon found itself in risky gambles at home and abroad and when one bank's [[Ponzi scheme]] collapsed in March 1980, Martínez de Hoz responded to the possible panic by luring investors with one-year [[Treasury security|treasury bills]], paying 60% in US dollars. Facing these pressures, the Argentine peso increasingly became the object of [[Short (finance)|short-selling]] by [[Insider trading|insiders]], including Martínez de Hoz himself.&lt;ref name=rio/&gt;

====Circular 1050 and the shattered Tablita====
[[File:Martinez.de.ogv|thumb|250px|Martínez de Hoz addresses the nation in a 12 March 1981, farewell address]]
The end of his tenure soon near and increasingly unpopular, in April 1980 Martínez de Hoz had the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] promulgate new regulations governing adjustable loans. The Central Bank Circular 1050 tied monthly loan interest payments (almost all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable basis) to the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis the peso.  Borrowers were confident that the gradual peso devaluations would continue on schedule and new homeowners rushed to secure (or refinance) mortgages at these favourable terms.&lt;ref name=pablo/&gt; Brokerage houses proliferated as [[put options]] against the peso increased sharply and in February 1981, Martínez de Hoz announced the unthinkable: the time had come for a sharp [[devaluation]]. The ''Tablita'' was shattered and he retired the following month.&lt;ref name="LewisB" /&gt;

What followed was one of the worst financial crises in the history of modern Argentina. Speculators quickly took advantage of the 1977 deregulation to write off their debts, legitimate borrowers (including many large employers) were faced with suddenly unaffordable US dollar payments and homeowners' monthly payments (tied by the Circular 1050 to the [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|value of the Dollar]]), rose by over tenfold during the next fifteen months.&lt;ref&gt;''Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth''. World Bank Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
It took defeat during the disastrous Malvinas [[Falklands War|War]] in June 1982, to usher in more moderate leadership in the junta. In July, the new Central Bank President, [[Domingo Cavallo]], rescinded the hated "1050". Thousands were saved from financial ruin by this change, but the economic damage would remain.

Business confidence was destroyed by the whole calamity and even though Argentina's productive [[Agriculture of Argentina|Agricultural sector]] brought in over US$34&amp;nbsp;billion in trade surpluses over the next eight years, none of it sufficed to deal with chronic capital flight or the newly monstrous public debt (US$7&amp;nbsp;billion at the start of the dictatorship, it had grown to US$43&amp;nbsp;billion by the time of the restoration of democracy in 1983).&lt;ref name="LewisB" /&gt;

Martínez de Hoz was himself indicted in 1988 for his involvement in the [[Dirty War|human rights abuses]] at Acindar and spent 77 days in jail. Quickly freed, he finally benefited from a [[pardon]] by President [[Carlos Menem]] in 1990. Returning to world of high finance despite a 1992 conviction of operating a brokerage with a revoked licence, Martínez de Hoz became a member of the board of directors of two [[Arbitrage]] houses: Rohm Group and the ''Banco General de Negocios'' ("General Business Bank").

The General Business Bank, now defunct, later helped clients illegally wire up to US$30 billion out of the country prior to its [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|December 2001 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasescolar.com.ar/NewsArchives/53/10/archivo-zj3981_esen.shtml Atlas Escolar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531161156/http://www.atlasescolar.com.ar/NewsArchives/53/10/archivo-zj3981_esen.shtml |date=31 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a judge declared the pardon [[Constitution of Argentina|unconstitutional]] and revoked the suspension of the judicial process dictated before, thus leaving the way open to investigate Martínez de Hoz's alleged involvement in the [[kidnapping]] and [[extortion]] of Federico and Miguel Gutheim (a local textile mill owner and his son) in 1976, as well as the murder of Juan Carlos Casariego (one of his own assistants at the Ministry of Economy).

Martinez de Hoz was arrested on 5 April 2007, following a Supreme Court ruling deeming the 1990 presidential pardons unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gvZLGXsj5yFCTAeSscgNwUzfx_vw Argentina arrests former dictator's top money man (AFP)]&lt;/ref&gt; and was given a preliminary sentence of [[house arrest]] (due to his advanced age) on 4 May 2010, pursuant to his indictment in the Gutheim case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobae.com/politica/527879-101275-0-Martinez-Hoz-fue-trasladado-su-domicilio-recibir-el-alta ''InfoBAE'': Martínez de Hoz fue trasladado a su domicilio tras recibir el alta] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lee Chapel''' is a National Historic Landmark in [[Lexington, Virginia]], on the campus of [[Washington and Lee University]]. It was constructed during 1867–68 at the request of [[Robert E. Lee]], who was President of the University (then known as Washington College) at the time, and after whom the building is named. The Victorian brick architectural design was probably the work of his son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]], with details contributed by Col. Thomas Williamson, an architect and professor of engineering at the neighboring [[Virginia Military Institute]]. General Lee, along with much of the rest of the Lexington community, attended church services at Grace Episcopal Church, a hundred yards south, at the edge of the college campus. (In 1903, that church was renamed R. E. Lee Memorial Episcopal Church; in 2017, its governing board voted to change its name back to Grace Episcopal Church.)

When Lee died in 1870, he was buried beneath the chapel. His body remains there to this day, and for this reason among others, the Chapel is one of Lexington's major historical tourist attractions.

[[File:RobertLeeMonument.jpg|thumb|left|"Recumbent Statue" of Robert E. Lee asleep on the battlefield, by [[Edward Valentine]]. Located in the Lee Chapel in [[Lexington, Virginia]], it is often mistakenly thought to be a tomb or [[sarcophagus]], but Lee is actually buried beneath the chapel. In the summer of 2014, the replica Confederate flags pictured in this photo were removed from the chapel after student protests.]]
A centerpiece on the stage of the chapel—where the pulpit would be in a less secular place of worship—is a statue of Lee, in his uniform, asleep on the battlefield (the "Recumbent Lee"), designed by [[Edward Valentine]]. On the walls are two paintings: one of General Washington himself, by [[Charles Willson Peale]], from the Washington family collections, and the other of Lee in his uniform, painted by Edward Pine. There is also a plaque given by the [[Sigma Society]] on one of the walls that honors two Sigma alumni from the classes of 1912 and 1915 who lost their lives in World War I.

In the basement a crypt (added after Lee's burial) contains the remains of much of Lee's direct family: the General himself, his wife [[Mary Custis Lee|Mary]], his seven children, and his parents—[[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee]], who had been a general during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and Anne Carter Lee. Lee's favorite horse, [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]], is buried just outside the Chapel, where students of Washington and Lee traditionally leave coins or apples in hopes of being compensated with good fortune in their studies. In the basement of the Chapel is a museum that illuminates the history of the family of [[George Washington]] and Lee as well as that of the university itself. Lee's office has been meticulously preserved in almost exactly the same condition as it was when he died.

Chapel plays a role in the modern operation of Washington and Lee. It seats about 600 in its main area and in a small, three-sided balcony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3570">'''Mustaq Ahmad''' co-founded one of Singapore’s local retail giants – the Mustafa Shopping Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nureza|first1=Ahmad|title=Mohamed Mustafa and Samsudin Co Pte Ltd|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_442_2005-02-03.html|publisher=Singapore Infopedia|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Forbes]] ranked him Number 37 in their list of Singapore's 40 Richest People.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore's 40 Richest|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/79/singapore-billionaires-22_Mustaq-Ahmad_2LF2.html|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ahmad was born June 8, 1951 in City Jaunpur [[Uttar Pradesh, India]].  In 1956 he moved to Singapore to join his father, following the death of his mother.

==Budding entrepreneur==
From when he was just a boy, Ahmad showed a keen interest in the business world.  He set up a stall next to his father’s, where he sold handkerchiefs that he had purchased with his own money.  This stall inspired his father to move over to garment (from his food stall) business in Campbell Lane.  He left school early (he was a student at [[Christ Church Secondary School]]) so that he could start his own business. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ong|first1=Isabel|title=Mustaq Ahmad|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1164_2009-03-10.html|publisher=Singapore Infopedia|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 he rented a space at No.1, Campbell Lane as started his business selling ready made garments under the name of Mustaq Ahmad.  Within two years he had done so well that since lease was expiring he started looking for new places to continue the business.

In 1973 he secured new places at 19 Campbell Lane and 67 Serangoon road. His father and uncle named it Mohamed Mustafa &amp; Samsuddin.

==Innovative business ideas==
It was while he was still just a teenager, helping his father that the idea of selling products at a [[fixed price]] came to him. At the time, this was quite a revolution away from current business practices.  This greatly pleased customers who appreciated competitive pricing without the need for bargaining.

==Mustafa Centre==
It was when rent on the store escalated by 70 percent that Mustafa felt it was time to buy. He purchased 20 stores on Syed Alwi Road which he converted to a 75,000 square foot department store containing a hotel with 130 rooms that opened in 1995 but was open to business as a 24-hour-a-day store, in 2003.

[[Mustafa Centre]] has since expanded to the building across Verdun Road and has more than 250,000 wide-ranging products including produce and appliances.  The Centre is also home to: a jewel mart, money-changing services, a pharmacy, postal services, supermarket and travel services.

Together with the store he reopened at Serangoon Plaza following its 2004 renovation, his empire turns over a staggering $302m per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mustaq Ahmad: The founding father of Mustafa Centre|url=http://southasiandiaspora.org/index.php/archives/317|publisher=South Asian Diaspora|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The [[Singapore Tourism Board]] named Mustaq “Tourism Entrepreneur of the Year” in 2004. He received this because of his great contribution to the country’s tourism industry, since his stores are a “must-visit” destination for the hundreds of thousands of Indian tourists that come each year.

==Early life and high school==
Galis was born in [[Union City, New Jersey]]. The child of a poor immigrant family, from the Greek islands of [[Rhodes]] and [[Nisyros]], Galis took up [[boxing]] in his early years, after his father, George Georgalis, who had also been a boxer in his youth. He was later persuaded to give up boxing by his mother, Stella Georgalis, who was terrified after each time that her son would return home from boxing training with a new facial injury. As a result, Galis started playing the sport of basketball instead of boxing. He attended [[Union Hill High School]], in Union City, where he also played high school basketball.&lt;ref name="fibaeurope.com"/&gt;

==College career==
After high school, Galis enrolled at [[Seton Hall University]], where he played [[college basketball]] as a member of the [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]]. In his senior season, Galis saw his scoring average reach 27.5 points per game, which was third in the nation, behind [[Idaho State Bengals men's basketball|Idaho State's]] [[Lawrence Butler (basketball)|Lawrence Butler]] (30.1 points per game) and [[Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball|Indiana State's]] [[Larry Bird]] (28.6 points per game),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Magic Keeps Bird In Hand |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123258/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |publisher= |date=1980-03-13 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a 48-point outburst against the [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|University of Santa Clara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/sacl/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/cablecar-history-12300.pdf|title=Cable Car Classic Records.|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also in his senior year of college, Galis won the [[Haggerty Award]] (the New York City metro area's best player award), and the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] Player of the Year award. The same year, he also played in the Pizza Hut All-American game, alongside Bird and [[Vinnie Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Galis and Larry Bird (Pizza Hut All American Game 1979) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUdOiTjIcxo |work=Youtube|publisher= |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 4 year college career, Galis played in a total of 107 games and scored 1,651 points, for a career scoring average of 15.4 points per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/nick-galis-1.html|title=Nick Galis College Stats - College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Galis' head coach at Seton Hall, [[Bill Raftery|Billy Raftery]], would later state that Galis was the best player he ever coached. While at Seton Hall, Galis was a good friend and roommate of [[Italian-American]] professional basketball player [[Dan Callandrillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2017/09/08/insane-nick-galis-journey-naismith-hall-fame-took-off-seton-hall/646390001/|title=For 'insane' Nick Galis, journey to Naismith Hall of Fame took off at Seton Hall|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galis was later inducted into the [[Seton Hall]] Athletic Hall of Fame, in 1991.

==Professional career==
===Boston Celtics===
After finishing his collegiate career in 1979, Galis signed with agent Bill Manon, who also managed [[Diana Ross]]. Manon did not have Galis work out with any [[NBA]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interbasket.net/players/galis.htm|title=Nikos Galis, Greece - Player Profiles by Interbasket|website=www.interbasket.net|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galis was eventually selected by the [[Boston Celtics]] in the 4th round of the [[1979 NBA Draft]], 68th overall. Due to a severe ankle injury that Galis suffered during the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]] preseason training camp of the [[1979–80 Boston Celtics season|1979–80 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/08/31/euroleague-legend-nikos-galis-made-mark-five-greek-league-mvp-awards|title=2017 Hall of Fame: Euroleague legend, cast of NCAA standouts get their due - NBA.com|first=Scott|last=Howard-Cooper|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the franchise was no longer interested in offering him a contract because [[Gerald Henderson]] had taken his place on the team, and his injury would keep him out for the foreseeable future. 

Galis then decided to pursue a professional career in [[Greece]]'s top-tier level [[Greek Basket League|Basket League]]. Later, while still playing in Greece, he would be offered [[NBA]] contracts by the Celtics and the [[New Jersey Nets]]. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, [[FIBA]] did not have [[professional sports|professional]] status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the [[national sports team|national team]] level. Since playing with the senior [[Greek national basketball team|Greek national team]] meant so much to him, he stayed in Greece. Celtics legend [[Red Auerbach]] later said that the single biggest mistake he ever made in his career was not keeping Galis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/event-guide/p/nid/41921/legend-bio.html# |title=Fiba official website, Tribute to Nikos Galis |access-date=2010-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107144242/http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/event-guide/p/nid/41921/legend-bio.html# |archive-date=2010-11-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticslife.com/2011/10/top-5-celtics-that-never-were-5-nick.html|title=Top 5 Celtics That Never Were-   #5: Nick Galis|website=www.celticslife.com|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aris Thessaloniki===
[[File:Nikos Galis Keith Williams.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Galis (on the right), and [[Keith Williams (basketball)|Keith Williams]] (on the left), during a [[EuroLeague]] [[1991–92 FIBA European League|1991–92 season]] game.]]

After suffering an ankle injury in the [[Boston Celtics]] [[1979–80 Boston Celtics season|1979–80]] preseason training camp, which prevented him from receiving a contract with the Celtics, Galis made the move across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and signed to play with [[Aris BC|Aris]] of [[Thessaloniki]], Greece, in 1979. [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] had also shown some interest in signing the newcomer, but it was Aris' interest that was the most persuasive. His move to the country would eventually help Greek [[sports club|club]] basketball to reach a level of popularity that had never been previously imagined. 

Averaging more than 30 points per game every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. While playing alongside other great players at Aris such as [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[Slobodan Subotić]] (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cups]] (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European Champions' Cup]] (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Final Four|Final Four]] ([[1988 EuroLeague Final Four|'88]], [[1989 EuroLeague Final Four|'89]], and [[1990 EuroLeague Final Four|'90]]). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three of the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis of the opportunity to shine all the way on Europe's biggest club stage, at the [[EuroLeague Finals|FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals]]. The team's performances and general standard of play, however, won the hearts of most basketball fans in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters in Greece would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing games, as large segments of the country settled down to watch them on television.

After a disappointing season in 1991–92, Galis was forced to leave Aris.&lt;ref&gt;Rabotas, G., ''Nikos Galis'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The new management of the team, and the fact that the club was in decline, were the main causes for his departure. Galis, who adored the city of [[Thessaloniki]], had originally insisted on remaining in the club and playing for the team, as he believed that he still had a lot to offer the club.

===Panathinaikos Athens===
[[Image:Nikos Galis Panathinaikos 1992.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Galis with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], during the 1992–93 season.]]

Galis moved to [[Athens]] in the summer of 1992, to play with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], and he was the player who then led the "Greens" to a club rebirth, after it had suffered through a long drought period, during which the historical team remained without titles. The previous season (1991–92) had been particularly disappointing for the club, with the team finishing eighth in the Greek league. As the team's [[Captain (sports)|captain]], Galis inspired the young players of Panathinaikos, such as [[Fragiskos Alvertis]] and [[Nikos Oikonomou]], and gradually brought back hope to the team's fans. So much so, as to the point that the club's then home arena, [[Glyfada Indoor Hall]], was always overcrowded. In that season (1992–93), Panathinaikos finished second in the [[Greek Basket League|Greek league]], and won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]], which was the seventh Greek Cup title for Galis.

The following season ([[1993–94 FIBA European League|1993–94]]), Galis was the FIBA European League (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Top Scorer|Top Scorer]] averaging 23.8 points per game in 21 games, and passer, averaging 4.7 assists per game, in 21 games. In the decisive game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals, against the reigning [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] champions, [[Limoges CSP|Limoges]], Galis truly led Panathinaikos into a new club era, with their qualification to the [[1994 EuroLeague Final Four|1994 FIBA European League Final Four]], by scoring 30 points on 75% field goal shooting in the game. The "Greens" eventually finished in 3rd place in the FIBA European League that season, after losing in the semifinal, but it was still a success they had never reached before. Galis scored 30 points in the third place game against [[FC Barcelona Bàsquet|FC Barcelona]], leading all scorers in the game.

In his third season in Panthinaikos ([[1994–95 FIBA European League|1994–95]]), Galis teamed up with [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[Žarko Paspalj]], to make a strong effort to win the FIBA European League. Galis was the player who led Panathinaikos to the Top 16 group, as he prevented the elimination of Panathinaikos by [[Budivelnik Kiev]], with a team-high 23 points in the decisive second-leg victory. He was also the leader of the team in the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] win against [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], at [[Sporting Sports Arena]]. But Galis' career controversially ended on October 18, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazzetta.gr/basket/a1/item/105797-Ηταν-απλά-ο-καλύτερος Gazetta.gr Ήταν απλά ο καλύτερος {{el icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; a few games after the start of the Greek League 1994–95 season. [[Kostas Politis]], Panathinaikos' head coach at the time, chose not to include Galis in the starting line-up of a [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] game against [[Ampelokipoi B.C.|Ambelokipi]]. Galis left the court, and never again returned to playing action.&lt;ref&gt;Rabotas, G., ''Nikos Galis'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; His last game in professional basketball, was as a player of Panathinaikos, in a game against [[Dafnis B.C.|AO Dafni]], on October 12, 1994. In the game, Galis scored 8 points in 35 minutes of playing time, as his team won in a blowout, 82–60.

== Player profile ==
It has been noted that Galis was not only a legendary scorer, but that he was also a great play maker and passer. The majority of his points scored came inside the paint, due to his penetrating ability.&lt;ref name="ironman"&gt;Arbel, Y. ,"Iron Man Galis", November 08, 2006, FIBA Europe official website [http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_wro9VQVdG7cxqdc3r6woH2.coid_OetsMywJJtcKppVVZ6xGT3.articleMode_on.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Galis' mid-range jumper was one of his biggest offensive weapons, being able to consistently pull it off under pressure. His post game was excellent, as he used his strength and leaping ability to counter his lack of height. Another enormous competitive advantage that Galis possessed was his incredible stamina, which was due to his exemplary physical condition. This led to his being given the nickname of "Iron Man". At the [[EuroBasket 1987]], he was never once substituted out of any game after the second day of the competition, completing 7 games in 9 days.&lt;ref name="ironman" /&gt;

==Post-playing career==
Since his official retirement on September 29, 1995, and up until early 2006, Galis was the owner of a summer basketball camp in [[Chalkidiki]], Greece. The basketball camp is listed at the [[Athens Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.galiscamp.gr/# |title=Official website of Galis's basketball camp |access-date=2006-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904231417/http://www.galiscamp.gr/# |archive-date=2006-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a token of appreciation for his contribution to Greek sport, Galis was chosen to be the first torch bearer in the final round of the [[Olympic Flame]], for the [[Athens 2004|Athens 2004 Olympics]]. Galis entered the stadium at the conclusion of the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]], and set off the procession of the flame to the altar.

In September 2007, Galis was elected as a member of the first class of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]], which includes the best basketball players in the history of the game internationally. Galis was inducted as a player. [[Bill Russell]] of the famous [[Boston Celtics]] dynasty was another one of the 16 inaugural player inductees. Galis is also a member of the [[Eurobasket.com]] website's European Basketball Hall of Fame, inducted as a player. Galis is married to Eleni Panagiotou, and he has one daughter, named Stella.

In May 2013, his former club team [[Aris BC|Aris]], renamed their home arena to [[Nick Galis Hall]], organized a celebration of Galis' life and career, and [[Aris B.C.#Retired numbers|retired his number 6 Aris jersey]]. The event was attended by many of his teammates and opponents from the 1980s and 1990s. Attendees included Greek legends such as the majority of the [[1987 EuroBasket]] gold medal winning team, as well as international stars who played against Galis over the years, such as [[Dino Rađja]], [[Jordi Villacampa]], and [[Doron Jamchi]].

On April 1, 2017, it was announced that Galis will be inducted to the [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the 2017 class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/01/tracy-mcgrady-jerry-krause-rebecca-lobo-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-fame|title=Tracy McGrady, Jerry Krause, Rebecca Lobo headline Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class - NBA.com|first=The Associated|last=Press|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galis was accepted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2017. He became one of the very few basketball players from around the world, that joined the Hall of Fame, without having ever played in the [[NBA]]. On June 14, 2016, exactly 29 years after [[Greek national basketball team|Greece]] won the [[1987 EuroBasket|EuroBasket in 1987]], the biggest basketball arena in Greece, [[OAKA Olympic Indoor Hall]] was named 'Nikos Galis' in his honour.

== Quotes about Galis ==

''"If I'm the devil's son, then Galis is the devil himself."'', '''[[Dražen Petrović]]'''

''"If Galis wants to score, he will score no matter who's defending him."'', '''[[Arvydas Sabonis]]'''

''"I never thought that there was such a good offensive player in Europe, and especially in Greece."'', '''[[Michael Jordan]]'''

[[File:PredeterminedOverheadRate.jpg|thumb|426px|Formula for calculating the Pre-determined Overhead Rate]]
A '''pre-determined overhead rate''' is the rate used to apply [[manufacturing]] [[business process overhead|overhead]] to work-in-process [[inventory]]. The pre-determined overhead rate is calculated before the period begins. The first step is to estimate the amount of the [[Activity-based costing|activity base]] that will be required to support operations in the upcoming period. The second step is to estimate the total [[manufacturing cost]] at that level of activity. The third step is to compute the predetermined overhead rate by dividing the estimated total [[manufacturing overhead costs]] by the estimated total amount of [[cost accounting|cost driver]] or [[Activity-based costing|activity base]]. Common activity bases used in the calculation include direct [[cost|labor costs]], direct [[Working time|labor hours]], or [[machine]] hours.

This is related to an activity rate which is a similar calculation used in [[Activity-based costing]].  A pre-determined overhead rate is normally the term when using a single, plant-wide base to calculate and apply overhead.  Overhead is then applied by multiplying the pre-determined overhead rate by the ''actual'' driver units. Any difference between applied overhead and the amount of overhead actually incurred is called over- or under-applied overhead.

==The Need for a Pre-determined Rate==

Instead of using a pre-determined rate based on estimates, why not base the overhead rate on the actual total [[manufacturing overhead cost]] and the actual total amount of the [[Activity-based costing|activity base]] incurred on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis? If an actual rate is computed monthly or quarterly, seasonal factors in overhead costs or in the [[Activity-based costing|activity base]] can produce fluctuations in the overhead rate. For example, the costs of heating and cooling a factory in Illinois will be highest in the winter and summer months and lowest in the spring and fall. If the overhead rate is recomputed at the end of each month or each quarter based on actual costs and activity, the overhead rate would go up in the winter and summer and down in the spring and fall. As a result, two identical jobs, one completed in the winter and one completed in the spring, would be assigned different manufacturing overhead costs. Many managers believe that such fluctuations in product costs serve no useful purpose. To avoid such fluctuations, actual overhead rates could be computed on an annual or less-frequent basis. However, if the overhead rate is computed annually based on the actual costs and activity for the year, the manufacturing overhead assigned to any particular job would not be known until the end of the year. For example, the cost of Job 2B47 at Yost Precision Machining would not be known until the end of the year, even though the job will be completed and shipped to the customer in March. For these reasons, most companies use predetermined overhead rates rather than actual overhead rates in their cost accounting systems.

The use of such a rate enables an enterprise to determine the approximate total cost of each job when completed. In recent years increased [[automation]] in manufacturing operations has resulted in a trend towards machine hours as the activity base in the calculation.

==How to find the overhead rate==
To find the overhead rate, first determine the right [[:wikt:basis|basis]] that will describe the best the behavior of the cost. Then, divide the total budgeted overhead by the basis to calculate the overhead rate:

   Overhead Rate = (Total budgeted overhead / Basis)

==What is the right basis to use to calculate the overhead rate==
There are many ways that can be used to determine the right basis for a given order. These bases are:
* Direct Labor Cost: this basis is used when manufacturing is labor-intensive.
* Direct Labor Hours: it is used When workers are paid on the basis of their working hours.
* Prime Cost: the prime cost is used when the factory produces only one kind of product.
* Machine time: this basis is used when manufacturing is mostly automated.

==How to calculate the Overhead budget using the rate==
In order to find the overhead rate we will use the same basis that we hahellohosen by multiplying this basis by the calculated rate. For example, if we choose the labor hours to be the basis then we will multiply the rate by the direct labor hours in each task during the manufacturing process.

            The share of the order of the overhead = Overhead Rate * Resources consumed

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6188">'''Repo 105''' is [[Lehman Brothers]]' name for an [[accounting maneuver]] that it used where a short-term [[repurchase agreement]] is classified as a sale. The cash obtained through this "sale" is then used to pay down [[debt]], allowing the company to appear to reduce its [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] by temporarily paying down [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]—just long enough to reflect on the company's published [[balance sheet]]. After the company's [[financial report]]s are published, the company borrows cash and repurchases its original [[asset]]s.

==Use by Lehman Brothers==
Repo 105 was used by investment bank Lehman Brothers three times according to a [[Report of Anton R. Valukas|March 2010 report]] by the bankruptcy court examiner. The report stated that Lehman's auditors, [[Ernst &amp; Young]], were aware of this questionable classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503983_162-20000341-503983.html Lehman Cooked Books before Collapse, Report Finds]. CBS News, March 12, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; Law firm [[Linklaters]] has received unfavorable press treatment in relation to their issuance of an English law opinion which characterised the arrangements as a ''true sale'' as opposed to a transfer by Lehman with a charge back in favour of the transferor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article7059592.ece |title=British law firm cleared way for Lehman cover-up |accessdate= 2010-12-22 |author= |date=March 12, 2010 |work= |publisher=''The Times'' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.timesonline.co.uk%2Ftol%2Fbusiness%2Findustry_sectors%2Fbanking_and_finance%2Farticle7059592.ece&amp;date=2010-12-22 |archivedate=2010-12-22 }} &lt;/ref&gt; although there is no suggestion that their advice was wrong. Apparently, the use of the British law firm was necessitated by the fact no law firm in the US was prepared to give a legal opinion on the legality of the use of Repo 105 http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/12/23/fraud-files-is-ernst-and-young-to-blame-in-lehman-bros-fraud/

===Examiner’s Report===
The report published, on March 11, 2010, was titled "Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Chapter 11 Proceedings". The Examiner in this matter was [[Anton R. Valukas]], Chairman of [[Jenner &amp; Block]]. The report details the use of both "repo 105" and "repo 108" which are basically identical procedures, the first costing 5% and the second 8% of the assets exchanged. In other words, assets valued at 105 will produce 100 in cash, assets valued at 108 will produce 100 in cash respectively.

After the Examiner’s report was published, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC)  sent letters to [[chief financial officer]]s of nearly two dozen large financial and insurance companies asking about their firms' use of [[repurchase agreement]]s, including the number and amount of such agreements that qualify for sales accounting, and detailed analysis of why such transactions can be treated as sales. SEC chairman, [[Mary Schapiro]], indicated that the agency was trying to determine whether other companies used similar techniques as the "repo 105" used by Lehman Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304370304575152040736357802  SEC Queries Firms on Repos], ''Wall St Journal'', March 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraud charges===
In response to the report, the auditors said that the transactions were accounted for in line with [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]]. However, New York attorney general [[Andrew Cuomo]] filed charges against Ernst &amp; Young in December 2010, alleging that the firm "substantially assisted... a massive accounting fraud" by approving the accounting treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1934026/-sued-lehmans-audit E&amp;Y sued over Lehman audit], ''Accountancy Age'', December 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' drew attention to the increasing levels of fees that Ernst &amp; Young had been paid by Lehman from 2001 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704259704576033540546160536?mod=WSJEUROPE_newsreel_business |title=Ernst Accused of Lehman Whitewash |accessdate= 2010-12-22 |author=Liz Rappaport, Michael Rapoport |date=December 21, 2010 |work= |publisher=Wall Street Journal |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052748704259704576033540546160536.html%3Fmod%3DWSJEUROPE_newsreel_business&amp;date=2010-12-22 |archivedate=2010-12-22 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Review of accounting treatment==
The [[IASB]] and [[FASB]], senior bodies responsible for setting [[accounting standards]], met in April 2010 to review the accounting treatment for such repo transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2260964/repo-accounting-review Repo accounting up for review], ''Accountancy Age'', April 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to [[tobashi scheme]]s==
Several writers have basically stated that Repo 105 was essentially a [[tobashi scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Dan |last=Duane |url=http://practicalstockinvesting.com/2010/03/14/the-lehman-report-and-repo-105/ |title=The Lehman Report, "Repo 105", and "tobashi" |website=Practical Stock Investing |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Tracy |last=Alloway |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/03/23/181376/repo-ichi-zero-go/ |title=Repo ichi zero go? |website=FT Alphaville| date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12317">'''Sales outsourcing''' is a way for companies to attract increased, high volumes of sales for their products or services by using a third party. The company typically uses outsourcing companies to improve sales volumes without links to the sales teams that carry out those campaigns. The company that undertakes the outsourcing will normally be paid based on the results they are able to generate, and therefore creates a mutually beneficial situation for both client and the outsourcing company. 

== Background ==
Full 'sales outsourcing' is observed when companies have an external third party [[sales]] force. It is differentiated from [[Value-added re seller|value added reselling]] or [[Distributor (business)|distribution]] in that the [[business model]] can be based on shared risk, although there are models where the outsourcer is paid for all of their activity - just as with a hired [[direct sales]] force, but the outsourcer provides rapidity, flexibility and experience. 
Other names for sales outsourcing include 'indirect sales' and 'channel sales'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trickle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full sales outsourcing is different from [[telemarketing]] in that it requires direct recruitment of sales personnel with specific backgrounds for each sales campaign. Usually the sales executives will be part of a team that may include telemarketing, [[marketing]], tools systems and methodologies as well as [[sales management]].

Sales [[outsourcing]] firms provide [[accountability]] regarding all sales results and activities while representing the brand of the client. For the end-customer, it usually appears as if the sales team sold the product themselves rather than the sales outsourcing firm. The outsourcing firm is, in essence, an extension of the client but is responsible for all operations associated with direct sales activities, often receiving sales engineering and initial product/service [[training]] support from the client.

== Purpose of indirect sales ==
The sole purpose of a contract sales organization is to provide sales resource to its clients, without taking title to their products.  Sales outsourcing providers include [[manufacturers' representative]]s, contract sales organizations, sales agents or sales outsourcing consultants. One way of organising the sales effort, especially when product delivery is erratic, is to replace or supplement internal resources with [[wikt:function|functionality]] and expertise brought in from contract sales organisations.

Sales outsourcing is quite different from large-scale service outsourcing, which has its advantages but also requires pro-active contract and relationship management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novick|first=H. J.|title=Selling through independent reps|year=2000|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to full sales outsourcing, many partial models are observed, particularly in large firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sales outsourcing is expected to be cheaper than the fully loaded cost of employing salespeople, but calculating the cost comparison over time is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, replacing fixed costs with variable costs is attractive to budget-holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike many forms of outsourcing, the advantages of sales outsourcing does not often come from saving costs but rather increasing [[revenue]] or providing speed of response or flexibility.

The [[business case]] for sales outsourcing should also include consideration of the cost of controlling the contract.  Difficulty in measuring the link between sales activity and sales performance leads to a preference for employed salespeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krafft|first=M |author2=Albers, S. |author3=Lal, R.|title=Relative Explanatory Power of Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Analysis in German Salesforces|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|year=2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=265–283|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the issues internally are often the same and the internal hire has many other corporate "distractions" that do not occur with external resources.

Companies may also choose sales outsourcing as a means of accessing the best sales skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[pejorative]] term “rent-a-rep” is still used, there is some evidence that contractors are perceived as good performers against qualitative as well as quantitative performance criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the reputational risk of third parties handling customer relationships has been observed as a factor restricting sales outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=A M |author2=Anderson E |author3=MacInnis D J|title=Reputation Management as a Motivation for Sales Structure Decisions|journal=Journal of Marketing|year=1999|volume=63|pages=74–89|doi=10.2307/1251975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One could argue that an employee is often using a company to gain 2–3 years salary and experience whereas a sales outsourcing firm would usually be looking at a long term contract even though the staff may change during that time. So the aims of an outsourcer can be closely aligned with the aims and objectives of the contracting company.

A recent study has highlighted flexibility as an important driver for outsourcing sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain business environments accentuate the need to turn sales resource on and off quickly. Industries and companies undergoing rapid change may need to avoid hiring and firing costs and risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downey|first=J. M.|title=Risks of outsourcing - applying risk management to staffing methods|journal=Facilities|year=1995|volume=13|series=9/10|pages=38–44|doi=10.1108/02632779510095617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract sales organizations can absorb employment risk, enabling their clients to respond to short-term opportunities or competitor activity (see [[Lean startup#Philosophy|Lean startup]]). However, an outsourcer may build in more of a premium to the rate or commission if excessive flexibility is required on a contract.

Contract sales organizations are growing in volume and influence, able to provide both tactical activity and long-term strategic support to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=Contract sales organizations (CSOs): making the transition from tactical resource to strategic partnering|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2008|volume=8|series=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1057/palgrave.jmm.5050119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salespartnerships.com/resources/articles/contract-pharmaceutical-sales-pharma-landscape|title=Contract Pharmaceutical Sales: The Changing Pharma Landscape|date=2017-09-06|work=Sales Partnerships|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speed of response is seen as a key reason to use an outsourcer. If a company was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find an office and build a team. With an outsourcer, a full working team can oftentimes be operational within a matter of days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poulter|first=Julian|title=Selling People Ltd|newspaper=Sales outsourcing alternatives|date=2005-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales outsourcing can also be used as a [[market entry strategy]] and avoids [[permanent establishment]] risk.

==Indirect sales growth rate==
The experience of many organizations over the past several years demonstrates that indirect channels can be critical to expanding market coverage. This has been particularly true in the [[electronics]], [[communications]] and [[high tech]] sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chugg|first=Justin|title=What is a Master Agent?|url=http://www.telarus.com/why-telarus.php|publisher=Telecom Channel News|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the indirect channel now accounts for 66 percent of overall technology sales, up from 53 percent in 1997.

==Examples of indirect sales companies==

In business management theory, the '''smiling curve''' is a graphical depiction of how [[value added]] varies across the different stages of bringing a product on to the market in an IT-related manufacturing industry. The concept was first proposed around 1992 by [[Stan Shih]], the founder of [[Acer Inc.]], an IT company headquartered in [[Taiwan]]. According to Shih's observation, in the personal computer industry, the two ends of the [[value chain]] &amp;ndash; conception and marketing &amp;ndash; command higher values added to the product than the middle part of the value chain &amp;ndash; manufacturing. If this phenomenon is presented in a graph with a Y-axis for value-added and an X-axis for value chain (stage of production), the resulting curve appears like a "smile".

Based on this model, the Acer company adopted a business strategy to reorient itself from manufacturing into global marketing of brand-name PC-related products and services. Acer accordingly invested heavily in [[R&amp;D]] to develop innovative technology. The concept later became widely cited to describe the distribution of value-adding potentials in other types of industry to justify business strategies aimed at higher value-adding activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smiling curve|url=http://money.163.com/10/0625/14/6A1GCL9H00253G87.html.|website=money.163|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory origins==

===Pursuing the new trend===

Although the smile curve theory is very simple but it points out the future direction of Taiwan’s industrial efforts, the only way is moving and positioning towards high value-adding block through the guidance of value-adding concept, therefore, the industry can continue the development and sustainable management. Although the construction is one of the locomotive industry, but under a mature industrial trend, [[market saturation]] and traditional manufacturing which only concerned low value-adding area, has experienced a decade of economic downturn. Smiling curve theory can provide a new thinking direction.

===Diagram illustration===

[[File:Smiling Curve.svg|thumb|Smiling Curve]]
The most lucrative value area focus on both ends of the [[value chain]] – [[R&amp;D]] and marketing. The only thing can do is just agency or [[OEM]] without R&amp;D capability, which earn a little money;
Without marketing ability, the product will only be treated as rubbish over disposal period.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smiling curve definition|url=http://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/微笑曲线理论.|website=MBA encyclopedia|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realizing the fact===

[[BYD Company|BYD]]'s Wang once lamented that Chinese companies had only learned how to organize workers, but have not learned how to organize engineers, it can only make a living in the most inhospitable terrain area of the manufacturing. If it can use advanced methods to organize a large number of Chinese Engineers, then China is the entrepreneur's treasure. Typically, knowledge-intensive organizations can find ways to organize engineers. Management master [[Peter Drucker]] said: "The most important management in the 21st century is to manage those intelligent workers." Which is the most successful aspect that [[Huawei]] has done among the Chinese companies. Among those employees, technology research and developing staff accounted for 46%, marketing and service staff accounted for 33%, management and other personnel accounted for 9%, and the remaining 12% is workers. For 20 years, [[Huawei]] has maintained this ratio, human resource allocation shows “high developing and marketing on both sides" of the "smile curve."

==Theory pressure==

[[Stan Shih]] ‘s smiling curve is promoted in order to reproducing [[Acer Inc.|Acer]]. However, there must be some breed factors. Some of the factors behind the birth may exist as follows:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not smiling curve's fault|url=http://www.tmtpost.com/17044.html.|website=TMTpost|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive pressure of globalization===

Under the trend of [[globalization]] of [[high-tech]] product markets, we can use the "chase, catch, run, jump, touch" five words to describe the competitive pressures of the industry. Competitive enterprises continue to catch up, ready to catch up with the leaders, and those leading companies continue to run forward in order to stay ahead of the distance, and finding methods to jump over the barriers. Therefore, the market becomes saturated, only head-on, make price competition, even bloody competition exist. This is the fate of global competition, only the fittest survive.

===Pressure of product life period===

[[High-tech]] products, unless mastering the key technologies or components, among the finished product market, because the fast speed of technology development, fashion also changes quickly, product life periods are changing rapidly, so-called niche products, sometimes become a few % of the profit gross during a few years, therefore generating tremendous pressure on enterprises.

===Survival Pressure of enterprises===

Under the pressure of the foregoing, if technology cannot always be upgraded, strategy cannot leading the market, then under the less profit situation, may turn into a loss, more seriously, even gradually affecting the survival of the enterprise.

===Pressure of value-added===

The value-added of an enterprise can be said that the potential for profit. Mature technology, low requirement to entry, and universalization of technology is easy to become so-called "low-profit" enterprise, also known as low-value-added industries. Normal manufacturing, assembly enterprise is called low-value-added industries, in order to survive, only to keep expanding production capacity to maintain profits. But as long as the market is shrinking, product prices is decreasing, product sales will no longer growing. Enterprise will face to risk immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loss of smiling curve|url=http://tech.qq.com/a/20130217/000033.htm?pgv_ref=aio2012&amp;ptlang=2052.|website=Tencent news|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory factors==

===Trend of industries development===

In order to overcome the pressure of low added value, enterprises only thinking is to move toward the block which high-value added industry trends. In the industry, mastering the key technology and key components is high added value; general manufacturing or [[OEM]] is low added value; product integration services, due to combine a lot of added value, therefore becoming another high-value-added block.

===Needs of industrial developing environment===

Among the blocks of high value-added, the key technologies and key components, may sold to various needs of world market; but integrated services, need to have an appropriate area, and entire industry in this region also has reached considerable development.

===Conclusion===

====Enterprises====

Enterprise’s products and services need to have sustained value-added (earnings), so that can be able to survive.

====Products====

The direction and services of high [[value-added]] products is only way to have a high potential for profit, therefore to ensure business continuity.

==Applications Inspiration==

===The success of products===

Smile curve theory has basically proved that the success of products is inextricably related to concept, research, brand spreading and marketing. Those factors require the company hire and retain highly skilled, intelligent, professionals.  Typically, those professionals will be highly paid, so that countries with high smile curve slope will get more profits, therefore generating growing gaps between countries.

===Compare with developing and development countries ===

Like [[United States]] and other [[developed countries]], they have maintained highly slope of the smile curve, however, [[developing countries]] such as India and China confined to low-level employing and manufacturing. Therefore, if developing countries want to achieve to highly slope of the smile curve, they need more professional analysts, researchers and brand developers to reach higher levels of economic growth. In other words, if developing countries want to compete with developed countries equally, they must require a highly skilled and knowledge team in order to achieve these, government needs to invest heavily and support on basic education and higher education. In the [[long-term]] development, manufacturing country in the world will hardly to sustain the level of economic growth. Developing countries need to let the smiling curve more smile, therefore there will be a fair competition with developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kwan|first1=C.H.|title=China: Wrong part of the smiling curve|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/DJ04Ad01.html|website=Asia Times|date=4 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related to industry==

===Developing countries===

Some developing countries have begun the development of trade and investment liberalization, and the company's internal production network has become globalized. Depending on the strengths of each country, manufacturing form of the developing countries are generally labor-intensive, which means that they only provided low-wage to workers, but those high-tech jobs, such as research and development, are to be borne by the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smiling curve: Stan shih|url=http://chaitravi.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/the-smiling-curve-stan-shih/|website=Chaitravi's Blog|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal division of labor===

The current situation is that between developed and developing countries, there are lots of flowing products and intermediate goods. This phenomenon which cooperating among the same industry is known as horizontal division of labor. 
However, the more accurate name is called vertical division of labor. However, because there are various ways of processes between developed and developing countries, developed countries always focus on high-value process while developing countries always focus on low-value-added processes.

=== Traditional manufacturing===

[[Fareed Zakaria]]'s writings mentioned, the significance of China and their traditional manufacturing dominance, China's manufacturing industry is in the middle stages, so that means production, plus some spare parts supply and engineering design. However, developed countries such as the United States has two complete form, so that is generated smiley curve, the curve shows the value added profits at every stage, and brand and product concepts at high point, the manufacturing industry is located below, values in the retail and service phases rise again. 
With the end of the [[Cold War]] and the former socialist countries into the global economy, there was more and more cheap labor, while developing countries have been watching their profits decline, then resulting in fierce competition. Therefore, increasing the slope of the smile curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brawn|first1=Alan.C.|title=Article: The Smiling Curve|url=http://www.dseg.org/page/article-smiling-curve.|website=Digital Signage Experts Group|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory phenomenon==

Smile curve assumes a phenomenon, in the middle of the process of value-added profits or assembly-type manufacturing value chain is assembled, these processes have a downward trend, which increases at both ends of these processes of the value chain, are the raw material at one end of chain and at the other sales service. This assumption has caused an intense global competition which increasing in the assembly of standardized and modular components.

===Use of  report===

Report examines the assembly-type manufacturing value chain and the formation of the smile curve. Because it use the ratio of the profit as a [[performance indicator]]. All the sources of products produced broader concept in industrial processes. Input-output tables and each firm's annual financial statements were used to calculate total assets and operating surplus.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kimura|first1=Tatsuya|title=The "Smile Curve" Phenomenon in the Japanese Assembly-Type Manufacturing Industry".|url=http://jp.fujitsu.com/group/fri/en/economic/publications/report/2003/report-167.html.|website=Japanese Fujitsu research institute|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analyze six sectors===

The assembly-type manufacturing industry also can be analyzed from:
 
#household electronic appliances, 
#household electric appliances, 
#electronic computing equipment and accessory devices, 
#communications equipment, 
#passenger motor cars,  
#trucks, buses and other vehicles.

In this research, the smile curve explained the household electronic appliances, computer equipment and ancillary equipment, as well as the three sectors trucks, buses and other vehicles. However, the smile curve cannot explain the other three sectors, and assembly-type manufacturing industry as a whole.

==Successful example ==

‘Clockwise’ company is one of the smiling curve practitioners, founded in 1991. Turning occurred in 2004, this year, the ‘Clockwise’ pay all attention on cotton underwear industry, formed a strategic alliance with Colored Cotton Group, controlled famous brand cotton "Choi days” upstream resources, meanwhile use media to publish brand. ‘Clockwise’ business total sales breakthrough billion yuan, became the industry leader.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

'''The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop''' is a book by [[Dan Charnas]] chronicling the business history of the [[hip hop]] industry.

== Reception ==
The book was generally well-received, described as "epic" by [[The Village Voice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/qanda-dan-charnas-author-of-the-big-payback-the-history-of-the-business-of-hip-hop-on-industry-rule-4080-hot-97-and-lyor-cohens-cd-collection-6616950|title=Q&amp;A: Dan Charnas, Author Of The Big Payback: The History Of The Business Of Hip-Hop, On Industry Rule #4080, Hot 97, And Lyor Cohen's CD Collection|last=Serwer|first=Jesse|date=2010-12-10|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named a "must-read... character-driven narrative" for anyone interested in the subject of hip hop, the hip hop music industry, or the music industry in general by the [[Los Angeles Times]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/04/entertainment/la-et-book-20110104|title=Book review: 'The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop' by Dan Charnas|last=McDonnell|first=Evelyn|date=2011-01-04|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Charnas revealed that his research for The Big Payback included interviewing "over 300 people: record executives, entrepreneurs, artists, managers, producers, DJs, journalists,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dan Charnas|title=Dan Charnas: "Why I Wrote 'The Big Payback'"|date=2010-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28XUK9uD4-I|accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the L.A. Times noted as "meticulous" and indicative of "fine sense of both the macro and the micro". praised for its "intertwining of commerce and art".

The book was criticized for its sense of focus and incomplete narrative. [[Evelyn McDonnell]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that despite its "ambitious scope," The Big Payback lacks balance, failing to mention "Atlanta, Houston, Miami, etc." while focusing on hip hop mostly from an East-West Coast perspective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Throughput accounting''' (TA) is a principle-based and simplified [[management accounting]] approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise profitability improvement. TA is relatively new in management accounting. It is an approach that identifies factors that limit an organization from reaching its goal, and then focuses on simple measures that drive behavior in key areas towards reaching organizational goals. TA was proposed by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]]&lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox - The Goal - {{ISBN|0-620-33597-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to traditional [[cost accounting]]. As such, Throughput Accounting&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Corbett - Throughput Accounting - {{ISBN|0-88427-158-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is neither [[cost accounting]] nor costing because it is cash focused and does not allocate all costs (variable and fixed expenses, including overheads) to products and services sold or provided by an enterprise. Considering the laws of variation, only costs that vary totally with units of output (see definition of T below for TVC) e.g. raw materials, are allocated to products and services which are deducted from sales to determine Throughput.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Du Plooy - Throughput Accounting Techniques - {{ISBN|978-0-9946979-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughput Accounting is a [[management accounting]] technique used as the performance measure in the [[Theory of Constraints]] (TOC).&lt;ref&gt;Eric Noreen - Theory of Constraints and its Implications for Management Accounting - {{ISBN|978-0-88427-116-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the business intelligence used for maximizing profits, however, unlike cost accounting that primarily focuses on 'cutting costs' and reducing expenses to make a profit, Throughput Accounting primarily focuses on generating more throughput.  Conceptually, Throughput Accounting seeks to increase the speed or rate at which throughput (see definition of T below) is generated by products and services with respect to an organization's constraint, whether the constraint is internal or external to the organization. Throughput Accounting is the only management accounting methodology that considers constraints as factors limiting the performance of organizations.

Management accounting is an organization's internal set of techniques and methods used to maximize shareholder wealth. Throughput Accounting is thus part of the management accountants' toolkit, ensuring efficiency where it matters as well as the overall effectiveness of the organization. It is an internal reporting tool. Outside or external parties to a business depend on accounting reports prepared by financial (public) accountants who apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ([[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]]) issued by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) and enforced by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and other local and international regulatory agencies and bodies such as [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS).

Throughput Accounting improves profit performance with better management decisions by using measurements that more closely reflect the effect of decisions on three critical monetary variables ([[Throughput (business)|throughput]], [[investment]] (AKA [[inventory]]), and [[operating expense]] — defined below).

== History ==
When cost accounting was developed in the 1890s, labor was the largest fraction of product cost and could be considered a variable cost. Workers often did not know how many hours they would work in a week when they reported on Monday morning because time-keeping systems were rudimentary. Cost accountants, therefore, concentrated on how efficiently managers used labor since it was their most important variable resource. Now however, workers who come to work on Monday morning almost always work 40 hours or more; their cost is fixed rather than variable. However, today, many managers are still evaluated on their labor efficiencies, and many "downsizing," "rightsizing," and other labor reduction campaigns are based on them.

Goldratt argues that, under current conditions, labor efficiencies lead to decisions that harm rather than help organizations. Throughput Accounting, therefore, removes [[standard cost accounting]]'s reliance on efficiencies in general, and labor efficiency in particular, from management practice. Many cost and financial accountants agree with Goldratt's critique, but they have not agreed on a replacement of their own and there is enormous inertia in the installed base of people trained to work with existing practices.

Constraints accounting, which is a development in the Throughput Accounting field, emphasizes the role of the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]], (referred to as the Archemedian constraint) in decision making.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Caspari and Pamela Caspari - Management Dynamics - {{ISBN|0-471-67231-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The concepts of Throughput Accounting ==
Goldratt's alternative begins with the idea that each organization has a goal and that better decisions increase its value. The goal for a profit maximizing firm is stated as, increasing net profit now and in the future. [[Profit maximization]] seen from a Throughput Accounting viewpoint, is about maximizing a system's profit mix without [[Cost Accounting]]'s traditional allocation of total costs. Throughput Accounting actions include obtaining the maximum net profit in the minimum time period, given limited resource capacities and capabilities. These resources include machines, capital (own or borrowed), people, processes, technology, time, materials, markets, etc. Throughput Accounting applies to [[not-for-profit]] organizations too, where they develop their goal that makes sense in their individual cases, and these goals are commonly measured in goal units.

Throughput Accounting also pays particular attention to the concept of 'bottleneck' (referred to as ''constraint'' in the Theory of Constraints) in the manufacturing or servicing processes.

Throughput Accounting uses three measures of income and expense: [[Image:ThroughputStructure.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The chart illustrates a typical throughput structure of income (sales) and expenses (TVC and OE).&lt;br /&gt;T=Sales less TVC and NP=T less OE.]]

* [[Throughput (business)|Throughput]] (T) is the rate at which the system produces "goal units." When the goal units are money &lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt - The Haystack Syndrome (pp 19) - {{ISBN|0-88427-089-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (in for-profit businesses), throughput is net sales (S) less totally variable cost (TVC), generally the cost of the raw materials (T = S – TVC). Note that T only exists when there is a sale of the product or service. Producing materials that sit in a warehouse does not form part of throughput but rather investment. ("Throughput" is sometimes referred to as "throughput contribution" and has similarities to the concept of "contribution" in marginal costing which is sales revenues less "variable" costs – "variable" being defined according to the marginal costing philosophy.)
* [[Investment]] (I) is the money tied up in the system. This is money associated with inventory, machinery, buildings, and other assets and liabilities. In earlier [[Theory of Constraints]] (TOC) documentation, the "I" was interchanged between "inventory" and "investment." The preferred term is now only "investment." Note that TOC recommends inventory be valued strictly on totally variable cost associated with creating the inventory, not with additional cost allocations from overhead.
* [[Operating expense]] (OE) is the money the system spends in generating "goal units." For physical products, OE is all expenses except the cost of the raw materials. OE includes maintenance, utilities, rent, taxes and payroll.

Organizations that wish to increase their attainment of ''[[The Goal]]'' should therefore require managers to test proposed decisions against three questions. Will the proposed change:

# Increase throughput? How?
# Reduce investment ([[inventory]]) (money that cannot be used)? How?
# Reduce [[operating expense]]? How?

The answers to these questions determine the effect of proposed changes on system wide measurements:

# [[Net profit]] (NP) = throughput – operating expense = T – OE
# [[Return on investment]] (ROI) = net profit / investment = NP/I
# TA [[Productivity]] = throughput / operating expense = T/OE
# Investment turns (IT) = throughput / investment = T/I

These relationships between financial ratios as illustrated by Goldratt are very similar to a set of relationships defined by [[DuPont]] and [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] financial executive [[Donaldson Brown]] about 1920. Brown did not advocate changes in management accounting methods, but instead used the ratios to evaluate traditional financial accounting data.

== Explanation ==

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Throughput} = \text{Sales revenue – Total Variable Costs}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kaplan publishing UK. Pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Throughput accounting Ratio} = \text{Return per factory hour} / \text{Cost per factory hour}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kaplan publishing UK. Pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: The railway coach company was offered a contract to make 15 open-topped streetcars each month, using a design that included ornate brass foundry work, but very little of the metalwork needed to produce a covered rail coach. The buyer offered to pay $280 per streetcar. The company had a firm order for 40 rail coaches each month for $350 per unit.

:The cost accountant determined that the cost of operating the foundry vs. the metalwork shop each month was as follows:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|'''Overhead Cost by Department'''
|Total Cost ($)
|Hours Available per month
|Cost per hour ($)
|-
|Foundry
| 7,300.00

| 3,300.00
|160
|20.63
|-
|Total
|10,600.00
|320
|33.13
|}

:The company was at full capacity making 40 rail coaches each month. And since the foundry was expensive to operate, and purchasing brass as a raw material for the streetcars was expensive, the accountant determined that the company would lose money on any streetcars it built. He showed an analysis of the estimated product costs based on [[standard cost accounting]] and recommended that the company decline to build any streetcars.

:However, the company's operations manager knew that recent investment in automated foundry equipment had created idle time for workers in that department. The constraint on production of the railcoaches was the metalwork shop. She made an analysis of profit and loss if the company took the contract using throughput accounting to determine the profitability of products by calculating "throughput" (revenue less variable cost) in the metal shop.

:After the presentations from the company accountant and the operations manager, the president understood that the metal shop capacity was limiting the company's profitability. The company could make only 40 rail coaches per month. But by taking the contract for the streetcars, the company could make nearly all the railway coaches ordered, and also meet all the demand for streetcars. The result would increase '''throughput''' in the metal shop from $6.25 to $10.38 per hour of available time, and increase profitability by 66 percent.

== Relevance ==
One of the most important aspects of Throughput Accounting is the relevance of the information it produces. Throughput Accounting reports what currently happens in business functions such as operations, distribution and marketing. It does not rely solely on GAAP's financial accounting reports (that still need to be verified by external auditors) and is thus relevant to current decisions made by management that affect the business now and in the future. Throughput Accounting is used in Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM),&lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt - Critical Chain - {{ISBN|0-620-21256-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drum Buffer Rope (DBR)—in businesses that are internally constrained, in Simplified Drum Buffer Rope (S-DBR) &lt;ref&gt;Eli Schragenheim and H William Dettmer - Manufacturing at Warp Speed - {{ISBN|1-57444-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in businesses that are externally constrained (particularly where the lack of customer orders denotes a market constraint), as well as in strategy, planning and tactics, etc.

'''''Wall Street Week with [[Maria Bartiromo]]''''' ('''''WSW'''''), retitled in early 2018 as '''''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street,''''' is an [[investment]] news and information [[Television|TV]] program airing Friday nights on the [[Fox Business Network]].  The original weekly show hosted by [[Louis Rukeyser]] aired each Friday evening on [[PBS]] in the United States from 1970 to 2002. The program features a host (or hosts) and guest experts participating in discussions related to the [[financial market]]s.

The original show, which was created by [[Anne Truax Darlington]] and produced by [[Maryland Public Television]] (MPT), debuted on the entire [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] network on January 7, 1972 and was officially titled '''''Wall $treet Week with [[Louis Rukeyser]]''''' ('''''W$W''''') during the 32 years he hosted from 1970 to 2002 (the "S" in "Street" was in the shape of a dollar sign).

{{wikinews|PBS cancels 'Wall $treet Week' after 35 years}}

In June 2002, the show was modified, dropping Rukeyser and changing the name to '''''Wall Street Week with [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'''''. Rukeyser went on to host ''[[Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street]]'' on [[CNBC]] (cancelled on December 31, 2004 at Rukeyser's request due to continuing ill health), which was also distributed to PBS stations. '''''Wall Street Week with [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''''', which was hosted by [[Geoff Colvin]] and former [[Fox News]] business correspondent [[Karen Gibbs]], ended its PBS run on June 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ives | first = Nat | authorlink = | last2 = Elliott | first2 = Stuart | authorlink2 = | title = 'Wall St. Week,' a PBS Staple, Will Go Off the Air in June | work = [[The New York Times]] | page = 8 | date = 2005-03-24 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E5D8163FF937A15750C0A9639C8B63 | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wall Street Week''''' was resurrected in April 2015 by SkyBridge Media LLC, an affiliated entity of global investment firm [[SkyBridge Capital]], which was founded by financier and entrepreneur [[Anthony Scaramucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/15/scaramucci-to-revive-iconic-wall-street-week/ | work=New York Post | first=Michelle | last=Celarier | title=Scaramucci to revive iconic 'Wall Street Week' | date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new "Wall Street Week" featured [[Anthony Scaramucci]] and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as co-hosts. In March 2016, the show's licensing rights were picked up by [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] and it now airs Friday nights at 8 PM ET on the [[Fox Business Network]].  In April 2017, the show's name was changed to reflect Fox Business naming Maria Bartiromo as the new presenter. It was further changed in early 2018 to ''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street.''&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title| id=4679468 | title=Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street (originally Wall Street Week) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Show format==

===''Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser''===
* Commentary: Rukeyser would begin the program with a short commentary on the week's financial news, followed by a summation of market statistics.
* Panel Discussion: A panel of financial analysts (usually three in number) offered their opinions on the market, and gave specific stock recommendations. Panelists over the years, who numbered close to 30 by the turn of the 20th century, included financial names like Frank Cappiello, Jim Price,  Gail Dudack, Mary Farrell, Michael Holland, Carter Randall, [[Julius Westheimer]] and [[Martin Zweig]].
* Viewer Mail: The panelists would answer questions submitted by viewers. This segment always ended with Rukeyser delivering a pun-laden solicitation for letters.
* Interview Prelude: Occasionally, before the final interview, Rukeyser would provide his insight on some aspects of business, such as a certain stock sector (e.g. food, medical, energy), the right choice for mutual funds, and even the best deals on various products. The most commonly repeated commentaries were "Professor Lou's Classroom" (during the back-to-school season), "Uncle Lou Goes Christmas Shopping" (held during in December, usually on the Friday before Christmas), and "Sentiment-al Journey" (New Year's Eve).
* Interview: In the final segment, Rukeyser and the panelist interviewed a guest expert.
Over the years, the list of guests included such notables as [[Paul Volcker]], [[Alan Greenspan]], [[Ross Perot]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Malcolm Forbes]], and [[Paul Samuelson]]. &lt;!-- Warren Buffett was never a guest--&gt;

===="Ms. Smythe"====
After being introduced, guests for the interview segment were escorted from backstage by a woman in formal dress dubbed by production staff and listed in the [[Credits roll|credits]] as "Ms. Smythe" ("Miss Smythe" until the late 1980s), always followed by her real name. Various women over the years performed this task, the most famous being Natalie Seltz.

===="TWX in 12 Bars"====
During Rukeyser's tenure, the program featured a distinctive theme composed by Donald Swartz entitled "TWX in 12 Bars," which featured percussion supplied by a [[teletype machine]]. The opening bells of the song replicated the sound of the [[Westminster chime]]s.

====New Year's Show====
On the last Friday of the year, the host and panelists would appear in [[black tie]], make market predictions and stock recommendations for the upcoming year, and review how well their predictions of one year ago fared.

====Alternative format====
On October 23, 1987, the first program following [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], the show dropped its regular format for a special program where Rukeyser interviewed three experts on the impact of the stock market crash.

Afterwards, the show would employ this alternative format whenever events warranted, usually once every few months.

====Stand-ins for Rukeyser====
Whenever Rukeyser was on vacation or otherwise absent, one of the show's regular panelists would fill in. For many years this function was usually performed by Carter Randall, though in later years it was usually Frank Cappiello or (less often) [[Martin Zweig]] after Randall died in 1999. Both Randall and Cappiello were investment bankers from [[Baltimore]], convenient to where ''WSW'' was produced in [[Owings Mills, Maryland]].

===="An Investment Primer" specials====
During the 1984 and 1985 [[pledge drive|pledge-drive]] seasons, Rukeyser hosted two "Investment Primer" specials, introducing viewers to the stock market and how it worked. The first show, which aired in 1984, dealt with stocks, bonds, and gold; whereas the second show in 1985 dealt with mutual funds, options and commodities. Some of the guests included [[Stan Weinstein]] (editor of ''The Professional Tape Reader''), Peter Lynch (manager of the Magellan funds at [[Fidelity Investments]]), and Dick Fabian (editor for "The Telephone Switch Newsletter")

===''Wall Street Week with Fortune''===
With the new hosts came a change in format:

* Opening report: Geoff Colvin and Karen Gibbs presented separate news reports on major stories impacting the market.
* Viewer Mail: The hosts answered questions from viewers.
* Interviews: The hosts conducted separate guest interviews; Gibbs handled interviews related to specific investing issues, while Colvin handled interviews relating to politics and the overall economy.
* Closing Commentary: A brief commentary by Colvin.

The new show's theme music was an updated, more orchestral version of "TWX in 12 Bars", produced again by Don Swartz and Don Barto.

Without Louis Rukeyser as host, this new version suffered from lower ratings, neither capturing a new more youthful market as PBS had intended, nor retaining the original viewers. It was canceled after three seasons.

===Wall Street Week Index===
During its run, the show used two different indexes to predict future market trends:

From 1970 to 1989, the show used the Wall Street Week Index (later known as the WSW Technical Market Index), a [[technical analysis]] developed by [[Robert Nurock]]. The analysis consisted of ten separate technical [[Technical indicator|indicators]], each of which was assigned a value of either +1 (indicating a [[bullish]] trend), -1 (for a [[bearish]] trend, or 0 (neutral)). A net balance of +5 (or higher) was interpreted as a buy signal, while a reading of -5 (or lower) was a sell signal. While the index rarely gave outright buy or sell signals, over time it was found to give an accurate forecast of the stock market.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Rukeyser irreverently named the index "The Elves" (a reference to the [[Gnomes of Zürich]]), and dubbed Nurock the "Chief Elf." After being in neutral for a considerable period of time, Rukeyser requested significant changes in the makeup of the index.  Nurock refused since he believed his ten indicators were still the best way to judge the technical aspects of the market.  This ended Nurock's association with the show and the Index was replaced.

Used From 1989 to the end of the Rukeyser era, the Elves Index was also a reading of ten indicators scored in the same manner as the Wall Street Week Index. Instead of reflecting technical factors, the indicators now represented the personal sentiment of ten market analysts about the direction of the market over the next three months. The Elves Index had more volatility and gave more buy and sell signals than the old Wall Street Week Index, but was not as highly regarded. In 1998, one magazine even suggested the Elves Index was more useful as a [[contrarian]] tool, citing three examples where buy signals were followed by periods of market drift or contraction.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Later, Rukeyser added an Elves Index for the NASDAQ. This index had one of the worst predictive records of any public index.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The indexes were "retired" by Rukeyser after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. At that point, the indexes were signalling a very strong sell signal. However, as was usually the case, it was an excellent time to do the opposite as the market rallied significantly after the initial selloff.

==Show popularity==
The premiere of ''WSW'' on November 20, 1970 was carried on eleven stations of the [[American Public Television|Eastern Educational Television Network]]. The show rapidly grew in coverage and viewers until it became one of the most popular programs on the newly created PBS member stations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} At its peak in the 1980s, the program aired on over 300 stations, and claimed a viewership of 4,100,000 households, which meant more people watched ''WSW'' every week than read the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The program became a major source of profit for both MPT and PBS through underwriting support and viewer pledges (it is estimated PBS earned $5,000,000 profit annually from the show).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===The Rukeyser Effect===
Over the years, stock traders and analysts noted that a company touted on ''WSW'' on Friday would experience a run-up in its stock price the following Monday. This phenomenon, dubbed "The Rukeyser Effect", was stated to be a further demonstration of the program's influence. However, in 1987, Prof. [[Robert Pari]] of [[Bentley College]] published an academic article in the ''[[Journal of Portfolio Management]]'' detailing the results of a study that found that stocks recommended by Rukeyser's guests on Wall Street Week not only tended to rise in price and trading volume in the days ''preceding'' the Friday evening broadcast, peaking on the Monday afterward, but thereafter those stocks tended to drop in price and under-perform the market for up to a year following the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;Pari, R. (1987). ''Wall Street Week recommendations: yes or no?'' Journal of Portfolio Management, 14, 74-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Rukeyser strongly disputed this claim, but ten years later Professors [[Jess Beltz]] and [[Robert Jennings (economist)|Robert Jennings]] published another academic article in the ''[[Review of Financial Economics]]'' reporting results consistent with Pari's original findings, and that there was "little correlation between the 6-month performance of a recommendation and the abnormal volume at the date the recommendation is made." They observed that there were differences in return performance between the recommendations of different individuals, but the market could not discern the more insightful recommendations from the less insightful.&lt;ref&gt;Beltz, J., &amp; Jennings, R. (1997). "Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser" recommendations: trading activity and performance. Review of Financial Economics, 6, 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Another commentator observed "It is mathematically impossible for the thirty million viewers of this show to beat the market, since they are the market."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/basics.htm William J. Bernstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rukeyser as host==
Louis Rukeyser conducted the proceedings with a wry sense of humor (including the use of [[pun]]s) and a reassuring manner. In 1980 Rukeyser explained his hosting philosophy to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as, "I am talking to one person, whom I regard as intelligent, with a good sense of humor, but not all that technically knowledgeable." He instructed panelists and guests not to use technical jargon and economic theories on the show, but rather talk about making money, because, "Economics puts people to sleep. Money wakes them up."

==Rukeyser's dismissal==
From its ratings peak in the early 1980s, ''WSW'' suffered a long steady decline in viewers due to competition from shows such as the ''[[Nightly Business Report]]'', cable programs like ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight|Moneyline]]'', and cable networks such as [[CNBC]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} By 2001 viewership was down to 1,500,000 households and demographics showed that the average ''WSW'' viewer was 65 years old (about the same age as Rukeyser). MPT began to discuss the possibility of updating the format in an effort to reverse these trends. On March 21, 2002, MPT announced that beginning in June the program would be renamed ''Wall Street Week with Fortune'', would be a collaboration between MPT and Fortune magazine, and would feature two new cohosts. Rukeyser was invited to remain with the program in a reduced role as a senior correspondent, but he turned down the offer.

The following evening, Rukeyser opened the telecast by announcing "A funny thing happened to me on the way to the studio this week—I got ambushed." He criticized MPT's decision to change the show format, announced that he was developing a new business program for PBS, and concluded his commentary by asking viewers to write to their local PBS station and request it carry his new show. After the broadcast MPT dismissed Rukeyser and executive producer Rich Dubroff. Over the next three months [[Marshall Loeb]] and Ray Brady served as guest hosts while the new format was put in place.

Despite "ambushing" Rukeyser, the show's trend of losing viewers continued as the show floundered on without Rukeyser's trusted presence and was terminated in early 2005. Rukeyser died 11 months after the show ended.

==Return of "Wall Street Week"==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AnthonyScaramucci.jpg|thumb|'''Anthony Scaramucci''': Host of new ''Wall Street Week'' and founder, co-managing partner of global investment firm SkyBridge Capital]] --&gt;
In May 2014, [[SkyBridge Capital]] acquired licensing rights to ''Wall Street Week'', creating a new entity, SkyBridge Media, for the purpose of re-launching the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/15/scaramucci-to-revive-iconic-wall-street-week/ | title=Scaramucci to revive iconic 'Wall Street Week' | publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=19 February 2015 | author=Celarier, Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ''Wall Street Week'' originally featured SkyBridge founder and managing partner [[Anthony Scaramucci]] and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as hosts, and the format has been refreshed to maintain the spirit of the original show while modernizing certain aspects of the presentation. 

The first episode of the new "Wall Street Week" aired April 19, 2015 and was streamed from its website, WallStreetWeek.com. Airtime for the show was purchased on television stations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New "Wall Street Week" Premieres On April 19 With Exclusive Guest Lineup|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-new-wall-street-week-premieres-on-april-19-with-exclusive-guest-lineup-300067725.html|website=Cision PR Newswire|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode featured special guest "bond king" [[Jeffrey Gundlach]] of DoubleLine Capital and panelists Liz Ann Sonders (who was a frequent panelist on the original "Wall Street Week with [[Louis Rukeyser]]") of Charles Schwab and Jonathan Beinner of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Gundlach's commentary on the show, where he called for a potential crash in the junk bond market, made news across Wall Street following the premiere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-gundlach-issues-ominous-warning-for-junk-bond-market-2015-04-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was picked up by Fox Business Network with its first episode airing there on March 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Business|url=http://press.foxbusiness.com/2016/03/fox-business-network-to-premiere-anthony-scaramuccis-wall-street-week-on-friday-march-18th/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scaramucci stepped away from his position hosting the show after Donald Trump added him to his transition team as an economic advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hill|url=http://thehill.com/media/305692-fox-business-host-steps-down-after-being-tapped-for-trump-transition-team|website=The Hill|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Maria Bartiromo]] was named by Fox Business as the show's permanent anchor in April 2017.  

The new program airs every Friday night at 8 PM ET on the [[Fox Business Network]], with replays airing Friday nights at 8:30 PM ET, 12 and 12:30 AM ET, and Saturday and Sunday mornings at 9 &amp; 9:30 AM ET. &lt;ref&gt;
http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/03/14/fox-business-network-welcomes-iconic-wall-street-week-program.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, the opening bars (only) of "TWX in 12 Bars" is used for the opening, with a quote attributed to Rukeyser, “This show has never been solely about investments. We've talked about anything that affected people and their money," with both Scaramucci and Kaminsky featured in the opening.

==''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street''==
Sometime in January 2018, the show's title was changed to ''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street.'' The name change was implemented with little notice or fanfare by Fox Business, and no reason was announced for the change.

The '''Wall and Hanover Building''' located at 63 [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]] was built in 1929. It was designed by architects [[Delano &amp; Aldrich]] and has 37 floors.

==History==
The building was built, owned and occupied as the [[headquarters]] of [[Brown Brothers &amp; Co.]], a [[merchant bank]] that became [[Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.]], a [[private bank]], by merger in 1931. BBH continued to occupy the building, then known as '''59 Wall Street''', until 2003 when it moved to [[140 Broadway]]. BBH established a family of [[mutual fund]]s in 1983 and named it after the building, as "59 Wall Street Funds". That fund family was later renamed "BBH Funds" in 2002 when the company made plans to relocate its headquarters.&lt;ref name="bbhfunds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbh.com/company/releases/3_8_02mutual.pdf|title=Brown Brothers Harriman's 59 Wall Street Funds Renamed BBH Funds|date=2002-03-08|accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2004, the building was converted to [[residential]] [[rental]] [[apartments]] by [[Metro Loft Management]]. The leasing company rebranded the building as '''The Crest''', named for the ornate circular depictions on the outside of the building, and began using the address '''63 Wall Street'''. The ground floor of the building is now retail space, including the [[United States Post Office]] for [[zip code]] 10005.

The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 16, 2005.

Today, 63 Wall Street is held by Luxembourg-based Eastbridge Group (through DTH Capital) and [[AG Real Estate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8700">'''Wang You-theng''' ({{zh|c=王又曾|p=Wáng Yòucéng}}; 5 March 1927 – 27 May 2016) was a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[entrepreneur]], born in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], who founded the [[China Rebar Group]] and served as its chairman until fleeing [[Taiwan]] in late 2006 amid allegations of [[embezzlement]] and [[fraud]].

== Business career ==

Wang established the China Rebar Group in 1959 as a manufacturer of [[rebar|steel reinforcement beams]].  In the following years, Rebar expanded its operations from the construction industry into textiles, hotels, real estate, retail services, insurance, banking, and telecommunications. As the head of a growing business empire, Wang enjoyed a large personal fortune and increasing political clout. Several of Wang's children and relatives served as high-ranking officers in Rebar's subsidiary companies. As a tycoon, Wang maintained a close business relationship with government authorities over several administrations, serving as a member of the Central Standing Committee of the [[Kuomintang]] for 15 years and being appointed as a National Policy Advisor to President [[Chen Shui-bian]] in 2000 when the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] won the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2000|ROC Presidential election]] that year.

==Rebar scandal and flight==

By 2006, Rebar was encountering serious difficulties following years of allegedly hiding financial problems with bad loans from The Chinese Bank (a subsidiary) and falsified accounting records. On 29 December 2006, Rebar Asia-Pacific Group, along with three subsidiaries filed for [[bankruptcy protection]], but did not notify the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]] of their insolvency claims as required by regulations until 4 January 2007. During this week, several high-ranking officers in Rebar, including Wang, were alleged to have engaged in [[insider trading]] and embezzlement. Wang and his wife fled Taiwan for [[Hong Kong]] on 30 December,&lt;ref name=tt20070108&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebar chief fled to China before insolvency claims|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/01/08/2003343858|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; days before prosecutors began to launch an investigation into allegations of Rebar financial impropriety.

In the weeks following the break of the scandal, Wang and his wife moved to [[Shanghai]]. Public opinion in Taiwan was inflamed by reports of Wang's extravagant tastes and high living, as well as news that he had engaged in [[money laundering]] and discreetly transferred several assets abroad in prior years, suggesting that he had been planning his escape for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors poised to raid Rebar Group|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2007/01/10/2003344099|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=洗錢匯中美 疑達數十億|url=http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/070203/4/a54y.html|publisher=[[China Times]]|date=2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several official attempts through the ROC's [[Mainland Affairs Council]] and other unofficial attempts, efforts to have the [[People's Republic of China]] return Wang back to Taiwan proved unsuccessful.

On 13 January, Wang and his wife left the PRC for the [[United States]] arriving at [[Los Angeles]] with Wang using his ROC passport with a B1 visa, and his wife entering using her US passport. Two days later, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office declared Wang a wanted fugitive, and his ROC passport was revoked by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). MOFA also contacted the [[US Department of Justice]] (DOJ) requesting assistance in having Wang [[extradition|extradited]] back to Taiwan. However, this proved to be difficult as the [[Political status of Taiwan|ROC's diplomatic isolation]] meant that it had few standing extradition agreements with other states, though US authorities did have an information sharing system in place which was used to coordinate efforts between the two sides.

On 31 January, the DOJ contacted [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]] (TECRO) representatives in the US with information that Wang and his wife had left Los Angeles aboard [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 27, with tickets for [[Myanmar]] with a stopover in [[Singapore]]. Wang was reportedly becoming nervous as US authorities were beginning to probe possible illegal transactions at the Rebar subsidiary [[OmniBank]], based in the US.&lt;ref name=ct0205&gt;{{cite news|title=想當陳由豪第二 夢碎了一半|url=http://news.yam.com/chinatimes/society/200702/20070205909015.html|publisher=[[China Times]]|date=2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Wang was traveling on a [[Dominica]]n passport, his ROC passport having been revoked in mid-January. Officials in Taipei immediately contacted Dominica and had Wang's Dominican passport revoked, effectively rendering him [[Stateless person|stateless]]. MOFA officials also contacted the Singapore government, requesting that Wang be extradited back to Taiwan, though again, the ROC and Singapore had no standing extradition agreement. Several agents from the Ministry of Justice Bureau of Investigation (BOI) were also dispatched to Singapore to intercept him at [[Singapore Changi Airport]].&lt;ref name=tt20070203&gt;{{cite news|title=Net closing on Rebar fugitive Wang|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2007/02/03/2003347467|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at Changi Airport the morning of 2 February, the couple were met at the gate by armed guards and denied entrance to Singapore. Singapore authorities and the BOI agents attempted to persuade the couple to board a Taiwan-bound flight. The couple refused and according to media reports, began sobbing and squatting on the floor, refusing to move. Due to the lack of an extradition agreement, neither the BOI agents or Singapore police were able to make an arrest. Attempts were made to place Wang on Singapore Airlines Flight 872, a return flight to the US with a transit at [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]], where he would be able to be detained upon entrance into the airport terminal. However upon learning of this, Wang and his wife still refused to board and as a result, delayed that flight for over three hours. After several more hours of screaming, crying, and yelling, the couple were permitted to return to the US via a direct flight.&lt;ref name ="tt20070203" /&gt;

Upon arriving back at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], Wang was detained by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] for attempting to enter the US without valid documentation, and was placed in the San Pedro Service Processing Center.&lt;ref name=tt20070204&gt;{{cite news|title=US immigration holding fugitive Wang|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2007/02/04/2003347589|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; You-theng was detained in the U.S. and wanted by Taiwanese prosecutors for allegedly embezzling NT$60 billion (US$1.8 billion) in corporate funds.&lt;ref name=tt20070902&gt;{{cite news|title=US immigration seeks to overturn Wang's release|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/09/02/2003376871|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang reportedly died in an automobile accident in [[West Covina, California]] on 27 May 2016. His body has been cremated by family members and his ashes flown back to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fugitive Rebar chairman Wang killed in US crash|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/05/31/2003647520|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
