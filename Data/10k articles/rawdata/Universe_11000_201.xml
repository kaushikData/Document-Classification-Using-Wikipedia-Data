'''BLC Leather Technology Centre''' or '''BLC''' is a testing, auditing and consulting business that specialises in chemicals, leather, footwear and other associated products and related materials, and is based in [[Northamptonshire]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blcleathertech.com/about-us]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laboratory-directory.com/contract-laboratories/profile/blc-leather-technology-centre-ltd]&lt;/ref&gt;. An additional specialism is the safe use and management of chemicals in the supply chain; a concept from which BLC developed the ZDHC approved BLC Chem-MAP certification process for chemicals, chemical companies, brands and their suppliers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chem-map.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.roadmaptozero.com/news/post/zdhc-announces-blc-chem-map-as-zdhc-accepted-certification-standard/]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A significant item of note is that BLC is the official facilitator of the Leather Working Group (LWG) which is a significant environmental stewardship programme within the leather industry. The LWG has over 600 member companies that includes over 100 major clothing and footwear brands&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leatherworkinggroup.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==BLC==

In March 2018, BLC was acquired by [[Eurofins Scientific]] of [[Belgium]] who now have a majority share holding in the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eurofins.com/consumer-product-testing/media-centre/news/blc-leather-technology-centre-ltd-joins-eurofins/ Eurofins]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Bernoulli_numbers_graphs.svg|thumb|Graphs of modern Bernoulli numbers, {{math|''B''}} (circles) compared with Bernoulli numbers in older literature, {{math|''B''*}} (crosses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernoulli Number|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Bernoulli numbers''' {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are a [[sequence]] of [[rational number]]s which occur frequently in [[number theory]]. The values of the first 20 Bernoulli numbers are given in the adjacent table. For every even {{math|''n''}} other than 0, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is negative if {{math|''n''}} is divisible by 4 and positive otherwise. For every odd {{math|''n''}} other than 1, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

The superscript ± used in this article designates the two sign conventions for Bernoulli numbers. Only the {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} term is affected: 
*{{math|''B''{{su|p=−|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=−|b=1}} = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A027641}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is the sign convention prescribed by [[NIST]] and most modern textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=278 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{math|''B''{{su|p=+|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} = +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is sometimes used in the older literature.&lt;ref name="MW1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernoulli Number|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the formulas below, one can switch from one sign convention to the other with the relation &lt;math&gt;B_n^{+{}}=(-1)^n B_n^{-{}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Bernoulli numbers are special values of the [[Bernoulli polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;B_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;B^{-{}}_n=B_n(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^+_n=B_n(1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="MW1"/&gt;

Since {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} for all odd {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, and many formulas only involve even-index Bernoulli numbers, some authors write "{{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}" to mean {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This article does not follow this notation.

The Bernoulli numbers appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansions of the [[tangent function|tangent]] and [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic tangent]] functions, in [[Faulhaber's formula]] for the sum of powers of the first positive integers, in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]], and in expressions for certain values of the [[Riemann zeta function]].

The Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician [[Jacob Bernoulli]], after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician [[Takakazu Seki|Seki Kōwa]].  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712&lt;ref name="selin 1997"&gt;Selin, H. (1997), p. 891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith mikami 1914"&gt;Smith, D. E. (1914), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  in his work ''Katsuyo Sampo''; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' of 1713.  [[Ada Lovelace]]'s [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|note G]] on the [[Analytical Engine]] from 1842 describes an [[algorithm]] for generating Bernoulli numbers with [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Note G'' in the Menabrea reference&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex [[computer program]].

==History==

=== Early history ===

The Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.

[[File:Seki Kowa Katsuyo Sampo Bernoulli numbers.png|thumb|right|A page from Seki Takakazu's ''Katsuyo Sampo'' (1712), tabulating binomial coefficients and Bernoulli numbers]]

Methods to calculate the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity to consider this problem were [[Pythagoras]] (c. 572–497&amp;nbsp;BCE, Greece), [[Archimedes]] (287–212&amp;nbsp;BCE, Italy), [[Aryabhata]] (b. 476, India), [[Abu Bakr al-Karaji]] (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn [[al-Haytham]] (965–1039, Iraq).

During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress.  In the West [[Thomas Harriot]] (1560–1621) of England, [[Johann Faulhaber]] (1580–1635) of Germany, [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665) and fellow French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) all played important roles.

Thomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers.  Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 ''Academia Algebrae'', far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.

Blaise Pascal in 1654 proved [[Faulhaber's formula|''Pascal's identity'']] relating the sums of the {{math|''p''}}th powers of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, …, ''k''}}.

The Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,…}} which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers {{harv|Knuth|1993}}.

The joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the {{mvar|c}}th powers for any positive integer {{math|''c''}} can be seen from his comment. He wrote:

:"With the help of this table, it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum 91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500."

Bernoulli's result was published posthumously in ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' in 1713.  [[Seki Kōwa]] independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712.&lt;ref name="selin 1997"/&gt;  However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.

Bernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of [[Abraham de Moivre]].

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth {{harv|Knuth|1993}} a rigorous proof of Faulhaber's formula was first published by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] in 1834 {{harv|Jacobi|1834}}. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes (the nonstandard notation on the LHS is explained further on):

:''"Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers; i.e., he never realized that a single sequence of constants'' {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} ''… would provide a uniform''

:''for all sums of powers. He never mentioned, for example, the fact that almost half of the coefficients turned out to be zero after he had converted his formulas for'' {{math|∑ ''n&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} ''from polynomials in {{mvar|N}} to polynomials in {{mvar|n}}."  {{harv|Knuth|1993|p=14}}''

=== Reconstruction of "Summae Potestatum" ===

[[File:JakobBernoulliSummaePotestatum.png|thumb|right|upright=2.5|Jakob Bernoulli's "Summae Potestatum", 1713]]

The Bernoulli numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}(n)/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}(n) were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' published posthumously in 1713 page 97. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''B'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''C'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The expression {{math|''c''·''c''−1·''c''−2·''c''−3}} means {{math|''c''·(''c''−1)·(''c''−2)·(''c''−3)}} – the small dots are used as grouping symbols. Using today's terminology these expressions are [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial powers]] {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The factorial notation {{math|''k''!}} as a shortcut for {{math|1 × 2 × … × ''k''}} was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 who used it as a long letter {{math|''S''}} for "summa" (sum). (The ''Mathematics Genealogy Project''&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/ Mathematics Genealogy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
shows Leibniz as the academic&lt;!--not doctoral--&gt; advisor of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the ''Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus]&lt;/ref&gt;) The letter {{math|''n''}} on the left hand side is not an index of [[summation]] but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as {{math|1, 2, …, ''n''}}. Putting things together, for positive {{math|''c''}}, today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^c = \frac{n^{c+1}}{c+1}+\frac 1 2 n^c+\sum_{k=2}^c \frac{B_k}{k!} c^{\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula suggests setting {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, 6… to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the [[falling factorial]] {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''k''−1}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} has for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} the value {{math|{{sfrac|1|''c'' + 1}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Thus Bernoulli's formula can be written
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^c = \sum_{k=0}^c \frac{B_k}{k!}c^{\underline{k-1}} n^{c-k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1/2}}, recapturing the value Bernoulli gave to the coefficient at that position.

Note that the formula for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n k^9&lt;/math&gt; in the first half contains an error at the last term: it must be &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac {3}{20}n^2&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac {1}{12}n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definitions ==

Many characterizations of the Bernoulli numbers have been found in the last 300 years, and each could be used to introduce these numbers.  Here only three of the most useful ones are mentioned:

* a recursive equation,
* an explicit formula,
* a generating function.

For the proof of the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]] of the three approaches see {{Harv|Ireland|Rosen|1990}} or {{Harv|Conway|Guy|1996}}.

=== Recursive definition ===

The Bernoulli numbers obey the sum formulas &lt;ref name="MW1"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom {m+1} k B^{-{}}_k &amp;= \delta_{m, 0} \\ \sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom {m+1} k B^{+{}}_k &amp;= m+1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m=0,1,2...&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|''δ''}} denotes the [[Kronecker delta]]. Solving for &lt;math&gt;B^{\mp{}}_m&lt;/math&gt; gives the recursive formulas
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_m^{-{}} &amp;= \delta_{m, 0} - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{k} \frac{B^{-{}}_k}{m - k + 1} \\
  B_m^+ &amp;= 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{k} \frac{B^+_k}{m - k + 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Explicit definition ===

In 1893 [[Louis Saalschütz]] listed  a total of 38 explicit formulas for the Bernoulli numbers {{Harv|Saalschütz|1893}}, usually giving some reference in the older literature. One of them is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B^{-{}}_m &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^m \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \binom{k}{v} \frac{v^m}{k + 1} \\
  B^+_m &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^m \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \binom{k}{v} \frac{(v + 1)^m}{k + 1}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Generating function ===

The exponential [[generating function]]s are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{t}{e^t - 1}    &amp;= \frac{t}{2} \left( \operatorname{coth} \frac{t}{2} -1 \right) &amp;= \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{B^{-{}}_m t^m}{m!}\\
  \frac{t}{1 - e^{-t}} &amp;= \frac{t}{2} \left( \operatorname{coth} \frac{t}{2} +1 \right) &amp;= \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{B^+_m t^m}{m!}. 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The (normal) generating function
: &lt;math&gt; z^{-1} \psi_1(z^{-1}) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} B^+_m z^m&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[asymptotic series]]. It contains the [[trigamma function]] {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function ==

[[File:BernoulliNumbersByZetaLowRes.png|thumb|right|The Bernoulli numbers as given by the Riemann zeta function.]]

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the [[Riemann zeta function]]:

:{{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=''n''}} = −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.

Here the argument of the zeta function is 0 or negative.

By means of the zeta [[Riemann zeta function#The functional equation|functional equation]] and the gamma [[Gamma function#General|reflection formula]] the following relation can be obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=279 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_{2n} = \frac {(-1)^{n+1}2(2n)!} {(2\pi)^{2n}} \zeta(2n) &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.

Now the argument of the zeta function is positive.

It then follows from {{math|''&amp;zeta;'' &amp;rarr; 1}} ({{math|''n'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;}}) and [[Stirling formula|Stirling's formula]] that
: &lt;math&gt; |B_{2 n}| \sim 4 \sqrt{\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{ \pi e} \right)^{2n} &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;}}.

== Efficient computation of Bernoulli numbers ==

In some applications it is useful to be able to compute the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} through {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt;}} modulo {{mvar|p}}, where {{mvar|p}} is a prime; for example to test whether [[Vandiver's conjecture]] holds for {{mvar|p}}, or even just to determine whether {{mvar|p}} is an [[irregular prime]]. It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of) {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed {{harv|Buhler|Crandall|Ernvall|Metsankyla|2001}} which require only {{math|''O''(''p'' (log ''p'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} operations (see [[big-O notation|big {{mvar|O}} notation]]).

David Harvey {{harv|Harvey|2008}} describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} modulo {{mvar|p}} for many small primes {{mvar|p}}, and then reconstructing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} via the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. Harvey writes that the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] of this algorithm is {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; log(''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2 + ''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and claims that this [[implementation]] is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Using this implementation Harvey computed {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Harvey's implementation has been included in [[SageMath]] since version 3.1. Prior to that, Bernd Kellner {{harv|Kellner|2002}}&lt;!--A more specific citation would be preferable.--&gt; computed {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to full precision for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;}} in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk {{harv|Pavlyk|2008}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;}} with [[Mathematica]] in April 2008.

== Applications of the Bernoulli numbers ==

=== Asymptotic analysis ===
Arguably the most important application of the Bernoulli number in mathematics is their use in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]]. Assuming that {{mvar|f}} is a sufficiently often differentiable function the Euler–Maclaurin formula can be written as &lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (9.67).&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=a}^{b-1} f(k) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B^-_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_-(f,m).&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation assumes the convention {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=−|b=1}} = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}}. Using the convention {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} = +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} the formula becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=a+1}^{b} f(k) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B^+_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_+(f,m).&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''}} (i.e. the zeroth-order derivative of a {{math|''f''}} is just {{math|''f''}}). Moreover, let {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;(−1)&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote an [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}. By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]],

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = f^{(-1)}(b) - f^{(-1)}(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the last formula can be further simplified to the following succinct form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=a}^{b}f(k)= \sum_{k=0}^m \frac{B_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R(f,m). &lt;/math&gt;

This form is for example the source for the important Euler–Maclaurin expansion of the zeta function

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  \zeta(s) &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^m \frac{B^+_k}{k!} s^{\overline{k-1}} + R(s,m) \\
           &amp; = \frac{B_0}{0!}s^{\overline{-1}} + \frac{B^+_1}{1!} s^{\overline{0}} + \frac{B_2}{2!} s^{\overline{1}} +\cdots+R(s,m) \\
           &amp; = \frac{1}{s-1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{12}s + \cdots + R(s,m).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;{{overline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol|rising factorial power]].&lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (2.44) and (2.52)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernoulli numbers are also frequently used in other kinds of [[asymptotic expansion]]s. The following example is the classical Poincaré-type asymptotic expansion of the [[digamma function]] {{math|''ψ''}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(z) \sim \ln z - \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B^+_k}{k z^k} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Sum of powers ===

{{main article|Faulhaber's formula}}

Bernoulli numbers feature prominently in the [[Closed-form expression|closed form]] expression of the sum of the {{math|''m''}}th powers of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers. For {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}} define

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n k^m = 1^m + 2^m + \cdots + n^m. &lt;/math&gt;

This expression can always be rewritten as a [[polynomial]] in {{math|''n''}} of degree {{math|''m'' + 1}}. The [[coefficient]]s of these polynomials are related to the Bernoulli numbers by '''Bernoulli's formula''':
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac{1}{m + 1} \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m + 1}{k} B^+_k n^{m + 1 - k},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''m'' + 1|b=''k''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} denotes the [[binomial coefficient]].

For example, taking {{math|''m''}} to be 1 gives the [[triangular number]]s {{math|0, 1, 3, 6, …}} {{OEIS2C|id=A000217}}.

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{1}{2} (B_0 n^2 + 2 B^+_1 n^1) = \tfrac12 (n^2 + n).&lt;/math&gt;

Taking {{math|''m''}} to be 2 gives the [[square pyramidal number]]s {{math|0, 1, 5, 14, …}} {{OEIS2C|id=A000330}}.

: &lt;math&gt;1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{1}{3} (B_0 n^3 + 3 B^+_1 n^2 + 3 B_2 n^1) = \tfrac13 \left(n^3 + \tfrac32 n^2 + \tfrac12 n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors use the alternate convention for Bernoulli numbers and state Bernoulli's formula in this way:
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac{1}{m + 1} \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \binom{m + 1}{k} B^{-{}}_k n^{m + 1 - k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after [[Johann Faulhaber]] who also found remarkable ways to calculate [[sums of powers]].

Faulhaber's formula was generalized by V. Guo and J. Zeng to a [[q-analog|{{mvar|q}}-analog]] {{harv|Guo|Zeng|2005}}.

===Taylor series===
The Bernoulli numbers appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansion of many [[trigonometric functions]] and [[hyperbolic function]]s.

;[[Tangent function|Tangent]]
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\tan x &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1} 2^{2n} (2^{2n}-1) B_{2n} }{(2n)!}\; x^{2n-1},&amp; \left |x \right | &amp;&lt; \frac \pi 2 \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
 
;[[Cotangent]]
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\cot x &amp; {} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n B_{2n} (2x)^{2n}}{(2n)!},&amp;  \qquad 0 &lt; |x| &lt; \pi.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Hyperbolic tangent]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tanh x &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^{2n}(2^{2n}-1)B_{2n}}{(2n)!}\;x^{2n-1},&amp; |x| &amp;&lt; \frac \pi 2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Hyperbolic cotangent]]
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\coth x &amp; {} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{B_{2n} (2x)^{2n}}{(2n)!},&amp;  \qquad \qquad 0 &lt; |x| &lt; \pi.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

===Laurent series===
The Bernoulli numbers appear in the following [[Laurent series]]:

[[Digamma function]]: &lt;math&gt; \psi(z)= \ln z- \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac {B_k^{+{}}} {k z^k} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=463 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in topology ===

The [[Kervaire–Milnor's formula]] for the order of the cyclic group of diffeomorphism classes of [[exotic sphere|exotic {{math|(4''n'' − 1)}}-spheres]] which bound [[parallelizable manifold]]s involves Bernoulli numbers. Let {{math|''ES''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the number of such exotic spheres for {{Math|''n'' ≥ 2}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\textit{ES}_n = (2^{2n-2}-2^{4n-3}) \operatorname{Numerator}\left(\frac{B_{4n}}{4n} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|Hirzebruch signature theorem]] for the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|{{mvar|L}} genus]] of a [[Smooth manifold|smooth]] [[Orientability|oriented]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 4''n'' also involves Bernoulli numbers.

== Connections with combinatorial numbers ==

The connection of the Bernoulli number to various kinds of combinatorial numbers is based on the classical theory of finite differences and on the combinatorial interpretation of the Bernoulli numbers as an instance of a fundamental combinatorial principle, the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]].

=== Connection with Worpitzky numbers ===

The definition to proceed with was developed by Julius Worpitzky in 1883. Besides elementary arithmetic only the factorial function {{math|''n''!}} and the power function {{math|''k&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is employed. The signless Worpitzky numbers are defined as

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^{v+k} (v+1)^n \frac{k!}{v!(k-v)!} . &lt;/math&gt;

They can also be expressed through the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=k! \left\{ {n+1\atop k+1} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A Bernoulli number is then introduced as an inclusion–exclusion sum of Worpitzky numbers weighted by the [[Harmonic progression (mathematics)|harmonic sequence]] 1,&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}},&amp;nbsp;…

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \frac{W_{n,k}}{k+1}\ =\ \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k+1} \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v (v+1)^n {k \choose v}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|1|2}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|3|2}} + {{sfrac|2|3}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|7|2}} + {{sfrac|12|3}} − {{sfrac|6|4}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|15|2}} + {{sfrac|50|3}} − {{sfrac|60|4}} + {{sfrac|24|5}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|31|2}} + {{sfrac|180|3}} − {{sfrac|390|4}} + {{sfrac|360|5}} − {{sfrac|120|6}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|63|2}} + {{sfrac|602|3}} − {{sfrac|2100|4}} + {{sfrac|3360|5}} − {{sfrac|2520|6}} + {{sfrac|720|7}}}}

This representation has {{math|''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

Consider the sequence {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}. From Worpitzky's numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A028246}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A163626}} applied to {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …}} is identical to the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (see [[Bernoulli number#Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind|Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind]]). This can be seen via the table:

:{| style="text-align:center"

The first row represents {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Hence for the second fractional Euler numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} ({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}):

:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|1|2}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|3|2}} + {{sfrac|2|4}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|7|2}} + {{sfrac|12|4}} − {{sfrac|6|8}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|15|2}} + {{sfrac|50|4}} − {{sfrac|60|8}} + {{sfrac|24|16}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|31|2}} + {{sfrac|180|4}} − {{sfrac|390|8}} + {{sfrac|360|16}} − {{sfrac|120|32}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|63|2}} + {{sfrac|602|4}} − {{sfrac|2100|8}} + {{sfrac|3360|16}} − {{sfrac|2520|32}} + {{sfrac|720|64}}}}

A second formula representing the Bernoulli numbers by the Worpitzky numbers is for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}

: &lt;math&gt; B_n=\frac n {2^{n+1}-2}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-2)^{-k}\, W_{n-1,k} . &lt;/math&gt;

The simplified second Worpitzky's representation of the second Bernoulli numbers is:

{{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}({{math|''n'' + 1}}) = {{math|{{sfrac|''n'' + 1|2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2}}}} × {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}}({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}}({{math|''n'' + 1}})

which links the second Bernoulli numbers to the second fractional Euler numbers. The beginning is:

:{{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|6}}, 0, −{{sfrac|1|30}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|42}}, … {{=}} ({{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|3|14}}, {{sfrac|2|15}}, {{sfrac|5|62}}, {{sfrac|1|21}}, …) × (1, {{sfrac|1|2}}, 0, −{{sfrac|1|4}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|2}}, …)}}

The numerators of the first parentheses are {{OEIS2C|id=A111701}} (see [[Bernoulli number#Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind|Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind]]).

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the second kind ===

If {{math|''S''(''k'',''m'')}} denotes [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]&lt;ref&gt;L. Comtet, Advanced combinatorics. The art of finite and infinite expansions, Revised and Enlarged Edition, D. Reidel Publ. Co., Dordrecht-Boston, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; then one has:

: &lt;math&gt;j^k=\sum_{m=0}^k {j^{\underline{m}}} S(k,m)&lt;/math&gt;
                                                              
where {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''m''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial]].

If one defines the [[Bernoulli polynomials]] {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''j'')}} as:&lt;ref name="H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory 1973"&gt;H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_k(j)=k\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{j}{m+1}S(k-1,m)m!+B_k &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2,…}} are the Bernoulli numbers.

Then after the following property of [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{j}{m}=\binom{j+1}{m+1}-\binom{j}{m+1} &lt;/math&gt;
 
one has,

:&lt;math&gt; j^k=\frac{B_{k+1}(j+1)-B_{k+1}(j)}{k+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

One also has following for Bernoulli polynomials,&lt;ref name="H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory 1973"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  B_k(j)=\sum_{n=0}^k \binom{k}{n} B_n j^{k-n}. &lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient of {{mvar|j}} in {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''j''|b=''m'' + 1|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} is {{math|{{sfrac|(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;|''m'' + 1}}}}.

Comparing the coefficient of {{mvar|j}} in the two expressions of Bernoulli polynomials, one has:

: &lt;math&gt; B_k=\sum_{m=0}^k (-1)^m \frac{m!}{m+1} S(k,m)&lt;/math&gt;

(resulting in {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) which is an explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers and can be used to prove [[Von Staudt–Clausen theorem|Von-Staudt Clausen theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. W. Gould |title=Explicit formulas for Bernoulli numbers |journal=Amer. Math. Monthly |volume=79 |year=1972 |pages=44–51 |doi=10.2307/2978125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M.

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind ===

The two main formulas relating the unsigned [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;[&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} to the Bernoulli numbers (with {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) are

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^{k} \left[{m+1\atop k+1}\right] B_k = \frac{1}{m+1}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the inversion of this sum (for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}, {{math|''m'' ≥ 0}})

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \left[{m+1\atop k+1}\right] B_{n+k} = A_{n,m}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here the number {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the rational Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers, the first few of which are displayed in the following table.

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align=center"

|-
! 4 
| −{{sfrac|1|30}} || … || … || … || …
|}

The Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers satisfy a simple recurrence relation which can be exploited to iteratively compute the Bernoulli numbers. This leads to the algorithm shown in the section 'algorithmic description' above. See {{OEIS2C|id=A051714}}/{{OEIS2C|id=A051715}}.

An ''autosequence'' is a sequence which has its inverse binomial transform equal to the signed sequence. If the main diagonal is zeroes = {{OEIS2C|id=A000004}}, the autosequence is of the first kind. Example: {{OEIS2C|id=A000045}}, the Fibonacci numbers. If the main diagonal is the first upper diagonal multiplied by 2, it is of the second kind. Example: {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, the second Bernoulli numbers (see {{OEIS2C|id=A190339}}). The Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to {{math|''2''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 1/{{OEIS2C|id=A000079}} leads to {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} (''n'') / {{OEIS2C|id=A06519}} (''n'' + 1). Hence:

===Connection with Pascal’s triangle===

There are formulas connecting Pascal's triangle to Bernoulli numbers &lt;ref&gt;this formula was discovered (or perhaps rediscovered) by Giorgio Pietrocola. His demonstration is available in Italian language: {{cite web |url=http://www.maecla.it/Matematica/sommapotenze/teorema_1B.htm#teorema1b |title=Esplorando un antico sentiero: teoremi sulla somma di potenze di interi successivi (Corollario 2b)|last=Pietrocola |first=Giorgio |date=October 31, 2008 |website=Maecla |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; B^{+}_n=\frac{|A_n|}{(n+1)!}~~~&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;|A_n|&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of a n-by-n square matrix part of Pascal’s triangle whose elements are: &lt;math&gt;
a_{i, k} = \begin{cases} 
0 &amp; \text{if } k&gt;1+i \\
{i+1 \choose k-1} &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

:&lt;math&gt; B^{+}_6 =\frac{\det\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp; 2&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 3&amp; 3&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 4&amp; 6&amp; 4&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 5&amp; 10&amp; 10&amp; 5&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 6&amp; 15&amp; 20&amp; 15&amp; 6\\
1&amp; 7&amp; 21&amp; 35&amp; 35&amp; 21
\end{pmatrix}}{7!}=\frac{120}{5040}=\frac 1 {42}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection with Eulerian numbers ===

There are formulas connecting [[Eulerian number]]s {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;⟨&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;⟩&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} to Bernoulli numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle &amp;= 2^{n+1} (2^{n+1}-1) \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1}, \\
\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle \binom{n}{m}^{-1} &amp;= (n+1) B_n.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Both formulae are valid for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is set to {{sfrac|1|2}}. If {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is set to −{{sfrac|1|2}} they are valid only for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} and {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}} respectively.

==A binary tree representation==
The Stirling polynomials {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} are related to the Bernoulli numbers by {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''n''!''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}. S. C. Woon {{harv|Woon|1997}} described an algorithm to compute {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}} as a binary tree:

:[[File:SCWoonTree.png]]

Woon's recursive algorithm (for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}) starts by assigning to the root node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [1,2]}}. Given a node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} of the tree, the left child of the node is {{math|''L''(''N'') {{=}} [−''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and the right child {{math|''R''(''N'') {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 2, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}. A node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is written as {{math|±[''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} in the initial part of the tree represented above with ± denoting the sign of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Given a node {{mvar|N}} the factorial of {{mvar|N}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; N! = a_1 \prod_{k=2}^{\operatorname{length}(N)} a_k!. &lt;/math&gt;

Restricted to the nodes {{mvar|N}} of a fixed tree-level {{mvar|n}} the sum of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''N''!}}}} is {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}, thus

:&lt;math&gt; B_n = \sum_\stackrel{N \text{ node of}}{\text{ tree-level } n} \frac{n!}{N!}. &lt;/math&gt;

For example:
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1!({{sfrac|1|2!}})}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2!(−{{sfrac|1|3!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!}})}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3!({{sfrac|1|4!}} − {{sfrac|1|2!3!}} − {{sfrac|1|3!2!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!2!}})}}

==Integral representation and continuation==

The [[integral]]
: &lt;math&gt; b(s) = 2e^{s i \pi/2}\int_0^\infty \frac{st^s}{1-e^{2\pi t}} \frac{dt}{t} &lt;/math&gt;
has as special values {{math|''b''(2''n'') {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}.

For example, {{math|1=''b''(3) = {{sfrac|3|2}}''ζ''(3)''&amp;pi;''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''i''}} and {{math|1=''b''(5) = −{{sfrac|15|2}}''ζ''(5)''&amp;pi;''&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;''i''}}. Here, {{mvar|ζ}} is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]]. Leonhard Euler (''Opera Omnia'', Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p.&amp;nbsp;351) considered these numbers and calculated

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  p &amp;=  \frac{3}{2\pi^3}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{3^3}+\cdots \right) = 0.0581522\ldots \\
  q &amp;= \frac{15}{2\pi^5}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^5}+\frac{1}{3^5}+\cdots \right) = 0.0254132\ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==The relation to the Euler numbers and {{pi}}==

The [[Euler number]]s are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the
asymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are in magnitude approximately {{math|{{sfrac|2|π}}(4&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} times larger than the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In consequence:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi \sim 2 (2^{2n} - 4^{2n}) \frac{B_{2n}}{E_{2n}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This asymptotic equation reveals that {{pi}} lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. In fact {{pi}} could be computed from these rational approximations.

Bernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since, for odd {{mvar|n}}, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} (with the exception {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}), it suffices to consider the case when {{mvar|n}} is even.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 B_{n} &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n-1}{k} \frac{n}{4^n-2^n}E_k &amp; n&amp;=2, 4, 6, \ldots \\
 E_{n} &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k-1} \frac{2^k-4^k}{k} B_k &amp; n&amp;=2,4,6,\ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These conversion formulas express an [[inverse relation]] between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to {{pi}}. These numbers are defined for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} as

:&lt;math&gt; S_n = 2 \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^n \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty (4k+1)^{-n} \qquad k=0,-1,1,-2,2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} by convention {{harv|Elkies|2003}}. The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers.  This was first proved by [[Leonhard Euler]] in a landmark paper {{harv|Euler|1735}} ''‘De summis serierum reciprocarum’'' (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are

: &lt;math&gt; S_n = 1,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{5}{24}, \frac{2}{15},\frac{61}{720},\frac{17}{315},\frac{277}{8064},\frac{62}{2835},\ldots  &lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A099612}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A099617}})

These are the coefficients in the expansion of {{math|sec ''x'' + tan ''x''}}.

The Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as ''special views'' of these numbers, selected from the sequence {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and scaled for use in special applications.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_{n} &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [ n \text{ even}] \frac{n! }{2^n - 4^n}\, S_{n}\ , &amp; n&amp;= 2, 3, \ldots \\
  E_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [ n \text{ even}] n! \, S_{n+1}  &amp; n &amp;= 0, 1, \ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression [{{math|''n''}} even] has the value 1 if {{math|''n''}} is even and 0 otherwise ([[Iverson bracket]]).

These identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|2''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} when {{mvar|n}} is even. The {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are rational approximations to {{pi}} and two successive terms always enclose the true value of {{pi}}. Beginning with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the sequence starts ({{OEIS2C|id=A132049}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A132050}}):

: &lt;math&gt; 2, 4, 3, \frac{16}{5}, \frac{25}{8}, \frac{192}{61}, \frac{427}{136}, \frac{4352}{1385}, \frac{12465}{3968}, \frac{158720}{50521},\ldots \quad \longrightarrow \pi. &lt;/math&gt;

These rational numbers also appear in the last paragraph of Euler's paper cited above.

Consider the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform for the sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A046978}} ({{math|''n'' + 2}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A016116}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}):

:{| class="wikitable"
! 0 
|1||{{sfrac|1|2}}||0||−{{sfrac|1|4}}||−{{sfrac|1|4}}||−{{sfrac|1|8}}||0
|-
! 1 
| {{sfrac|1|2}}|| 1|| {{sfrac|3|4}}|| 0|| −{{sfrac|5|8}}|| −{{sfrac|3|4}}||
|-
! 2 
| −{{sfrac|1|2}}|| {{sfrac|1|2}}|| {{sfrac|9|4}}|| {{sfrac|5|2}}|| {{sfrac|5|8}}|| ||

|-

| 8|| {{sfrac|77|2}}|| || || || ||
|-
! 6 
| −{{sfrac|61|2}}|| || || || || ||
|}

From the second, the numerators of the first column are the denominators of Euler's formula. The first column is −{{sfrac|1|2}} × {{OEIS2C|id=A163982}}.

==An algorithmic view: the Seidel triangle==

The sequence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; divide the factorial (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;. In other words: the numbers ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)!, sometimes called [[Alternating permutations|Euler zigzag numbers]], are integers.

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = 1,\,1,\,1,\,2,\,5,\,16,\,61,\,272,\,1385,\,7936,\,50521,\,353792,\ldots \quad n=0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A000111}}). See ({{OEIS2C|id=A253671}}).

Thus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 B_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [n\text{ even}] \frac{n }{2^n-4^n}\, T_{n-1}\  &amp; n &amp;= 2, 3, \ldots \\
 E_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [n\text{ even}] T_{n+1} &amp; n &amp;= 0, 1, \ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are given immediately by {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained from {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.

What remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. However, already in 1877 [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]] {{harv|Seidel|1877}} published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

:[[File:SeidelAlgorithmForTn.png|frame|none|Seidel's algorithm for {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]

#Start by putting 1 in row 0 and let {{math|''k''}} denote the number of the row currently being filled
#If {{math|''k''}} is odd, then put the number on the left end of the row {{math|''k'' − 1}} in the first position of the row {{math|''k''}}, and fill the row from the left to the right, with every entry being the sum of the number to the left and the number to the upper
#At the end of the row duplicate the last number.
#If {{math|''k''}} is even, proceed similar in the other direction.

Seidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont {{harv|Dumont|1981}}) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.

Similar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz {{harv|Knuth|Buckholtz|1967}} gave a recurrence equation for the numbers {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and recommended this method for computing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} ‘on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers’.

V. I. Arnold rediscovered Seidel's algorithm in {{harv|Arnold|1991}} and later Millar, Sloane and Young popularized Seidel's algorithm under the name [[boustrophedon transform]].

The first column whose the absolute values are {{OEIS2C|id=A000111}} could be the numerator of a trigonometric function.

{{OEIS2C|id=A163747}} is an autosequence of the first kind (the main diagonal is {{OEIS2C|id=A000004}}). The corresponding array is:

==A combinatorial view: alternating permutations==
{{main article|Alternating permutations}}

Around 1880, three years after the publication of Seidel's algorithm, [[Désiré André]] proved a now classic result of combinatorial analysis {{harv|André|1879}} &amp; {{harv|André|1881}}. Looking at the first terms of the Taylor expansion of the [[trigonometric functions]]
{{math|tan ''x''}} and {{math|sec ''x''}} André made a startling discovery.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \tan x &amp;= x + \frac{2x^3}{3!} + \frac{16x^5}{5!} + \frac{272x^7}{7!} + \frac{7936x^9}{9!} + \cdots\\[6pt]
 \sec x &amp;= 1 + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{5x^4}{4!} + \frac{61x^6}{6!} + \frac{1385x^8}{8!} + \frac{50521x^{10}}{10!} + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients are the [[Euler number]]s of odd and even index, respectively. In consequence the ordinary expansion of {{math|tan ''x'' + sec ''x''}} has as coefficients the rational numbers {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

: &lt;math&gt; \tan x + \sec x = 1 + x + \tfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \tfrac{1}{3}x^3 + \tfrac{5}{24}x^4 + \tfrac{2}{15}x^5 + \tfrac{61}{720}x^6 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

André then succeeded by means of a recurrence argument to show that the [[alternating permutation]]s of odd size are enumerated by the Euler numbers of odd index (also called tangent numbers) and the alternating permutations of even size by the Euler numbers of even index (also called secant numbers).

==Related sequences==

The arithmetic mean of the first and the second Bernoulli numbers are the associate Bernoulli numbers: 
{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1|6}}}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = −{{sfrac|1|30}}}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A176327}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}. Via the second row of its inverse Akiyama–Tanigawa transform {{OEIS2C|id=A177427}}, they lead to Balmer series {{OEIS2C|id=A061037}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A061038}}.

The Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm applied to {{OEIS2C|id=A060819}} ({{math|''n'' + 4}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{mvar|n}}) leads to the Bernoulli numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A027641}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, or {{OEIS2C|id=A176327}} {{OEIS2C|id=A176289}} without {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, named intrinsic Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}}.

:{| style="text-align:center; padding-left; padding-right: 2em;"

Hence another link between the intrinsic Bernoulli numbers and the Balmer series via {{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{math|''n''}}).

{{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{math|''n'' − 2}}) = 0, 2, 1, 6,… is a permutation of the non-negative numbers.

The terms of the first row are f(n) = {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|''n'' + 2}}}}. 2, f(n) is an autosequence of the second kind. 3/2, f(n) leads by its inverse binomial transform to 3/2 &amp;minus;1/2 1/3 &amp;minus;1/4 1/5 ... = 1/2 + log 2.

Consider g(n) = 1/2 - 1 / (n+2) = 0, 1/6, 1/4, 3/10, 1/3. The Akiyama-Tanagiwa transforms gives:

:{| style="text-align:center; padding-left; padding-right:2em;"

0, g(n), is an autosequence of the second kind.

Euler {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} ({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}) without the second term ({{sfrac|1|2}}) are the fractional intrinsic Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') {{=}} 1, 0, −{{sfrac|1|4}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|2}}, 0, −{{sfrac|17|8}}, 0, …}} The corresponding Akiyama transform is:

The first line is {{math|''Eu''(''n'')}}. {{math|''Eu''(''n'')}} preceded by a zero is an autosequence of the first kind. It is linked to the Oresme numbers. The numerators of the second line are {{OEIS2C|id=A069834}} preceded by 0. The difference table is:

The rows are alternatively autosequences of the first and of the second kind. The second row is {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}. For the third row, see {{OEIS2C|id=A051716}}.

==Arithmetical properties of the Bernoulli numbers==

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} for integers {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} provided for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the expression {{math|−''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} is understood as the limiting value and the convention {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} is used. This intimately relates them to the values of the zeta function at negative integers. As such, they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties. For example, the [[Agoh–Giuga conjecture]] postulates that {{mvar|p}} is a prime number if and only if {{math|''pB''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is congruent to −1 modulo {{mvar|p}}. Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the [[ideal class group]]s of [[cyclotomic field]]s by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the [[Herbrand-Ribet theorem]], and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by [[Ankeny–Artin–Chowla congruence|Ankeny–Artin–Chowla]].

=== The Kummer theorems ===

The Bernoulli numbers are related to [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (FLT) by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]'s theorem {{harv|Kummer|1850}}, which says:

:If the odd prime {{mvar|p}} does not divide any of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt;}} then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}} has no solutions in nonzero integers.

Prime numbers with this property are called [[regular prime]]s. Another classical result of Kummer {{harv|Kummer|1851}} are the following [[Modular arithmetic#Congruence relation|congruences]].

{{main article|Kummer's congruence}}

:Let {{mvar|p}} be an odd prime and {{mvar|b}} an even number such that {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} does not divide {{mvar|b}}. Then for any non-negative integer {{mvar|k}}
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{B_{k(p-1)+b}}{k(p-1)+b} \equiv \frac{B_{b}}{b} \pmod{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

A generalization of these congruences goes by the name of {{math|''p''}}-adic continuity.

==={{math|''p''}}-adic continuity===

If {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are positive integers such that {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are not divisible by {{math|''p'' − 1}} and {{math|''m'' ≡ ''n'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''b'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; (''p'' − 1)}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;(1-p^{m-1})\frac{B_m}{m} \equiv (1-p^{n-1})\frac{B_n} n \pmod{p^b}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}}, this can also be written

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1-p^{-u}\right)\zeta(u) \equiv \left(1-p^{-v}\right)\zeta(v) \pmod{p^b},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 − ''m''}} and {{math|''v'' {{=}} 1 − ''n''}}, so that {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are nonpositive and not congruent to 1 modulo {{math|''p'' − 1}}. This tells us that the Riemann zeta function, with {{math|1 − ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−''s''&lt;/sup&gt;}} taken out of the Euler product formula, is continuous in the [[p-adic number|{{mvar|p}}-adic number]]s on odd negative integers congruent modulo {{math|''p'' − 1}} to a particular {{math|''a'' ≢ 1 mod (''p'' − 1)}}, and so can be extended to a continuous function {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'')}} for all {{mvar|p}}-adic integers {{math|'''ℤ'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[p-adic zeta function|{{mvar|p}}-adic zeta function]].

=== Ramanujan's congruences ===

The following relations, due to [[Ramanujan]], provide a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers that is more efficient than the one given by their original recursive definition:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{m+3}{m} B_m=\begin{cases}
\frac{m+3}{3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 0\pmod 6;\\
\frac{m+3}{3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m-2}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 2\pmod 6;\\
-\frac{m+3}{6}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m-4}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 4\pmod 6.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Von Staudt–Clausen theorem ===

{{main article|Von Staudt–Clausen theorem}}

The von Staudt–Clausen theorem was given by [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] {{harv|von Staudt|1840}} and [[Thomas Clausen (mathematician)|Thomas Clausen]] {{harv|Clausen|1840}} independently in 1840. The theorem states that for every {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}},
: &lt;math&gt; B_{2n} + \sum_{(p-1)\,\mid\,2n} \frac1p&lt;/math&gt;
is an integer. The sum extends over all [[prime number|primes]] {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' − 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}.

A consequence of this is that the denominator of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by the product of all primes {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' − 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}. In particular, these denominators are [[square-free]] and divisible by&amp;nbsp;6.

=== Why do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish? ===
The sum

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_k(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^k - \frac{n^k} 2&lt;/math&gt;

can be evaluated for negative values of the index {{math|''n''}}. Doing so will show that it is an [[odd function]] for even values of {{math|''k''}}, which implies that the  sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''k'' + 1 − ''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is 0 for {{math|''m''}} even and {{math|2''k'' + 1 − ''m'' &gt; 1}}; and that the term for {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is cancelled by the subtraction.  The von Staudt–Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for ''n'' &gt; 1).

From the von Staudt–Clausen theorem it is known that for odd {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} the number {{math|2''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets

: &lt;math&gt; 2B_n =\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \frac{2}{m+1}m! \left\{{n+1\atop m+1} \right\} = 0\quad(n&gt;1 \text{ is odd})&lt;/math&gt;

as a ''sum of integers'', which is not trivial. Here a combinatorial fact comes to surface which explains the vanishing of the Bernoulli numbers at odd index. Let {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the number of surjective maps from {{math|{1, 2, …, ''n''}|}} to {{math|{1, 2, …, ''m''}|}}, then {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''!&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;{&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}}. The last equation can only hold if

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{\text{odd }m=1}^{n-1} \frac 2 {m^2}S_{n,m}=\sum_{\text{even } m=2}^n \frac{2}{m^2} S_{n,m} \quad (n&gt;2 \text{ is even}). &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be proved by induction. The first two examples of this equation are

:{{math|1=''n'' = 4: 2 + 8 = 7 + 3}},
:{{math|1=''n'' = 6: 2 + 120 + 144 = 31 + 195 + 40}}.

Thus the Bernoulli numbers vanish at odd index because some non-obvious combinatorial identities are embodied in the Bernoulli numbers.

=== A restatement of the Riemann hypothesis ===

The connection between the Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function is strong enough to provide an alternate formulation of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (RH) which uses only the Bernoulli number. In fact [[Marcel Riesz]] {{harv|Riesz|1916}} proved that the RH is equivalent to the following assertion:

:For every {{math|''ε'' &gt; {{sfrac|1|4}}}} there exists a constant {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}} (depending on {{math|''ε''}}) such that {{math|{{abs|''R''(''x'')}} &lt; ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{math|''x'' → ∞}}.

Here {{math|''R''(''x'')}} is the [[Riesz function]]

: &lt;math&gt; R(x) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty
\frac{k^{\overline{k}} x^{k}}{(2\pi)^{2k}\left(\frac{B_{2k}}{2k}\right)}
= 2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{\overline{k}}x^k}{(2\pi)^{2k}\beta_{2k}}. &lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;{{overline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] in the notation of [[D. E. Knuth]]. The numbers {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''}}}} occur frequently in the study of the zeta function and are significant  because {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a {{math|''p''}}-integer for primes {{math|''p''}} where {{math|''p'' − 1}} does not divide {{math|''n''}}.  The {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called ''divided Bernoulli numbers''.

==&lt;span id="Generalized Bernoulli numbers"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Generalized Bernoulli numbers==
The '''generalized Bernoulli numbers''' are certain [[algebraic number]]s, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to [[Special values of L-functions|special values]] of [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet {{mvar|L}}-functions]] in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.

Let {{mvar|χ}} be a [[Dirichlet character]] modulo {{mvar|f}}. The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to {{mvar|χ}} are defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{a=1}^f \chi(a) \frac{te^{at}}{e^{ft}-1} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty B_{k,\chi}\frac{t^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from the exceptional {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, we have, for any Dirichlet character {{mvar|χ}}, that {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''χ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} if {{math|''χ''(−1) ≠ (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Generalizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}:

: &lt;math&gt;L(1-k,\chi)=-\frac{B_{k,\chi}}k,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''(''s'',''χ'')}} is the Dirichlet {{mvar|L}}-function of {{mvar|χ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neukirch|1999|loc=§VII.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Eisenstein–Kronecker number}}

==Appendix==

=== Assorted identities ===
{{unordered list
|1 = [[Umbral calculus]] gives a compact form of Bernoulli's formula by using an abstract symbol {{math|'''B'''}}:

: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac 1 {m+1} ((\mathbf{B} + n)^{m+1} - B_{m+1}) &lt;/math&gt;

where the symbol {{math|'''B'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} that appears during binomial expansion of the parenthesized term is to be replaced by the Bernoulli number {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}). More suggestively and mnemonically, this may be written as a definite integral:

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \int_0^n (\mathbf{B}+x)^m\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

Many other Bernoulli identities can be written compactly with this symbol, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{B} + 1)^m  = B_m  &lt;/math&gt;

|2 = Let {{math|''n''}} be non-negative and even

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(n) = \frac{(-1)^{\frac{n}{2} - 1} B_n (2\pi)^n}{2(n!)}&lt;/math&gt;

|3 = The {{math|''n''}}th [[cumulant]] of the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[probability distribution]] on the interval [−1,&amp;nbsp;0] is {{math|{{sfrac|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''}}}}.

|4 = Let {{math|''n''? {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''n''!}}}} and {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}. Then {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the following {{math|(''n'' + 1) × (''n'' + 1)}} determinant:&lt;ref name="Malenfant 2011" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
B_n &amp; = n! \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
2? &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
n? &amp; (n-1)? &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
(n+1)? &amp; n? &amp; \cdots &amp; 2? &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix} \\[8pt]
&amp; = n! \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{2!} &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{1}{n!} &amp; \frac{1}{(n-1)!} &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\frac{1}{(n+1)!} &amp; \frac{1}{n!} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{1}{2!} &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the determinant is {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}, the [[Stirling polynomial]] at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}}.

|5 = For even-numbered Bernoulli numbers, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by the {{math|(''p'' + 1) × (''p'' + 1)}} determinant:&lt;ref name="Malenfant 2011"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1103.1585 |author1=Jerome Malenfant |title=Finite, closed-form expressions for the partition function and for Euler, Bernoulli, and Stirling numbers |class=math.NT |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_{2p} = -\frac{(2p)!}{2^{2p} - 2} \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{3!} &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\frac{1}{5!} &amp; \frac{1}{3!} &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots&amp; \vdots \\
\frac{1}{(2p+1)!} &amp; \frac{1}{(2p-1)!} &amp; \frac{1}{(2p-3)!} &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{1}{3!} &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

|6 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}. Then ([[Leonhard Euler]])

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}B_k B_{n-k}+B_{n-1}=-B_n &lt;/math&gt;

|7 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.  Then {{harv|von Ettingshausen|1827}}

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n+1}k (n+k+1)B_{n+k}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

|8 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}.  Then ([[Leopold Kronecker]] 1883)

: &lt;math&gt; B_n = - \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{(-1)^k}{k} \binom{n+1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k j^n &lt;/math&gt;

|9 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} and {{math|''m'' ≥ 1}}.  Then {{harv|Carlitz|1968}}

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^m \sum_{r=0}^m \binom{m}{r} B_{n+r}=(-1)^n \sum_{s=0}^n \binom{n}{s} B_{m+s} &lt;/math&gt;

|10 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}} and

: &lt;math&gt; H_n=\sum_{k=1}^n k^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

the [[harmonic number]]. Then (H. Miki 1978)

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k}\frac{B_k}{k} - \sum_{k=2}^{n-2} \binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k} B_k =H_n B_n&lt;/math&gt;

|11 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}}. [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] found (1997)

: &lt;math&gt; (n+2)\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}B_k B_{n-k}-2\sum_{l=2}^{n-2}\binom{n+2}{l} B_l B_{n-l}=n(n+1)B_n &lt;/math&gt;

|12 = ''Faber–[[Rahul Pandharipande|Pandharipande]]–[[Zagier]]–Gessel identity'': for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}},

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\left(B_{n-1}(x)+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{B_{k}(x)}{k}
\frac{B_{n-k}(x)}{n-k}\right) -\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}
{n-k} B_k(x) =H_{n-1}B_n(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} results in the Bernoulli number identity in one or another convention.

|13 = The next formula is true for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, but only for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(0) {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{B_k}{n-k+2} = \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;

|14 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}. Then

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_k(1) = 2^n &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_{k}(0) = \delta_{n,0} &lt;/math&gt;

|15 = A reciprocity relation of M.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Gelfand {{harv|Agoh|Dilcher|2008}}:

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^k \binom{k}{j} \frac{B_{m+1+j}}{m+1+j} + (-1)^{k+1} \sum_{j=0}^m \binom{m}{j}\frac{B_{k+1+j}}{k+1+j} = \frac{k!m!}{(k+m+1)!} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">'''Boiler blowdown''' is water intentionally wasted from a [[boiler]] to avoid concentration of impurities during continuing evaporation of steam.  The water is blown out of the boiler with some force by steam pressure within the boiler.  Bottom blowdown used with early boilers caused abrupt downward adjustment of boiler water level and was customarily expelled downward to avoid the safety hazard of showering hot water on  nearby individuals.
[[File:Steam Boiler 3 english.png|thumb|right|Surface blowdown is removed from the steam drum at the top of the boiler and Bottom blowdown is removed from the mud drum at the bottom of the boiler.]]

==Background==
A  steam boiler evaporates liquid water to form steam, or gaseous water; and requires frequent replenishment of [[boiler feedwater]] for the continuous production of steam required by most boiler applications.  Water is a capable solvent, and will dissolve small amounts of solids from piping and containers including the boiler.  Continuing evaporation of steam concentrates dissolved impurities until they reach levels potentially damaging to steam production within the boiler.  Without blowdown, impurities would reach saturation levels and begin to precipitate within the boiler.  Impurity concentrations are highest where steam is being produced near heat exchange surfaces.  Precipitation would be expected to occur in the form of scale deposits on those heat exchange surfaces.  Scale deposits thermally insulate heat exchange surfaces initially decreasing the rate of steam generation, and potentially causing boiler metals to reach failure temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer p.39-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface blowdown==
Surface blowdown continuously bleeds off a low volume of water from within the boiler as a means of ridding the boiler of dissolved impurities.  It is most effective to remove water with the highest level of impurities; and such water is found where steam separates in the steam drum at the top of the boiler.  There are two types of surface blowdown fittings.  The simpler is a pipe entering the steam drum at the normal water level.  A more sophisticated skimmer arrangement attaches a swivel joint to the pipe for a short length of pipe suspended by a float.&lt;ref name="wll"&gt;Woodruff, Lammers&amp;Lammers pp.230-234&lt;/ref&gt;  The skimmer may be more effective at removing floating oil which might otherwise cause foaming.  Surface blowdown is normally fed to a flash tank and heat exchanger for heat recovery.  The flashed steam can be used in the feedwater heater.  These energy economies are seldom practical with infrequent bottom blowdown.  Surface blowdown offers the additional advantage of steady-state operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, Lammers&amp;Lammers pp.269&amp;270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom blowdown==
Some [[boiler water treatment]]s cause precipitation of impurities as insoluble particles anticipating those particles will settle to the bottom of the boiler before they become entrained in water circulating past the heat exchange surfaces.  These water treatments often include compounds forming a sludge to entrap such particles; and boilers intended for such water treatment include a structure called a mud drum at the lowest part of the boiler.  Bottom blowdown involves periodically opening valves in the mud drum to allow boiler pressure to force accumulated sludge out of the boiler.  Similar blowdown connections at the bottom of water wall headers are blown down less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Betz pp.106&amp;107&lt;/ref&gt;  Several short blowdown events remove sludge more effectively than a single continuous blowdown.  Shorter blowdown events cause less significant changes in boiler water level, and are safer during periods of high steam demand.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, Lammers&amp;Lammers p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom blowdown piping drains the lowest parts of the boiler so it can be used to drain the boiler for servicing.  Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge.  Modern boilers discharge bottom blowdown to a blowoff tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns.  A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first.  Two bottom blowdown valves are often used in series to minimize erosion.  One valve serves as the sealing valve, and the other as the blowdown valve.  The sealing valve is customarily opened first and closed last.  Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces.  Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it.  Bottom blowdown valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.&lt;ref name="wll"/&gt;

'''Butter''' is a [[dairy product]] containing up to 80% [[butterfat]] (in commercial products) which is solid when chilled and at [[room temperature]] in some regions, and liquid when warmed. It is made by [[churning (butter)|churning]] fresh or [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[cream]] or [[milk]] to separate the butterfat from the [[buttermilk]]. It is generally used as a [[spread (food)|spread]] on plain or toasted bread products and a [[condiment]] on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as [[baking]], [[sauce]] making, and [[pan frying]]. Butter consists of [[butterfat]], milk [[protein]]s and water, and often added salt.

Most frequently made from [[cattle|cow's]] milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other [[mammal]]s, including [[Sheep milk|sheep]], [[Goat milk|goats]], [[Buffalo milk|buffalo]], and [[Yak milk|yaks]]. [[Edible salt|Salt]] (such as [[dairy salt]]), [[flavoring]]s (such as [[garlic butter|garlic]]) and [[preservative]]s are sometimes added to butter. [[Kitchen rendering|Rendering]] butter, removing the water and [[milk solids]], produces [[clarified butter]] or ''[[ghee]]'', which is almost entirely butterfat.

Butter is a water-in-oil [[emulsion]] resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when [[refrigerated]], but softens to a spreadable consistency at [[room temperature]], and melts to a thin liquid consistency at {{Convert|32|to|35|C}}. The density of butter is 911&amp;nbsp;grams per Litre (0.950 lb per US pint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://physics.info/density/|work=The Physics Hypertextbook|title=Density|last=Elert|first=Glenn|access-date=2018-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819083024/https://physics.info/density/#|archive-date=19 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its natural, unmodified color is dependent on the source animal's feed and genetics, but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with [[food coloring]]s like [[annatto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Substitute for 'Annatto' in Butter |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/157232a0 |website=Nature |publisher=Nature |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[carotene]].

==Etymology==
[[File:BreadButterKnife.jpg|thumb|left|Butter is often served for spreading on bread with a [[butter knife]].]]

The word ''butter'' derives (via [[Germanic languages]]) from the [[Latin]] ''butyrum'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dbutyrum butyrum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127023222/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dbutyrum# |date=27 January 2012 }}, Charlton T.

The word commonly is used to describe [[purée]]d vegetable or [[nut butter|seed]] and [[nut (fruit)|nut]] products such as [[peanut butter]] and [[almond butter]]. It is often applied to spread [[Fruit butter|fruit products]] such as [[apple butter]]. [[Fat]]s such as [[cocoa butter]] and [[shea butter]] that remain solid at room temperature are also known as "butters". Non-dairy items that have a dairy-butter consistency may use "butter" to call that consistency to mind, including food items such as [[maple butter]] and [[Tremella mesenterica|witch's butter]] and nonfood items such as [[baby bottom butter]], [[hyena butter]], and [[rock butter]].

==Production==
{{Main article|Churning (butter)}}
[[File:Churning butter.jpg|thumb|left|Churning cream into butter using a hand-held mixer.]]
[[Homogenization (chemistry)|Unhomogenized]] milk and cream contain [[butterfat]] in [[microscopic]] globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of [[phospholipid]]s ([[fatty acid]] [[emulsifier]]s) and [[protein]]s, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from the other parts of the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat [[crystals]], and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.

Churning produces small butter grains floating in the water-based portion of the cream. This watery liquid is called [[buttermilk]]—although the buttermilk most common today is instead a directly fermented skimmed milk. The buttermilk is drained off; sometimes more buttermilk is removed by rinsing the grains with water. Then the grains are "worked": pressed and kneaded together. When prepared manually, this is done using wooden boards called [[scotch hands]]. This consolidates the butter into a solid mass and breaks up embedded pockets of buttermilk or water into tiny droplets.

Commercial butter is about 80% butterfat and 15% water; traditionally made butter may have as little as 65% fat and 30% water. Butterfat is a mixture of [[triglyceride]], a tri[[ester]] derived from [[glycerol]] and three of any of several [[fatty acid]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Jost "Milk and Dairy Products" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a16_589.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butter becomes [[rancidification|rancid]] when these chains break down into smaller components, like [[butyric acid]] and [[diacetyl]]. The density of butter is 0.911&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.527&amp;nbsp;[[Ounce|oz]]/in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), about the same as [[ice]].

In some countries, butter is [[Butter grading|given a grade]] before commercial distribution.

==Types==
Before modern factory butter making, cream was usually collected from several milkings and was therefore several days old and somewhat fermented by the time it was made into butter. Butter made from a fermented cream is known as '''cultured butter'''. During fermentation, the cream naturally sours as [[bacterium|bacteria]] convert [[lactose|milk sugars]] into [[lactic acid]]. The fermentation process produces additional aroma compounds, including [[diacetyl]], which makes for a fuller-flavored and more "buttery" tasting product.&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGee|first=Harold|author-link=Harold McGee|title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|lccn=2004058999|oclc=56590708}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=35}} Today, cultured butter is usually made from pasteurized cream whose fermentation is produced by the introduction of ''[[Lactococcus]]'' and ''[[Leuconostoc]]'' bacteria.

[[Image:Milkproducts.svg|thumb|275px|Chart of milk products and production relationships, including butter.]]
Another method for producing cultured butter, developed in the early 1970s, is to produce butter from fresh cream and then incorporate bacterial cultures and lactic acid. Using this method, the cultured butter flavor grows as the butter is aged in cold storage. For manufacturers, this method is more efficient, since aging the cream used to make butter takes significantly more space than simply storing the finished butter product. A method to make an artificial simulation of cultured butter is to add lactic acid and flavor compounds directly to the fresh-cream butter; while this more efficient process is claimed to simulate the taste of cultured butter, the product produced is not cultured but is instead flavored.

Dairy products are often [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] during production to kill [[pathogen]]ic bacteria and other [[microbe]]s. Butter made from pasteurized fresh cream is called '''sweet cream butter'''. Production of sweet cream butter first became common in the 19th century, with the development of [[refrigeration]] and the mechanical [[cream separator]].&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=33}} Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is called '''raw cream butter'''. While butter made from pasteurized cream may keep for several months, raw cream butter has a [[shelf life]] of roughly ten days.

Throughout [[continental Europe]], cultured butter is preferred, while sweet cream butter dominates in the United States and the [[United Kingdom]]. Cultured butter is sometimes labeled "European-style" butter in the United States, although cultured butter is made and sold by some, especially Amish, dairies. Commercial raw cream butter is virtually unheard-of in the United States. Raw cream butter is generally only found made at home by consumers who have purchased raw whole milk directly from dairy farmers, skimmed the cream themselves, and made butter with it. It is rare in Europe as well.&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=34}}

Several "spreadable" butters have been developed. These remain softer at colder temperatures and are therefore easier to use directly out of refrigeration. Some methods modify the makeup of the butter's fat through chemical manipulation of the finished product, some manipulate the cattle's feed, and some incorporate [[vegetable oil]] into the butter. "Whipped" butter, another product designed to be more spreadable, is aerated by incorporating [[nitrogen]] gas—normal air is not used to avoid [[oxidation]] and [[rancidification|rancidity]].

All categories of butter are sold in both salted and unsalted forms. Either granular [[edible salt|salt]] or a strong [[brine]] are added to salted butter during processing. In addition to enhanced flavor, the addition of salt acts as a [[preservative]]. The amount of [[butterfat]] in the finished product is a vital aspect of production. In the United States, products sold as "butter" must contain at least 80% butterfat. In practice, most American butters contain slightly more than that, averaging around 81% butterfat. European butters generally have a higher ratio—up to 85%.

[[File:Butterschmalz-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Liquid [[clarified butter]]]]
[[Clarified butter]] is butter with almost all of its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating butter to its [[melting point]] and then allowing it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, [[whey]] proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and [[casein]] proteins that settle to the bottom.&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=37}}

[[Ghee]] is clarified butter that has been heated to around 120&amp;nbsp;°C (250&amp;nbsp;°F) after the water evaporated, turning the milk solids brown. This process flavors the ghee, and also produces [[antioxidant]]s that help protect it from rancidity. Because of this, ghee can keep for six to eight months under normal conditions.&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=37}}

{{anchor|Whey butter}}

===Whey butter===
[[File:Jan Spanjaert Bauernhaus mit butternder Bäuerin.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Butter made in a [[barn]]; German painting by Jan Spanjaert.]]
Cream may be separated (usually by a centrifugal separator) from [[whey]] instead of milk, as a [[byproduct]] of [[cheese]]-making. Whey butter may be made from whey cream. Whey cream and butter have a lower fat content and taste more salty, tangy and "cheesy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/|title=Article on sweet cream, whey cream, and the butters they produce|work=Kosher|accessdate=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220100350/http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/#|archive-date=20 February 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also cheaper than "sweet" cream and butter. The fat content of whey is low, so 1000 pounds of whey will typically give 3 pounds of butter.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Thom, Walter Fisk, ''The Book of Cheese'', 1918, reprinted in 2007 as {{ISBN|1429010746}}, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CAT31283652|title=Whey butter|first=Charles Francis|last=Doane|date=12 November 2017|publisher=Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Industry|via=Internet Archive|access-date=29 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528151635/https://archive.org/details/CAT31283652#|archive-date=28 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:ButterMakingPalestine1914.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|''Traditional butter-making in Palestine''. Ancient techniques were still practiced in the early 20th century. ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', March 1914.]]

The earliest butter would have been from [[sheep]] or [[goat]]'s milk; [[cattle]] are not thought to have been [[domestication|domesticated]] for another thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Dates from McGee p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient method of butter making, still used today in parts of [[Africa]] and the [[Near East]], involves a goat skin half filled with milk, and inflated with air before being sealed. The skin is then hung with ropes on a tripod of sticks, and rocked until the movement leads to the formation of butter.

In the [[Mediterranean climate]], unclarified butter spoils quickly— unlike [[cheese]], it is not a practical method of preserving the nutrients of milk. The ancient Greeks and Romans seemed to have considered butter a food fit more for the northern [[barbarian]]s. A play by the Greek comic poet [[Anaxandrides]] refers to [[Thracians]] as ''boutyrophagoi'', "butter-eaters".&lt;ref name=Dalby_65&gt;Dalby p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]] calls butter "the most delicate of food among barbarous nations", and goes on to describe its medicinal properties.&lt;ref&gt;Bostock and Riley translation. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%232043;layout=;loc=28.36|Book Book 28, chapter 35].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the physician [[Galen]] also described butter as a medicinal agent only.&lt;ref&gt;Galen. ''de aliment. facult.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian and linguist [[Andrew Dalby]] says most references to butter in ancient Near Eastern texts should more correctly be translated as [[ghee]]. Ghee is mentioned in the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] as a typical trade article around the first century CE [[Arabian Sea]], and Roman geographer [[Strabo]] describes it as a commodity of [[Arabia]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]].&lt;ref name=Dalby_65/&gt; In [[India]], ghee has been a symbol of purity and an offering to the gods—especially [[Agni]], the [[Hindu]] god of fire—for more than 3000 years; references to ghee's sacred nature appear numerous times in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', circa 1500–1200&amp;nbsp;BCE. The tale of the child [[Krishna]] stealing butter remains a popular children's story in India today. Since India's prehistory, ghee has been both a [[staple food]] and used for ceremonial purposes, such as fueling holy lamps and funeral pyres.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:MakingButter1499.jpg|thumb|left|160px|upright|Woman churning butter; ''Compost et Kalendrier des Bergères'', Paris, 1499]]
In the cooler climates of northern Europe, people could store butter longer before it spoiled. [[Scandinavia]] has the oldest tradition in Europe of butter export trade, dating at least to the 12th century.&lt;ref name=WE&gt;Web Exhibits: Butter. [http://webexhibits.org/butter/history-firkins.html Ancient Firkins] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021003815/http://webexhibits.org/butter/history-firkins.html# |date=21 October 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Rome and through much of the [[Middle Ages]], butter was a common food across most of Europe—but had a low reputation, and so was consumed principally by [[peasant]]s. Butter slowly became more accepted by the upper class, notably when the early 16th century [[Roman Catholic Church]] allowed its consumption during [[Lent]]. Bread and butter became common fare among the [[middle class]], and the English, in particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a sauce with meat and vegetables.&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=33}}

In antiquity, butter was used for fuel in lamps as a substitute for oil. The ''Butter Tower'' of [[Rouen Cathedral]] was erected in the early 16th century when Archbishop [[Georges d'Amboise]] authorized the burning of butter instead of oil, which was scarce at the time, during Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pantropheon or a History of Food and its Preparation in Ancient Times |last=Soyer |first=Alexis|year=1977|origyear=1853|publisher=Paddington Press |location=Wisbech, Cambs. |isbn=0-448-22976-5|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across northern Europe, butter was sometimes treated in a manner unheard-of today: it was packed into barrels ([[wikt:Special:Search/firkin|firkins]]) and buried in [[peat bog]]s, perhaps for years. Such "[[bog butter]]" would develop a strong flavor as it aged, but remain edible, in large part because of the unique cool, airless, [[antiseptic]] and [[acid]]ic environment of a peat bog. Firkins of such buried butter are a common archaeological find in Ireland; the [[National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology]] has some containing "a grayish cheese-like substance, partially hardened, not much like butter, and quite free from putrefaction." The practice was most common in Ireland in the 11th–14th centuries; it ended entirely before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=WE/&gt;

===Industrialization===
Like Ireland, [[France]] became well known for its butter, particularly in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. By the 1860s, butter had become so in demand in France that Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] offered prize money for an inexpensive substitute to supplement France's inadequate butter supplies. A [[Hippolyte Mège-Mouriés|French chemist]] claimed the prize with the invention of [[margarine]] in 1869. The first margarine was [[beef]] [[tallow]] flavored with milk and worked like butter; vegetable margarine followed after the development of [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] oils around 1900.

[[File:GustafDeLaval.jpg|thumb|upright|Gustaf de Laval's [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] cream separator sped up the butter-making process.]]
Until the 19th century, the vast majority of butter was made by hand, on farms. The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of [[cheese]] factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] [[cream separator]] was introduced, marketed most successfully by [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer [[Gustav de Laval|Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Everett E. "Europe's Contribution to the American Dairy Industry". ''The Journal of Economic History'', Volume 9, 1949. 72-84.&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the butter produced in the [[United States]] was factory made; [[Europe]] followed suit shortly after.

In 1920, [[Otto Frederick Hunziker|Otto Hunziker]] authored ''The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Hunziker | first =O F | authorlink=Otto Frederick Hunziker | year =1920 | title =The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory | publisher =author | location =LaGrange, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940).

Butter also provided extra income to farm families. They used wood presses with carved decoration to press butter into pucks or small bricks to sell at nearby markets or general stores. The decoration identified the farm that produced the butter.  This practice continued until production was mechanized and butter was produced in less decorative stick form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sarah Josepha Buell|title=Mrs. Hale's new cook book|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, butter presses remain in use for decorative purposes.

Per capita butter consumption declined in most western nations during the 20th century, in large part because of the rising popularity of [[margarine]], which is less expensive and, until recent years, was perceived as being healthier. In the United States, margarine consumption overtook butter during the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Web Exhibits: Butter.

==Packaging==
===United States===
In the United States, butter has traditionally been made into small, rectangular blocks by means of a pair of wooden butter paddles. It is usually produced in {{convert|4|oz|lb g|adj=on|frac=4}} sticks that are individually wrapped in waxed or foiled paper, and sold as a {{convert|1|lb}} package of 4 sticks. This practice is believed to have originated in 1907, when [[Swift and Company]] began packaging butter in this manner for mass distribution.&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Western-pack-butter.jpg|thumb|225px|Western-pack shape unsalted butter]]
Due to historical differences in butter printers (machines that cut and package butter),&lt;ref name="cooksill"/&gt; 4-ounce sticks are commonly produced in two different shapes:
* The dominant shape east of the Rocky Mountains is the Elgin, or Eastern-pack shape, named for a dairy in [[Elgin, Illinois]]. The sticks measure {{convert|4+3/4|x|1+1/4|x|1+1/4|in}} and are typically sold stacked two by two in elongated cube-shaped boxes.&lt;ref name="cooksill"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Stick-of-butter-salted.jpg|thumb|225px|Eastern-pack shape salted butter]]
* West of the Rocky Mountains, butter printers standardized on a different shape that is now referred to as the Western-pack shape.  These butter sticks measure {{convert|3+1/4|x|1+1/2|x|1+1/2|in}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Butter Making and Packaging Machines|url=http://www.schiercompany.com/ButterEquipment.html|website=Schier Company, Inc.|access-date=19 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520054543/http://www.schiercompany.com/ButterEquipment.html#|archive-date=20 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are usually sold with four sticks packed side-by-side in a flat, rectangular box.&lt;ref name="cooksill"/&gt;

Most butter dishes are designed for Elgin-style butter sticks.&lt;ref name="cooksill"/&gt;

Butter stick wrappers are usually marked with divisions for {{convert|8|UStbsp}}, which is less than their actual volume: the Elgin-pack shape is {{cvt|7.42|cuin|UStbsp|disp=out}}&lt;!-- 7.42 cuin derived from above dimensions (4.75" x 1.25" x 1.25") --&gt;, while the Western-pack shape is {{cvt|7.31|cuin|UStbsp|disp=out}}&lt;!-- 7.31 cuin derived from above dimensions (3.25" x 1.5" x 1.5") --&gt;. The printing on unsalted ("sweet") butter wrappers is typically red, while that for salted butter is typically blue.

===Elsewhere===
Outside of the United States, the shape of butter packages is approximately the same, but the butter is measured for sale and cooking by mass (rather than by volume or unit/stick), and is sold in {{cvt|250|g}} and {{cvt|500|g}} packages. The wrapper is usually a foil and waxed-paper laminate. (The waxed paper is now a siliconised substitute, but is still referred to in some places as [[parchment]], from the wrapping used in past centuries; and the term 'parchment-wrapped' is still employed where the paper alone is used, without the foil laminate.)

Butter for commercial and industrial use is packaged in plastic buckets, tubs, or drums, in quantities and units suited to the local market.

Different varieties are found around the world. ''[[Smen]]'' is a spiced [[Morocco|Moroccan]] clarified butter, buried in the ground and aged for months or years.

==Storage and cooking==
[[File:Spargel sauce hollandaise.jpg|thumb|[[Hollandaise sauce]] served over white [[asparagus]] and [[potato]]es.]]
Normal butter softens to a spreadable consistency around 15&amp;nbsp;°C (60&amp;nbsp;°F), well above [[refrigerator]] temperatures. The "butter compartment" found in many refrigerators may be one of the warmer sections inside, but it still leaves butter quite hard. Until recently, many refrigerators sold in [[New Zealand]] featured a "butter conditioner", a compartment kept warmer than the rest of the refrigerator—but still cooler than room temperature—with a small heater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhitegoods.co.uk/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=668 Bring back butter conditioners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025358/http://www.ukwhitegoods.co.uk/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=668 |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 27 November 2005. The feature has been phased out for [[energy conservation]] reasons.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping butter tightly wrapped delays rancidity, which is hastened by exposure to light or air, and also helps prevent it from picking up other odors. Wrapped butter has a [[shelf life]] of several months at refrigerator temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatbydate.com/dairy/spreads/butter-shelf-life-expiration-date/ How Long Does Butter Last?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006073213/http://www.eatbydate.com/dairy/spreads/butter-shelf-life-expiration-date/# |date=6 October 2014 }}. Retrieved 03, October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Butter can also be frozen to further extend its storage life. 

"[[French butter dish]]es" or "[[Acadian]] butter dishes" have a lid with a long interior lip, which sits in a container holding a small amount of water. Usually the dish holds just enough water to submerge the interior lip when the dish is closed. Butter is packed into the lid. The water acts as a seal to keep the butter fresh, and also keeps the butter from overheating in hot temperatures. This method lets butter sit on a countertop for several days without spoiling.

Once butter is softened, [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s, or other flavoring agents can be mixed into it, producing what is called a ''compound butter'' or ''composite butter'' (sometimes also called ''composed butter''). Compound butters can be used as spreads, or cooled, sliced, and placed onto hot food to melt into a sauce. Sweetened compound butters can be served with [[dessert]]s; such [[hard sauce]]s are often flavored with [[distilled beverage|spirits]].

[[File:Butter melt with sugar.jpg|left|thumb|When heated, butter quickly melts into a thin liquid.]]
Melted butter plays an important role in the preparation of [[sauce]]s, most obviously in [[French cuisine]]. ''[[Beurre noisette]]'' (hazelnut butter) and ''[[Beurre noir]]'' (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of [[vinegar]] or [[lemon juice]].&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=36}} [[Hollandaise sauce|Hollandaise]] and [[bearnaise sauce|béarnaise]] sauces are [[emulsion]]s of [[egg (food)|egg yolk]] and melted butter; they are in essence [[mayonnaise]]s made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful [[emulsifiers]] in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own.&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=635–636}} ''[[Beurre blanc]]'' (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or [[wine]], forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. ''[[Beurre monté]]'' (prepared butter) is melted but still [[emulsion|emulsified]] butter; it lends its name to the practice of "mounting" a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=632}}

In Poland, the [[butter lamb]] (''Baranek wielkanocny'') is a traditional addition to the Easter Meal for many Polish Catholics. Butter is shaped into a lamb either by hand or in a lamb-shaped mould. Butter is also used to make edible decorations to garnish other dishes.
[[File:Preparation des brownies etape3.jpg|thumb|200px|Mixing melted butter with chocolate to make a [[Chocolate brownie|brownie]].]]
Butter is used for [[sautéing]] and [[frying]], although its milk solids brown and burn above 150&amp;nbsp;°C (250&amp;nbsp;°F)—a rather low temperature for most applications. The [[smoke point]] of butterfat is around 200&amp;nbsp;°C (400&amp;nbsp;°F), so clarified butter or ghee is better suited to frying.&lt;ref name="McGee"/&gt;{{rp|page=37}} Ghee has always been a common frying medium in India, where many avoid other animal fats for cultural or religious reasons.

Butter fills several roles in [[baking]], where it is used in a similar manner as other solid fats like [[lard]], [[suet]], or [[shortening]], but has a flavor that may better complement sweet baked goods. Many [[cookie]] [[dough]]s and some [[cake]] [[batter (cooking)|batters]] are [[leavening agent|leavened]], at least in part, by [[creaming (food)|creaming]] butter and [[sugar]] together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like [[shortbread]] may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. [[Pastry|Pastries]] like [[pie]] dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.

==Nutritional information==
As butter is essentially just the milk fat, it contains only traces of [[lactose]], so moderate consumption of butter is not a problem for [[lactose intolerant]] people.&lt;ref&gt;From data here [http://www.gastro.net.au/diets/lactose.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224060911/http://www.gastro.net.au/diets/lactose.html# |date=24 December 2005 }}, one [[teaspoon]] of butter contains 0.03&amp;nbsp;grams of lactose; a cup of milk contains 400 times that amount.&lt;/ref&gt; People with [[milk allergy|milk allergies]] may still need to avoid butter, which contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Allergy Society of South Africa.

The molecular composition of butter which contribute to butter's distinct flavor includes: fatty acids, lactones, methyl ketones, diacetyl and dimethyl sulfide. When foods containing butter are baked, the concentrations of methyl ketones and lactones increase to provide the flavor of butter.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

A '''charge controller''', '''charge regulator''' or '''battery regulator''' limits the rate at which [[electric current]] is added to or drawn from electric [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].&lt;ref name="eere"&gt;

It prevents overcharging and may protect against [[overvoltage]], which can reduce battery performance or lifespan, and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life.&lt;ref name="analogic"&gt;Webarchive backup: Brown, David.

== Stand-alone charge controllers ==

Charge controllers are sold to consumers as separate devices, often in conjunction with [[solar power|solar]] or [[wind power]] [[Electric generator|generators]], for uses such as [[RV]], [[boat]], and [[off-the-grid]] home battery storage systems.&lt;ref name="eere" /&gt;
In solar applications, charge&amp;nbsp;controllers may also be called solar&amp;nbsp;regulators. Some charge&amp;nbsp;controllers&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;solar&amp;nbsp;regulators have additional features, such as a [[low voltage disconnect]] (LVD), a separate circuit which powers down the load when the batteries become overly discharged (some battery chemistries are such that over-discharge can ruin the battery).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''series charge controller''' or '''series regulator''' disables further current flow into batteries when they are full. A '''shunt charge controller''' or '''shunt regulator''' diverts excess electricity to an auxiliary or "shunt" load, such as an electric water heater, when batteries are full.&lt;ref&gt;
Dunlop, James P. [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-CR-1292-01.pdf "Batteries and Charge Control in Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems: Fundamentals and Application"] Sandia National Laboratories, Photovoltaic Systems Applications Dept, 1997-01-15. Retrieved on 2007-08-21.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple charge controllers stop charging a battery when they exceed a set high voltage level, and re-enable charging when battery voltage drops back below that level. [[Pulse width modulation]] (PWM) and [[maximum power point tracker]] (MPPT) technologies are more electronically sophisticated, adjusting charging rates depending on the battery's level, to allow charging closer to its maximum capacity.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

A charge controller with MPPT capability frees the system designer from closely matching available PV voltage to battery voltage. Considerable efficiency gains can be achieved, particularly when the PV array is located at some distance from the battery. By way of example, a 150 volt PV array connected to an MPPT charge controller can be used to charge a 24 or 48 volt battery. Higher array voltage means lower array current, so the savings in wiring costs can more than pay for the controller.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Charge controllers may also monitor battery temperature to prevent overheating. Some charge controller systems also display data, transmit data to remote displays, and data logging to track electric flow over time.

== Integrated charge controller circuitry ==

Circuitry that functions as a charge regulator controller may consist of several electrical components, or may be encapsulated in a single microchip, an [[integrated circuit]] (IC) usually called a charge controller IC or charge control IC.&lt;ref name="analogic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1666 "MAX712, MAX713 NiCd/NiMH Battery Fast-Charge Controllers."] (Data sheet). Maxim Integrated Products. 2002-06-21. Retrieved on 2007-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charge controller circuits are used for rechargeable electronic devices such as cell phones, laptop computers, portable audio players, and uninterruptible power supplies, as well as for larger battery systems found in electric vehicles and orbiting space satellites&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Daniel R.

'''Chloryl fluoride''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F. It is commonly encountered as side-product in reactions of [[chlorine fluorides]] with oxygen sources.&lt;ref&gt;Chrisie, K. O.; Wilson, R. D.; Schack, C. J. "Chloryl fluoride" ''Inorganic Syntheses'', 1986, volume 24, pages 3–5. {{ISBN|0-471-83441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[acyl halide|acyl fluoride]] of [[chloric acid]].

==Preparation==
ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F was first reported by Schmitz and Schumacheb in 1942, who prepared it by the fluorination of [[chlorine dioxide|ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz, H.; Schumacheb, H. J. "Über eine neue Reaktion des Chlordioxyds. Die Bildung einer Verbindung der Formel ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F" ''Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie'' 1942, Volume 249, pp. 238–244. DOI 10.1002/zaac.19422490302&lt;/ref&gt; The compound is more conveniently prepared by treatment of sodium chlorate and chlorine trifluoride and purified by vacuum fractionation, i.e. selectively condensing this species separately from other products. This species is a gas boiling at −6&amp;nbsp;°C:
:6 NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 6 ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F + 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NaF

==Structure==
In contrast to [[Dioxygen difluoride|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F is a pyramidal molecule. This structure is predicted by [[VSEPR]]. The differing structures reflects the greater tendency of chlorine to exist in positive oxidation states with oxygen and fluorine ligands. The related Cl-O-F compound [[perchloryl fluoride]], ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F, is tetrahedral.
The related bromine compound ''bromyl fluoride'' (BrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F) adopts the same structure as ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F, whereas ''iodyl fluoride'' (IO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F) forms a polymeric substance under standard conditions.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lehrbuch der anorganischen Chemie|author1=Holleman, A.F.|author2=Wiberg, E.|author3=Wiberg, N.|date=1995|publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=9783110126419|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGkvSDAqY9gC|page=501|accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Climate Change and Global Energy Security: Technology and Policy Options''''' is a 2011 book by [[Marilyn A. Brown]] and [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. In this book, Brown and Sovacool offer detailed assessments of commercially available technologies for strengthening global [[energy security]] and [[climate change mitigation]]. They also evaluate the barriers to the deployment of these technologies and critically review [[public policy]] options for their commercialization. Arguing that society has all the technologies necessary for the task, the authors discuss an array of options available today, including high-efficiency transportation, [[renewable energy]], [[carbon sequestration]], and [[demand side management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hot-topic.co.nz/climate-change-and-global-energy-security/ |title=Climate Change and Global Energy Security |author=Bryan Walker |date=September 18, 2011 |work=Hot Topic }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136890/marilyn-a-brownbenjamin-k-sovacool/climate-change-and-global-energy-security-technology-and-policy |title=Climate Change and Global Energy Security |author=Richard N.

[[File:Cloud over A340 wing.JPG|thumb|right|Condensation forming in the low pressure zone above the wing of an aircraft due to [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] expansion]]

'''Condensation''' is the change of the physical [[state of matter]] from [[gas|gas phase]] into [[liquid|liquid phase]], and is the reverse of [[vapourisation]]. The word most often refers to the [[water cycle]].&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=condensation ''in atmospheric chemistry''|file=C01235}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as the change in the state of water vapour to liquid water when in contact with a liquid or solid surface or [[cloud condensation nuclei]] within the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. When the transition happens from the gaseous phase into the solid phase directly, the change is called [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposition]].

==Initiation==
Condensation is initiated by the formation of [[atomic clusters|atomic/molecular clusters]] of that species within its gaseous volume—like [[rain drop]] or [[snow flake]] formation within [[cloud]]s—or at the contact between such gaseous phase and a liquid or solid surface. In clouds, this can be catalyzed by [[Bacterial ice-nucleation proteins|water-nucleating proteins]], produced by atmospheric microbes, which are capable of binding gaseous or liquid water molecules.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schiermeier |first=Quirin |url=https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080228/full/news.2008.632.html |title='Rain-making' bacteria found around the world |work=Nature |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2018-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reversibility scenarios==
A few distinct reversibility scenarios emerge here with respect to the nature of the surface.
* absorption into the surface of a liquid (either of the same substance or one of its solvents)—is reversible as [[evaporation]].&lt;ref name="Gold"/&gt;
* [[adsorption]] (as dew droplets) onto solid surface at pressures and temperatures higher than the species' [[triple point]]—also reversible as evaporation.
* adsorption onto solid surface (as supplemental layers of solid) at pressures and temperatures lower than the species' [[triple point]]—is reversible as [[Sublimation (Physics)|sublimation]].

==Most common scenarios==
Condensation commonly occurs when a [[vapor]] is cooled and/or compressed to its [[dew point|saturation limit]] when the molecular density in the gas phase reaches its maximal threshold. Vapor cooling and compressing equipment that collects condensed liquids is called a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|"condenser"]].

== How condensation is measured ==
[[Psychrometry]] measures the rates of condensation through evaporation into the air moisture at various atmospheric pressures and temperatures. Water is the product of its vapor condensation—condensation is the process of such phase conversion.

== Applications of condensation ==
[[File:Effect similar to contrails created in a cloud chambers.jpg|thumb|In [[cloud chamber]]s a liquid (sometimes water, but usually [[isopropanol]]) condenses upon contact with a [[particle]] of [[radiation]] thus producing an effect similar to [[contrails]]]]
Condensation is a crucial component of [[distillation]], an important laboratory and industrial chemistry application.

Because condensation is a naturally occurring phenomenon, it can often be used to generate water in large quantities for human use. Many structures are made solely for the purpose of collecting water from condensation, such as [[Air well (condenser)|air wells]] and [[fog fence]]s. Such systems can often be used to retain soil moisture in areas where active [[desertification]] is occurring—so much so that some organizations educate people living in affected areas about water condensers to help them deal effectively with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fogquest.org/ FogQuest - Fog Collection / Water Harvesting Projects - Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223071843/http://www.fogquest.org/ |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a crucial process in forming particle tracks in a [[cloud chamber]].  In this case, ions produced by an incident particle act as nucleation centers for the condensation of the vapor producing the visible "cloud" trails.

Commercial applications of condensation, by consumers as well as industry, include power generation, water desalination,&lt;ref name=WarsingerEntropy&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Mistry|first2= Karan H.|last3=Nayar|first3=Kishor G.|last4=Chung|first4=Hyung Won|last5=Lienhard V|first5=John H.|title=Entropy Generation of Desalination Powered by Variable Temperature Waste Heat|journal=Entropy|volume=17|issue=11|pages=7530–7566|doi=10.3390/e17117530|date=2015|bibcode=2015Entrp..17.7530W}}&lt;/ref&gt; thermal management,&lt;ref&gt; White, F.M. ‘Heat and Mass Transfer’ © 1988 Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. pp. 602–604&lt;/ref&gt; refrigeration,&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A: Microchannel air-cooled condenser; Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration; April 2011; {{cite web |url=http://www.heatcraftrpd.com/landing/2011/air-cooled-condenser/res/pdfs/H-ACCMCX-QA.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417093034/http://www.heatcraftrpd.com/landing/2011/air-cooled-condenser/res/pdfs/H-ACCMCX-QA.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and air conditioning.&lt;ref name="Enright"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enright|first1=Ryan|title=Dropwise Condensation on Micro- and Nanostructured Surfaces|journal=Nanoscale and Microscale Thermophysical Engineering|date=23 Jul 2014|volume=18|issue=3|pages=223–250|doi=10.1080/15567265.2013.862889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological adaptation ==
Numerous living beings use water made accessible by condensation. A few examples of these are the [[Australia]]n [[thorny devil]], the [[darkling beetle]]s of the [[Namibia]]n coast, and the [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwoods]] of the [[West Coast of the United States]].

==Condensation in building construction==
[[Image:Window in Ireland.jpg|right|thumb|Condensation on a window during a rain shower.]]
Condensation in building [[construction]] is an unwanted [[phenomenon]] as it may cause [[Damp (structural)|dampness]], [[mold health issues]], [[wood]] [[Dry rot|rot]], [[corrosion]], weakening of mortar and masonry walls, and energy penalties due to increased [[heat transfer]]. To alleviate these issues, the indoor air humidity needs to be lowered, or air ventilation in the building needs to be improved. This can be done in a number of ways, for example opening windows, turning on extractor fans, using dehumidifiers, drying clothes outside and covering pots and pans whilst cooking. Air conditioning or ventilation systems can be installed that help remove moisture from the air, and move air throughout a building.&lt;ref name=PropertyHive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisepropertycare.com/condensation |title=Condensation |publisher=Property Hive |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213114908/http://propertyhive.org/condensation/ |archive-date=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of water vapour that can be stored in the air can be increased simply by increasing the temperature.&lt;ref name=PropertyHive /&gt; However, this can be a double edged sword as most condensation in the home occurs when warm, moisture heavy air comes into contact with a cool surface. As the air is cooled, it can no longer hold as much water vapour. This leads to deposition of water on the cool surface. This is very apparent when central heating is used in combination with single glazed windows in winter.

Interstructure condensation may be caused by [[thermal bridge]]s, insufficient or lacking insulation, [[damp proofing]] or [[insulated glazing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diydata.com/problem/condensation/condensation.php |title=Condensation around the house - what causes condensation |website=diydata.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113064649/http://www.diydata.com/problem/condensation/condensation.php |archivedate=2008-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''D1G reactor''' was a [[prototype]] [[United States Naval reactor|naval reactor]] designed for the [[United States Navy]] to provide [[electricity generation]] and [[Nuclear marine propulsion|propulsion]] on [[warships]].  The D1G designation stands for:

* D = [[Destroyer]] platform
* 1 = First generation [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] designed by the contractor
* G = [[General Electric]] was the contracted designer

This prototype [[nuclear reactor]] was constructed for the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s Office of Naval Reactors as part of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program.  The reactor was built by General Electric and operated by the [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]] at the Kesselring Site Operation in [[Milton (town), New York|West Milton, New York]].  It was used for testing components and as a training tool for the Nuclear Power Training Unit.  The reactor operated from 1962 to 1996, when it was shut down in March of that year.  It was later defuelled, with the [[pressure vessel]] eventually removed in 2002.

The containment structure — which housed both the primary (nuclear reactor) and secondary (steam plant) systems — is referred to as the "DIG-ball" due to its unique shape: a [[Horton Sphere]]. The [[sphere]] was originally constructed by Chicago Bridge and Iron Works to house the [[liquid metal cooled reactor]] of the [[USS Seawolf (SSN-575)|USS ''Seawolf'' (SSN-575)]], with the [[dome]] designed to contain a liquid sodium explosion.

[[File:Dust devil krakow.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A dust devil in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]].]]
A '''dust devil''' is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived [[whirlwind]], ranging from small (half a metre wide and a few metres tall) to large (more than 10&amp;nbsp;metres wide and more than 1000&amp;nbsp;metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;{{cite book |title= Glossary of Meteorology |publisher= [[American Meteorological Society]] |year= 2000 |url= http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dust-devil1 |isbn= 978-1-878220-34-9 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090130003357/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dust-devil1 |archivedate= 2009-01-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are comparable to [[tornado]]es in that both are a weather phenomenon involving a vertically oriented rotating column of wind. Most tornadoes are associated with a larger parent circulation, the [[mesocyclone]] on the back of a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]]. Dust devils form as a swirling updraft under sunny conditions during fair weather, rarely coming close to the intensity of a tornado.

== Formation ==
[[File:Iraqi Dust Devil.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A dust devil in [[Ramadi]], [[Iraq]].]]
Dust devils form when a pocket of hot air near the surface rises quickly through  cooler air above it, forming an updraft. If conditions are just right, the updraft may begin to rotate. As the air rapidly rises, the column of hot air is stretched vertically, thereby moving mass closer to the axis of rotation, which causes intensification of the spinning effect by [[conservation of angular momentum]]. The [[Secondary flow#Tornadoes and dust devils|secondary flow]] in the dust devil causes other hot air to speed horizontally inward to the bottom of the newly forming vortex. As more hot air rushes in toward the developing vortex to replace the air that is rising, the spinning effect becomes further intensified and self-sustaining. A dust devil, fully formed, is a funnel-like chimney through which hot air moves, both upwards and in a circle. As the hot air rises, it cools, loses its buoyancy and eventually ceases to rise.  As it rises, it displaces air which descends outside the core of the vortex. This cool air returning acts as a balance against the spinning hot-air outer wall and keeps the system stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Ludlum, David M. |year = 1997 |title = National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Weather |publisher = Knopf |isbn = 978-0-679-40851-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spinning effect, along with surface [[friction]], usually will produce a forward momentum. The dust devil is able to sustain itself longer by moving over nearby sources of hot surface air.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

As available hot air near the surface is channeled up the dust devil, eventually surrounding cooler air will be sucked in. Once this occurs, the effect is dramatic, and the dust devil dissipates in seconds. Usually this occurs when the dust devil is not moving fast enough (depletion) or begins to enter a terrain where the surface temperatures are cooler.&lt;ref name=death-valley&gt;[http://www.death-valley.us/article559.html http://www.death-valley.us/article559.html] {{dead link|date=September 2010|url=http://www.death-valley.us/article559.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain conditions increase the likelihood of dust devil formation.
* '''Flat barren terrain, desert or tarmac:''' Flat conditions increase the likelihood of the hot-air "fuel" being a near constant. Dusty or sandy conditions will cause particles to become caught up in the vortex, making the dust devil easily visible, but are not necessary for the formation of the vortex.
* '''Clear skies or lightly cloudy conditions:''' The surface needs to absorb significant amounts of solar energy to heat the air near the surface and create ideal dust devil conditions.
* '''Light or no wind and cool atmospheric temperature:''' The underlying factor for sustainability of a dust devil is the extreme difference in temperature between the near-surface air and the atmosphere. Windy conditions will destabilize the spinning effect of a dust devil.

== Intensity and duration ==
[[File:Remolino (tourbillon de sable).ogg|right]]
On Earth, most dust devils are very small and weak, often less than 3&amp;nbsp;feet (0.9&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter with maximum winds averaging about 45&amp;nbsp;miles per hour (70&amp;nbsp;km/h), and they often dissipate less than a minute after forming. On rare occasions, a dust devil can grow very large and intense, sometimes reaching a diameter of up to 300&amp;nbsp;feet (90&amp;nbsp;m) with winds in excess of 60&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h+) and can last for upwards of 20&amp;nbsp;minutes before dissipating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Arizona Vacation Planner | title=Dust Devils: Ephemeral Whirlwinds Can Stir Up Trouble | url=http://www.arizona-vacation-planner.com/dust-devils.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718220124/http://www.arizona-vacation-planner.com/dust-devils.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-18 | accessdate=2007-10-05}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Dust devils typically do not cause injuries, but rare, severe dust devils have caused damage and even deaths in the past. One such dust devil struck the [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] Fairgrounds in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], on September 14, 2000, causing extensive damage to several temporary tents, stands and booths, as well as some permanent fairgrounds structures. Several injuries were reported, but there were no fatalities. Based on the degree of damage left behind, it is estimated that the dust devil produced winds as high as 75&amp;nbsp;mph (120&amp;nbsp;km/h), which is equivalent to an [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF-0]] tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=National Weather Service-Flagstaff, AZ | title=Damage From a Dust Devil at the Coconino County Fairgrounds - September 14, 2000 | url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/fgz/past/cocodust/coco_fair.php?wfo=fgz | accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2003, a dust devil lifted the roof off a two-story building in [[Lebanon, Maine]], causing it to collapse and kill a man inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~499035 NCDC: Event Details] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129192229/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~499035 |date=2009-01-29 }} ''[[National Climatic Data Center]]'.'

No one was injured in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=Damon |title=Colorado Dust Devil Tosses Porta-Potties |url=http://texasstormwatch.com/2018/06/colorado-dust-devil-tosses-porta-potties.html |website=Texas Storm Watch |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
Dust devils have been implicated in around 100 aircraft accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Ralph|title=Dust Devil Hazard to Aviation: A Review of US Air Accident Reports,|journal=Journal of Meteorology|year=2005|volume=28|issue=298|pages=178–184|url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/dustdevilaviation.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While many incidents have been simple taxiing problems, a few have had fatal consequences. Dust devils are also considered major hazards among [[Skydiving|skydivers]] and [[Paragliding|paragliding pilots]] as they can cause a [[parachute]] or a glider to collapse with little to no warning, at altitudes considered too low to [[Cut-away|cut away]], and contribute to the serious injury or death of parachutists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=United States Parachute Association | title=Dust Devils - July 9, 2012 | url=http://parachutistonline.com/safety_training/safety_check/dust-devils}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skydiving instructor Tony Rokov killed in accident at Goulburn airport|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/skydiving-instructor-tony-rokov-killed-in-accident-at-goulburn-airport-20151121-gl4raf.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 November 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
There is an endemic health issue in some arid areas, such as the [[southwestern United States]], [[California]], northwestern Mexico, [[Central America]], and [[South America]], called [[Coccidioidomycosis|Valley fever]]. “Cocci” fungus grows naturally in alkaline soil and the fungus spores, that lie dormant and can be picked up by dust devils, are blown around. When a person breathes these spores in, they cause [[fungal pneumonia]]. While usually not a serious threat, the disease is still dangerous to some people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arizonaedventures.com/arizona/blog/articles/arizona/whirling-winds-dust-storms-dust-devils/ Whirling Winds: Dust Storms &amp; Dust Devils]: ''Arizona Edventures''- Retrieved 2016-11-19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electrical activities ==
Dust devils, even small ones (on Earth), can produce radio noise and electrical fields greater than 10,000 volts per meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=University of California, Berkeley | date=29 May 2002 | title= Stalking Arizona dust devils helps scientists understand electrical, atmospheric effects of dust storms on Mars | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2002/05/29_dust.html | accessdate=2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dust devil picks up small dirt and dust particles. As the particles whirl around, they bump and scrape into each other and become electrically charged. The whirling charged particles also create a magnetic field that fluctuates between 3 and 30 times each second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Koch, J. |author2=N.O. Renno | title=Convective-radiative feedback mechanisms by dusty convective plumes and vortices | booktitle=Fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union | date=Dec 5–9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These electrical fields assist the vortices in lifting materials off the ground and into the atmosphere. Field experiments indicate that a dust devil can lift 1&amp;nbsp;gram of dust per second from each square metre (10&amp;nbsp;lb/s from each acre) of ground over which it passes. A large dust devil measuring about 100&amp;nbsp;metres (330&amp;nbsp;ft) across at its base can lift about 15 metric tonnes (17 short tons) of dust into the air in 30&amp;nbsp;minutes. Giant dust storms that sweep across the world's deserts contribute 8% of the mineral dust in the atmosphere each year during the handful of storms that occur. In comparison, the significantly smaller dust devils that twist across the deserts during the summer lift about three times as much dust, thus having a greater combined impact on the dust content of the atmosphere. When this occurs, they are often called '''sand pillars'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kok|first=J.F.|author2=Renno, N.O.|year=2006|title=Enhancement of the emission of mineral dust aerosols by electric forces|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=33|issue=Aug. 28|pages=L19S10|bibcode=2006GeoRL..3319S10K|doi=10.1029/2006GL026284|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/95661/1/grl21575.pdf}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2006-12-01 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Martian dust devils ==
Dust devils also occur on [[Mars]] (see [[dust devil tracks]]) and were first photographed by the [[Viking program|Viking]] orbiters in the 1970s. In 1997, the [[Mars Pathfinder]] lander detected a dust devil passing over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Metzger | first = S.

The dust devil itself (the black spot) is climbing the crater wall. The streaks on the right are sand dunes on the crater floor.

A [[fire whirl]] or swirl, sometimes called fire devils or fire tornadoes, can be seen during intense fires in combustible building structures or, more commonly, in forest or bush fires. A fire whirl is a vortex-shaped formation of burning gases being released from the combustible material. The genesis of the vortex is probably similar to that of a dust devil. As distinct from the dust devil, it is improbable that the height reached by the fire gas vortex is greater than the visible height of the vertical flames because of turbulence in the surrounding gases that inhibit creation of a stable boundary layer between the rotating/rising gases relative to the surrounding gases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfsp.nifc.gov/conferenceproc/GISRS-12-AORadkeetal.pdf WILDFIRE MODELING, IR OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327183634/http://jfsp.nifc.gov/conferenceproc/GISRS-12-AORadkeetal.pdf |date=2007-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot cinders underneath freshly deposited ash in recently burned areas may sometimes generate numerous dust devils. The lighter weight and the darker color of the ash may create dust devils that are visible hundreds of feet into the air.

Ash devils form similar to dust devils and are often seen on unstable days in burn scar areas of recent fires.

[[Steam devil]]s are phenomena often observed in the steam rising from [[power plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyons |first=Walter A. |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |location=Detroit, MI |publisher=Visible Ink Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-7876-1034-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same conditions can produce a snow whirlwind, although differential heating is more difficult in snow-covered areas.

Coal devils are common at the coal town of Tsagaan Khad in [[Ömnögovi Province|South Gobi Province]], [[Mongolia]]. They occur when dust devils pick up large amounts of stockpiled coal. Their dark color makes them resemble some tornados.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2429">In [[combustion]], '''flame stretch''' (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) is a quantity which measures the amount of stretch of the flame surface due to curvature and due to the outer velocity field strain. The concept of flame stretch was introduced by Karlovitz in 1953&lt;ref&gt;Karlovitz, B., Denniston Jr, D. W., Knapschaefer, D. H., &amp; Wells, F. E. (1953, January). Studies on Turbulent flames: A. Flame Propagation Across velocity gradients B. turbulence Measurement in flames. In Symposium (international) on combustion (Vol. 4, No. 1, pp. 613-620). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matalon, M. (1983). On flame stretch. Combustion Science and Technology, 31(3-4), 169-181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matalon, M., &amp; Matkowsky, B. J. (1982). Flames as gasdynamic discontinuities. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 124, 239-259.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George H. Markstein]] studied the flame stretch by treating the flame surface as a hydrodynamic discontinuity (known as [[flame front]])&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, G. H. Non-steady flame Propagation,(1964). P22, Pergarmon, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and also discussed by [[Bernard Lewis (scientist)|Bernard Lewis]] and Guenther von Albe in their book.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, B., &amp; Von Elbe, G. (2012). Combustion, flames and explosions of gases. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; All these discussions were treated flame stretch as an effect of flow velocity gradients. But the stretch can be found even if there is no velocity gradient, but due to the flame curvature. So, the definition required a more general formulation and its precise definition was first introduced by [[Forman A. Williams]] in 1975&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (1975). " A Review of Some Theoretical Considerations of Turbulent Flame Structure." in analytical Numerical Methods for Investigation of Flow Fields with Chemical Reactions, Especially Related Fields to Combustion. In AGARD Conference Proceedings, 1975 (Vol. 164).&lt;/ref&gt; as the ratio of rate of change of flame surface area to the area itself

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{A}\frac{dA}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the flame is stretched, otherwise compressed. Sometimes the flame stretch is defined as non-dimensional quantity

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde K = \frac{\delta_L}{S_L} \frac{1}{A}\frac{dA}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_L&lt;/math&gt; is the laminar flame thickness and &lt;math&gt;S_L&lt;/math&gt; is the laminar propagation speed of unstretched [[premixed flame]].

The '''Foucault pendulum''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|f|uː|ˈ|k|oʊ}} {{respell|foo|KOH|'}}; {{IPA-fr|fuˈko}}) or '''Foucault's pendulum''' is a simple device named after French physicist [[Léon Foucault]] and conceived as an experiment to demonstrate the [[Earth's rotation]]. The [[pendulum]] was introduced in 1851 and was the first experiment to give simple, direct evidence of the earth's rotation. Today, Foucault pendulums are popular displays in [[science museum]]s and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oprea, John|title=Geometry and the Foucault Pendulum|journal=Amer. Math.

[[File:Foucault Pendulum.jpg|thumb|A Print of the Foucault Pendulum, 1895]]
The first public exhibition of a Foucault pendulum took place in February 1851 in the Meridian of the [[Paris Observatory]]. A few weeks later, Foucault made his most famous pendulum when he suspended a 28-kg brass-coated lead [[bob (physics)|bob]] with a 67-m-long wire from the dome of the [[Panthéon, Paris]]. The plane of the pendulum's swing rotated clockwise approximately 11.3° per hour, making a full circle in approximately 31.8 hours. The original bob used in 1851 at the Panthéon was moved in 1855 to the [[Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris. A second temporary installation was made for the 50th anniversary in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parisenimages.fr/fr/galerie-collections/9232-13-pendule-foucault-du-pantheon-ceremonie-dinauguration-m-chaumie-ministre-linstruction-publique-brulant-fil-retenue-mettre-marche-pendule-1902 |title=The Pendulum of Foucault of the Panthéon.

During museum reconstruction in the 1990s, the original pendulum was temporarily displayed at the Panthéon (1995), but was later returned to the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] before it reopened in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kissell|first=Joe|title=Foucault's Pendulum: Low-tech proof of Earth's rotation|url=http://itotd.com/articles/362/foucaults-pendulum/|publisher=Interesting thing of the day|accessdate=March 21, 2012|date=November 8, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312175754/http://itotd.com/articles/362/foucaults-pendulum/|archivedate=March 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2010, the cable suspending the bob in the Musée des Arts et Métiers snapped, causing irreparable damage to the pendulum and to the marble flooring of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/le-pendule-de-foucault-perd-la-boule_888228.html |title=Le pendule de Foucault perd la boule |first=Boris |last=Thiolay |publisher=L'Express |date=April 28, 2010 |language=fr |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710123539/http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/le-pendule-de-foucault-perd-la-boule_888228.html |archivedate=July 10, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foucault's pendulum is sent crashing to Earth|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411529|accessdate=March 21, 2012|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=13 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320084119/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411529|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation of mechanics==
[[File:Foucault-rotz.gif|250px|thumb|right|Animation of a Foucault pendulum at the Pantheon in Paris (48° 52' north), with the Earth's rotation rate greatly exaggerated. The green trace shows the path of the pendulum bob over the ground (a rotating reference frame), while in any vertical plane. The actual plane of swing appears to rotate relative to the Earth. The wire should be as long as possible—lengths of {{convert|12|–|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} are common.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Foucault Pendulum|publisher=Smithsonian Encyclopedia|url=http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmah/pendulum.htm|access-date=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At either the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]], the plane of oscillation of a pendulum remains fixed relative to the [[Mach's principle|distant masses of the universe]] while Earth rotates underneath it, taking one [[sidereal day]] to complete a rotation. So, relative to Earth, the plane of oscillation of a pendulum at the North Pole – viewed from above – undergoes a full clockwise rotation during one day; a pendulum at the South Pole rotates counterclockwise.

When a Foucault pendulum is suspended at the [[equator]], the plane of oscillation remains fixed relative to Earth. At other latitudes, the plane of oscillation [[Precession|precesses]] relative to Earth, but more slowly than at the pole; the angular speed, ''ω'' (measured in clockwise [[degree (angle)|degrees]] per sidereal day), is proportional to the [[sine]] of the [[latitude]], &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\omega=360^\circ\sin\varphi\ /\mathrm{day}&lt;/math&gt;,}}

where latitudes north and south of the equator are defined as positive and negative, respectively. For example, a Foucault pendulum at 30° south latitude, viewed from above by an earthbound observer, rotates counterclockwise 360° in two days.

[[File:Foucault pendulum at north pole accurate.PNG|thumb|left|130px|A Foucault pendulum at the North Pole: The pendulum swings in the same plane as the Earth rotates beneath it.]]

To demonstrate rotation directly rather than indirectly via the swinging pendulum, Foucault used a [[gyroscope]] in an 1852 experiment. The inner gimbal of the Foucault gyroscope was balanced on knife edge bearings on the outer gimbal and the outer gimbal was suspended by a fine, torsion-free thread in such a manner that the lower pivot point carried almost no weight. The gyro was spun to 9000–12000 revolutions per minute with an arrangement of gears before being placed into position, which was sufficient time to balance the gyroscope and carry out 10 minutes of experimentation. The instrument could be observed either with a microscope viewing a tenth of a degree scale or by a long pointer. At least three more copies of a Foucault gyro were made in convenient travelling and demonstration boxes and copies survive in the UK, France, and the US.

A Foucault pendulum requires care to set up because imprecise construction can cause additional veering which masks the terrestrial effect. The initial launch of the pendulum is critical; the traditional way to do this is to use a flame to burn through a thread which temporarily holds the bob in its starting position, thus avoiding unwanted sideways motion (see a [[:File:Le petit Parisien illustre 2nov1902.jpg|detail of the launch at the 50th anniversary in 1902]]).

[[File:Le petit Parisien illustre 2nov1902.jpg|thumb|An excerpt from the illustrated supplement of the magazine ''Le Petit Parisien'' dated November 2, 1902, on the 50th anniversary of the experiment of Léon Foucault demonstrating the rotation of the earth.]]
[[Air resistance]] damps the oscillation, so some Foucault pendulums in museums incorporate an electromagnetic or other drive to keep the bob swinging; others are restarted regularly, sometimes with a launching ceremony as an added attraction.

[[File:Foucault pendulum plane of swing semi3D.gif|frame|The animation describes the motion of a Foucault pendulum at a latitude of 30°N. The plane of oscillation rotates by an angle of −180° during one day, so after two days, the plane returns to its original orientation.]]
A 'pendulum day' is the time needed for the plane of a freely suspended Foucault pendulum to complete an apparent rotation about the local vertical. This is one sidereal day divided by the sine of the latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=pendulum-day1 |title=Pendulum day |website=Glossary of Meteorology |publisher=American Meteorological Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817221735/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=pendulum-day1 |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Foucault's Pendulum.

==Precession as a form of parallel transport==
[[File:Parallel Transport.svg|210px|thumb|right|Parallel transport of a vector around a closed loop on the sphere: The angle by which it twists, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is proportional to the area inside the loop.]]
[[File:Foucault_pendulum_precession_vs_latitude.svg|thumb|300px|Graphs of precession period and precession per sidereal day vs latitude. The sign changes as a Foucault pendulum rotates anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The example shows that one in Paris precesses 271&amp;#176; each sidereal day, taking 31.8 hours per rotation.]]

In a near-inertial frame moving in tandem with Earth, but not sharing the rotation of the earth about its own axis, the suspension point of the pendulum traces out a circular path during one sidereal day.

At the latitude of Paris, 48 degrees 51 minutes north, a full precession cycle takes just under 32 hours, so after one sidereal day, when the Earth is back in the same orientation as one sidereal day before, the oscillation plane has turned by just over 270 degrees. If the plane of swing was north-south at the outset, it is east-west one sidereal day later.

This also implies that there has been exchange of [[momentum]]; the Earth and the pendulum bob have exchanged momentum. The Earth is so much more massive than the pendulum bob that the Earth's change of momentum is unnoticeable. Nonetheless, since the pendulum bob's plane of swing has shifted, the conservation laws imply that an exchange must have occurred.

Rather than tracking the change of momentum, the precession of the oscillation plane can efficiently be described as a case of [[parallel transport]]. For that, it can be demonstrated, by composing the infinitesimal rotations, that the precession rate is proportional to the [[Orthogonal projection|projection]] of the [[angular velocity]] of Earth onto the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] direction to Earth, which implies that the trace of the plane of oscillation will undergo parallel transport. After 24 hours, the difference between initial and final orientations of the trace in the Earth frame is {{nowrap|''α'' {{=}} −2πsin(''φ'')}}, which corresponds to the value given by the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. ''α'' is also called the [[holonomy]] or [[geometric phase]] of the pendulum. When analyzing earthbound motions, the Earth frame is not an [[inertial frame]], but rotates about the local vertical at an effective rate of {{nowrap|2π sin(''φ'')}} radians per day. A simple method employing parallel transport within cones tangent to the Earth's surface can be used to describe the rotation angle of the swing plane of Foucault's pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1972QJRAS..13...40S|title=The Description of Foucault's Pendulum|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=13|pages=40|last1=Somerville|first1=W. B.|year=1972}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1119/1.14972|title=A simple geometric model for visualizing the motion of a Foucault pendulum|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=55|pages=67–70|year=1987|last1=Hart|first1=John B.|last2=Miller|first2=Raymond E.|last3=Mills|first3=Robert L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of an Earth-bound coordinate system with its ''x''-axis pointing east and its ''y''-axis pointing north, the precession of the pendulum is described by the [[Coriolis force]]. Consider a planar pendulum with natural frequency ''ω'' in the [[small angle approximation]]. There are two forces acting on the pendulum bob: the restoring force provided by gravity and the wire, and the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force at latitude ''φ'' is horizontal in the small angle approximation and is given by
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F_{c,x} &amp;=2 m \Omega \dfrac{dy}{dt} \sin(\varphi)\\
F_{c,y} &amp;=- 2 m \Omega \dfrac{dx}{dt} \sin(\varphi)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;}}
where Ω is the rotational frequency of Earth, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of the Coriolis force in the ''x''-direction and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of the Coriolis force in the ''y''-direction.

The restoring force, in the [[small-angle approximation]], is given by
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F_{g,x} &amp;=- m \omega^2 x \\
F_{g,y} &amp;=- m \omega^2 y.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

Using [[Newton's laws of motion]] this leads to the system of equations
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} &amp;=-\omega^2 x + 2 \Omega \dfrac{dy}{dt} \sin(\varphi)\\
\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2} &amp;=-\omega^2 y - 2 \Omega \dfrac{dx}{dt} \sin(\varphi) \,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

Switching to complex coordinates {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''x'' + ''iy''}}, the equations read
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + 2i\Omega \frac{dz}{dt} \sin(\varphi)+\omega^2 z=0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;}}

To first order in Ω/''ω'' this equation has the solution
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;z=e^{-i\Omega \sin(\varphi) t}\left(c_1 e^{i\omega t}+c_2 e^{-i\omega t}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;}}

If time is measured in days, then {{nowrap|Ωt {{=}} 2π}} and the pendulum rotates by an angle of −2π sin(''φ'') during one day.
&lt;!--Foucault's original paper (Comptes Rendus Vol.32, 1851, p.135) is wholly descriptive. He remarks in effect that the rate of precession of the plane of rotation can be obtained analytically or geometrically. From a geometric perspective much of the explanation given above comes down to the statement that the rate of change of azimuth of a star on the horizon depends only on the observer's latitude and is the same as the rate of precession of the pendulum (Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Vol.63,1970, pp. 227–228). Binet (Comptes Rendus Vol.32, 1851, p.197) gives a simple analytical derivation of the rate. [[Arthur Cayley]] (Collected Works Vol.4,1891, pp. 534–537) says that[[Poisson]] examined the problem in 1838 and concluded that there would be no effect due to the rotation of the Earth. [[Kamerlingh Onnes]] based his doctoral dissertation on the accurate determination of the Earth's rotation by means of the pendulum (Schulz-DuBois, American Journal of Physics, Vo.28, 1970, p.173). --&gt;[[File:Foucault Pendulum - Ranchi Science Centre - Jharkhand 2010-11-29 8871.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Foucault's Pendulum at the [[Ranchi Science Centre]]]]

Many physical systems precess in a similar manner to a Foucault pendulum. As early as 1836, the Scottish mathematician [[Edward Sang]] contrived and explained the precession of a spinning [https://books.google.com/books?id=rtpQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA105 top]. In 1851, [[Charles Wheatstone]]
&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Wheatstone]] Wikisource: "[[s:Note relating to M. Foucault's new mechanical proof of the Rotation of the Earth|Note relating to M. Foucault's new mechanical proof of the Rotation of the Earth]]", pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt; described an apparatus that consists of a vibrating spring that is mounted on top of a disk so that it makes a fixed angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with the disk. The spring is struck so that it oscillates in a plane. When the disk is turned, the plane of oscillation changes just like the one of a Foucault pendulum at latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, consider a nonspinning, perfectly balanced bicycle wheel mounted on a disk so that its axis of rotation makes an angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with the disk. When the disk undergoes a full clockwise revolution, the bicycle wheel will not return to its original position, but will have undergone a net rotation of &lt;math&gt;2\pi\, \sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.

Foucault-like precession is observed in a virtual system wherein a massless particle is constrained to remain on a rotating plane that is inclined with respect to the axis of rotation.&lt;ref name="psb1"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Bharadhwaj |first=Praveen |eprint=1408.3047 |class=physics.pop-ph |title=Foucault precession manifested in a simple system |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin of a relativistic particle moving in a circular orbit precesses similar to the swing plane of Foucault pendulum. The relativistic velocity space in [[Minkowski spacetime]] can be treated as a sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 4-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] with imaginary radius and imaginary timelike coordinate. Parallel transport of polarization vectors along such sphere gives rise to [[Thomas precession]], which is analogous to the rotation of the swing plane of Foucault pendulum due to parallel transport along a sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Krivoruchenko | first1=M.

In physics, the evolution of such systems is determined by [[geometric phase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Geometric Phases in Physics", eds. [[Frank Wilczek]] and Alfred Shapere (World Scientific, Singapore, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Mangiarotti, G.

It is an [[evergreen]] [[tropical shrub]] that grows to 4 m tall and has glossy dark green leaves (5–16&amp;nbsp;cm long) that are oppositely arranged along the stem. The flower is creamy white and pinwheel-shaped with 5–9 lobes (each lobe 2–4&amp;nbsp;cm long) and fragrant. Native to the highland shores of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], it has the distinction of being one of the few cultivated plants native to [[Polynesia]]. It is the [[Floral emblem|national flower]] of [[French Polynesia]] and the [[Cook Islands]].

The name Tahitian gardenia is somewhat a misnomer because it is neither native nor naturalised in [[Tahiti]]. The first acceptable scientific name for the plant was based on Tahitian specimens collected by [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] in 1824. Hence the scientific name of ''Gardenia taitensis'', and the English name of Tahitian gardenia or Tiaré flower. It was first collected in Tahiti, by the [[Johann Reinhold Forster|Forsters]] on [[James Cook|Captain Cook's]] first Pacific voyage (1768–1771), although it was misidentified as ''Gardenia florida''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cookislands.bishopmuseum.org/species.asp?id=6173 Cook Islands Biodiversity &amp; Natural Heritage Database : Gardenia taitensis - Tahitian Gardenia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant originates from [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia|Western Polynesia]]. It is an [[indigenous people|aboriginal]] introduction to the [[Cook Islands]] and [[French Polynesia]] and possibly [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntbg.org/plants/plant_details.php?plantid=5454&amp;rid=939 Gardenia taitensis - National Tropical Garden Plant Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hartree–Fock approximation the total [[wavefunction|wave-function]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; of the system of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; bosons is taken as a product of single-particle functions &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\dots,\mathbf{r}_N)=\psi(\mathbf{r}_1)\psi(\mathbf{r}_2)\dots\psi(\mathbf{r}_N)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th boson.

The pseudopotential model Hamiltonian of the system is given as
:&lt;math&gt;
H=\sum_{i=1}^N \left(-{\hbar^2\over 2m}{\partial^2\over\partial\mathbf{r}_i^2}+V(\mathbf{r}_i)\right)
+\sum_{i&lt;j}{4\pi\hbar^2a_s\over m}\delta(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the boson, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the external potential, &lt;math&gt;a_s&lt;/math&gt; is the boson-boson scattering length, and &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is the Dirac delta-function.

If the single-particle wave-function satisfies the Gross–Pitaevski equation,
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}{\partial^2\over\partial\mathbf{r}^2} + V(\mathbf{r})  + {4\pi\hbar^2a_s\over m}\vert\psi(\mathbf{r})\vert^2\right)\psi(\mathbf{r})=\mu\psi(\mathbf{r}),
&lt;/math&gt;
the total wave-function minimizes the expectation value of the model Hamiltonian under normalization condition &lt;math&gt;\int dV |\Psi|^2=N.&lt;/math&gt;

It is a model equation for the single-particle [[wavefunction]] in a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. It is similar in form to the [[Ginzburg–Landau equation]] and is sometimes referred to as a [[nonlinear]] [[Schrödinger equation]].

A [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (BEC) is a gas of [[bosons]] that are in the same [[quantum state]], and thus can be described by the same [[wavefunction]]. A free quantum particle is described by a single-particle [[Schrödinger equation]]. Interaction between particles in a real gas is taken into account by a pertinent many-body Schrödinger equation. If the average spacing between the particles in a gas is greater than the [[scattering length]] (that is, in the so-called dilute limit), then one can approximate the true interaction potential that features in this equation by a [[pseudopotential]].  The non-linearity of the Gross–Pitaevskii equation has its origin in the interaction between the particles. This is made evident by setting the coupling constant of interaction in the Gross–Pitaevskii equation to zero (see the following section): thereby, the single-particle Schrödinger equation describing a  particle inside a trapping potential is recovered.

==Form of equation==

The equation has the form of the [[Schrödinger equation]] with the addition of an interaction term.  The coupling constant, g, is proportional to the scattering length &lt;math&gt;a_s&lt;/math&gt; of two interacting bosons:

:&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{4\pi\hbar^2 a_s}{m}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck's constant]] and m is the mass of the boson.
The [[energy density]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\vert\nabla\Psi(\mathbf{r})\vert^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\vert\Psi(\mathbf{r})\vert^2 + \frac{1}{2}g\vert\Psi(\mathbf{r})\vert^4, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;/math&gt; is the wavefunction, or order parameter, and V is an external potential.
The time-independent Gross–Pitaevskii equation, for a conserved number of particles, is

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})  + g\vert\Psi(\mathbf{r})\vert^2\right)\Psi(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]].  The [[chemical potential]] is found from the condition that the number of particles is related to the [[wavefunction]] by

:&lt;math&gt;N = \int\vert\Psi(\mathbf{r})\vert^2 \, d^3r. &lt;/math&gt;

From the time-independent Gross–Pitaevskii equation, we can find the structure of a Bose–Einstein condensate in various external potentials (e.g. a harmonic trap).

The time-dependent Gross–Pitaevskii equation is

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) + g\vert\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\vert^2\right)\Psi(\mathbf{r},t). &lt;/math&gt;

From the time-dependent Gross–Pitaevskii equation we can look at the dynamics of the Bose–Einstein condensate.  It is used to find the collective modes of a trapped gas.

==Solutions==

Since the Gross–Pitaevskii equation is a [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equation]], exact solutions are hard to come by.  As a result, solutions have to be approximated via myriad techniques.

===Exact solutions===

====Free particle====
The simplest exact solution is the free particle solution, with &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r}) =0&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = \sqrt{\frac{N}{V}} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This solution is often called the Hartree solution.  Although it does satisfy the Gross–Pitaevskii equation, it leaves a gap in the energy spectrum due to the interaction:

: &lt;math&gt;E(\mathbf{k}) = N \left[ \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}+ g \frac{N}{2 V}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[Hugenholtz–Pines theorem]],
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=N. M. Hugenholtz
 |author2=D. Pines
 |year=1959
 |title=Ground-state energy and excitation spectrum of a system of interacting bosons
 |journal=Physical Review
 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=489–506
 |bibcode=1959PhRv..116..489H
 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.116.489}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interacting bose gas does not exhibit an energy gap (in the case of repulsive interactions).

====Soliton====
A one-dimensional [[soliton]] can form in a Bose–Einstein condensate, and depending upon whether the interaction is attractive or repulsive, there is either a bright or dark soliton.  Both solitons are local disturbances in a condensate with a uniform background density.

If the BEC is repulsive, so that &lt;math&gt;g&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then a possible solution of the Gross–Pitaevskii equation is,

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \psi_0\tanh\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}\xi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the condensate wavefunction at &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\xi = \hbar/\sqrt{2mn_0g}&lt;/math&gt;, is the coherence length.  This solution represents the dark soliton, since there is a deficit of condensate in a space of nonzero density.  The dark soliton is also a type of [[topological defect]], since &lt;math&gt;\psi &lt;/math&gt; flips between positive and negative values across the origin, corresponding to a &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; phase shift.

For &lt;math&gt;g&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t) = \psi(0)e^{-i\mu t/\hbar}\frac{1}{\cosh\left[\sqrt{2m\vert\mu\vert/\hbar^2}x\right]},&lt;/math&gt;

where the chemical potential is &lt;math&gt;\mu = g\vert\psi(0)\vert^2/2&lt;/math&gt;.  This solution represents the bright soliton, since there is a concentration of condensate in a space of zero density.

====1-D square well potential====

===Variational solutions===
In systems where an exact analytical solution may not be feasible, one can make a variational approximation.  The basic idea is to make a variational [[ansatz]] for the wavefunction with free parameters, plug it into the free energy, and minimize the energy with respect to the free parameters.

===Numerical solutions===

The Gross-Pitaevskii  equation is a partial differential equation in space and time variables. Usually it  does not have analytic solution and numerical methods, such as the split-step [[Crank–Nicolson method|Crank–Nicolson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Thomas–Fermi approximation===

If the number of particles in a gas is very large, the interatomic interaction becomes large so that  the kinetic energy term can be neglected from the Gross–Pitaevskii equation. This is called the [[Thomas–Fermi approximation]].

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t) = \sqrt{\frac{\mu - V(x)}{NU_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Bogoliubov approximation===

Bogoliubov treatment of the Gross–Pitaevskii equation is a method that finds the elementary excitations of a Bose–Einstein condensate. To that purpose, the condensate wavefunction is approximated  by a sum of the equilibrium wavefunction &lt;math&gt;\psi_0=\sqrt{n}e^{-i\mu t}&lt;/math&gt; and a small perturbation &lt;math&gt;\delta\psi&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \psi_0 + \delta\psi &lt;/math&gt;.

Then this form is inserted in the time dependent Gross–Pitaevskii equation and its complex conjugate, and linearized to first order in &lt;math&gt;\delta\psi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla ^2 \delta\psi+V\delta\psi+g(2|\psi_0|^2\delta\psi+\psi^2\delta\psi^*) = i\hbar\frac{\partial\delta\psi}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla ^2 \delta\psi^*+V\delta\psi^*+g(2|\psi_0|^2\delta\psi^*+(\psi^*)^2\delta\psi) = -i\hbar\frac{\partial\delta\psi^*}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the following for &lt;math&gt;\delta\psi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta\psi = e^{-i\mu t/\hbar}(u(\boldsymbol{r})e^{-i\omega t} - v^*(\boldsymbol{r})e^{i\omega t})&lt;/math&gt;

one finds the following coupled differential equations for &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by taking the &lt;math&gt; e^{\pm i\omega t} &lt;/math&gt; parts as independent components

:&lt;math&gt; \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+V+2gn-\hbar\mu-\hbar\omega\right)u-gnv = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+V+2gn-\hbar\mu+\hbar\omega\right)v-gnu = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

For a homogeneous system, i.e. for &lt;math&gt;V(\boldsymbol{r})=const.&lt;/math&gt;, one can get &lt;math&gt;V=\hbar\mu-gn&lt;/math&gt; from the zeroth order equation. Then we assume &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to be plane waves of momentum &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{q}&lt;/math&gt;, which leads to the energy spectrum

:&lt;math&gt; \hbar\omega = \epsilon_\boldsymbol{q} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2|\boldsymbol{q}|^2}{2m}\left( \frac{\hbar^2|\boldsymbol{q}|^2}{2m}+2gn \right)} &lt;/math&gt;

For large &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{q}&lt;/math&gt;, the dispersion relation is quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{q}&lt;/math&gt; as one would expect for usual non interacting single particle excitations. For small &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{q}&lt;/math&gt;, the dispersion relation is linear

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\boldsymbol{q} = s\hbar q&lt;/math&gt;



with &lt;math&gt;s=\sqrt{ng/m}&lt;/math&gt; being the speed of sound in the condensate. The fact that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\boldsymbol{q}/(\hbar q)&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; shows, according to Landau's criterion, that the condensate is a superfluid, meaning that if an object is moved in the condensate at a velocity inferior to s, it will not be energetically favorable to produce excitations and the object will move without dissipation, which is a characteristic of a [[superfluid]]. Experiments have been done to prove this superfluidity of the condensate, using a tightly focused blue-detuned laser.

===Superfluid in rotating helical potential===

The optical potential well &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm twist}( \mathbf{r},t)=V_{\rm twist}(z,r,\theta,t)&lt;/math&gt; might be formed by two counter propagating optical vortices with wavelengths &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\pm}=2 \pi c/\omega_{\pm}&lt;/math&gt;, effective width &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and topological charge &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; :

:&lt;math&gt; {E_{\pm}} (  \mathbf{r},t) \sim 
\exp \left(-\frac{r^2}{2 D^2}\right) r^{|\ell|} \exp (- i \omega_{\pm} t  \pm i k_{\pm} z + i \ell \theta) , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta\omega=(\omega_{+}-\omega_{-})&lt;/math&gt;.

In cylindrical coordinate system 
&lt;math&gt;( z, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Hair wax''' is a thick [[hairstyling product]] containing [[wax]], used to assist with holding the hair. In contrast with [[hair gel]], most of which contain [[alcohol]], hair wax remains appliable and has less chance of drying out. Consequently, hair wax is currently experiencing an increase in popularity, often under names such as [[pomade]], putty, glue, whip, molding gum, or styling paste.  The texture, consistency, and purpose of these products varies widely and each has a different purported purpose depending on the manufacturer.  Traditionally, pomade is a type of hair wax that also adds shine to one's hair.  

Hair wax has been used for many years and a waxy [[soap]]-like substance was invented by the ancient [[Gaul]]s as a hair styling agent and was not used as a cleaning agent until many years later.

==Ingredients==
The following are some of the ingredients typically found in commercial hair wax products.
* [[Beeswax]]
* [[Candelilla wax]]
* [[Carnauba wax]]
* [[Castor wax]]
* [[Emulsifying wax]]
* [[Japan wax]]
* [[Lanolin]]
* [[Ozokerite]]

Some stylists prefer making their own blends of hair wax customized for their clientele.  Various recipes exist, including some with "secret" ingredients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">'''John Ghazvinian''' (born 1974) is an American journalist and historian. He was raised in London and Los Angeles, born in Iran and currently lives in Philadelphia. He is known for his writing on African oil politics as the author of ''[[Untapped: The Scramble for Africa's Oil]]'' (Harcourt, 2007), an exposé of the [[petroleum industry]] in Africa.  Ghazvinian is currently a Senior Fellow at the Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

''Untapped'' has received widespread praise, particularly among progressives.  [[Andrew Leonard]] at [[salon.com]] wrote of the book that it "should be must reading for anyone who still believes that unregulated markets are the best way to cure all the ills of the poor nations of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Andrew.  The real heart of darkness.  May 5, 2007.  Salon.com&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called ''Untapped'' a "riveting account and superb analysis of what African oil means to a fuel-hungry world and to the African nations involved."&lt;ref&gt;Muldow, Anna.  A fierce new thirst for African's treasure. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.  May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the book "perceptive" and said that it "drills home the point...that a thoughtful strategy to lift the neglected bottom billion must compete against the global oil giants going about their business."&lt;ref&gt;Kotkin, Stephen.  "In Africa, One Step Forward and Two Back".  ''The New York Times''.  July 8, 2007 Retrieved May 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghazvinian also writes for [[The Nation]], [[Newsweek]], [[GQ]] and [[The Virginia Quarterly Review]].

Raised in London and later in Los Angeles, he currently lives in Philadelphia.

== Location ==

Kilmalkedar is on the [[Dingle Peninsula]], {{convert|4.8|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Ballyferriter]] and {{convert|6.7|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Dingle]].

== History ==
Kilmalkedar is traditionally associated with [[Saint Brendan]] (c. AD 484 – c. 577), but also with a local saint, Maolcethair (Maol Céadair, Maol Céaltair, Malkedar;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Ker_beVinJ8C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=Kilmalkedar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVl8jl-abbAhXNGuwKHce-BwMQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Kilmalkedar&amp;f=false|title=Saints and Their Cults in the Atlantic World|first=Margaret Jean|last=Cormack|date=27 May 2018|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; died 636).&lt;ref name="crsbi.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crsbi.ac.uk/site/717/|title=St Maolcethair/St Malkedar, Kilmalkedar · The Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain &amp; Ireland|last=|first=|date=|website=www.crsbi.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving church dates to the mid-12th century, with the chancel extended c. 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=NmBbDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105&amp;dq=Kilmalkedar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVl8jl-abbAhXNGuwKHce-BwMQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Kilmalkedar&amp;f=false|title=Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way: A Guide to its Historic Treasures|first=Neil|last=Jackman|date=11 May 2018|publisher=The Collins Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a traditional assembly site for pilgrims, who followed the Saint's Road (''Casán na Naomh'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=4YKrpH222eYC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Kilmalkedar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVl8jl-abbAhXNGuwKHce-BwMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kilmalkedar&amp;f=false|title=The Cross Goes North: Processes of Conversion in Northern Europe, AD 300-1300|first=Martin|last=Carver|date=27 May 2018|publisher=Boydell Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; northeast to [[Mount Brandon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voicesfromthedawn.com/gate-of-the-cow/|title=Voices from the Dawn – The Gate of the Cow; Kilmalkedar Keelers Stone|website=voicesfromthedawn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the rituals carried out by locals, like performing nine clockwise circuits of the site on [[Easter Sunday]], or the boring of holes in standing stones, suggest remnants of [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion]]; Kilmalkedar may well have been a religious site long before Christianity arrived.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=IENFAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Kilmalkedar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVl8jl-abbAhXNGuwKHce-BwMQ6AEITDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Kilmalkedar&amp;f=false|title=Soulfaring: Celtic Pilgrimage Then and Now|first=Cintra|last=Pemberton|date=1 October 1999|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kilmalkeader Church north west view.JPG|thumb|NW view]]

The church resembles Cormac's Chapel on the [[Rock of Cashel]] (built 1127–1134). Its [[nave]] is {{convert|8.28|x|9.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} with [[anta (architecture)|antae]] and steep gables. The [[chancel]] is {{convert|5.72|x|5.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} externally. The doorway is a notable Hiberno-Romanesque piece.&lt;ref name="irelandtravelkit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandtravelkit.com/irish-romanesque-church-kilmalkedar-county-kerry/|title=The Antiquities of Kilmalkedar: Dingle Peninsula, Co Kerry – Ireland Travel Kit|website=www.irelandtravelkit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irelandtravelkit.com" /&gt; A hole in the east wall of the chancel is called "the eye of the needle"; if one can fit through it, one is certain to go to heaven.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

{{About|the wood product||LVL (disambiguation){{!}}LVL}}

'''Laminated veneer lumber''' (LVL) is an [[engineered wood]] product that uses multiple layers of thin [[wood]] assembled with [[adhesive]]s. It is typically used for [[Framing (construction)#Lintels (headers)|header]]s, [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s, [[Rim joist|rimboard]], and edge-forming material.  LVL offers several advantages over typical milled [[lumber]]: Made in a factory under controlled specifications, it is stronger, straighter, and more uniform. Due to its composite nature, it is much less likely than conventional lumber to warp, twist, bow, or shrink. LVL is a type of structural composite lumber, comparable to [[Glued laminated timber]] (Gluelam) but with a higher allowable stress. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design of Wood Structures-ASD/LRFD|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Structural composite lumber, including LVL, are a relatively recent innovation. They are the result of new technology and economic pressure to make use of new species and smaller trees that cannot be used to make solid sawn lumber. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design of Wood Structures-ASD/LRFD|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[plywood]] became widespread by the early twentieth century, the invention of LVL wasn't until the 1980s after the invention of oriented strand board. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.apawood.org/apas-history&lt;/ref&gt; The National Design Specification for Wood Construction is generally updated on a 3- to 5-year cycle. The 1991 release is especially significant in that it is the first release which mentions LVL. LVL is mentioned as a subcategory of structural glued laminated timber. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design of Wood Structures-ASD/LRFD|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1991-1997 NDS Commentary|publisher=American Wood Council |url=http://www.awc.org/codes-standards/publications/nds-1991-1997|access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first explorations into engineered lumber happened during World War II in America. In 1942, an increased demand for wood caused a sudden timber shortage. The war industry utilized a panel material developed by the Homasote Company of Trenton, New Jersey made of wood pulp and ground newspaper to be used in place of siding and sheathing for buildings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poetic engineering and Invention: Arthur Troutner, Architect, and the Development of Engineered Lumber|publisher=84th ACSA Annual Meeting. Building Technology Conference.|access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of laminated veneer lumber as known today can be attributed to Arthur Troutner. While glue laminated wood veneers were in use since the middle of the 19th century on a small scale for furniture and pianos, Troutner was the first to develop a laminated veneer lumber of a scale large enough to be used in construction. In 1971 "Micro=Lam LVL" was introduced. "Micro=Lam LVL" consisted of laminated veneer lumber billets 4 feet wide, 3-1/2 inches thick, and 80 feet long. Troutner proved the structural capabilities of his Micro=Lam product by building a house in Hagerman, Idaho using beams made of Micro=Lam. Most corporations considered Troutner's invention to be a niche product and it was not until the mid 1980s when logging became an environmental concern and corporations moved toward engineered lumber that LVL became widespread in use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poetic engineering and Invention: Arthur Troutner, Architect, and the Development of Engineered Lumber|publisher=84th ACSA Annual Meeting.

== Qualities ==
Laminated veneer lumber is similar in appearance to [[plywood]], although in plywood the veneers switch direction while stacking and in LVL the veneers all stack in the same direction. In LVL, the direction of the wood grain is always parallel to the length of the billet. &lt;ref&gt;Allen, Edward and Joseph Iano. ''Fundamentals of Building Construction: Fourth Edition.'' Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2004. pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The stacking of these veneers into a complete board, called a billet, creates a single piece of LVL sharing a common direction of wood grain. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design of Wood Structures-ASD/LRFD|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; LVL is typically rated by the manufacturer for elastic modulus and allowable bending stress.  Common elastic moduli are {{convert|12|GPa|psi|abbr=on}}; {{convert|13|GPa|psi|abbr=on}}; and {{convert|14|GPa|psi|abbr=on}}; and common allowable bending stress values are {{convert|19|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}; and {{convert|21|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. Although the creation of LVL is often proprietary and thus its make-up is largely dependent on individual manufacturers, in general one cubic meter of North American Lumber is composed of 97.54% Wood, 2.41% of Phenol formaldehyde resin, 0.02% of Phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin, and 0.03% fillers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design of Wood Structures-ASD/LRFD|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icc.es.org/Reports/pdf_files/load_file.cfm?file_type=pdf&amp;file_name=ESR-1387.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing ==
LVL is commonly manufactured in North America by companies that also manufacture [[I-joist]]s. LVL is manufactured to sizes compatible with the depth of I-joist framing members for use as beams and headers. Additionally, some manufacturers further cut LVL into sizes for use as chord-members on I-joists. In 2012, North American LVL manufacturers produced more than 1.2 million cubic metres (43.4 million cubic feet) of LVL in 18 different facilities, and in 2013 the production increased with more than 14%.&lt;ref name="awc.org"&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Product Declaration for North American Laminated Veneer Lumber |institution=American Wood Council |url=http://www.awc.org/pdf/EPDs/LVL_EPD.pdf |date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fordaq"&gt;{{Cite news |work = Fordaq |publisher = Fordaq S.A. |title = North American panel output rises |url = http://www.fordaq.com/fordaq/news/North_America_panel_production_consumption_36151.html |date =3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not coincidental that LVL mills are often co-located with I-joist manufacturing facilities as many builders use a combination of I-joists and LVL in floor and roof assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icc.es.org/Reports/pdf_files/load_file.cfm?file_type=pdf&amp;file_name=ESR-1387.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Use ==
Because it is specifically sized to be compatible with [[I-joist]] floor framing, residential builders and building designers like the combination of I-joist and LVL floor and roof assemblies. LVL is considered to be a highly reliable building material that provides many of the same attributes associated with large sized timbers. LVL can also be used in combination with gluelam as an outer gluelam tension lam to increase the strength of the gluelam beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design of Wood Structures-ASD/LRFD|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the fact that the assembly adhesives limit the penetration of chemicals typically used to treat outdoor-rated lumber, LVL may not be suitable for outdoor load-bearing use. A deck built using pressure-treated LVL collapsed due to internal rotting of the twelve-year-old LVL components, although the LVL beams had passed regular visual inspections. The breakdown of LVL end uses in North America is 33% new single family residential construction, 25% residential renovations and upkeep, 8% new non-residential construction and 34% manufacturing furniture and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc.es.org/Reports/pdf_files/load_file.cfm?file_type=pdf&amp;file_name=ESR-1387.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural composite lumber ==
LVL belongs to the category of engineered wood called structural composite lumber.  Other members of this category are [[parallel strand lumber]] (PSL) and laminated strand lumber (LSL). All members of this category are strong and predictable, and are thus interchangeable for some applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=All About Beams |url=http://www3.telus.net/selkirk99/selkirk/Beams/beams.html |publisher=Selkirk Truss Ltd |access-date=19 Nov 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513115901/http://www3.telus.net/selkirk99/selkirk/Beams/beams.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; PSL is made from veneers that are cut up into long strands and oriented parallel to its length before being compressed into its final shape. LSL is also made from strands rather than veneer, although the strands are shorter and aligned with less precision than PSL and is created as billets that are like a thick version of [[oriented strand board]]. Billets of PSL and LVL are very similar although their sizes are different. Billets of PSL can be as large as 12 inches wide and 60 feet long while LVL can range up to 4 feet wide and 80 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design of Wood Structures-ASD/LRFD|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|access-date=29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[particle physics]], a '''lepton''' is an [[elementary particle]] of [[half-integer spin]] ([[spin (physics)|spin]] {{Frac|1|2}}) that does not undergo [[strong interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classes of leptons exist: [[electric charge|charged]] leptons (also known as the [[electron]]-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as [[neutrino]]s). Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various [[composite particle]]s such as [[atom]]s and [[positronium]], while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed.  The best known of all leptons is the [[electron]].

There are six types of leptons, known as ''[[flavour (particle physics)|flavours]]'', grouped in three ''[[Generation (particle physics)|generations]]''.&lt;ref name="HyperphysicsLepton"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[standard model|first-generation]] Leptons, also called ''electronic leptons'', comprise the [[electron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron-}}) and the [[electron neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}); the second are the ''muonic leptons'', comprising the [[muon]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}}) and the [[muon neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}); and the third are the ''tauonic leptons'', comprising the [[Tau (particle)|tau]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}}) and the [[tau neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau neutrino}}). Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons. The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of [[particle decay]]: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the [[universe]], whereas muons and taus can only be produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions (such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s and those carried out in [[particle accelerator]]s).

Leptons have various [[intrinsic properties]], including [[electric charge]], [[spin (physics)|spin]], and [[mass]]. Unlike [[quark]]s however, leptons are not subject to the [[strong interaction]], but they are subject to the other three [[fundamental interaction]]s: [[gravitation]], the [[weak interaction]], and to [[electromagnetism]], of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.

For every lepton flavor there is a corresponding type of [[antiparticle]], known as an [[antilepton]], that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]]. According to certain theories, neutrinos may be [[Majorana fermion|their own antiparticle]]. It is not currently known whether this is the case.

The first charged lepton, the electron, was theorized in the mid-19th century by several scientists&lt;ref name="farrar"&gt;

Leptons are an important part of the [[Standard Model]]. Electrons are one of the components of [[atom]]s, alongside [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. [[Exotic atom]]s with muons and taus instead of electrons can also be synthesized, as well as lepton–antilepton particles such as [[positronium]].

==Etymology==
The name ''lepton'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|λεπτός}} ''leptós'', "fine, small, thin" ([[Grammatical gender|neuter]] nominative/accusative singular form: λεπτόν ''leptón'');&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lepton "lepton"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lepto/s|λεπτός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀩𐀡𐀵}}, ''re-po-to'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;Found on the [[Knossos|KN]] L 693 and [[Pylos|PY]] Un 1322 tablets. {{cite web|title=The Linear B word re-po-to|publisher=Palaeolexicon.

Rosenfeld (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Following a suggestion of Prof. [[C. Møller]], I adopt—as a pendant to "nucleon"—the denomination "lepton" (from λεπτός, small, thin, delicate) to denote a particle of small mass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The etymology incorrectly implies that all the leptons are of small mass. When Rosenfeld named them, the only known leptons were electrons and muons, whose masses are indeed small compared to nucleons—the mass of an electron ({{val|0.511|ul=MeV/c2}})&lt;ref name="Electron"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s003.pdf Particle listings—{{SubatomicParticle|Electron-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and the mass of a muon (with a value of {{val|105.7|u=MeV/c2}})&lt;ref name="Muon"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s004.pdf Particle listings—{{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; are fractions of the mass of the "heavy" proton ({{val|938.3|u=MeV/c2}}).&lt;ref name="Proton"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s016.pdf Particle listings—{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}}]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mass of the tau (discovered in the mid 1970s) ({{val|1777|u=MeV/c2}})&lt;ref name="Tauon"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s035.pdf Particle listings—{{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; is nearly twice that of the proton, and about 3,500 times that of the electron.

The first lepton identified was the electron, discovered by [[J.J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinberg (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Wilson (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1930 [[Wolfgang Pauli]] postulated the [[electron neutrino]] to preserve [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of momentum]], and [[conservation of angular momentum]] in [[beta decay]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Riesselmann (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the difference between the [[energy]], [[momentum]], and [[angular momentum]] of the initial and observed final particles. The electron neutrino was simply called the neutrino, as it was not yet known that neutrinos came in different flavours (or different "generations").

Nearly 40 years after the discovery of the electron, the [[muon]] was discovered by [[Carl D. Anderson]] in 1936.  Due to its mass, it was initially categorized as a [[meson]] rather than a lepton.&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Neddermeyer, C.D. Anderson (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;  It later became clear that the muon was much more similar to the electron than to mesons, as muons do not undergo the [[strong interaction]], and thus the muon was reclassified: electrons, muons, and the (electron) neutrino were grouped into a new group of particles—the leptons. In 1962, [[Leon M. Lederman]], [[Melvin Schwartz]], and [[Jack Steinberger]] showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the [[muon]] neutrino, which earned them the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|1988 Nobel Prize]], although by then the different flavours of neutrino had already been theorized.&lt;ref&gt;I.V. Anicin (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tau (particle)|tau]] was first detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by [[Martin Lewis Perl]] with his colleagues at the [[SLAC]] [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|LBL group]].&lt;ref&gt;M.L. Perl et al. (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Like the electron and the muon, it too was expected to have an associated neutrino. The first evidence for tau neutrinos came from the observation of "missing" energy and momentum in tau decay, analogous to the "missing" energy and momentum in beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in 2000 by the [[DONUT]] collaboration at [[Fermilab]], making it the latest particle of the [[Standard Model]] to have been directly observed,&lt;ref name="obs"&gt;K. Kodama (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; apart from the [[Higgs boson]], which has been discovered in 2012.

Although all present data is consistent with three generations of leptons, some particle physicists are searching for a fourth generation. The current lower limit on the mass of such a fourth charged lepton is {{val|100.8|ul=GeV/c2}},&lt;ref&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008) [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s025.pdf Heavy Charged Leptons Searches]&lt;/ref&gt; while its associated neutrino would have a mass of at least {{val|45.0|ul=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008) [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s077.pdf Searches for Heavy Neutral Leptons]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

===Spin and chirality===
[[File:Right left helicity.svg|thumb|200px|right|Left-handed and right-handed helicities]]

Leptons are [[spin (physics)|spin]]-{{frac|1|2}} particles. The [[spin-statistics theorem]] thus implies that they are [[fermion]]s and thus that they are subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: No two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time. Furthermore, it means that a lepton can have only two possible spin states, namely up or down.

A closely related property is [[chirality (physics)|chirality]], which in turn is closely related to a more easily visualized property called [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]]. The helicity of a particle is the direction of its spin relative to its [[momentum]]; particles with spin in the same direction as their momentum are called ''right-handed'' and otherwise they are called ''left-handed''. When a particle is massless, the direction of its momentum relative to its spin is frame independent, while for massive particles it is possible to 'overtake' the particle by a [[Lorentz transformation]] flipping the helicity. Chirality is a technical property (defined through the transformation behaviour under the [[Poincaré group]]) that agrees with helicity for (approximately) massless particles and is still well defined for massive particles.

In many [[quantum field theories]], such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]], left- and right-handed fermions are identical. However, the Standard Model's [[Weak interaction]], treats left-handed and right-handed fermions are asymmetrically: Only left-handed fermions (and right-handed anti-fermions) participate in the [[weak interaction]]. This is an example of [[parity violation]] explicitly written into the model. In the literature, left-handed fields are often denoted by a capital ''L'' subscript (e.g. the normal electron:  e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and right-handed fields are denoted by a capital ''R'' subscript (e.g. a positron  e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).

Right-handed neutrinos and left-handed anti-neutrinos have no possible interaction with other particles (''see'' [[sterile neutrino]]s) and so are not a functional part of the Standard Model, although their exclusion is not a strict requirement; they are sometimes listed in particle tables to emphasize that they would have no active role if included in the model. Even though electrically charged particles (electron, muon, or tau) do not engage in the weak interaction specifically, they can still interact electrically, and hence still participate in the [[Electroweak unification|combined electro-weak force]], although with a different strengths ([[Weak hypercharge|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;W&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

=== Electromagnetic interaction ===
[[File:Lepton-interaction-vertex-eeg.svg|thumb|portrait|right|Lepton–photon interaction]]
One of the most prominent properties of leptons is their [[electric charge]], ''Q''. The electric charge determines the strength of their electromagnetic interactions. It determines the strength of the [[electric field]] generated by the particle (see [[Coulomb's law]]) and how strongly the particle reacts to an external electric or magnetic field (see [[Lorentz force]]). Each generation contains one lepton with ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''e'' (conventionally the charge of a particle is expressed in units of the [[elementary charge]]) and one lepton with zero electric charge. The lepton with electric charge is commonly simply referred to as a 'charged lepton' while the neutral lepton is called a neutrino. For example, the first generation consists of the electron {{SubatomicParticle|electron}} with a negative electric charge and the electrically neutral electron neutrino {{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}.

In the language of quantum field theory, the electromagnetic interaction of the charged leptons is expressed by the fact that the particles interact with the quantum of the electromagnetic field, the [[photon]]. The [[Feynman diagram]] of the electron-photon interaction is shown on the right.

Because leptons possess an intrinsic rotation in the form of their spin, charged leptons generate a magnetic field. The size of their [[magnetic dipole moment]] ''μ'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = g \frac{ Q \hbar}{4 m}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the mass of the lepton and ''g'' is the so-called [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] for the lepton.  First order approximation quantum mechanics predicts that the g-factor is 2 for all leptons. However, higher order quantum effects caused by loops in Feynman diagrams introduce corrections to this value. These corrections, referred to as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]], are very sensitive to the details of a quantum field theory model and thus provide the opportunity for precision tests of the standard model. The theoretical and measured values for the electron anomalous magnetic dipole moment are within agreement within eight significant figures.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Peskin, D.V. Schroeder (1995), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Standard Model, the left-handed charged lepton and the left-handed neutrino are arranged in [[Doublet (physics)|doublet]] {{nowrap|({{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, {{SubatomicParticle|electron}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)}} that transforms in the [[spinor]] representation (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}}) of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] gauge symmetry. This means that these particles are eigenstates of the isospin projection ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with eigenvalues {{frac|1|2}} and −{{frac|1|2}} respectively. In the meantime, the right-handed charged lepton transforms as a weak isospin scalar (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and thus does not participate in the weak interaction, while there is no evidence that a right-handed neutrino exists at all.

The [[Higgs mechanism]] recombines the gauge fields of the weak isospin SU(2) and the [[weak hypercharge]] U(1) symmetries to three massive vector bosons ({{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}}) mediating the weak interaction, and one massless vector boson, the photon, responsible for the electromagnetic interaction. The electric charge ''Q'' can be calculated from the isospin projection ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and weak hypercharge ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; through the [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]],
:''Q'' = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ½&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;
To recover the observed electric charges for all particles, the left-handed weak isospin doublet {{nowrap|({{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, {{SubatomicParticle|electron}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)}} must thus have ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1, while the right-handed isospin scalar e{{su|p=−|b=R}} must have ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−2. The interaction of the leptons with the massive weak interaction vector bosons is shown in the figure on the left.

=== Mass ===
In the [[Standard Model]], each lepton starts out with no intrinsic mass. The charged leptons (i.e. the electron, muon, and tau) obtain an effective mass through interaction with the [[Higgs field]], but the neutrinos remain massless. For technical reasons, the masslessness of the neutrinos implies that there is no mixing of the different generations of charged leptons as [[CKM matrix|there is for quarks]]. This is in close agreement with current experimental observations.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Peskin, D.V. Schroeder (1995), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is known from experiments—most prominently from observed [[neutrino oscillation]]s&lt;ref&gt;Y. Fukuda et al. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;—that neutrinos do in fact have some very small mass, probably less than {{val|2|ul=eV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="Neutrino"/&gt; This implies the existence of physics [[beyond the Standard Model]]. The currently most favoured extension is the so-called [[seesaw mechanism]], which would explain both why the left-handed neutrinos are so light compared to the corresponding charged leptons, and why we have not yet seen any right-handed neutrinos.

=== Leptonic numbers ===
{{Main article|Lepton number}}
The members of each generation's [[weak isospin]] [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] are assigned [[lepton number|leptonic numbers]] that are conserved under the Standard Model.&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"&gt;B.R. Martin, G. Shaw (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons and electron neutrinos have an ''electronic number'' of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while muons and muon neutrinos have a ''muonic number'' of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while tau particles and tau neutrinos have a ''tauonic number'' of  ''L''&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The antileptons have their respective generation's leptonic numbers of −1.

Conservation of the leptonic numbers means that the number of leptons of the same type remains the same, when particles interact. This implies that leptons and antileptons must be created in pairs of a single generation. For example, the following processes are allowed under conservation of leptonic numbers:{{clear}}
[[File:Lepton isodoublets fixed.png|thumb|right|Each generation forms a [[weak isospin]] [[Doublet (physics)|doublet]].]]
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antielectron}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Photon}} +  {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Photon}},
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Tau}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antitau}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Z boson0}} +  {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Z boson0}},

but not these:

:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Photon}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antimuon}},
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|W boson-}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Tau neutrino}},
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Z boson0}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Muon}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antitau}}.

However, [[neutrino oscillation]]s are known to violate the conservation of the individual leptonic numbers. Such a violation is considered to be smoking gun evidence for [[Beyond the Standard Model|physics beyond the Standard Model]]. A much stronger conservation law is the conservation of the total number of leptons (''L''), conserved even in the case of neutrino oscillations, but even it is still violated by a tiny amount by the [[chiral anomaly]].

== Universality &lt;!--'Lepton universality' redirects here--&gt;==
The coupling of the leptons to [[gauge boson]]s are flavour-independent (i.e., the interactions between leptons and gauge bosons are the same for all leptons).&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt; This property is called '''lepton universality'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and has been tested in measurements of the tau and muon [[mean lifetime|lifetime]]s and of [[Z boson]] partial [[decay width]]s, particularly at the [[Stanford Linear Collider]] (SLC) and [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] (LEP) experiments.&lt;ref name="Cumalat1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. P. Cumalat|title=Physics in Collision 12|year=1993|publisher=Atlantica Séguier Frontières|isbn=978-2-86332-129-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241–243}}&lt;ref name="Fraser1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=G Fraser|title=The Particle Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgasJfizmocC|date=1 January 1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-5033-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138}}

The decay rate (&lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) of muons through the process {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|muon-}} → {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron-}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|muon neutrino}} is approximately given by an expression of the form (see [[muon decay]] for more details)&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \left ( \mu^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\mu \right ) = K_1G_F^2m_\mu^5,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is some constant, and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]. The decay rate of tau particles through the process {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|tau-}} → {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron-}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|tau neutrino}} is given by an expression of the same form&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \left ( \tau^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\tau \right ) = K_2G_F^2m_\tau^5,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is some constant. Muon–Tauon universality implies that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, electron–muon universality implies&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \left ( \tau^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\tau \right ) = \Gamma \left ( \tau^- \rarr \mu^- + \bar{\nu_\mu} +\nu_\tau \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

This explains why the [[branching ratio]]s for the electronic mode (17.85%) and muonic (17.36%) mode of tau decay are equal (within error).&lt;ref name="Tauon"/&gt;

Universality also accounts for the ratio of muon and tau lifetimes. The lifetime of a lepton (''τ''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;) is related to the decay rate by&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_\ell=\frac{B \left ( \ell^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\ell \right )}{\Gamma \left ( \ell^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\ell \right )},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''(x → y) and &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;(x → y) denotes the branching ratios and the [[decay width|resonance width]] of the process x&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;y&amp;#x202f;.

The ratio of tau and muon lifetime is thus given by&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_\tau}{\tau_\mu} = \frac{B \left ( \tau^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\tau \right )}{B \left ( \mu^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\mu \right )}\left (\frac{m_\mu}{m_\tau}\right )^5.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the values of the 2008 ''[[Review of Particle Physics]]'' for the branching ratios of muons&lt;ref name="Muon"/&gt; and tau&lt;ref name="Tauon"/&gt; yields a lifetime ratio of ~{{val|1.29|e=-7}}, comparable to the measured lifetime ratio of ~{{val|1.32|e=-7}}. The difference is due to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; not actually being constants: They depend on the mass of leptons.

Recent tests of lepton universality in [[B meson]] decays, performed by the [[LHCb]], [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]] and [[Belle experiment|Belle]] experiments, have shown consistent deviations from the Standard Model predictions. However the combined statitical and systematic significance is not yet high enough to claim an observation of [[new physics]].&lt;ref name=Ciezarek2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciezarek G, Franco Sevilla M, Hamilton B, Kowalewski R, Kuhr T, Lüth V, Sato Y |year=2017 |title=A challenge to lepton universality in B-meson decays |journal=Nature |volume=546 |issue= 7657|pages=227–233 |doi=10.1038/nature22346|pmid=28593973 |arxiv=1703.01766 |bibcode=2017Natur.546..227C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1662">'''Lyoluminescence''' refers to the emission of light while dissolving a solid into a liquid [[solvent]]. It is actually a form of [[chemiluminescence]]. The most common lyoluminescent effect is seen when solid samples which have been heavily [[irradiated]] by [[ionizing radiation]] are dissolved in water.  The total amount of light emitted by the material increases proportionally with the total radiation dose received by the material up to a certain level called the saturation value. 

Many gamma-irradiated substances are known to lyoluminescence; these include [[spices]], [[powdered milk]], soups, cotton and paper. While the broad variety of materials which exhibit lyoluminescence confounds explanation by a single common mechanism there is a common feature to the phenomenon, the production of [[free radicals]] in solution. Lyoluminescence intensity can be increased by performing the dissolution of the solid in a solution containing conventionally chemiluminescent compounds such as [[luminol]]. These are thus called lyoluminescence sensitizers.

The '''magnetosheath''' is the region of space between the [[magnetopause]] and the [[bow shock]] of a [[planet|planet's]] [[magnetosphere]]. The regularly organized [[magnetic field]] generated by the planet becomes weak and irregular in the magnetosheath due to interaction with the incoming [[solar wind]], and is incapable of fully deflecting the highly [[charged particle]]s. The density of the particles in this region is considerably lower than what is found beyond the bow shock, but greater than within the [[magnetopause]], and can be considered a transitory state.

[[Image:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere, showing the relative position of the magnetosheath]]

Scientific research into the exact nature of the magnetosheath has been limited due to a longstanding misconception that it was a simple byproduct of the bow shock/magnetopause interaction and had no inherently important properties of its own.  Recent studies indicate, however, that the magnetosheath is a dynamic region of turbulent [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] flow that may play an important role in the structure of the bow shock and the magnetopause, and may help to dictate the flow of energetic particles across those boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The [[Earth]]'s magnetosheath typically occupies the region of space approximately 10 Earth radii on the upwind ([[Sun]]-facing) side of the planet, extending significantly farther out on the downwind side due to the pressure of the solar wind.  The exact location and width of the magnetosheath does depend on variables such as [[Solar variation|solar activity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">'''Metal–insulator transitions''' are transitions from a [[metal]] (material with good [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] of [[electric charges]]) to an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (material where conductivity of charges is quickly suppressed). These transitions can be achieved by tuning various ambient parameters such as [[pressure]] or, in case of a [[semiconductor]], [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]].

== History ==

The basic distinction between metals and insulators was proposed by [[Hans Bethe|Bethe]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] and [[Felix Bloch|Bloch]] in 1928/1929. It distinguished between conducting metals and nonconducting insulators. However, in 1937 [[Jan Hendrik de Boer|de Boer]] and Evert Verwey reported that many [[transition-metal oxides]] (such as NiO) with a partially filled d-band were poor conductors, often insulating. In the same year, the importance of the electron-electron correlation was stated by [[Rudolf Peierls|Peierls]]. Since then, these materials as well as others exhibiting a transition between a metal and an insulator have been extensively studied, e.g. by [[Nevill Francis Mott|Sir Nevill Mott]], after whom the insulating state is named [[Mott insulator]].

== Theoretical description ==

The classical [[Electronic band structure|band structure]] of solid state physics predicts the [[Fermi level]] to lie in a [[band gap]] for insulators and in the [[conduction band]] for metals, which means metallic behavior is seen for compounds with partially filled bands. However, some compounds have been found which show insulating behavior even for partially filled bands. This is due to the [[Electronic correlation|electron-electron correlation]], since electrons cannot be seen as noninteracting. Mott considers a lattice model with just one electron per site. Without taking the interaction into account, each site could be occupied by two electrons, one with [[spin (physics)|spin]] up and one with spin down. Due to the interaction the electrons would then feel a strong Coulomb repulsion, which Mott argued splits the band in two: The lower band is then occupied by the first electron per site, the upper by the second. If each site is only occupied by a single electron the lower band is completely filled and the upper band completely empty, the system thus a so-called [[Mott insulator]].

The '''Ministry of Petroleum ''' is a ministry of the [[Government of South Sudan]]. The incumbent minister is  Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth,  the ministry of petroleum  contributes more than 90% of the south Sudan total income through oil production and exportation to different counties through north sudan pipe line from the oil fields in south sudan to the port sudan in red sea. the government of sudan is heavily taxing south sudan for using the pipe line, and with the recent declined in the oil prices in the international market, this declined in the oil prices has really affected the economy of the country.  &lt;ref&gt;Government of South Sudan official Website: Ministry of Petroleum  {{cite web |url=http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/ministries/Petroleum-and-Mining.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20110901155620/http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/ministries/Petroleum-and-Mining.html |archivedate=2011-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mootral''' is the name given to a programme to reduce [[methane]] emissions from [[ruminant]] animals, chiefly [[cow]]s and [[sheep]], but also [[goat]]s. Methane is a major target [[greenhouse gas]] and in the 4th protocol report of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) is recommended to increase from a x23 to x72 multiplier because of the magnitude of its effect relative to [[carbon dioxide]] and short longevity in [[Earth's atmosphere]].

== Natural feed supplement ==

The Mootral natural feed supplement is produced by Neem Biotech. The active ingredient is an organic [[Organosulfur compounds|organosulfur]] compound (normally found in [[garlic]]), Research at the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]] has demonstrated up to a 94% reduction in methane production.

Mootral is the brand for the project, designed to certify approved methane reduction programmes in which corporates may participate and prove the provenance of their involvement.  Proceeds of [[emission trading]] credits are part donated to [[farmer]]s, who will receive Mootral without charge for adding to their cattle feed. Further surpluses return to programme participants and charities allied to greenhouse gas reduction research.

==Publicity==
Mootral has attracted much recent  attention as runner-up in the FT Global Climate Challenge and Dutch Postcode Lottery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  

Mootral is a finalist in the Shell/BBC/Newsweek World Challenge 2009 as one of the 12 most promising solutions to [[climate change]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2767">The '''New Agriculture Movement''' ({{lgn-bn|''Nayakrishi''}}) is an [[agricultural]] movement in [[Bangladesh]] that opposes the use of [[Western world|Western]] pesticides and [[Genetic engineering|genetically altered]] seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh: the seeds of change |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9172006_ITM |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |date=January 2001 |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Movement began in response to [[environmental hazards]] that were believed to have been started by the use of [[insecticides]] and [[nematicide]]s in the growing of [[crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Writing the world: on globalization |last=Rothenberg |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-18245-4 |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to health concerns the movement strongly promotes [[organic farming]], and the use for food and animal fodder of plants which are often regarded as weeds.&lt;ref name=hbl/&gt; This is seen as both furthering self-sufficiency and distancing Bangladesh from Western [[land development|development]] firms and the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name=reed&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Development and Social Power: Perspectives from South Asia |last=Reed |first=Ananya Mukherjee |year=2008 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |isbn=978-0-415-77552-6 |pages=129–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nayakrishi has a special emphasis on supporting women, with a programme of supplying cattle to poor female-headed households which are kept until a calf is born, when the original animal is passed on to another family,&lt;ref name=hbl&gt;{{cite news |title=To measure poverty, you may have to go chak |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2007/09/27/stories/2007092750650900.htm |work=[[The Hindu Business Line]] |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation of the Specialised Women's Seed Network to collect seeds from local varieties of crops.&lt;ref name=reed/&gt;

'''Newstead Gasworks''' is a heritage-listed former [[gasometer]] at 70 Longland Street, [[Teneriffe, Queensland|Teneriffe]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was built from 1873 to 1887. It is also known as Brisbane Gas Company Gasworks and Newstead Gasworks No.2 gasholder. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 24 June 2005.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|16355|Newstead Gasworks No.2 gasholder (remnants) and guide framing|601594|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:StateLibQld 2 262992 Estate map of property fronting Adelaide, Boundary and Macrossan Streets, Brisbane, Queensland, 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Estate map showing gasworks at Petrie Bight, 1885]]
The Newstead Gasworks was established in 1887, as the second [[Brisbane]] gasworks. The surviving Newstead Gasworks No.2 gasholder (remnants) and guide framing was erected at that time and was probably moved from the original gas works site at [[Petrie, Queensland|Petrie]] Bight where it was erected in 1873.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

From 1861 to 1864, Brisbane's population more than doubled, to 12,551. In the mid-1860s, Brisbane's infrastructure blossomed, with construction of the first cross-river bridge, a new [[Town of Brisbane|Brisbane Town Hall]], a vastly improved water supply and its first gasworks. Commercial gas supply originated in London in 1812, Sydney in 1841 and Melbourne in 1856.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The [[Brisbane Municipal Council]] was anxious to provide street lighting, for which gas was seen as the only feasible system. Earlier in the decade, the [[Queensland Government|Colonial Government]], supposedly for health reasons, refused permission for the Council to establish a gasworks on a site at [[Petrie Bight|Petrie's Bight]]. On the same site, however, in 1864, the Government authorised private enterprise to establish this new public utility. Central to these decisions was the Minister for Lands and Works, [[Arthur Macalister]], then at the epicentre of friction between the Government and the Brisbane Council, friction which has erupted on several occasions ever since.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

One of the founding directors of the Company in 1864 was [[Lewis Adolphus Bernays]], secretary for the first 37 years, and eventually a board member, of the (Brisbane) Board of Waterworks. Bernays, also listed in Who's Who from 1851-1905, was prominent in a number of Queensland organisations including the [[Acclimatisation Society]], and held the position of clerk of the [[Queensland Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

[[Brisbane Gas Company]] production started at Petrie Bight in November 1865. The streets of Brisbane were lit. Soon after, however, council's arrears of payment resulted in its gas being turned off, with the streets plunged back into darkness. The streets remained unlit until the council's (and the colony's) financial situation had recovered sufficiently, in 1870. By 1873, the boot was on the other foot. The council's cash flow had recovered, but gas flow could not satisfy demand. The Company duly solved the problem by installing another, larger (No.2) gasholder (probably known then as a gasometer).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The 81-year-long association of the Cowlishaw family with the board of the company also started in 1873. [[James Cowlishaw]], later the Hon. James Cowlishaw, [[Member of the Queensland Legislative Council]], an architect, was chairman for 41 years. He served on the board for 45 years. His brother [[George Cowlishaw]] also served on the board for 28 years from 1884. James Cowlishaw was succeeded in the chair by his son [[Thomas Owen Cowlishaw]], who served for 34 years until 1954. A fourth Cowlishaw, [[George Owen Cowlishaw]], was involved with the Company in 1939.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The main demand for gas during the 1870s was probably for lighting, and the Municipal Council was almost certainly the Brisbane Gas Company's biggest customer. After the financial woes of the later 1860s there followed two decades of steady growth in Brisbane, reflected in an increase of demand for gas, for both lighting and for domestic and industrial fuel. Supply was expanded to, among other places, [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]]. The Company had outgrown the Petrie's Bight site, and acquired {{convert|22|acre}} of suitable land at [[Newstead, Queensland|Newstead]], in 1883. Further adjoining land was bought in 1885 to facilitate the company's first major expansion.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The company's engineer for the shift from Petrie Bight to Newstead was JH Tomlinson, arriving in 1880 from a previous appointment in Birmingham. He presumably managed the design, supply and erection of the new gasworks. The equipment, much of it imported from England, was landed at the Company's wharf at the [[Brisbane River]] frontage of the site. The company first manufactured and stored town gas at Newstead in 1887 after a period of 22 years manufacture at Petrie Bight.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

As part of the shift to Newstead, the Petrie's Bight gasholder No.2, constructed in 1873 from puddled iron, was re-erected on the recently acquired land at Longland Street. No.1 gasholder remained at Petrie Bight. At this time, the first weight-controlled governor would have been installed in its governor house.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Just as had occurred in the early 1860s, the land boom of the 1880s was reflected in booming demand for gas. Events proved that there was room for a second gasworks. The [[South Brisbane Gas and Light Company Limited]] was formed in 1885, entered the market very aggressively, and produced its first gas at the end of 1886. By this time, gas was increasingly in use for domestic fuel as well as for lighting. A price-cutting war lasted until 1889 when the companies, without any concerns about restrictive trade practices, carved Brisbane up into north and south of the river as their respective marketing territories. It was not until the Gas Act of 1916 that the government saw fit to look more closely at the cosy arrangements between gas companies, which by that stage included the [[Wynnum and Manly Gas and Lighting Company Limited]], formed in 1912. The Act dealt with product quality and pressure, and provided for gas examiners. Price was also dealt with. (A later piece of legislation, the Profiteering Prevention Act, also encompassed gas).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:View of Kyabra Street looking towards the gasometer in Newstead Queensland.jpg|thumb|View of Kyabra Street looking towards the gasometer]]
A further consideration in the 1880s was the emergence in Brisbane of electricity generation for power and lighting. Eventually, as electricity technology advanced, gas lighting would literally fade into the background, the demand for gas as fuel outstripping the demand for use for lighting. Active defence was mounted to protect the gas companies' interests in lighting, and it was not until 1917 that the first permanent electric lighting took to the streets of Brisbane.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The demise of gas lighting would not have been immediate, and the demand for gas continued to grow. In 1929, No.3 gasholder at Doggett Street was commissioned, a four-lift frame-guided steel tank gasholder, again made from puddled iron, with a capacity of {{convert|2,500,000|cuft}}, by far the largest in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1937, gasholder No.2 was fitted with a new crown of riveted steel plate.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In the post-[[World War II]] period, demand for gas again boomed, to such an extent that at one stage some 5000 newly constructed northside dwellings were completed without their gas having been connected. The core of the problem lay in English gasworks manufacturers' inability to deliver. A major retort augmentation planned for completion in 1950 finally came on stream in 1954, but not until an emergency measure had been taken to erect a Humphreys and Glasgow water-gas plant, for which coke was the feedstock. This came on stream just in time for the winter of 1953.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

When the [[Queensland Railways]] were converted to diesel fuel in the 1960s, it was judged that there would be a risk of serious damage if a locomotive were to derail near No.2 gasholder. Accordingly, a reinforced concrete wall was built as a shield between the railway spur line and the gasholder. Diesel locomotives were seen as a greater risk than their apparently cuddly coal-fired steam counterparts that had used the same track, in the same proximity, for the previous half-century.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

By 1965, No.1 gasholder in [[Ann Street, Brisbane|Ann Street]] had been dismantled. In 1999, so had No.3, and No.2 has been disabled by splitting a hole in the crown plating, leaving the inside of the gasholder exposed to a moist oxidising atmosphere, ideal conditions for rapid rust.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 2008, planning approval was given for the [[Gasworks Newstead]] urban redevelopment project, replacing the former industrial area in Newstead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/newstead-urban-renewal/news-story/3e71954ab43d0dfb6a46048a54b35d81|title=Development nod for Newstead urban renewal site|last=|first=|date=11 April 2008|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|access-date=3 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project incorporated the gasometer site and repurposed it as an outdoor amphitheatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.placeprojects.com.au/newstead-a-cultural-study/|title=Newstead : A Cultural Study|last=|first=|date=31 July 2014|website=Place Projects|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gas manufacture ==
The foregoing history has been compiled in the context of gas storage, with the emphasis on the remaining No.2 gasholder (remnants) and guide framing, which has stored and delivered both town gas and natural gas.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The sources of gasholder feed have been a series of gas manufacturing plants on the site, of which there are none left. The size and programming of the manufacturing plants have been determined by several factors:&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
* Current technology, both of outlet appliances and gas manufacture technology
* Demand, always closely related to population growth and economic conditions
* Feedstock
* Working conditions at the gasworks.

The following is a brief history of the major manufacturing installations at Newstead since 1887. The first manufacture at Newstead in 1887 was in a retort house containing ten benches of manually operated horizontal retorts. Feedstock was [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] coking coal. Output was "town" gas.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A new {{convert|1,500,000|cuft}} per day West's vertical retort house, embarked upon during [[World War I]], was eventually completed in 1920, with six settings of eight {{convert|33|in|adj=on}} vertical retorts {{convert|20|ft}} long.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1926, a Whessoe washer was imported, used to remove ammonia and naphthalene after completion of all other purification.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A further ten benches were added to the horizontal retort house in 1927 when the horizontal retort house was revamped to mechanical operation.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Several additions were made in 1947, in preparation for a major increase in plant capacity planned to be on stream by 1950. A Woodhall-Duckham electrostatic de-tarrer was imported from England, and a Livesay washer was constructed locally. These were of 4,000,000 cu. ft. per day capacity, matching the capacity of the proposed new Glover-West plant on order from England. Also, constructed locally to (English) Holmes design, multi-film washers. Additional Connersville meters were also installed.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The new Glover-West vertical retort carbonising plant, with a capacity of 4,000,000 cu. ft. per day, was eventually opened in 1954. In view of delays in supply of specialised plant from post-war England, a Humphreys-Glasgow carburetted water-gas plant was installed as an emergency measure by [[MR Hornibrook Pty Ltd]], prior to the winter of 1953. While less efficient than the carbonisation process, this process, one of several known as gasification, used coke as its feedstock and was more easily automated. It is probable that the Bryan-Donkin diaphragm-operated governors, housed immediately to the north of and in series with the original governor, were installed as part of the 1954 revamp.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

With the arrival of natural gas, the retort houses and the water-gas plant were duly retired from service, to be replaced, in 1968 with a Vickers-Zimmer plant, supplemented in 1973 by an Onia-Geigy plant ex [[Adelaide]]. These gasification plants synthesised town gas from oil refinery material and natural gas, until the eventual 1996 conversion of the older suburbs to natural gas.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The older carbonisation plants were demolished in 1994, and the gasification plants in 1999, along with gasholder No.3 in Doggett Street. In 2002, approval was given to demolish the brick governor houses and to remove associated machinery and pipe work, to demolish the storage shed and concrete safety wall, and to construct new commercial buildings and an adjacent road surrounding the gasometer. Approval was also given to excavate the site and remove its crown and inner gaslifts.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
All items of gas manufacture, such as retort houses, exhausters, condensers, gasification plants, scrubbers, washers, purifiers, have been demolished. Most of these lay on the eastern side of the site. The weighbridge and the compressor house have also been demolished.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The only remaining items of historical engineering interest remaining on site include the Newstead Gasworks No.2 gasholder (remnants) and guide framing. The facility originally had a double-lift 500,000 cu. ft. capacity and was re-crowned in 1937.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Newstead Gasworks No.2 gasholder (remnants and guide framing) was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 24 June 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

The Newstead Gasworks No.2 gasholder demonstrates the growth and development pattern of the reticulation of a major public utility, the gas supply and its infrastructure, in Brisbane and northern Brisbane suburbs from the 1860s through to the 1990s. Town gas was among the earliest of innovations that significantly improved the quality of life in the burgeoning city of Brisbane, particularly in the boom periods of the 1860s and 1880s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''

The remnants of the gasholder and guide framing represents the last of the frame-guided type remaining in Brisbane, and possibly in Queensland. The Newstead No.2 gasholder (remnants) and guide framing, constructed in 1873 from puddled iron and part of the former Petrie Bight gasworks (1865-1887), is significant for its rarity, its robustness and its association with Queensland's first gasworks and a major public utility for 125 years.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.'''

The place has the potential to yield information about the evolving technology of manufacture and distribution of town and natural gas in Brisbane and northern Brisbane suburbs over a period of 125 years.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

One of the principal characteristics of a gasworks was its gasholder storage and other necessarily robust but sensitive and reliable machinery and apparatus required for drawing from the storage. At the Newstead site, the remaining gasholder (remnants) and guide framing demonstrates some of these characteristics of the gasworks.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.'''

Large round structures are unusual and attractive, particularly in areas of predominantly angular commercial and industrial construction such as Newstead. Aesthetically, the cylindrical gasholder with its spherical crown, even when empty, was both interesting and elegant. The aesthetic is further enhanced by the slightly ornate frame-guide structure.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

For over 100 years, passers-by along Breakfast Creek Road, Longland and Ann Streets, as well as residents of and workers in the area, would have seen No.2 gasholder in various states of filling, silently performing its important function of storing and feeding out the gas supply. For these communities, the gasholder (remnants) and guide framing was and is an important landmark. The material remaining on the site carries with it a strong association with these communities.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''

The gasworks site has a special association with a vital public utility, Brisbane's gas supply, for over a century. Prominent figures with long and close associations with the gasworks included Lewis Adolphus Bernays (associated between 1864-1908) and the Hon James Cowlishaw (associated between 1873-1920).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13353">[[File:Ethyl eicosapentaenoate.png|thumb|right|upright|Chemical structure of [[ethyl eicosapentaenoate]], an important omega-3 acid ethyl ester]]
'''Omega-3 acid ethyl esters''' are the omega-3 fatty acids [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), i.e., the ester part, attached at one end to an ethanol molecule - the ethyl part. These FDA-approved prescription products are used in combination with changes in diet to lower blood [[triglyceride]] levels in adults with severe (≥ 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. This was the first [[fish oil]]-derived product to be approved for use as a drug. The first approvals came in Europe in 2001. The first approval in the US came in 2004. These prescription products have been tested in clinical trials. In the US, omega-3 ethyl esters are also manufactured and sold as dietary supplements.

==Medical use==
Omega-3 acid ethyl esters are used in addition to changes in diet to reduce [[triglyceride]] levels in adults with severe (≥ 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) [[hypertriglyceridemia]].&lt;ref name=LovazaLabel&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/021654s041lbl.pdf Lovaza Label] Revised: March 2016. Updated labels available at FDA website [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&amp;ApplNo=204977&amp;DrugName=OMTRYG&amp;ActiveIngred=OMEGA%2D3%2DACID%20ETHYL%20ESTERS&amp;SponsorApplicant=TRYGG&amp;ProductMktStatus=1&amp;goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the European markets and other major markets outside the US, omega-3 acid ethyl esters are indicated for [[hypertriglyceridemia]] as a monotherapy, or in combination with a [[statin]] for patients with mixed [[dyslipidemia]] and as secondary prevention after [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in addition to other standard therapy (e.g. statins, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and ACE-I).&lt;ref name=emc&gt;UK electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) [https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/10312 Omacor]. Last Updated on eMC 20-Apr-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (&gt; 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater that 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).  It appears that both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lower triglycerides, but DHA appears to raise [[LDL-C]] ("bad cholesterol") more than EPA, while DHA raises [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL-C]] ("good cholesterol") while EPA does not.&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015&gt;Jacobson TA, et al, NLA Expert Panel.

===Other fish-oil based drugs===
There are other omega-3 fish oil based prescription drugs on the market that have similar uses and mechanisms of action.&lt;ref name=2014rev/&gt;

===Dietary supplements===
There are many fish oil dietary supplements on the market.&lt;ref name=2015CompareRev/&gt; There appears to be little difference in effect between dietary supplement and prescription forms of omega-3 fatty acids as to ability to lower triglycerides, but the ethyl ester products work less well when taken on an empty stomach or with a low-fat meal.&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015/&gt;  The ingredients of dietary supplements are not as carefully controlled as prescription products and have not been tested in clinical trials as such drugs have.&lt;ref name=emedDrugs&gt;Sweeney MET.

==Side effects==
Special caution should be taken with people who have [[Fish Allergy|fish and shellfish allergies]].&lt;ref name=LovazaLabel/&gt; In addition, as with other omega-3 fatty acids, taking omega-3 acid ethyl esters puts people who are on [[anticoagulants]] at risk for prolonged [[bleeding time]].&lt;ref name=LovazaLabel/&gt;&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015/&gt;

Side effects include [[Dyspepsia|stomach ache]], burping, and a bad taste; some people on very high doses (8g/day) in clinical trials had [[atrial fibrillation]].&lt;ref name=LovazaLabel/&gt;

Omega-3 acid ethyl esters have not been tested in pregnant women and are rated [[Pregnancy category#United States|pregnancy category C]]; it is excreted in breast milk and the effects on infants are not known.&lt;ref name=LovazaLabel/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
After ingestion, omega-3 acid ethyl esters are metabolized mostly in the liver like other dietary fatty acids.&lt;ref name=emc/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Omega-3 acid ethyl esters, like other omega-3 fatty acid based drugs, appears to reduce production of triglycerides in the liver, and to enhance clearance of triglycerides from circulating [[very low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) particles; the way it does that is not clear, but potential mechanisms include increased [[Beta oxidation|breakdown of fatty acids]]; inhibition of [[diglyceride acyltransferase]] which is involved in biosynthesis of triglycerides in the liver; and increased activity of [[lipoprotein lipase]] in blood.&lt;ref name=2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weintraub|first1=HS|title=Overview of prescription omega-3 fatty acid products for hypertriglyceridemia|journal=Postgrad Med|date=2014|volume=126|issue=7|pages=7–18|doi=10.3810/pgm.2014.11.2828|pmid=25387209|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;ref name=emc/&gt; The synthesis of triglycerides is reduced in the liver as EPA and DHA are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for triglyceride synthesis.

==Physical and chemical properties==
The active ingredient is concentrated omega-3-acid ethyl esters that are made from [[fish oil|fish body oils]] that are purified and [[esterification|esterified]],&lt;ref name=adis/&gt; For the Lovaza product, each 1000&amp;nbsp;mg softgel capsule contains 840&amp;nbsp;mg omega-3 fatty acids: [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] ethyl ester (460&amp;nbsp;mg) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] ethyl ester (380&amp;nbsp;mg).&lt;ref name=emc/&gt;

==History==
Pronova BioPharma ASA had its roots in Norway's [[Cod liver oil|codfish liver oil]] industry; it was founded in 1991 as a spinout from the JC Martens company, which in turn was founded in 
1838 in Bergen, Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Epax [http://www.epax.com/pages/history History] Page accessed March 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Pronova developed the concentrated omega-3 acid ethyl esters formulation that is the [[active pharmaceutical ingredient]] of Lovaza.&lt;ref name=adis&gt;Adis Insight [http://adis.springer.com/drugs/800002488 Omega-3 ethylester concentrate] Page accessed March 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palladium black''' is a coarse, [[metal sponge | sponge-like form]] of elemental [[palladium]] which offers a large [[surface area]] for [[catalyst|catalytic]] [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. It is used in [[organic synthesis]] as a catalyst for [[hydrogenation]] reactions.&lt;ref name=Shigeo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nishimura|first1=Shigeo|title=Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis|date=2001|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Newyork|isbn=9780471396987|pages=34-35|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjZRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=0471396982&amp;dq=0471396982&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BCacVMTgN5LmoASd34KQCQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term palladium black is also used colloquially to refer to a black precipitate of elemental palladium, which forms via decomposition of various palladium complexes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iwasawa|first=Tetsuo|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Makoto|last3=Obora|first3=Yasushi|last4=Tsuji|first4=Yasushi|date=2004-06-01|title=Homogeneous Palladium Catalyst Suppressing Pd Black Formation in Air Oxidation of Alcohols|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja031936l|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=126|issue=21|pages=6554–6555|doi=10.1021/ja031936l|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''Pathatrix ''' is a high volume recirculating immuno magnetic-capture system for the detection of [[pathogen]]s in food and environmental samples.  Pathatrix was used in 2006, linking an [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|E. coli O157]] outbreak to contaminated spinach.

The Pathatrix system is being used by [[List of United States federal agencies|regulatory agencies]] and food companies around the world to enhance their pathogen detection capabilities.

Unlike other detection methods Pathatrix allows the entire pre-enriched sample or large pooled samples to be recirculated over antibody-coated [[paramagnetic]] beads. It can specifically isolate [[pathogens]] directly from food samples and in conjunction with [[quantitative PCR]] can provide results within hours. It is also used to improve the performance of other rapid methods such as [[PCR]], [[Lateral flow test|lateral flow]], [[ELISA]] and chromgenic media by reducing or eliminating the need for lengthy pre enrichment and/or selective enrichment steps. The Pathatrix is useful in pathogen labs that would be running food samples and looking for [[Foodborne illness|foodborne diseases]].

The Pathatrix is a rapid test method and Pathatrix pooling allows the screening of large numbers of food samples in a highly [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effective]] way for specific pathogens such as E. coli O157, Salmonella or [[Listeria monocytogenes]].

The Pathatrix will selectively bind and purify the target organism from a comprehensive range of complex food matrices (including raw [[ground beef]], chocolate, [[peanut butter]], [[Leaf vegetable|leafy greens]], spinach, tomatoes). The Pathatrix is the only microbial detection system that allows for the entire sample to be analyzed.

== Pathatrix procedure ==
To perform a test using Pathatrix there are 4 major steps including sample preparation, pre-incubation, placing the sample in the Pathatrix, and washing and elution.

Once the food samples are ready they are placed in the five independent incubation pots providing heat that makes the Pathatrix more sensitive for the detection of the target organism. [[Tubing (material)|Tubing]], made of [[silicone rubber]], is then connected to form a loop. Finally magnetic beads particles, coated with an antibody specific to the target pathogen, are added.

The whole process runs for 180 minutes at a temperature between 30-37 degrees Celsius. After the incubation has taken place the target organism, now captured by the reagent, are now retained on the magnetic while unwanted debris is taken away. During the capture phase the microorganisms are removed from the system and further processed, otherwise  colonies can be seen within as little as 16 hours.

Interactions between [[electromagnetic radiation]] and ionized gas have been extensively studied for many purposes, including concealing aircraft from radar as [[stealth technology]]. Various methods might plausibly be able to form a layer or cloud of plasma around a [[vehicle]] to deflect or absorb radar, from simpler electrostatic or [[radio frequency]] discharges to more complex laser discharges.&lt;ref name="laserplasma"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theoretically possible to reduce RCS in this way, but it may be very difficult to do so in practice.

==First claims==
In 1956, Arnold Eldredge, of General Electric, filed a patent application for an "Object Camouflage Method and Apparatus," which proposed using a particle accelerator in an aircraft to create a cloud of ionization that would "...refract or absorb incident radar beams."  It is unclear who funded this work or whether it was prototyped and tested.  U.S. Patent 3,127,608 was granted in 1964.&lt;ref name="patent3127608"&gt;{{Cite patent

During Project OXCART, the operation of the [[Lockheed A-12]] reconnaissance aircraft, the CIA funded an attempt to reduce the RCS of the A-12's [[inlet cone]]s.  Known as Project KEMPSTER, this used an electron beam generator to create a cloud of ionization in front of each inlet.  The system was flight tested but was never deployed on operational A-12s or [[SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71s]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackbirds.net/sr71/oxcart/successortou2.html ''The U-2's Intended Successor: Project Oxcart 1956-1968'', approved for release by the CIA in October 1994. Retrieved: 26 January 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Hughes Research Laboratory conducted a research project to study electromagnetic wave propagation in unmagnetized plasma. A series of high voltage spark gaps were used to generate UV radiation, which creates plasma via photoionization in a waveguide. Plasma filled missile radome were tested in an anechoic chamber for attenuation of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregoire|first1=D. J.|last2=Santoro|first2=J.|last3=Schumacher|first3=R.

Despite the apparent technical difficulty of designing a plasma stealth device for combat aircraft, there are claims that a system was offered for export by [[Russia]] in 1999. In January 1999, the Russian [[ITAR-TASS]] news agency published an interview with Doctor [[Anatoliy Koroteyev]], the director of the Keldysh Research Center (FKA Scientific Research Institute for Thermal Processes), who talked about the plasma stealth device developed by his organization. The claim was particularly interesting in light of the solid scientific reputation of Dr. Koroteyev and the Institute for Thermal Processes,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} which is one of the top scientific research organizations in the world in the field of fundamental physics.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolay Novichkov.''Russian scientists created revolutionary technologies for reducing radar visibility of aircraft''. "ITAR-TASS", January 20, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Journal of Electronic Defense]]'' reported that "plasma-cloud-generation technology for stealth applications" developed in Russia reduces an aircraft's RCS by a factor of 100 (20&amp;nbsp;dB). According to this June 2002 article, the Russian plasma stealth device has been tested aboard a [[Sukhoi Su-27]]IB fighter-bomber. The Journal also reported that similar research into applications of plasma for RCS reduction is being carried out by [[Accurate Automation Corporation]] ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]) and [[Old Dominion University]] (Norfolk, Virginia) in the U.S.; and by [[Dassault Aviation]] (Saint-Cloud, France) and [[Thales Group|Thales]] (Paris, France).&lt;ref&gt;Fiszer, Michal and Jerzy Gruszczynski.

== Plasma and its properties ==
{{Main|Plasma (physics)}}

A plasma is a ''[[Plasma (physics)#Potentials|quasineutral]]'' (total [[electrical charge]] is close to zero) mix of [[ion]]s ([[atom]]s which have been ionized, and therefore possess a net positive charge), [[electron]]s, and neutral particles (un-ionized atoms or molecules). Most plasmas are only partially ionized, in fact, the ionization degree of common plasma devices like fluorescent lamp is fairly low ( less than 1%). Almost all the matter in the universe is very low density plasma: solids, liquids and gases are uncommon away from planetary bodies. Plasmas have many technological applications, from fluorescent lighting to plasma processing for semiconductor manufacture.

Plasmas can interact strongly with electromagnetic radiation: this is why plasmas might plausibly be used to modify an object's radar signature. Interaction between plasma and electromagnetic radiation is strongly dependent on the physical properties and parameters of the plasma, most notably the electron temperature and plasma density.

*'''Characteristic electron plasma frequency''', the frequency with which electrons oscillate ([[plasma oscillation]]): 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{pe} = (4\pi n_ee^2/m_e)^{1/2} = 5.64 \times 10^4 n_e^{1/2} \mbox{rad/s} = 9000 \times n_e^{1/2} \mbox{Hz} &lt;/math&gt;

Plasmas can have a wide range of values in both temperature and density; plasma temperatures range from close to absolute zero and to well beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[kelvin]]s (for comparison, tungsten melts at 3700 kelvins), and plasma may contain less than one particle per cubic metre, or be denser than lead. Electron temperature is usually expressed as electronvolt (eV), and 1 eV is equivalent to 11,604 K. Common plasmas temperature and density in fluorescent light tubes and semiconductor manufacturing processes are around several eV and 10&lt;sup&gt;9-12&lt;/sup&gt;per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For a wide range of parameters and frequencies, plasma is electrically conductive, and its response to low-frequency electromagnetic waves is similar to that of a metal: a plasma simply reflects incident low-frequency radiation. Low-frequency means it is lower than the characteristic electron [[Plasma parameters|plasma frequency]]. The use of plasmas to control the reflected electromagnetic radiation from an object (Plasma stealth) is feasible at suitable frequency where the conductivity of the plasma allows it to interact strongly with the incoming radio wave, and the wave can either be absorbed and converted into thermal energy, or reflected, or transmitted depending on the relationship between the radio wave frequency and the characteristic plasma frequency. If the frequency of the radio wave is lower than the plasma frequency, it is reflected. if it is higher, it transmit. If these two are equal, then resonance occurs. There are also another mechanism where reflection can be reduced. If the electromagnetic wave passes through the plasma, and is reflected by the metal, and the reflected wave and incoming wave are roughly equal in power, then they may form two phasors. When these two phasors are of opposite phase they can cancel each other out. In order to obtain substantial attenuation of radar signal, the plasma slab needs adequate thickness and density.&lt;ref name=Chung1 /&gt;

Plasmas support a wide range of waves, but for unmagnetised plasmas, the most relevant are the [[Langmuir wave]]s, corresponding to a dynamic compression of the electrons. For magnetised plasmas, many different wave modes can be excited which might interact with radiation at radar frequencies.

== Plasmas on aerodynamic surfaces ==

Plasma layers around aircraft have been considered for purposes other than stealth. There are many research papers on the use of plasma to reduce aerodynamic [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. In particular, [[electrohydrodynamic]] coupling can be used to accelerate air flow near an aerodynamic surface. One paper&lt;ref name="drag"&gt;{{cite journal

== Absorption of EM radiation ==

When [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] waves, such as radar signals, propagate into a conductive plasma, ions and electrons are displaced as a result of the time varying electric and magnetic fields. The wave field gives energy to the particles. The particles generally return some fraction of the energy they have gained to the wave, but some energy may be permanently absorbed as heat by processes like scattering or resonant acceleration, or transferred into other wave types by [[mode conversion]] or nonlinear effects. A plasma can, at least in principle, absorb all the energy in an incoming wave, and this is the key to plasma stealth. However, plasma stealth implies a substantial reduction of an aircraft's [[Radar cross-section|RCS]], making it more difficult (but not necessarily impossible) to detect. The mere fact of detection of an aircraft by a radar does not guarantee an accurate targeting solution needed to intercept the aircraft or to engage it with missiles. A reduction in RCS also results in a proportional reduction in detection range, allowing an aircraft to get closer to the radar before being detected.

The central issue here is frequency of the incoming signal. A plasma will simply reflect radio waves below a certain frequency (characteristic electron plasma frequency). This is the basic principle of short wave radios and long-range communications, because low-frequency radio signals bounce between the Earth and the ionosphere and may therefore travel long distances. Early-warning over-the-horizon radars utilize such low-frequency radio waves (typically lower than 50&amp;nbsp;MHz). Most military airborne and air defense radars, however, operate in VHF, UHF, and microwave band, which have frequencies higher than the characteristic plasma frequency of ionosphere, therefore microwave can penetrate the ionosphere and communication between the ground and communication satellites demonstrates is possible. (''Some'' frequencies can penetrate the ionosphere).

Plasma surrounding an aircraft might be able to absorb incoming radiation, and therefore reduces signal reflection from the metal parts of the aircraft: the aircraft would then be effectively invisible to radar at long range due to weak signals received.&lt;ref name=Chung1&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shen Shou Max Chung|editor1-last=Wang|editor1-first=Wen-Qin|title=Radar Systems: Technology, Principles and Applications|date=2013|publisher=NOVA Publishers|location=Hauppauge, NY|isbn=978-1-62417-884-9|pages=1–44|edition=1|chapter-url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=42399|chapter=Chapter 1: Manipulation of Radar Cross Sections with Plasma|doi=10.13140/2.1.4674.4327|url=http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/2.1.4674.4327}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plasma might also be used to modify the reflected waves to confuse the opponent's radar system: for example, frequency-shifting the reflected radiation would frustrate Doppler filtering and might make the reflected radiation more difficult to distinguish from noise.

Control of plasma properties like density and temperature is important for a functioning plasma stealth device, and it may be necessary to dynamically adjust the plasma density, temperature, or combinations, or the magnetic field, in order to effectively defeat different types of radar systems. The great advantage Plasma Stealth possesses over traditional radio frequency stealth techniques like shape morphing into [[LO geometry]]{{clarify|what is this?|date=January 2018}} and use of [[radar-absorbent material]]s is that plasma is tunable and wideband. When faced with frequency hopping radar, it is possible, at least in principle, to change the plasma temperature and density to deal with the situation. The greatest challenge is to generate a large area or volume of plasma with good energy efficiency.

Plasma stealth technology also faces various technical problems. For example, the plasma itself emits EM radiation, although it is usually weak and noise-like in spectrum. Also, it takes some time for plasma to be re-absorbed by the atmosphere and a trail of ionized air would be created behind the moving aircraft, but at present there is no method to detect this kind of plasma trail at long distance. Thirdly, plasmas (like glow discharges or fluorescent lights) tend to emit a visible glow: this is not compatible with overall low observability concept. However, present optical detection devices like FLIR has a shorter range than radar, so Plasma Stealth still has an operational range space. Last but not least, it is extremely difficult to produce a radar-absorbent plasma around an entire aircraft traveling at high speed, the electrical power needed is tremendous. However, a substantial reduction of an aircraft's RCS may be still be achieved by generating radar-absorbent plasma around the most reflective surfaces of the aircraft, such as the turbojet engine fan blades, engine air intakes, vertical stabilizers, and airborne radar antenna.

There have been several computational studies on plasma-based radar cross section reduction technique using three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations. Chaudhury et al. studied the electromagnetic wave attenuation of an Epstein profile plasma using this method.&lt;ref name="3drcs"&gt;{{cite journal

== Theoretical work with Sputnik ==

Due to the obvious military applications of the subject, there are few readily available experimental studies of plasma's effect on the radar cross section (RCS) of aircraft, but plasma interaction with microwaves is a well explored area of general plasma physics. Standard plasma physics reference texts are a good starting point and usually spend some time discussing wave propagation in plasmas.
&lt;!-- There is a whole research field dedicated to plasma-microwave interactions --&gt;

One of the most interesting articles related to the effect of plasma on the RCS of aircraft was published in 1963 by the [[IEEE]]. The article is entitled "''Radar cross sections of dielectric or plasma coated conducting spheres and circular cylinders''" (IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, September 1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;558&amp;ndash;569). Six years earlier, in 1957, the Soviets had launched the first artificial satellite. While trying to track [[Sputnik]] it was noticed that its electromagnetic scattering properties were different from what was expected for a conductive sphere. This was due to the satellite's traveling inside of a plasma shell: the [[ionosphere]].

The Sputnik's simple shape serves as an ideal illustration of plasma's effect on the RCS of an aircraft. Naturally, an aircraft would have a far more elaborate shape and be made of a greater variety of materials, but the basic effect should remain the same. In the case of the Sputnik flying through the [[ionosphere]] at high velocity and surrounded by a naturally occurring plasma shell, there are two separate radar reflections: the first from the conductive surface of the satellite, and the second from the dielectric plasma shell.

The authors of the paper found that a dielectric (plasma) shell may either decrease or increase the echo area of the object. If either one of the two reflections is considerably greater, then the weaker reflection will not contribute much to the overall effect. The authors also stated that the EM signal that penetrates the plasma shell and reflects off the object's surface will drop in intensity while traveling through plasma, as was explained in the prior section.

The most interesting effect is observed when the two reflections are of the same order of magnitude. In this situation the two components (the two reflections) will be added as [[phasor]]s and the resulting field will determine the overall RCS. When these two components are out of phase relative to each other, cancellation occurs. This means that under such circumstances the RCS becomes null and the object is completely invisible to the radar.

It is immediately apparent that performing similar numeric approximations for the complex shape of an aircraft would be difficult. This would require a large body of experimental data for the specific airframe, properties of plasma, aerodynamic aspects, incident radiation, etc. In contrast, the original computations discussed in this paper were done by a handful of people on an [[IBM 704]] computer made in 1956, and at the time, this was a novel subject with very little research background. So much has changed in science and engineering since 1963, that differences between a metal sphere and a modern combat jet pale in comparison.

A simple application of plasma stealth is the use of plasma as an antenna: metal antenna masts often have large radar cross sections, but a hollow glass tube filled with low pressure plasma can also be used as an antenna, and is entirely transparent to radar when not in use.

'''Pyroligneous acid''', also called '''wood vinegar''' or '''wood acid''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary]] (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; is a dark liquid produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of wood and other plant materials.

== Composition ==
The principal components of pyroligneous acid are [[acetic acid]], [[acetone]] and [[methanol]]. It was once used as a commercial source for acetic acid. In addition, the vinegar often contains 80-90% water along with some 200 [[organic compound]]s.

Pyroligneous acid (acetum lignorum) was investigated by German chemist [[Johann Rudolph Glauber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Fielding H. Garrison]] | title=History of Medicine | edition=3rd | publisher=W. B. Saunders | year=1921 | page=286 | url=https://archive.org/details/3edintroductiont00garruoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acid was eaten as a substitute for vinegar. It was also used topically for treating wounds, ulcers and other ailments. A [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] can be made by [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralizing]] the acid with a [[lye]] made from the ashes of the burnt wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Johann Rudolph Glauber]] | title=Furni Novi Philosophici | volume=1 | year=1651 | publisher=Johann Jansson | pages=47–49 | url=https://archive.org/details/furninoviphiloso00glau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States Civil War]] it became increasingly difficult for the [[Confederate States of America]] to obtain much needed salt. Curing meat and fish with pyroligneous acid was attempted by cooks to compensate for this deficiency. Unfortunately for the [[Confederate States Army]] it was not a comparable method of food preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Salt: A World History | author=[[Mark Kurlansky]] | year=2002 | publisher=Penguin Books | isbn=0-14-200161-9 | pages = 267–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, pyroligneous acid was used to prepare an impure [[aluminium sulfacetate]] [[mordant]] for use with cotton, but the resulting mixture imparted a burnt odor to the cotton, and Ganswindt recommended its use be abandoned in favour of purer preparations in 1899.&lt;ref name = Ganswindt&gt;{{cite book|last = Ganswindt|first = Albert|title = Handbuch der Färberei und der damit verwandten vorbereitenden und vollendenden Gewerbe|year = 1889|language = German|url = http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/view/ganswindt_faerberei_1889?p=296|page = 270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, pyroligneous acid was first marketed under the brand Wright's Liquid Smoke,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unusual Stories of Unusual Men: Ernest H. Wright - Classification: "Condensed Smoke"|publisher=The Rotarian|year=1923|isbn=|location=|pages=209–10, 240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[liquid smoke]] product intended to impart the flavor and some of the preservative effects of [[Smoked meat|wood smoking]] to meats and vegetables at a time when fear about the carcinogenic effects of wood smoking was becoming prevalent.&lt;ref name="Kraig2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Kraig|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA278|date=31 January 2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-973496-2|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pyrolytic graphite.jpg|thumb|250px|Sheets of pyrolytic carbon]]
'''Pyrolytic carbon''' is a material similar to [[graphite]], but with some [[covalent bond]]ing between its [[graphene]] sheets as a result of imperfections in its production.

Pyrolytic carbon is man-made and is not thought to be found in nature.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon. In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Uzmrq7LO7loC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;ots=zcTbDBKgU-&amp;dq=discovery%20of%20pyrolytic&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Biomaterials science: an introduction to materials in medicine]''. Academic Press. p. 171-180. {{ISBN|0-12-582463-7}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally it is produced by heating a [[hydrocarbon]] nearly to its [[decomposition temperature]], and permitting the graphite to [[crystal]]lise ([[pyrolysis]]).  One method is to heat [[synthetic fiber]]s in a [[vacuum]].  Another method is to place seeds on a plate in the very hot gas to collect the graphite coating.{{clarification needed|reason=which gas?|date=February 2017}}  It is used in high temperature applications such as missile [[nose cone]]s, rocket motors, heat shields, laboratory furnaces, in [[graphite-reinforced plastic]], and in biomedical [[prosthesis|prostheses]].

==Physical properties==
Pyrolytic carbon samples usually have a single [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] plane, similar to [[mica]], because the graphene sheets crystallize in a planar order, as opposed to graphite, which forms microscopic randomly oriented zones. Because of this, pyrolytic carbon exhibits several unusual [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] properties. It is more [[thermal conductivity|thermally conductive]] along the cleavage plane than graphite, making it one of the best planar thermal conductors available.

Pyrolitic graphite forms [[mosaic crystal]]s with controlled mosaicities up to a few degrees.

It is also more [[diamagnetic]] ([[magnetic susceptibility|χ]] = −4×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) against the cleavage plane, exhibiting the greatest diamagnetism (by weight) of any room-temperature diamagnet. In comparison, pyrolitic graphite has a [[relative permeability]] of 0.9996, whereas [[bismuth]] has a relative permeability of 0.9998 ([[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Values for some common materials|table]]).

== Magnetic levitation ==
[[Image:Diamagnetic graphite levitation.jpg|thumb|Pyrolytic carbon levitating over permanent magnets]]
Few materials can be made to [[magnetic levitation|magnetically levitate]] stably above the magnetic field from a permanent magnet. Although magnetic repulsion is obviously and easily achieved between any two magnets, the shape of the field causes the upper magnet to push off sideways, rather than remaining supported, rendering stable levitation impossible for magnetic objects (see [[Earnshaw's theorem]]). Strongly diamagnetic materials, however, can levitate above powerful magnets.

With the easy availability of [[rare-earth permanent magnet]]s in recent years, the strong diamagnetism of pyrolytic carbon makes it a convenient demonstration material for this effect.

In 2012, a research group in Japan demonstrated that pyrolytic carbon can respond to laser light or sufficiently powerful natural sunlight by spinning or moving in the direction of the field gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon's [[magnetic susceptibility]] weakens upon sufficient illumination, leading to an unbalanced [[magnetization]] of the material and movement when using a specific geometry.

==Applications==
* It is used nonreinforced for [[missile]] [[nose cone]]s and [[ablation|ablative]] (boiloff-cooled) [[rocket motor]]s.
* In fiber form, it is used to reinforce plastics and metals (see [[Carbon fiber]] and [[Graphite-reinforced plastic]]).
* [[Pebble-bed reactor|Pebble-bed]] [[nuclear reactor]]s use a coating of pyrolytic carbon as a [[neutron moderator]] for the individual pebbles.
* Used to coat graphite cuvettes (tubes) in [[graphite furnace atomic absorption]] furnaces to decrease heat stress, thus increasing cuvette lifetimes.
* Pyrolytic carbon is used for several applications in electronic thermal management: thermal-interface material, heat spreaders (sheets) and [[heat sink]]s (fins).
* It is occasionally used to make [[tobacco pipe]]s.
* It is used to fabricate grid structures in some high-power [[vacuum tubes]].
* It is used as a [[monochromator]] for neutron and X-ray scattering studies.
* Prosthetic heart valves.
* Radial head prosthesis.
* It is also used in automotive industries where a desired amount of friction is required between two components
* [[Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite]] (HOPG) is used as the dispersive element in HOPG spectrometers, which are used for X-ray spectrometry.

===Biomedical applications===
Because blood clots do not easily form on it, it is often advisable to line a blood-contacting [[prosthesis]] with this material in order to reduce the risk of [[thrombosis]].  For example, it finds use in [[artificial heart]]s and [[artificial heart valve]]s.  [[Blood vessel]] [[stent]]s, by contrast, are often lined with a polymer that has [[heparin]] as a pendant group, relying on drug action to prevent clotting.  This is at least partly because of pyrolytic carbon's [[brittle]]ness and the large amount of [[plasticity (physics)|permanent deformation]], which a stent undergoes during expansion.

Pyrolytic carbon is also in medical use to coat anatomically correct orthopaedic implants, a.k.a. [[replacement joint]]s. In this application it is currently marketed under the name "PyroCarbon". These implants have been approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for use in the hand for metacarpophalangeal (knuckle) replacements. They are produced by two companies: Tornier (BioProfile) and Ascension Orthopedics.&lt;ref name="Cook1999"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stephen D. |last1=Cook |first2=Robert D. |last2=Beckenbaugh |first3=Jacqueline |last3=Redondo |first4=Laura S. |last4=Popich |first5=Jerome J. |last5=Klawitter |first6=Ronald L. |last6=Linscheid |title=Long-Term Follow-up of Pyrolytic Carbon Metacarpophalangeal Implants |pmid=10360692 |year=1999 |pages=635–48 |issue=5 |volume=81 |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/content/full/81/5/635}}&lt;/ref&gt; (On September 23, 2011, Integra LifeSciences acquired Ascension Orthopedics.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6408">'''Renewable energy in [[Bhutan]]''' is the use of [[renewable energy]] for [[electricity generation]] in [[Bhutan]]. The [[renewable energy]] sources include [[hydropower]].&lt;ref name="sari-energy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sari-energy.org/PageFiles/What_We_Do/activities/renewable_spain_oct_2009/Presentations/Bhutan_Renewable_Energy.pdf|date=13 October 2009|title=Overview of Renewable Energy Projects|author=Pem Dorjee &amp; Ugen|accessdate=2014-08-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224122842/http://www.sari-energy.org/PageFiles/What_We_Do/activities/renewable_spain_oct_2009/Presentations/Bhutan_Renewable_Energy.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bhutan has seen great successes with developing its large hydropower projects through technical and financial assistance from India, little or no private sector participation with other forms of renewable energy has been evident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhutanobserver.bt/8306-bo-news-about-alternative_renewable_energy__expensive_in_bhutan.aspx  Alternative renewable energy expensive in Bhutan, Gopal S. Mongar, March 29, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  In part because of the [[Sustainable development goals]], Bhutan has established a minimum goal of 20 megawatts of renewable energy product by 2025, through a mix of renewable energy technologies.  Bhutan's Department of Renewable Energy helped formulate and launch its Alternative Renewable Energy Policy in order to promote in Bhutan a mix of clean Renewable Energy (RE) technologies - solar, wind, bio-mass, geo-thermal, pico/micro/mini/small hydropower plants up to 25 MW in size and waste-to-energy technologies.

== History ==
Bhutan's commitment to renewable energy started in 1980. Six years later, the first hydropower plant opened in Chukha, followed by a plant in Kurichhu in 2001. Soon after that two more plants opened in Basochhu in 2005 and Tala in 2009. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scidev.net/global/energy/data-visualisation/bhutan-quest-for-alternative-energy.html|title=Bhutan’s quest for alternative energy|last=SciDev.Net|work=SciDev.Net|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At COP 15 in 2009 ([[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]), Bhutan made its first promise to remain completely carbon neutral &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1570-6664_iyb_sim_person_53126|title=Tobgay, Tshering|website=International Year Book and Statesmen's Who's Who|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;; they reaffirmed this promise at COP 21 in 2015 ([[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hydroelectric power ==
Bhutan's first step into renewable energy was hydroelectric power. They first started by opening the first hydroelectric power plant in Chukha in 1986. They now have three more plants open: Kurichhu (2001), Basochhu (2005), and Tala (2009). Currently approximately 70% or 4.4 million tons of the hydroelectric power Bhutan produces is exported to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biogasworld.com/news/bhutan-a-proactive-sustainability-and-renewable-energy-leader/|title=Bhutan: a proactive sustainability and renewable energy leader • BiogasWorld|date=2016-02-25|work=BiogasWorld|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to expand the types of renewable energy used in Bhutan, hydroelectric power is still the leading source of clean energy in the nation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Other forms of renewable energy ==
[[File:Bhutan - 50m Wind Power.png|thumb]]
After the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], Bhutan has been moving towards other forms of renewable energy so as to decrease their reliance on hydroelectric power during winter and dry months.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thethirdpole.net/en/2016/02/16/bhutan-diversifies-its-renewables-with-wind-turbines/|title=Bhutan Diversifies its Renewables with Wind Turbines|last=Walker|first=Beth|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan has increased their focus specifically in the areas of: windmills, biogas plants, solar power, and smaller hydropower plants. The initial plan was to install 24 wind turbines, however installation was halted after only two turbines due to citizens raising concerns about possible noise pollution.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Since 2015, Bhutan has installed a 30 MW solar energy plant in Shingkhar in the Bumthang district; this plant was the first of its kind.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There have also been approximately 13,500 stoves and 2,800 biogas plants installed throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In an effort to further spread the use of renewable energy and to decrease the country's carbon emissions, Bhutan also provides free electricity to rural farmers; this reduces the amount of fires/ gas they use to do their farm work. The government also subsidizes LED light bulbs and electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Currently Bhutan's clean energy exports offset approximately 6 million tons of carbon dioxide.

== Carbon neutrality ==
In a 2016 TED Talk, the Bhutanese Prime Minister [[Tshering Tobgay]] spoke about how Bhutan is the only country able to claim the title of "carbon negative". This means that though the nation produces about 2.2 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , the forests offset more than 4 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They are able to do this because over 72% of their country is under the cover of their forests, a constitutional mandate of the nation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Goals and commitments ==
At the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], Bhutan made their first promise to remain carbon neutral; they again made this promise at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]. As of 2016, the clean energy Bhutan exported offset roughly 6 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; it is their goal to export enough clean energy to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2020. In his 2016 TED Talk, Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay stated that if Bhutan was able to harness even half of the potential hydroelectric power, they would be able to offset roughly 50 million tons of carbon dioxide, more than New York City produces in one year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Rubidium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Rb''' and [[atomic number]] 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white [[metal]]lic element of the [[alkali metal]] group, with a [[standard atomic weight]] of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid [[oxidation]] in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two [[isotope]]s: 72% is the stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Rb; 28% is the slightly [[radioactive]] &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb, with a [[half-life]] of 49&amp;nbsp;billion years—more than three times longer than the estimated [[age of the universe]].

German chemists [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered rubidium in 1861 by the newly developed technique, [[Atomic emission spectroscopy#Flame emission spectroscopy|flame spectroscopy]].

Rubidium's compounds have various chemical and electronic applications. Rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range, making it a frequent target for [[laser]] manipulation of [[atom]]s.

Rubidium is not a known nutrient for any [[organism|living organisms]]. However, rubidium [[ion]]s have the same charge as potassium ions, and are actively taken up and treated by [[animal cell]]s in similar ways.

==Characteristics==
[[File:RbH.JPG|thumb|left|Partially molten rubidium metal in an ampoule]]
Rubidium is a very soft, [[ductility|ductile]], silvery-white metal.&lt;ref name="Ohly"/&gt; It is the second most [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] of the stable alkali metals and melts at a temperature of {{convert|39.3|°C|°F}}. Like other alkali metals, rubidium metal reacts violently with water. As with potassium (which is slightly less reactive) and caesium (which is slightly more reactive), this reaction is usually vigorous enough to ignite the [[hydrogen]] gas it produces. Rubidium has also been reported to ignite spontaneously in air.&lt;ref name="Ohly"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Rubidium | title = Analysis, detection and commercial value of the rare metals | last = Ohly | first = Julius | publisher = Mining Science Pub. Co. | date = 1910 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=dGUuAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]] with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[alloy]]s with [[gold]], [[iron]], [[caesium]], [[sodium]], and [[potassium]], but not [[lithium]] (even though rubidium and lithium are in the same group).&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book |publisher = Walter de Gruyter |date = 1985 |edition = 91–100 |pages = 953–955 |isbn = 3-11-007511-3 |title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie |first1 = Arnold F. |last1 = Holleman |last2 = Wiberg |first2 = Egon |last3 =Wiberg |first3 = Nils |chapter = Vergleichende Übersicht über die Gruppe der Alkalimetalle| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rb&amp;Cs crystals.jpg|left|thumb|Rubidium crystals (silvery) compared to [[caesium]] crystals (golden)]]

[[Rubidium chloride]] (RbCl) is probably the most used rubidium compound: among several other chlorides, it is used to induce living cells to take up [[DNA]]; it is also used as a biomarker, because in nature, it is found only in small quantities in living organisms and when present, replaces potassium. Other common rubidium compounds are the corrosive [[rubidium hydroxide]] (RbOH), the starting material for most rubidium-based chemical processes; [[rubidium carbonate]] (Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), used in some optical glasses, and rubidium copper sulfate, Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Rubidium forms a number of [[Rubidium oxide|oxides]] when exposed to air, including rubidium monoxide (Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), Rb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O, and Rb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; rubidium in excess oxygen gives the [[superoxide]] RbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Rubidium forms salts with halides, producing [[rubidium fluoride]], [[rubidium chloride]], [[rubidium bromide]], and [[rubidium iodide]].

Because rubidium substitutes for [[potassium]] in the crystallization of magma, the enrichment is far less effective than that of caesium. Zone pegmatite ore bodies containing mineable quantities of caesium as [[pollucite]] or the lithium minerals [[lepidolite]] are also a source for rubidium as a by-product.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

Two notable sources of rubidium are the rich deposits of [[pollucite]] at [[Bernic Lake]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, and the [[rubicline]] ((Rb,K)AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) found as impurities in pollucite on the Italian island of [[Elba]], with a rubidium content of 17.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://ammin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/83/11-12_Part_1/1335| title = Rubicline, a new feldspar from San Piero in Campo, Elba, Italy |journal = American Mineralogist |volume = 83 |issue = 11–12 Part 1 |pages = 1335–1339 |last1 = Teertstra |first1 = David K. |first2 = Petr |last2 = Cerny |first3 = Frank C. |last3 = Hawthorne |first4 = Julie |last4 = Pier |first5 = Lu-Min |last5 = Wang |first6 = Rodney C. |last6 =Ewing |date = 1998 |authorlink2 = Petr Cerny|bibcode = 1998AmMin..83.1335T |doi = 10.2138/am-1998-11-1223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of those deposits are also sources of caesium.

==Production==
Although rubidium is more abundant in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 [[tonne]]s per year.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]] of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum.

For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and a small amount of caesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Cesium and Rubidium Hit Market |journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume = 37 |issue = 22 |pages = 50 |date = 1959 |doi = 10.1021/cen-v037n022.p050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the largest producers of caesium, such as the [[Tanco Mine]], Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kirchhoff Bunsen Roscoe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gustav Kirchhoff]] (left) and [[Robert Bunsen]] (center) discovered rubidium by spectroscopy. ''([[Henry Enfield Roscoe]] is on the right side.)''| alt= Three middle-aged men, with the one in the middle sitting down. All wear long jackets, and the shorter man on the left has a beard.]]
Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral [[lepidolite]] through [[spectroscope|spectroscopy]]. Because of the bright red lines in its [[emission spectrum]], they chose a name derived from the [[Latin]] word ''rubidus'', meaning "deep red".&lt;ref name="BuKi1861"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen |pages = 337–381 |first1 = G. |last1 = Kirchhoff |first2 = R. |last2 = Bunsen |authorlink1 = Gustav Kirchhoff |authorlink2 = Robert Bunsen |doi = 10.1002/andp.18611890702 |journal = [[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] |volume = 189 |issue = 7 |date = 1861 |bibcode=1861AnP...189..337K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The discovery of the elements.

Rubidium is a minor component in lepidolite. Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150&amp;nbsp;kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with [[chloroplatinic acid]], but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble rubidium [[hexachloroplatinate]] (Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) could be obtained by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]]. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with [[hydrogen]], the process yielded 0.51&amp;nbsp;grams of [[rubidium chloride]] for further studies.{{clarify|150kg x 0.24% = 360g of Rb2O = 460g of RbCl... did we lose 3 zeroes somewhere? Start with 150grams instead of 150kg?|date=February 2016}} Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with {{Convert|44000|litre|USgal}} of mineral water, which yielded 7.3&amp;nbsp;grams of [[caesium chloride]] and 9.2&amp;nbsp;grams of [[rubidium chloride]].&lt;ref name="BuKi1861"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"/&gt; Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered by spectroscopy, just one year after the invention of the [[spectroscope]] by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/print/rubidium.html |title=C&amp;EN: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Cesium |publisher=American Chemical Society |accessdate=2010-02-25 |first=Stephen K. |last = Ritter |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two scientists used the rubidium chloride to estimate that the [[atomic weight]] of the new element was 85.36 (the currently accepted value is 85.47).&lt;ref name="BuKi1861"/&gt; They tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which "neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance." They presumed it was a [[Non-stoichiometric compound|subchloride]] ({{chem|Rb|2|Cl}}); however, the product was probably a [[colloid]]al mixture of the metal and rubidium chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zsigmondy |first=Richard |title=Colloids and the Ultra Microscope |publisher=Read books |date=2007 |isbn=978-1-4067-5938-9 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac2mGhqjgUkC&amp;pg=PAPA69 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium, Bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate. Although the distilled rubidium was [[pyrophoric]], they were able to determine the density and the melting point. The quality of this research in the 1860s can be appraised by the fact that their determined density differs less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!--1.52--&gt; and the melting point by less than 1&amp;nbsp;°C &lt;!--38.5&amp;nbsp;°C--&gt; from the presently accepted values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bunsen |first1=R. |title=Ueber die Darstellung und die Eigenschaften des Rubidiums |journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie |volume = 125 |issue = 3 |pages = 367 |date = 1863 |doi = 10.1002/jlac.18631250314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in 1908, but that was before the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low level of activity (half-life greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years) made interpretation complicated. The now proven decay of &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb to stable &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Sr through [[beta decay]] was still under discussion in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1080/14786441008520248 | journal = Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 7| volume = 43 | issue = 345 | date = 1952 | first = G.

Other potential or current uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines, as a [[getter]] in [[vacuum tube]]s, and as a [[photocell]] component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GEVt3kpFw64C&amp;pg=PA274 |page = 274 |title = Introduction To Nuclear And Particle Physics |isbn = 978-81-203-3610-0 |author1 = Mittal |date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass, in the production of [[superoxide]] by burning in [[oxygen]], in the study of [[potassium]] [[ion channel]]s in biology, and as the vapor in atomic [[magnetometer]]s.&lt;ref name="MAG"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Parametric modulation of an atomic magnetometer |journal=Applied Physics Letters| volume=89| date=2006 |issue=13 |pages=134105 |doi=10.1063/1.2357553 |last1=Li |first1=Zhimin |last2=Wakai |first2=Ronald T. |last3=Walker |first3=Thad G. |bibcode = 2006ApPhL..89m4105L |pmc=3431608 |pmid=22942436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free [[SERF|(SERF) magnetometers]].&lt;ref name="MAG" /&gt;

[[Rubidium-82]] is used for [[positron emission tomography]]. Rubidium is very similar to potassium and tissue with high potassium content will also accumulate the radioactive rubidium. One of the main uses is [[myocardial perfusion imaging]]. As a result of changes in the [[blood–brain barrier]] in brain tumors, rubidium collects more in brain tumors than normal brain tissue, allowing the use of radioisotope rubidium-82 in [[nuclear medicine]] to locate and image brain tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Yen |first1 = C.

Rubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry [[mineral oil]] or sealed in glass ampoules in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms [[peroxide]]s on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic [[potassium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vKBqqiCTB7MC&amp;pg=PA215 |page = 215 |chapter = Rubidium |title = Chemical risk analysis: a practical handbook |isbn = 978-1-903996-65-2 |author1 = Martel, Bernard |author2 = Cassidy, Keith |date = 2004-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubidium, like sodium and potassium, almost always has +1 [[oxidation state]] when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions as if they were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's [[intracellular fluid]] (i.e., inside cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Relman |first1 = A.

SN Power AS invests in clean, renewable energy on a commercial basis in emerging markets. The company has operations in Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America and the focus is to acquire, develop, construct and operate hydropower assets. SN Power has several running plants in the [[Philippines]], [[Zambia]], [[Laos]] and [[Panama]], and the company consist of a multinational team of people employed globally in its operations and projects. In addition to operating assets, SN Power has office in [[Netherlands]] and is Head-quartered in Oslo [[Norway]]. 

The company is fully owned by [[Norfund]], the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries. 

The company was established in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.statkraft.com/about-statkraft/historyweb/#2000-2005/2002|website = www.statkraft.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Norfund, the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Statkraft created the international power company Statkraft Norfund Power Invest (in short called SN Power). The company was formed to promote economic growth and sustainable development in new and emerging markets. In May 2003, SN Power made its first investment, with the acquisition of 30 per cent of Nividhu in Sri Lanka, a venture partner that operates the power plants Assupiniella and Belihuloya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snpower.com/history/category271.html The history of SN Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

SN Power AS was reestablished as a new company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kunngjøringer - Brønnøysundregistrene|url = http://w2.brreg.no/kunngjoring/hent_alle.jsp?kid=20150000217640&amp;sokeverdi=912489108&amp;spraak=nb|website = w2.brreg.no|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013 after its parent company [[Statkraft]] and [[Norfund]] decided to make changes to their share portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statkraft and Norfund have completed the restructuring of SN Power  {{!}} Statkraft|url = http://www.statkraft.com/IR/stock-exchange-notice/2014/Statkraft-and-Norfund-have-completed-the-restructuring-of-SN-Power-/|website = www.statkraft.com|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On 27th September 2017 Statkraft and Norfund closed an agreement to swap shares in their jointly owned international hydropower assets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.norfund.no/nyhetsarkiv/statkraft-and-norfund-swapping-shares-in-international-hydropower-article12847-1011.html Statkraft and Norfund swapping shares in international hydropower]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The agreement implies that Statkraft sells all its shares in SN Power to Norfund, while Norfund sells all its shares in Statkraft IH Invest AS (SKIHI) to Statkraft. 
Up until that date, Statkraft and Norfund owned 50 percent each in SN Power, which owns hydropower plants in Panama, Laos, Philippines and Zambia. At the same time Statkraft has owned 81.9% and Norfund 18.1% of the shares in SKIHI, the company owning mainly hydropower assets in Peru, Brazil, Chile, India and Nepal.

Through these transactions, Norfund increases its presence in Africa and Southeast Asia.

A '''satellite tornado''' is a [[tornado]] that rotates around a larger, primary tornado and interacts with the same [[mesocyclone]]. Satellite tornadoes occur apart from the primary tornado and are not considered [[Multiple vortex tornado|subvortices]]; the primary tornado and satellite tornadoes are considered to be separate tornadoes. The cause of satellite tornadoes is not known. Such tornadoes are more often [[Anticyclonic tornado|anticyclonic]] than are typical tornadoes and these pairs may be referred to as tornado couplets.&lt;ref name="Storm Talk"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Tim |authorlink=Timothy P. Marshall |others=David Hoadley (illust.) |title=Storm Talk |year=1995 |location=Texas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite tornadoes most commonly form in association with very large and intense tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Edwards |first = Roger |title=Satellite tornado |publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]] |date=2006-04-04 |url=http://www.spc.ncep.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#satellite_tornado1 |work=The Online Tornado FAQ |accessdate=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite tornadoes are relatively uncommon. When a satellite tornado does occur there is often more than one orbiting satellite spawned during the life cycle of the tornado or with successive primary tornadoes spawned by the parent [[supercell]] (a process known as [[Tornadogenesis|cyclic tornadogenesis]] and leading to a [[tornado family]]). On [[tornado outbreak]] days, if satellite tornadoes occur with one supercell, there is an elevated probability of their occurrence with other supercells.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Satellite tornadoes may merge into their companion tornado although often the appearance of this occurring is an illusion caused when an orbiting tornado revolves around the backside of a primary tornado obscuring view of the satellite.&lt;ref name="stormeyes"&gt;{{cite web |last = Edwards |first = Roger |title = Satellite Tornado |publisher = StormEyes |year = 2001 |url = http://www.stormeyes.org/tornado/faq/stlt_tor.html |accessdate = 2014-03-22 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[March 1990 Central United States tornado outbreak]], one member of a tornado family (rated [[Fujita Scale|F5]]) constricted and became a satellite tornado of the next tornado of the family before merging into the new primary tornado which soon also intensified to F5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Davies |first=Jonathan M. |authorlink=Jonathan M.

Such examples include near Beloit, Kansas on 15 May 1990 and during [[VORTEX projects|Project VORTEX]] near Allison, Texas on 8 June 1995, among other events.&lt;ref name="stormeyes"/&gt;

'''''Submission''''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''Underkastelsen''''') is a 2010 Swedish [[documentary film]] directed by [[Stefan Jarl]] and narrated by [[Stellan Skarsgård]]. In the film, director Jarl has his blood drawn for a series of tests to show how much of a "chemical burden" is in his body.

Jarl convinces actress [[Eva Röse]], who is pregnant, to have the blood tests also. The film goes on to describe the issue of chemicals and plastics invented since [[World War II]] and how they affect the health of people around the world.

The film had its North American premiere at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]] on 15 October 2010.

'''Tantite''' is a rare [[tantalum]] [[oxide]] mineral with formula: [[tantalum|Ta]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Tantite forms transparent microscopic colorless [[triclinic]] - pedial crystals with an adamantine luster. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 7 and a high [[specific gravity]] of 8.45. Chemical analyses show minor inclusion (1.3%) of [[niobium]] oxide.

It was first described in 1983 for an occurrence in a [[pegmatite]] in the [[Kola peninsula]], [[Russia]]. It has also been reported from a pegmatite complex in [[Florence County, Wisconsin]]. Associated mineral species include [[elbaite]], [[lepidolite]], [[spodumene]], [[columbite-tantalite]], [[wodginite]], and [[microlite]].

'''Tudor''' is a lead-acid battery brand founded by [[Henri Tudor]] in 1890 and is now owned by [[Exide]] Technologies. 

== History ==
[[File:Portrait Henri Tudor.jpg|thumb|Henri Tudor]]

=== The start ===
[[Henri Tudor]] from [[Rosport]] created in 1890 what will become later the Tudor batteries brand: the ''Société anonyme Franco-Belge pour la fabrication de l’accumulateur Tudor'' (Franco-Belgian anonymous society for the manufacture of the Tudor Accumulator).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The batterie story|last=|first=|publisher=Tudor Accumulator|year=1980–1990|isbn=|location=Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time, more than 1200 Tudor batteries were in service in Belgium and abroad including Germany, France, Austria, Spain, Egypt, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Swiss, Hungary, Nederland, Italy, Poland and Argentina. The emblem was the name of the brand with the head of a [[wyvern]] [[griffon]] from Wales. Tudor had licensed his brand in many countries like Germany (''Akkumulatoren Fabrik AG'' (AFA)) and Spain (''la Sociedad Española Del Acumulador'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1901, Henri Tudor decided to change the name of the firm to ''Société anonyme des accumulateurs Tudor'' (Anonymous society of the Tudor Accumulator) with operating sites in [[Lille]] and Florival. Later in 1908, the Rosport site was closed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As Tudor Spain became more profitable, the shareholding shifted and the majority shareholder became the Germany Company (AFA) and Tudor imported equipment from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tudor starts to speak spanish|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Spain|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tudor before.png|thumb|Former Tudor logo]]

=== During World War I ===
When the [[World War I|first world war]] broke out in 1914, AFA removed from Tudor Spain's capital. Three directors resigned and the situation was critical. However, in 1916, Tudor Spain became the supplier of two starting batteries models manufactured in Spain.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In others European countries during WWI, plants were completely plundered, like in Belgium and in Luxembourg. These events will not hinder the company to have, between the two world wars nearly 25,000 employees at the Florival plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The first great challange|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Spain|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, Tudor Spain supplied the first battery for a submarine ([[Isaac Peral]]), with funding from The Akkumulator Fabrik AG.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== The succession ===
In 1928, after Henri Tudor’s death, his son John took the succession as Managing director of “Accumulateurs Tudor”

During the following years, the traction battery market will strongly rise. However, the first expansion of their plants were based on stationary batteries. For these facilities, the company proposed service contracts under which it bound up with keeping the battery in good working order for a period of ten years against a fixed remuneration. From 1931, «Accumulateurs Tudor» introduced widely the traction battery which is especially used for the industry handling equipment.

In 1939, Tudor batteries France made the acquisition of the Belgian Society of Fulmen accumulator S.A. with its 5900 m2 site located in Leeuw-St.Pierre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activité au Benelux, Chapitre 13|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Belium|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After World War II ===
* From 1945, la Société anonyme Accumulateurs Tudor became one of the main starter batteries suppliers for the automotive industry.  
* In 1948 the capital of the company was increased to 30 million Francs  
* During the fifties, the traction battery market expanded considerably following the needs for reconstruction and development of handling equipment.  
* In 1957, Auguste Charles Laval became CEO of Tudor France and started a corporate restructuring with the centralization of the manufacturing on the Florival site.  
* In 1965, Tudor enhances its quality image by becoming the exclusive large automotive OEM brands including Ford, Peugeot and Renault.  
* About 1967, the Florival plant had around 600 workers. It produced 4.000 accumulators a day. A car on two in Belgium runs with a Tudor accumulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activité au Benelux, Chapitre 13|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Belgium|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Two successive recessions ===
The 1974 recession was keenly felt. The first half of 1981 was characterized by a new crisis resulting in technical unemployment and a deficit. In 1982, the plant underwent thirteen days strike while production was one million pieces per year. The company suffered from the global overcapacity in the starter battery, which represented 65% of revenues.

The goal was to reduce this proportion to 50%. Sales were divided between Germany, Benelux and France, with a predominance of the French market. The competition was Japanese, but also Europe with the establishment of a major General Motors production plant in Sarreguemines. The lifetime of the batteries significantly lengthened, and replacements became less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activité au Benelux|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Belgium|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional investment ===
A continuous casting installation of grids, representing an investment of one million dollars, was commissioned in 1982. At the trays, antique ebony gave way to lighter and more resistant polymers. The stationary battery was the subject of high demand in the area of preventing interruptions (telephone exchanges, operating rooms, computer rooms). Batteries handling equipment however accounted for 70% of turnover of industrial battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activité au Benelux, Chapitre 13|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Belgium|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integration in a global economy ===
Eventually, The Florival site suffered from its initial geographical limits. In 1990, the “Société Anonyme Tudor accumulators" was absorbed by the C.E.A.C.(European Accumulators Company) based in Gennevilliers (France) which was a French-Italian company. C.E.A.C., well-known for its Fulmen brand, thus became also owner of the Tudor brand in some country. The production activities of the Florival site were reduced gradually.

In October 1994, Exide Technologies took over the “Societad Española del Accumulador Tudor”. The Spanish company was, with Tudor India and Tudor Swedish, one of the last social reasons to keep using Tudor brand. In 1995 Exide Technologies also took C.E.A.C. The Florival site became a distribution center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activité au Benelux, Chapitre 13|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Belgium|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Energy Council''' is a global and inclusive forum for thought-leadership and tangible engagement with headquarters in London. Its mission is 'To promote the sustainable supply and use of energy for the greatest benefit of all people'.

The idea for the foundation of the Council came from [[Daniel Nicol Dunlop]] in the 1920s. He wanted to gather experts from all around the world to discuss current and future energy issues. He organised in 1923 first national committees, which organised the first '''''World Power Conference''''' (WPC) in 1924. 1700 experts from 40 countries met in London to discuss energy issues. The meeting was a success and the participants decided on July 11, 1924 to establish a permanent organisation named ''World Power Conference''. Dunlop was elected as its first Secretary General.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright |first1=Rebecca|last2=Shin|first2=Hiroki|last3=Trentmann|first3=Frank |title=From World Power Conference to World Energy Council: 90 Years of Energy Cooperation, 1923 - 2013|url=http://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/A-Brief-History-of-the-World-Energy-Council.pdf|accessdate=30 August 2017|year=2013|publisher=World Energy Council|isbn=978 0 946121 31 1|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1968 the name was changed to ''World Energy Conference'' and in 1989 it became the ''World Energy Council''&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Rebecca; Shin, Hiroki; Trentmann, Frank (2013). From World Power Conference to World Energy Council: 90 Years of Energy Cooperation, 1923 - 2013 (PDF). World Energy Council. p. 8. {{ISBN|978 0 946121 31 1}}. Retrieved 24 July 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;.

The World Energy Council  is the principal impartial network of leaders and practitioners promoting an affordable, stable and environmentally sensitive energy system for the greatest benefit of all. Formed in 1923, the Council is the UN-accredited &lt;ref&gt;http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/acf19b49281081c7852569fa0000ece8?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt; global energy body, representing the entire energy spectrum, with more than 3000 member organisations located in over 90 countries and drawn from governments, private and state corporations, academia, NGOs and energy-related stakeholders. The World Energy Council informs global, regional and national energy strategies by hosting high-level events, publishing authoritative studies, and working through its extensive member network to facilitate the world’s energy policy dialogue. Today, the Council has Member Committees established in over 90 countries, which represent over 3000 member organizations including governments, industry and expert institutions. The World Energy Council covers all energy resources and technologies of energy supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldenergy.org/about-wec/&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Energy Council hosts the World Energy Congress, which is the world’s largest and most influential energy event covering all aspects of the energy agenda. Staged every three years, the Congress provides a platform for energy leaders and experts in all aspects of the sector to address the challenges and opportunities facing suppliers and consumers of energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldenergy.org/about-wec/what-wec-does/world-energy-congress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Energy Council's publications include an annual country-by-country Energy and Climate Policy Assessment, the Survey of Energy Resources. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldenergy.org/publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member Committees ==

As of July 2018 the World Energy Council has 92 member committees and 2 countries which have direct membership&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldenergy.org/news-and-media/news/vietnam-becomes-the-councils-newest-direct-member/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldenergy.org/wec-network/member-committees/&lt;/ref&gt;
