The '''1923 [[Constitution of Romania]]''', also called the Constitution of Union, was intended to align the organisation of the state on the basis of universal male suffrage and the new realities that arose after the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Great Union]] of 1918. Four draft constitutions existed: one belonging to the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], written with contributions from [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]]; one composed by R. Boilă at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], under the influence of the [[Romanian National Party]]; one by [[Constantin Stere]], representing the views of the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]]; and a fourth by C. Berariu. Except for Stere’s proposal, which involved a unicameral legislature, proportional representation and popular consultation through the plebiscite, the other three were inspired (when it came to political organisation) by the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]]. The Liberals came to power in 1922 and managed to push through their own draft, which was approved 247-8 (with two abstentions) in the Chamber of Deputies on March 26, 1923, and the next day in the Senate, 137-2 (with two abstentions). It was published in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'' and came into force on March 29.

The constitution had eight titles and 138 articles, of which 76 came in their entirety from its predecessor. It enshrined the principles of popular sovereignty (exercised through representatives), separation of powers in the state, rule of law and decentralisation. Rights and freedoms for all citizens were recognised, regardless of ethnicity, language, religion or social class; the right to own property was guaranteed and, for the first time, the nationalisation of mineral deposits was provided for. The Kingdom of Romania was defined as a “unitary and indivisible national state”, with an inalienable territory. The state guaranteed freedom of expression and assembly, of conscience and of religion, and declared that “as the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] is the religion of the great majority of Romanians it is the dominant church in the Romanian State, while the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic Church]] has primacy before other faiths”.

Regarding state organisation, legislative power was entrusted to Parliament (Senate and Assembly of Deputies) and the King; executive power to the King, who delegated it to the Council of Ministers; and judicial power to the central and local judicial organs. The right to vote was expanded beyond the 1866 regulations: it was universal for all males, equal, direct, compulsory and secret, based on majority representation. The Assembly of Deputies was elected through universal suffrage, while the Senate comprised members elected by different electoral bodies (the Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture and Labour, and professors, all divided into separate colleges), and members by right: the heir to the throne; [[Metropolitan bishop]]s; diocesan bishops of the Orthodox and Greek-Catholic churches; heads of state-recognised religious bodies; the president of the [[Romanian Academy]]; former presidents of the Council of Ministers; former ministers with at least six years’ seniority; former presidents of either legislative chamber who held this function for at least eight ordinary sessions; former senators and deputies elected to at least ten legislatures, irrespective of their duration; former presidents of the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|High Court of Cassation and Justice]]; reserve and retired generals; former presidents of the National Assemblies at [[Chişinău]], [[Chernivtsi|Cernăuţi]] and [[Alba Iulia]], which proclaimed their respective provinces’ union with Romania in 1918.

A special section discussing the King provides that the throne should remain with the [[House of Hohenzollern]], “from male to male in order of primogeniture and with the perpetual exclusion of women and their descendants”. The King’s person was declared inviolable, and ministers had responsibility for his acts, as any act of the sovereign had to be countersigned by a minister, who then became responsible for it.

Although the constitution was very advanced and democratic in many respects, it also contained imperfections in the functioning of state institutions that made it easy to subvert democracy.  For instance, the King appointed the president of the Council of Ministers, who then organised elections. The government was thus in a position to ensure that its party won a majority in the legislature. In a well-functioning democracy, a government represents the will of parliament and not vice versa, as generally happened in the [[interwar period]].

The 1923 Constitution was abrogated when its [[1938 Constitution of Romania|February 1938 successor]] came into force. It was then partly revived after the [[King Michael Coup]] of August 23, 1944, and definitively abrogated when Romania became a republic on December 30, 1947. During this latter period, in July 1946, the Senate was abolished&amp;mdash;the only significant modification to the document.

The '''2019 World Aquatics Championships''' — 18th [[FINA World Aquatics Championships]] will be held in [[Gwangju]], [[South Korea]] in the summer of 2019. The city has hosted the [[2015 Summer Universiade]] aquatics events in the same venues.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/19/uk-swimming-world-idUKBRE96I0CK20130719] (Gwangju, Budapest win right to host worlds); posted by Reuters on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host selection==
The host was announced on 19 July 2013 on the biennial General Congress of [[FINA]] in [[Barcelona]], the host-city of the [[2013 World Aquatics Championships]]. [[Budapest]] was awarded the [[2021 World Aquatics Championships|2021 Championships]] in the same vote, though in 2015 it was announced that they will host the [[2017 World Aquatics Championships|2017 Championships]] due to [[Guadalajara]]'s withdrawal.

==Venues==
Most of the competitions will be held at the Main Aquatics Centre, built for the [[2015 Summer Universiade]], also hosted in Gwangju.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwangju2019.com/?cat=6 Our Plan] posted by gwangju2019.com; retrieved 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aquatics Centre will host the swimming and diving competitions, and there will be two adjacent outdoor temporary venues for synchronised swimming and water polo.

[[File:2014 Traffic Deaths Above 0.08 BAC.png|thumb|right|2014 Traffic Deaths due to crashes involving drivers at or above 0.08 BAC &lt;ref&gt;[https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/812231]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Alcohol-related traffic crashes''' are defined by the [[United States]] [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) as alcohol-related if either a driver or a non-motorist had a measurable or estimated [[Blood alcohol concentration|BAC]] of 0.01 g/dl or above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/alcoholcountries/background_&amp;_intro.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

This statistic includes any and all vehicular (including bicycle and motorcycle) accidents in which any [[alcohol]] has been consumed, or believed to have been consumed, by the driver, a passenger or a pedestrian associated with the accident. Thus, if a person who has consumed alcohol and has stopped for a red light is rear-ended by a completely sober but inattentive driver, the accident is listed as alcohol-related, although alcohol had nothing to do with causing the accident. Furthermore, if a sober motorist hits a drunk pedestrian, the accident is also listed as alcohol-related. Alcohol-related accidents are often mistakenly confused with alcohol-caused accidents. Some&lt;ref&gt; https://www.motorists.org &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.alcoholproblemsandsolutions.org/Controversies/1090948932.html &lt;/ref&gt; have criticized the NHTSA for compiling this statistic since it may give the impression that drunk drivers cause a much higher percentage of accidents and does not accurately reflect the problem of [[drunk driving in the United States]].

Nationally, 31% of all drivers involved in fatal accidents during 2013 are known to have been [[Drunkenness|intoxicated]] according to the [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC laws) of their state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alcoholalert.com/alcohol-and-drunk-driving-articles.html&lt;/ref&gt; This number is based on a systematic examination of the official records of each and every accident involving a fatality during that year in the US.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  However, a majority of fatalities resulting from car accidents involving alcohol are from sober drivers who are hit by drunk drivers.

The higher number (about 40%) commonly reported refers to accidents defined as alcohol-related as estimated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Each year, [[The Century Council]], a national non-profit organization funded by a group of [[Distillery|alcohol manufacturers]], compiles a document of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Between 1991 and 2013, the rate of alcohol-related traffic fatalities (ARTF) per 100,000 population has decreased 52% nationally, and 79% among youth under 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centurycouncil.org/learn-the-facts/research#888 The Century Council's Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">'''Araki Yasusada''' was a non-existent [[Japan]]ese poet, generally thought (though unverified) to be the creation of [[United States|American]] literature professor [[Kent Johnson]] (born 1955). The publication of Yasusada's poetry by major [[literary journals]] including the ''[[American Poetry Review]]'', ''[[Grand Street (magazine)|Grand Street]]'' and ''[[Conjunctions]]'' during the early 1990s created an embarrassing scandal for these publications.

== Araki's fictional biography ==
Araki Yasusada was supposedly a [[hibakusha|survivor]] of the [[Hiroshima]] atom bomb. He was born in 1907, attended [[Hiroshima University]] (before it was even founded, in 1949), worked in the postal service, and was conscripted into the Japanese army during [[World War II]]. He died of cancer in 1972. His son discovered his poems and notebooks and in 1991 they began to appear in print in the United States.

The 'notebooks' included editorial comments, smudged ink and illegible text, and other elaborate attempts to give the appearance of authenticity.  They also included hints leading to their own unravelling, however, such as references to poets who probably would not be known to Japanese poets of the period and anachronistic references to such things as scuba divers.

== Kent Johnson ==
The real writer of the poems is widely believed to be [[Kent Johnson]], professor of [[Highland Community College (Illinois)|Highland Community College]] in [[Freeport, Illinois]], though he has never claimed authorship. Beliefs about Johnson's role as author stem in no small part from the fact that Johnson edited the Yasusada texts for the Wesleyan University Press. Johnson also included Yasusada's poetry in his doctoral dissertation.

The texts that had been published in the poetry journals were sent to various academics from a variety of locations, presenting Yasusada as an invented persona that was used by one or more people who intended the keep the origin of the texts secret.

Johnson admitted to some critics that Yasusada was nothing but an invented pseudonym "somebody" used to conceal the writer's origin. Some editors, who asked Johnson who the real writer was, claim to have received different answers. One response was that the real writer was "Tosa Motokiyu," one of the three "Japanese translators" — or at least, 95 percent of the poems were his, the rest being Johnson's older work, which Motokiyu had requested to include in his Yasusada fiction. Johnson continued to lecture on Yasusada and denied the hoax in interviews. At one stage he claimed that Motokiyu asked Johnson to take credit for the poems before Motokiyu's death. Yet elsewhere he said that Motokiyu's name was yet another pseudonym.

There were a number of rumors about other supposed co-authors, including the leading avant-garde Mexican composer, Javier Alvarez, who appears as co-editor of the work with Johnson. Publishers demanded their money back and criticized the hoax. Wesleyan cancelled the publication of the poetry collection. Some critics noticed that Johnson had published similar poetry in 1986 under the name of Ogiwara Miyamori, in ''Ironwood'' magazine.

== Criticism ==
After the 'hoax' was discovered, several journals rejected previously accepted poems.  The hoax has allegedly been called "a criminal act" by Arthur Vogelsang, editor of ''American Poetry Review'', which had previously published a special supplement of Yasusada poems, including an alleged portrait of the author, but in letters to the ''[[Boston Review]]'' he denied having used the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonreview.net/BR22.3/Vogelsang.html]&lt;/ref&gt; But numerous critics were supportive, praising both the conceptual nature of the fiction and the quality of the writing, including Roof Books that published the entire text in 1997.

'''''August 1991''''' is a 2005 television dramatization of a failed Soviet attempt to suppress the [[Singing Revolution]] independence movement in [[Estonia]]. At the same time as the events unfold in Estonia, a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] is taking place in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Wondered, Would the Window Close?|url=http://www.rusbg.com/en/we-wondered-would-the-window-close.html|publisher=The Washington Post, retrieved via RUBO@RD|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanks roll through the streets of Estonia, attempting to crush the fledgling [[democracy]] and assert Soviet authority.

'''BW Summer Festival''', (commonly known as '''BW''' or BayWatch), was an annual music festival that was held in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], [[New Zealand]].

==History==
The festival began in 2004 as '''BW Campgrounds''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bwsummerfestival.com/about-bw/ |title=ABOUT {{!}} BW Summer Festival |date=2015-04-03 |access-date=2017-02-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403114843/http://www.bwsummerfestival.com/about-bw/ |archivedate=3 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to help host the thousands of visitors visiting the district for the [[Rhythm and Vines]] New Year's Eve festival. BW operates a range of camping grounds hosting over 16,000 people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhythmandvines.co.nz/faq/|title=FAQ|website=Rhythm and Vines|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, BW Summer Festival added the '''Jim Beam Sound Shell''' amphitheatre to host its own artists in the lead-up to Rhythm and Vines.

BW holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest [[skinny dip]] event &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-skinny-dipping-(swimming-naked)|title=Largest skinny dipping (swimming naked)|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2017-02-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 31 December 2014, a riot broke out at the campground between the two sectioned off campsites when some campers decided to set tents on fire and started throwing things at each other. It resulted in 68 arrests and 83 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1501/S00001/63-arrests-in-gisborne-bw-festival-riot.htm|title=63 Arrests In Gisborne BW Festival Riot {{!}} Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015 this festival has been merged with the [[Rhythm &amp; Vines]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bwsummerfestival.com/|title=BW Summer Festival|website=www.bwsummerfestival.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bush Ground Zero.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] speaking at Ground Zero with Beckwith beside him]]
'''Bob Beckwith''' (born September 21, 1933) is a retired member of the [[New York City Fire Department]].  He became well known to the United States' public after he stood next to President [[George W. Bush]] as the president gave a speech at the ruins of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Photos of Beckwith and the president appeared on the front page of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. This exposure launched him into the national spotlight and led to press attention and interviews. Beckwith has met several times with President Bush since then, spoken extensively in public, and acted as a fundraiser for charities.

==Family and career==
Beckwith has lived for more than 50 years with his wife Barbara in the same house in [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York]]. The couple has six adult children.&lt;ref name=Yahoo1 /&gt; Beckwith is a veteran of the [[New York City Fire Department]] with 30 years of service.&lt;ref name=WSJ_AP1 /&gt;

==Actions at Ground Zero==

On the morning of September 11, 2001, Beckwith was tending to his grandson, who had been hit by a car while biking to school.  Before he arrived at the hospital with his grandson, Beckwith was aware that a plane had struck the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. When the boy appeared to be in stable condition, Beckwith left the hospital and went to World Trade Center site after he saw the South Tower collapse via television. Even though he had been retired for seven years from the [[New York City Fire Department]], he grabbed his old gear and [[Deception|bluffed]] his way past the blockades and barricades that had been set up and began helping with [[bucket brigade]]s and [[missing person]] searches.&lt;ref name="Yahoo1"/&gt;

{{wikisource|Ground Zero Bullhorn Speech}}On September 14, after Beckwith and some men had unearthed a [[fire engine]] buried in rubble from the fallen buildings, they tested its stability as a stand from which to speak, and a [[U.S. Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent ordered him to help President Bush onto the platform.&lt;ref name="Yahoo1"/&gt; Beckwith handed Bush a [[bullhorn]] with which to address the crowd of responders and workers&lt;ref name="NYDN1"/&gt; and was told to climb down by the Secret Service&lt;ref name = "Yahoo1"/&gt; and [[Karl Rove]],&lt;ref name = "NYDN1"/&gt; but Bush insisted that Beckwith stay with him.&lt;ref name = "Yahoo1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYDN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WPIX1"/&gt; An image of Bush with Beckwith was featured the next day on the front page of the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name = "Yahoo1"/&gt;

==National fame and activities since 9/11==
A photo of Bush with Beckwith standing together was published two weeks later on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, catapulting Beckwith to the national spotlight. Rejecting his new-found fame, he initially refused to speak to various news personalities and shows—[[Diane Sawyer]], the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', and [[Rosie O'Donnell]]—though he eventually appeared on [[MSNBC]] and other news channels and programs.&lt;ref name="Yahoo1"/&gt;

Beckwith continues to be bashful about his fame,&lt;ref name="WSJ_AP1"/&gt; though an enlarged version of the ''Time'' magazine cover that made him famous hangs in his den.&lt;ref name = "Yahoo1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WSJ_AP1"/&gt; Regarding the cover, Beckwith said that "[a]ll these guys that come over to interview me, they all have to have a picture of it." Beckwith also has a [[first edition]] print of the cover, which is encased in a display box together with a flag that waved at Ground Zero, given to him by President Bush. Beckwith has volunteered to have the items in his possession go to the 9/11 Memorial after he dies. He has already donated the clothes and helmet that he was wearing that day to the memorial.&lt;ref name="Yahoo1"/&gt;

Beckwith has visited 11 times with President Bush, traveled and spoken extensively,&lt;ref name="Yahoo1"/&gt; and dedicated much of his activity to fundraising for the [[New York Firefighters Burn Center Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WSJ_AP1"/&gt;

On February 25, 2002, in a [[White House]] ceremony together with Governor [[George Pataki]] of New York state, Beckwith presented to Bush the bullhorn the president had used to address workers at the World Trade Center site just days after the attacks.&lt;ref name = "NYDN1"/&gt;

In the wake of the killing of [[Osama bin Laden]] by a team of [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy Seals]], Beckwith was asked his opinion.  He stated: "I would have liked it to be on George Bush's watch, but it wasn't, so OK".&lt;ref name = "WSJ_AP1"/&gt;  He also said: "But I'm glad we got him. He's burning in hell and he's going to rot there."&lt;ref name = "WPIX1"/&gt;

'''Buntingford Almshouses''' is a grade II* [[listed building]] on the High street of the Hertfordshire town of [[Buntingford]]. The building was erected in 1684 by the mathematician and astronomer Bishop [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]]&lt;ref name=ehlisting&gt;{{NHLE|num=1101350 |desc=|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born in the town. The architect was probably the celebrated scientist and architect, [[Robert Hooke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batten|first1=M. I.|title=THE ARCHITECTURE OF DR. ROBERT HOOKE, F.R.S.|journal=The Volume of the Walpole Society|date=1936–1937|volume=25|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building, located next to St Peter's church, is built of brick around three sides of a courtyard. The heritage listing describes the building as ''"A classical almshouses of 1684 of outstanding interest."''&lt;ref name=ehlisting /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3442">'''Christiania Offentlige Theater''' ('Christiania Public Theatre') or ''Det Strømbergske Teater'' ('Strömberg Theatre') was a historic theatre in [[Oslo]] in Norway, active between 1827 and 1835. It was the first public theatre in Oslo and in Norway, and the predecessor of the [[Christiania Theatre]].

The theater was founded by the Swedish theatre director [[Johan Peter Strömberg]]. With the exception of the unsuccessfull attempt of [[Martin Nürenbach]] in 1772, there was no public theatre in Oslo or anywhere in Norway prior to 1827. Theatre was performed by foreign travelling theatre companies, or privately by ''[[Det Dramatiske Selskab]]''.

Strömberg wished to establish a professional public theatre in Norway, with professional native actors. He obtained a theater permit from the Danish crown, and founded the first dramatic school in 1825 in order to train the first group of native actors.

In 30 January 1827, the theatre was inaugurated with a performance of Strömberg's students, the pioneer group of Norwegian actors. However, the Norwegian actors was not considered trained enough to meet the standars of the audience, and Strömberg was forced to engage trained actors from Denmark.  On 4 November 1827, Strömberg performed his play ''Fredsfesten'' in praise of the unpopular [[Swedish-Norwegian Union]], which attracted great criticism.  In the spring of 1828, Strömberg was declared bancrupt, rented the theatre and the theatre permit to one of his Danish actors, [[Jens Lang Bøcher]], and returned to Sweden. Jens Lang Bøcher replaced almost all of the Norwegian staff with Danes, allowing only five Norwegians to remain.  On 22 June 1832, Strömberg sold the theatre to the director [[Carl Anton Saabye]], after which it was renamed to Christiania Offentlige Theater.

The first opera performed in public in Norway, ''Deux mots'' by [[Nicolas Dalayrac]], was performed here in 1831, directed by [[August Schrumpf]] with [[Augusta Smith]] in the main role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Europas konstnärer|title=Schrumpf|url=http://runeberg.org/eurkonst/0532.html|publisher=Runeberg.org|accessdate=23 August 2011|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre burned down on 5 November 1835, after which the theater company performed in the house of the ''Det Dramatiske Selskab'' until the [[Christiania Theatre]] was inaugurated on 4 October 1837.

'''Chunee''' (or '''Chuny''') was an [[Indian elephant]] who was brought to [[English Regency|Regency]] [[London]] in 1811.

Three elephants were brought to England in [[East India Company]] ships between 1809 and 1811. The third of these was Chunee. He travelled on the [[East Indiaman]], {{ship||Astell|1809 EIC ship|2}}, from Bengal, arriving in England in July 1811. &lt;ref name=grigson2016&gt;Grigson, Caroline, ''Menagerie: The History of Exotic Animals in England'', Oxford University Press, 2016. {{ISBN|9780198714705}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190}}

The other two elephants, also owned by [[Stephani Polito]] at some point, arrived in England in September 1809,&lt;ref name="grigson2016" /&gt;{{rp|125}} and June 1810.&lt;ref name="grigson2016" /&gt;{{rp|186}}

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;
"Mr Polito ... has obtained possession of a remarkably fine Elephant, brought to England in the Hon. East India Company's ship, [[Winchelsea_(1803_EIC_ship)#EIC_voyage_#3_(1808–1809)|Winchelsea]], [[William_Moffat_(MP)#Captain_William_Moffat_(1774–1850)|Capt. William Moffat]], which will be exhibited at [[Romsey|Rumsey]] [sic] fair on Monday; and it is expected he will be offered for public inspection for a day or two, in this town {{bracket|[[Winchester]]}}, on his way to the Exeter 'Change London."&lt;ref&gt; ''Hampshire Chronicle'' (23 April 1810), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second elephant was brought to England from [[Sri Lanka]] on the East India Company ship {{ship||Walthamstow|1789 EIC ship|2}} in June 1810.&lt;ref name="grigson2016" /&gt;{{rp|186}}

Chunee was originally exhibited at the [[Covent Garden Theatre]],&lt;ref name="grigson2016" /&gt;{{rp|190}} but was bought by circus owner [[Stephani Polito]] to join his [[menagerie]] at [[Exeter Exchange]] on [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in London. The menagerie was bought by [[Edward Cross (zoo proprietor)|Edward Cross]] in 1817. The events in which the elephant was put to death in 1826 became a [[cause célèbre]].

==Career==
Chunee weighed nearly 7&amp;nbsp;[[ton]]s, was 11&amp;nbsp;feet tall, and was valued at [[pound sterling|£]]1,000. He was tame, and was originally a theatrical animal, appearing on stage with [[Edmund Kean]]. His plays included ''Blue Beard'', at the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], and the [[pantomime]] ''Harlequin and Padmanaba, or the Golden Fish'', at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].

Chunee was trained to take a [[British sixpence coin|sixpence]] from visitors to the menagerie to hold with his [[Elephant#Trunk|trunk]] before returning it. An entry in [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]'s journal records a visit to Exeter Exchange on 14 November 1813, when "The elephant took and gave me my money again — took off my hat — opened a door — trunked a whip — and behaved so well, that I wish he was my butler."

==Death==
Chunee became dangerously violent towards the end of his life, attributed to an "annual [[wikt:paroxysm|paroxysm]]" (perhaps his [[musth]]) aggravated by a rotten [[tusk]] which gave him a bad [[toothache]]. On 26 February 1826, while on his usual Sunday walk along the Strand, Chunee ran amok, killing one of his keepers. He became increasingly enraged and difficult to handle over the following days, and it was decided that he was too dangerous to keep. The following Wednesday, 1 March, his keeper tried to feed him [[poison]], but Chunee refused to eat it. Soldiers were summoned from [[Somerset House]] to shoot Chunee with their [[musket]]s. Kneeling down to the command of his trusted keeper, Chunee was hit by 152 [[Musket#Ammunition|musket balls]], but refused to die. Chunee was finished off by a keeper with a [[harpoon]] or [[sword]]. The floor of his cage was deeply covered with his blood, and it was said that the sound of the elephant in agony was more alarming than the reports of the soldiers’ guns.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Chunees Skelett.jpg|thumb|Chunee's skeleton]]

Hundreds of people paid the usual [[shilling]] entrance fee to see his carcass butchered, and then dissected by doctors and medical students from the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. His [[skeleton]] weighed 876&amp;nbsp;lb (397&amp;nbsp;kg), and was sold for £100 and exhibited at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[Piccadilly]], and later at the Royal College of Surgeons in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], the bullet holes clearly visible. His skin weighed 17&amp;nbsp;[[hundredweight|cwt]] (1,900&amp;nbsp;lb or 860&amp;nbsp;kg), and was sold to a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] for £50. Chunee's skeleton was on display in the Hunterian Collection until 1941 when it had a direct hit from a [[Luftwaffe]] airstrike.

The manner of Chunee's death was widely publicised, with illustrations printed in popular [[broadsheet|newssheet]]s of volley after volley being shot into his profusely bleeding body. Recipes were published for elephant stew, along with [[Sentimentalism (literature)|maudlin]] poems saying "Farewell, poor Chuny". Letters were printed in ''[[The Times]]'' protesting at the barbarity of the process, and the poor quality of the living conditions of the animals in the menagerie. The [[Zoological Society of London]] was founded in April 1826. The controversy was the inspiration for a successful play at [[Sadler's Wells]], entitled ''Chuneelah; or, The Death of the Elephant at Exeter 'Change''.

The menagerie at Exeter Exchange declined in popularity after Chunee's death. The animals were moved to [[Surrey Zoological Gardens]] in 1828, and the building was demolished in 1829.

The '''Collaborators Act''' was a law enacted in 1972 by the [[government of Bangladesh]] to try those who did not side with the nationalist cause in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], or politically opposed the liberation war or willingly cooperated with the [[Pakistan Army]] or committed criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trial of crimes against humanity could come under Collaborators Act: Suranjit |url=http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=b0ab42fcb7133122b38521d13da7120b&amp;nttl=201108283332 |newspaper=BanglaNews24 |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=2013-07-12 |quote="On 24 January 1972, the government of Bangladesh enacted another law to try those who did not side with the liberation war or politically opposed the call of liberation war or willingly cooperated with the Pakistan Army or committed criminal acts."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is referred as the '''Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunal) Order 1972''', commonly known as Collaborators Act, 1972.

About 2,884 cases were filed under this law until October 1973. Of the accused, 752 were given punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=দালাল আইন ফিরছে |trans-title=Collaborators Act returns |url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/print_edition/?view=details&amp;archiev=yes&amp;arch_date=16-12-2010&amp;type=gold&amp;data=news&amp;pub_no=371&amp;cat_id=1&amp;menu_id=13&amp;news_type_id=1&amp;index=0#.Ud4AKNululQ |newspaper=Kaler Kantho |language=bn |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=2013-07-12 |quote="১৯৭৩ সালের অক্টোবর পর্যন্ত এই আইনের আওতায় দুই হাজার ৮৮৪টি মামলা দায়ের করা হয়। এসব মামলায় সাজা দেওয়া হয় ৭৫২ জনকে।"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on 31 October 1975, the Collaborators Act was dismissed due to several reasons and irregularities found in the law. The law was amended three times.

The Act, was designed to facilitate arrest and trial of accomplices as well as of local perpetrators of the genocide remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secularvoiceofbangladesh.org/Fotoes/Report%20on%20the%20war%20criminals..%A8%A8/Report%20on%20the%20war%20criminals.htm |title=Report on the Findings of the People's Inquiry Commission on the Activities of the War Criminals and the Collaborator |publisher=Forum for Secular Bangladesh |date=26 March 1994 |accessdate=2013-07-13 |quote="The 1972 Collaborators Act, designed to facilitate arrest and trial of accomplices as well as of local perpetrators of the genocide remained in place." |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415235114/http://www.secularvoiceofbangladesh.org/Fotoes/Report%20on%20the%20war%20criminals..%A8%A8/Report%20on%20the%20war%20criminals.htm# |archive-date=15 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
What happened in Bangladesh between 25 March and 16 December 1971 epitomized the spirit of the human will as well as man's unlimited capacity to be brutal towards fellow men. Rarely in the history of mankind have a people displayed so much heroism and suffered so much pain within the space of so short a time as the people of Bangladesh did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secularvoiceofbangladesh.org/Fotoes/Report%20on%20the%20war%20criminals..%A8%A8/Report%20on%20the%20war%20criminals.htm |title=Report on the Findings of the People's Inquiry Commission on the Activities of the War Criminals and the Collaborator |publisher=Forum for Secular Bangladesh |date=26 March 1994 |accessdate=2013-07-13 |quote="What happened in Bangladesh between March 25 and December 16, 1971 epitomized the spirit of the human will as well as man's unlimited capacity to be brutal towards fellow men.

During this war some Bengali civilians took the side of Pakistani Army of occupation. They collaborated the army to occupy the whole Bangladesh and supported the atrocities committed by them.

The members of [[Pakistan Muslim League]], [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]], [[Nizam-e-Islam]] joined the [[East Pakistan Central Peace Committee|Peace Committee]], which was actually formed to support the atrocities. A dummy cabinet was formed under Nurul Amin in which Abul Kashem, Nawajesh Ahmed, AKM Yousuf, Abbas Ali Khan, Maolana Ishak joined. Obaydullah Mazumder, an [[Awami League]] leader also joined in the cabinet. After liberation 46 MNAs from Awami League was denounced or relegated from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rokomari.com/book/15576;jsessionid=317EF55864FB1ADEA97114612EA40365 |title=বাংলাদেশের শাসন ব্যবস্থা ও রাজনীতি -ড. আবুল ফজল হক |publisher=Rokomari.Com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, under the supervision of [[Pakistani Army]] another force named [[Razakars (Bangladesh)|Rajakar]] was formed to replace the Ansar. Jamaat-e-Islami leader AKM Yousuf, with 96 members of Jamaat-e-Islami started a training camp in Khulna Ansar and VDP camp to fight against the freedom fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boi24.com/muktizuddher-prekkhapote-byktir-obosthan.html |title=মুক্তিযুদ্ধের প্রেক্ষাপটে ব্যক্তির অবস্থান : Online Book Shop in Bangladesh : Pay After You Get : 24/7 |publisher=Boi24.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Rajakar personnel were the members of Jamaat-e-Islami

[[Al-Shams (Bangladesh)|Al-Shams]] and [[Al-Badr]] was also formed in order to counter the guerrilla activities of the [[Mukti Bahini]] which grew increasingly organised and militarily successful during in the second half of 1971. All three groups operated under Pakistani command.

On this regard, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] on his repatriation in Bangladesh on 10 January 1972, declared to try the collaborators along with the Pakistani Army who committed genocide and atrocities.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=যুদ্ধাপরাধীদের বিচার ও বাস্তবতা |trans-title=War criminals trial and reality |url=http://www.prothom-alo.net/V1/archive/news_details_mcat.php?dt=2007-11-13&amp;issue_id=427&amp;cat_id=3&amp;nid=Njg0NDU=&amp;mid=Mw |newspaper=[[Prothom Alo]] |language=bn |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=2013-07-12 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==
The process to try the collaborators during the first days of Bangladesh was not going through any legal process. People were angry and were killing the collaborators without any trail. These activities tarnished the overall image of the nation. Some were being killed because of personal issues. So a government was forced to create a law and begin a trial to pacify the agitation.

===Law===
The Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 was announced to try the local war criminals. On 24 January 1972 an order came in effect.

The constitution of Bangladesh was also amended to include Article 47 (3) in order to fasten the trial of members "of any armed or defence or auxiliary forces" for genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. In addition, The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973 was announced on 20 July 1973 mainly to try the Pakistani war criminals.

The government also announced a two-tier trial process where national and international jurists would be appointed to try some high-profile war criminals, while an all-Bangladeshi jurist panel would try the rest.

=== Statements of the government ===
Many statements were provided by the responsible officials of the government of Bangladesh regarding this issue.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on his arrival on 10 January 1972 ensured that the collaborators will be tried along with their Pakistani masters. But he also asked his people to give the responsibility to the government&lt;ref name="hritkalom.blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://hritkalom.blogspot.com/2010/09/blog-post.html |script-title=হৃৎ কলম: একাত্তরের ঘাতক ও দালালেরা কে কোথায় |trans-title=Who and where are war killers and collaborators |date=27 February 2004 |language=bn |website=Hritkalom |type=Blog |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ordered Awami League leaders to gather proof against the collaborators and assured that the collaborators will be tried for times and again. On 12 January 1972, Rahman addressed people, saying that the criminals will not go unpunished under his government.&lt;ref name="scribd_a"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/109505431/%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%98%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%95-%E0%A6%93-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AF |script-title=একাত্তরের ঘাতক ও দালালরা কে কোথায় |trans-title=Where are the killers and agents of war |language=bn |website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mujib on 14 January asked the Awami League activists not to take revenge and assured that legislative measures will be taken against the collaborators in time.&lt;ref name="scribd_a" /&gt;

On 30 March, in a public gathering in Chittagong he asked the people should he pardon the collaborators or not. The people of Chittagong said, "No and never".&lt;ref name="scribd_a" /&gt;

==Implementation==
The implementation of the law started on 15 February when an order signed by secretary Taslimuddin Ahmed was circulated stating that 14 top collaborators have to surrender. The list was made addressing [[Nurul Amin]], [[Ghulam Azam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='I was on list of collaborators' |first1=Manik |last1=Julfikar Ali |last2=Laskar |first2=Rizanuzzaman |date=14 May 2012 |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=234062 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan A Sabur, [[Shah Azizur Rahman]], Maulana Muhammad Ishaq, Khawaja Khayeruddin, Mahmud Ali, AKM Yousuf,&lt;ref name="bdnews24"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jamaat leader Yusuf arrested |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/05/12/jamaat-leader-yusuf-arrested |newspaper=bdnews24 |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas Ali Khan and many others as collaborators.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo" /&gt; Awami League leader Obaydullah Mazumder of Feni was among the list of the collaborators.

Later some 50,000 collaborators were arrested under the act.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo" /&gt; Among them 752 were found guilty and was punished.

About 37,471 cases were filed under this law till October 1973. On 28 March 73 tribunals were formed to try the collaborators. It was also declared that other courts will refrain from the cases under these tribunals.

===Sentences===
About 2,884 cases were solved and the verdict was given under this law till October 1973 before the general amnesty was declared by Mujib. Only 752 of them were found guilty and only one of them was sentenced capital punishment. As many as two thousand were acquitted after the trial.&lt;ref name="scribd_a" /&gt;
* On 10 February 1973 life imprisonment was sentenced against Maulana Muhammad Ishaq for collaboration.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=৭৫২ যুদ্ধাপরাধীর সাজা হয়েছিলো |trans-title=752 war criminals were sentenced |url=http://www.prothom-alo.net/V1/archive/news_details_mcat.php?dt=2008-03-26&amp;issue_id=875&amp;cat_id=1&amp;nid=OTA0OTg=&amp;mid=MQ== |newspaper=[[Prothom Alo]] |language=bn |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Jamaat-e-Islami leader AKM Yousuf and Abbas Ali Khan were arrested under the law. After the war, Yousuf was sentenced to life imprisonment under the 1972 Collaborator’s Order.&lt;ref name="bdnews24" /&gt;

Sa'ad Ahmed, a leader from Kushtia was sentenced life imprisonment for supporting the atrocities as a [[East Pakistan Central Peace Committee]] member and taking part in the election of 1971.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt;

Chikon Ali, a Rajakar from Mirpur of Kushtia was sentenced to death on 10 June 1972, which was the first ever verdict of capital punishment under the law. The punishment of Chikon Ali was later cut short by the Supreme Court to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt;

An absentia trial staged under the law gave death penalty to three Al-Badr members for the murder of prominent Professor Dr. AK Azad on 6 October 1972.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt; The culprits were never found.

On 11 April 1972, Rajakar Abdul Hafiz of Comilla was sentenced 41 years imprisonment, highest in the history of this law. He was tried for various convictions like murder, rape, loot etc.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt;

In the July 1972, three brothers of Bogra were given punishment as Nurul Islam of same area filed a murder case them. Mofizur Rahman aka Chan Miah was sentenced to death, Mokhlesur Rahman aka Khoka Mia and Moshiur Rahman aka Lal Miah were sentenced to life imprisonment.
After appealing against their punishment Chan Miah was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment while his two brothers were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment both.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt;

Keramat Ali of Munshiganj was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment because of his activity as a Peace Committee member.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt;

A special tribunal sentenced Mokbul Hossain, Ayub Ali and Atiar Rahman to life imprisonment on the Montu murder case.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt;

Al-Badr members Siddiqur Rahman and Muhammad Galib were sentenced life imprisonment on the journalist Nizamuddin murder case.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The Collaborators Act 1972 was a flawed law with many defects. It was amended for at least three times within one year. Many criticised the law because of its defects and irregularities.

===Unaccepted===
The pro-Awami League researcher Shahriar Kabir in cross examination confessed that the trials occurred under this act were never accepted by the families of the martyrs.&lt;ref name="banglanews24"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=জামায়াত নেতাদের স্বাক্ষরিত পরিচয়পত্র বহন করতো রাজাকাররা: শাহরিয়ার কবীর |trans-title=Jamaat leaders would carry an identity card signed rajakarara: Shahriar Kabir |url=http://www.banglanews24.com/detailsnews.php?nssl=718726592600dd79284f1812d9685dce&amp;nttl=20120910070123138009 |newspaper=Banglanews24.com |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahin Reza, son of famous journalist Shirajuddin Hossain stated that, the trial of the collaborators was nothing but a kangaroo trial&lt;ref name="hritkalom.blogspot" /&gt; to protect the collaborators. Those who were involved in murders and genocides were set free and the innocents were imprisoned without substantial proof.&lt;ref name="scribd_a" /&gt;

Khaleque Mazumder, who killed Shahidullah Kaiser was sentenced to only a seven years imprisonment under the act. Panna Kaiser, the widow of Shahidullah Kaiser marked it as a humiliation of humanity and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaiser |first=Panna |date=1991 |title=Muktijuddha: agey o paray |script-title=মুক্তিযুদ্ধ: আগে ও পরে |trans-title=War of Liberation: Before and After |language=bn |location=Dhaka |publisher=Agamee Prakashani |isbn=984-401-004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politicization===
Prominent political leaders and intellectuals like Maolana Bhashani, Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Abul Mansur Ahmed, Justice S M Morshed, Alim AL Razy, Enayetullah Khan, Ataur Rahman Khan and many others started criticizing the law because of the abusive measures.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo" /&gt;

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman himself started facing problems while the process to try the collaborators begun. The Awami League leaders and activist getting order from Mujib to submit genocide data started to misusing the power. They started to use the power against their personal foes.

On the other hand, many political parties and its members were convicted of collaboration with Pakistanis. So many of them started criticising the steps taken by the government because of political benefit.

===Legal problems===
[[File:বাংলাদেশ দালাল অধ্যাদেশ ১৯৭২, ঘাতকদের রক্ষাকবচ.png|thumb|বাংলাদেশ দালাল অধ্যাদেশ ১৯৭২, ঘাতকদের রক্ষাকবচ]]
The Collaborators Act faced major legal problems as it was created in a very short time. Barrister Moinul Hossain, an Awami League backed Member of Parliament criticized the law in an article published in [[The Daily Ittefaq]] on 19 November 1972.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo" /&gt;

Barrister Moinul Hossain stated:
{{quote|According to the first schedule of the legislation, under the Collaborators Act the collaborators will remain out of the purview of principal rights of a citizen. The conflict between Collaborators Act and principal rights is now ascertained. No indication of the time of the offence in the law will be misused by many. According to the law, just because of an accusation according to any hearsay can suspend the principal rights of an innocent citizen.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo" /&gt;}}

On the other hand, this law had a provision in its section 7 which stated that the conviction against the criminals will come in effect only if the Officer in Charge of the Police of that particular area certify that as an offence.&lt;ref name="hritkalom.blogspot" /&gt; According to the act, No cases can be filed in the tribunal if the Officer in Charge defies.&lt;ref name="hritkalom.blogspot" /&gt;

Many police officers took the side of the Pakistani Government during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. And most of the families of the collaborators were enough solvent to pay a good margin to police officers. So police officers were not enough conscious about these cases.

Another defect was that the act gave the convicts an opportunity to appeal against the verdict while the victims were not given such opportunity.

On 23 July 1972 in an article published on Dainik Bangla some experts stated that,
{{quote|The tribunals are trying the crimes occurred in a certain period which was actually an emergency one. But still the authority is following the ancient 'Evidence Act' which was actually created to try the offences occurred in the time of peace. While investigating the cases, it is becoming hard to harder to prove it because of the complexities arising.&lt;ref name="hritkalom.blogspot" /&gt;}}

Prominent writer [[Ahmed Sharif]], [[Shahriar Kabir]] stated the Collaborators Act 1972 as a '''safeguard''' to the collaborators and war criminals.

Later during a cross examination on 10 September 2012, Shahriar Kabir confessed that the International Crimes Tribunal Act 1973 was created to overcome the problems of the Collaborators Act 1972.&lt;ref name="banglanews24" /&gt;

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was also concerned about the failures of the Collaboration Act 1972.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo" /&gt; The call of general amnesty in 1973 was somehow influenced because of his concern about this law.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo" /&gt;

==Flawed process==
The Collaborators Act 1972, soon started to prove itself as a spiderweb. The number of big flies trapped in it were very low. Dr. Malik, Maulana Muhammad Ishaq, AKM Yousuf, Izhar Ahmed were the only big figures to be punished.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo_a" /&gt; Many others who were directly involved in genocide were freed or went underground.

[[File:Shah Aziz Freed.jpg|thumb|Shah Aziz Freed]]
The uncle of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Sheikh Mosharraf Hossain was a Rajakar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=132023286996853&amp;set=vb.155230181301463&amp;type=3&amp;theater |title=Reconciliation-এ জোর দিয়েছিলেন খোদ শেখ মুজিবই |publisher=Channel I |language=bn |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent him to jail. But soon many such cases started to arise.

Awami Muslim League leader Rajakar Athar Ali Khan was the father of a freedom fighter from Bagerhat who attained the gallantry award [[Bir Uttam]] for his bravery.&lt;ref name="Murshid2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murshid |first=Ghulam |date=2010 |title=Muktiyuddha o tārapara: ekaṭi nirdalīẏa itihāsa |script-title=মুক্তিযুদ্ধ ও তারপর একটি নির্দলীয় ইতিহাস |trans-title=The Liberation War and then: A non-partisan history |language=bn |location=Dhaka |publisher=Prathamā Prakāśana |isbn=978-984-8765-37-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athar Ali Khan did not face any trial because of his son.

A Rajakar who later joined Bangladesh Rifles (Presently known as [[Border Guards Bangladesh]]) after liberation war remained untouched and promoted in a higher post during Sheikh Mujibur Rahman regime.&lt;ref name="Murshid2010" /&gt;

Taslimuddin Ahmed, who signed the notification for the 14 collaborators asking them to surrender was himself a collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rokomari.com/book/5190;jsessionid=876C738183626C2AD133D4DE1BA79600 |title=পঁচাত্তরের রক্তক্ষরণ-মেজর রফিকুল ইসলাম পিএসসি |publisher=Rokomari.Com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another surprising scenario was staged in a special tribunal where a Rajakar recruiting officer became the judge and gave verdict against the one whom he recruited as Rajakar.&lt;ref name="Murshid2010" /&gt; Many such situations was raised that time.

Those who had close relation with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were never tried. Mujib himself freed collaborators like Khan A Sabur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maksud |first=Syed Abul |date=5 November 2013 |script-title=সৌজন্যবোধ ও বাঙালির কথাবার্তার কথা |trans-title=Bengalis of speech and human kindness |url=http://www.prothom-alo.com/opinion/article/65518/%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8C%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%A7_%E0%A6%93_%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%99%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE |newspaper=Prothom Alo |language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shah Azizur Rahman]], Wahiduzzaman, Mawlana Abu Zafar Mohammad Saleh, former Awami League leader AKM Shamsul Haque and many others.&lt;ref name="Momen1980"&gt;{{cite book |last=Momen |first=Nurul |date=1980 |title=Bangladesh, the First Four Years: From 16 December 1971 to 15 December 1975 |publisher=Bangladesh Institute of Law &amp; International Affairs |oclc=499570532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After liberation war, a committee was formed under Nilima Ibrahim to find out the collaborators who worked in Radio Pakistan. 43 people were found by the committee who worked for Pakistan. Unfortunately no action were taken against them as they were the part of progressive society as well as Awami League and some of them were killed by Pakistanis.

==General amnesty==
As the second anniversary of victory in the Bangladesh Liberation War approached, most of those jailed under the Collaborators Act had been detained for nearly two years without being charged with specific crimes.&lt;ref name="Kabir 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kabir |first=B.

Villagers were reluctant to testify because of fear of retaliation. Also public sentiment had grown less concerned with punishing collaborators and more worried about the shattered economy.&lt;ref name="Sundar1974" /&gt; The continued imprisonment of alleged collaborators and threat of legal action against those not yet arrested was increasingly viewed as an attempt to silence political opposition.&lt;ref name="wfp" /&gt; It was having the opposite effect by creating fresh social tensions.&lt;ref name="Sundar1974"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sundar |first=Ram |date=23 July 1974 |title=Bangladesh: Release of political prisoners termed 'a risk' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4364399/bangladesh_release_of_political/ |newspaper=The Ottawa Journal |agency=Canadian Press |page=48 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=19 February 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to domestic considerations, there were international ones. In August 1973, the [[Delhi Agreement]] had started the repatriation of prisoners of war, but two significant issues remained. First, Bangladesh wanted Pakistan to accept hundreds of thousands of [[Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh|Biharis]] who had remained loyal to Islamabad during the war, still considered themselves citizens of Pakistan, and didn't want to live in the now independent Bangladesh. Second, Bangladesh wanted 195 Pakistani POWs tried for war crimes. Sheik Mujib desired diplomatic recognition by Pakistan and membership in the United Nations, something China was blocking at the behest of her ally Pakistan.&lt;ref name="wfp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakistan bars Bangladesh from UN over prisoners |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19730922&amp;id=_rpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TVADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4508,15257&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Prescott Courier |location=Prescott, AZ |agency=Associated Press |date=21 September 1973 |page=2 |access-date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh also sought more favorable relations with the oil-rich Muslim Middle East in the hope that foreign aid would be forthcoming.&lt;ref name="Kabir 2001" /&gt;

In this climate, Sheik Mujib announced on 1 December 1973 a general amnesty for 36,400 alleged collaborators. The pardon did not extend to the few thousand prisoners charged with wartime murder, rape, or arson.&lt;ref name="wfp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Collaborators Tribunal Order (1972) |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Collaborators_Tribunal_Order,_1972 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration===
The declaration was depicted in the newspapers on 1 December 1973. ''Dainik Bangla'' stated the news with the headline, "General Amnesty Declared upon the Punished Prisoners under Collaborators Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=752 Were Punished |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/153281570/752-Were-Punished |newspaper=Prothom Alo |language=bn |date=26 March 2008 |via=Scribd |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The newspaper said,

{{quote|Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh has declared a general mercy for the convicted and punished prisoners under the Collaborator Act. Persons who have been imprisoned under the Collaborator Ordinance (Special Tribunal) 1972, against whom there is a warrant or those who are wanted and those who have been punished will be imposed this general mercy and soon they will be freed. Yet those who have killed people, raped and set fire or caused to damage people's homestead with explosives or convicted for damaging water-transport whatsoever will not be considered under this act. A Governmental press-note issued on Friday night last says this General amnesty.&lt;ref name="icsforum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icsforum.org/blog/admin/bangabandhu%E2%80%99s-general-amnesty-declaration-evidential-documents-and-relevant-stories/ |title=Bangabandhu's 'General Amnesty' Declaration: Evidential Documents and Relevant Stories |date=24 July 2010|website=International Crimes Strategy Forum Blog |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623180039/http://icsforum.org/blog/admin/bangabandhu%E2%80%99s-general-amnesty-declaration-evidential-documents-and-relevant-stories/ |archive-date=2012-06-23 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It added that,
{{quote|Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman says, Government has declared this general mercy for the people arrested and convicted under Collaborator Act so that people from all corners can enjoy the Victory Day 16th December together indiscriminately and take oath to build our country. Bangabandhu has ordered the Home Ministry to take necessary steps so that these persons can get released from Jail soon and join the victory festival coming on 16th December. The persons freed are urged to be united with spirit of victory and are requested to take the responsibility of working as a safeguard for our independence.&lt;ref name="icsforum" /&gt;}}

As a result of the amnesty, 21,000 prisoners were released on 17 December 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh National day display |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131699092 |newspaper=The Canberra Times |agency=AAP-Reuter |date=18 December 1973 |page=6 |access-date=20 February 2016 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Many prominent collaborators were freed after the declaration gradually.

Khwaja Khairuddin, who was the chief of the Peace Committee was freed from jail on 7 December 1973.&lt;ref name="Momen1980" /&gt; Khairuddin was jailed for life by the tribunals.

Muslim League leader Khan A Sabur was freed from jail on 5 December 1973.&lt;ref name="Momen1980" /&gt;

Shah Azizur Rahman, Wahiduzzaman, Mawlana Abu Zafar Mohammad Saleh, former Awami League leader AKM Shamsul Haque, AKM. Yousuf, Abbas Ali Khan and many others got freed after the declaration.

Among them AKM Yousuf and Khwaja Khairuddin were sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18c3fk_akm-yousuf-xvid&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal of the law==
After the fall of Mujib on 15 August 1972 and unfortunate killing of four top leaders from Bangladesh Awami League, an ordinance was declared which halted the activity under this act. Later on President [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]] repealed the act on 31 December 1975. This gave the lackeys of Pakistani occupational force a complete legal protection from farther facing any kind of trial.

===Text of the ordinance===
Whereas it is expedient to repeal the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 (P.O. No. 8 of 1972), and to provide for certain matters ancillary thereto;

Now, Therefore, in pursuance of the Proclamations of 20 August 1975, and 8 November 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President is pleased to make and promulgate the following Ordinance:-

1.

2. # (1) The Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 (P.O. No. 8 of 1972), hereinafter referred to as the said Order, is hereby repealed.&lt;ref name="bdlaws.minlaw" /&gt;
# (2) Upon the repeal of the said Order under sub-section (1), all trials or other proceedings thereunder pending immediately before such repeal before any Tribunal, Magistrate or Court, and all investigations or other proceedings by or before any Police Officer or other authority under that Order, shall abate and shall not be proceeded with.&lt;ref name="bdlaws.minlaw" /&gt;
# 
# (3) Nothing in sub-section (2) shall be deemed to affect -
# (a) the continuance of any appeal against any conviction or sentence by any Tribunal, Magistrate or Court under the said Order; or
# (b) except to the extent provided in that sub-section, the operation of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (X of 1897).&lt;ref name="bdlaws.minlaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=510&amp;sections_id=13423 |title=2.Repeal of P.O.

'''YUTEL for Peace''' ({{lang-sh|italic=yes|YUTEL za mir}}) was an [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] concert organized by the independent Yugoslav National Broadcasting Agency [[Yutel]], held at the [[Olympic Hall Zetra|Zetra Arena]] in [[Sarajevo]] on Sunday, 28 July 1991 as a protest against the [[Yugoslav wars|war in Yugoslavia]]. The following artists played at the concert: [[Rade Šerbedžija]], [[Bajaga i Instruktori]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Goran Bregović]], [[Haris Džinović]], [[Ekatarina Velika|EKV]], [[Dino Merlin]], [[Indexi]], [[Regina (singer)|Regina]], [[Nele Karajlić]], [[Plavi Orkestar]] and others.

The Concert was originally planned outdoors at the plateau in front of the [[Holiday Inn]] hotel, but was subsequently moved to the Zetra arena because of bad weather conditions. The concert was attended by over thirty thousand spectators, with another fifty thousand left outside of the sold-out venue. The program was hosted by YUTEL [[News presenter|news anchors]] [[Goran Milić]] and [[Gordana Suša]]. The broadcast was only aired in [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]] because the other four channels of the [[Yugoslav Radio Television|Yugoslav national public broadcasting system]] (JRT) refused to carry it.

The '''Depression of 1882–85''' or '''Recession of 1882–85''' was an [[recession|economic contraction]] in the [[United States]] that lasted from March 1882 to May 1885, according to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].  At 38 months in length this is the third-longest recession in the NBER's chronology of business cycles from 1854 to present.  Only the [[Great Depression|Great Depression of 1929-1941]] and the [[Long Depression|Long Depression of 1873–79]] were longer.

==History==
===Origin===

The Depression of 1882-85 was not inaugurated by financial disaster or mass panic, but was rather an economic downturn that came about through a protracted and gradual process.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll D. Wright, [https://archive.org/details/86WrightFirstannualreport ''Industrial Depressions: The First Annual Report of the United States Commissioner of Labor.''] Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1886; pg. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The downturn was preceded by a period of prosperity over the years 1879 to 1882, a growth powered by expansion of the American railroad industry and the opening of economic opportunities associated with the development of the transportation system.&lt;ref name=Sorkin&gt;Alan L. Sorkin, "Depression of 1882-1885," in David Glasner (ed.), ''Business Cycles and Depressions: An Encyclopedia.'' Abingdon, England: Routledge, 1997; pp. 149-151.&lt;/ref&gt; During this interval annual railroad construction quadrupled, growing from 2,665 miles (4,289 km) in 1878 to 11,569 miles (18,619 km) in 1882.&lt;ref name=Sorkin /&gt; According to one 1997 estimate, the expansion of this sector represented a full 15% of American capital formation during the decade of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Walton and Hugh Rockoff, ''History of the American Economy.'' New York: Harcourt Brace, 1997; cited in Sorkin, "Depression of 1882-1885," pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the United States experienced a favorable international balance of trade during the 1879-1882 period of growth — a fact which had the effect of expanding the country's money supply, facilitating credit and investment.&lt;ref name=Sorkin /&gt;

In 1882 this trend reversed, resulting in a decline in railroad construction and a decline in related industries, particularly iron and steel.&lt;ref name=Fels/&gt; Mismanagement and rate wars negatively affected profitability and the luster of railroads as an investment was dulled; money dried up and construction of new lines was negatively impacted, falling from 11,569 miles in 1882 to 6,741 miles in 1883.&lt;ref name=Sorkin /&gt;

===Panic of 1884===
{{main|Panic of 1884}}

A major economic event during the recession was the [[Panic of 1884]].

The 1884 downturn was severe with an estimated 5% of all American factories and mines completely shuttered during the 12 months running from July 1, 1884, to July 1, 1885.&lt;ref name=Wright65&gt;Wright, ''Industrial Depressions,'' pg. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition another 5% of such enterprises were said to have closed down for part of the year.&lt;ref name=Wright65 /&gt; Approximately 1 million American workers were out of work during this economic trough.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Industrial Depressions,'' pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===

Like the [[Long Depression]] that preceded it, the Depression of 1882–85 was more of a [[deflation|price depression]] than a production depression — in that prices and wage rates contracted while gross output remained more or less constant.&lt;ref name=Fels&gt;Rendigs Fels, "The American Business Cycle of 1879-85," ''Journal of Political Economy,'' vol. 60, no. 1 (Feb. 1952), pp. 60–75. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1826297 In JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Contemporary observers were baffled by the downturn and agents of the fledgling U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted extensive surveys on the matter. In a published report by Commissioner of Labor [[Carroll D. Wright]], it was found that explanation of the 1882 depression varied greatly according to the profession of the observer, with bankers and merchants tending to blame financial or commercial reasons, members of the clergy tending to blame social causes combined with divine providence, manufacturers apt to blame regulatory causes and the wage demands of workers, and workers tending to identify [[overproduction]] due to the introduction of new labor-saving machinery and low wage levels that made it impossible to consume the full amount of output.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Industrial Depressions,'' pg. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lengthy alphabetical list of causes claimed by survey respondents was compiled by the Bureau, which included, among other proposed factors, defects in the banking system, place of credit in agriculture, the use of child labor, the negative effects of corporate monopoly, a lack of public confidence in the future of the economy, expansion of the role of silver in the money system due to an unequal price ratio between gold and silver, excessive immigration, the expanded use of labor-saving machinery, a growth of speculative investment and market manipulation, the decline of railway construction, negative effects of a high tariff policy, and the growing consolidation of wealth in the hands of a comparative few.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Industrial Depressions,'' pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

Economic data from the era are very spotty.  Much of what is known comes from the reporting of the business newspaper the ''[[Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref name=Fels/&gt;  In terms of severity, according to [[Victor Zarnowitz]], indexes of business activity show that the recession was not as severe as the declines in 1873, 1893, and 1921, but was more severe than the other recessions between the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Zarnowitz/&gt; At 38 months in length this is the third-longest recession in the NBER's chronology of business cycles from 1854 to present.  Only the [[Great Depression]] and [[Long Depression|Long Depression of 1873–79]] are longer.&lt;ref name=NBER&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html | work = [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] | title = Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions | accessdate = January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19959">'''Failure rate''' is the [[frequency]] with which an [[systems engineering|engineered system]] or component fails, expressed in failures per unit of time.  It is often denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[λ]] (lambda) and is highly used in [[reliability engineering]].

The failure rate of a system usually depends on time, with the rate varying over the life cycle of the system.  For example, an automobile's failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service.  One does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] problems in a new vehicle.

In practice, the [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF, 1/λ) is often reported instead of the failure rate. This is valid and useful if the failure rate may be assumed constant – often used for complex units / systems, electronics – and is a general agreement in some reliability standards (Military and Aerospace). It does in this case ''only'' relate to the flat region of the [[bathtub curve]], which is also called the "useful life period". Because of this, it is incorrect to extrapolate MTBF to give an estimate of the service lifetime of a component, which will typically be much less than suggested by the MTBF due to the much higher failure rates in the "end-of-life wearout" part of the "bathtub curve".

The reason for the preferred use for MTBF numbers is that the use of large positive numbers (such as 2000 hours) is more intuitive and easier to remember than very small numbers (such as 0.0005 per hour).

The MTBF is an important system parameter in systems where failure rate needs to be managed, in particular for safety systems. The MTBF appears frequently in the [[engineering]] design requirements, and governs frequency of required system maintenance and inspections.  In special processes called [[renewal process]]es, where the time to recover from failure can be neglected and the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time, the failure rate is simply the multiplicative inverse of the MTBF (1/λ).

A similar ratio used in the [[transport industry|transport industries]], especially in [[railway]]s and [[Truck driver|trucking]] is "mean distance between failures", a variation which attempts to [[Correlation|correlate]] actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.

Failure rates are important factors in the insurance, finance, commerce and regulatory industries and fundamental to the design of safe systems in a wide variety of applications.

==Failure rate in the discrete sense==

The failure rate can be defined as the following:

:The total number of failures within an item [[statistical population|population]], divided by the total time expended by that population, during a particular measurement interval under stated conditions. (MacDiarmid, ''et al.'')

Although the failure rate, &lt;math&gt;\lambda (t)&lt;/math&gt;, is often thought of as the [[probability]] that a failure occurs in a specified interval given no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it is not actually a probability because it can exceed 1. Erroneous expression of the failure rate in % could result in incorrect perception of the measure, especially if it would be measured from repairable systems and multiple systems with non-constant failure rates or different operation times. It can be defined with the aid of the [[reliability function]], also called the survival function, &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the time to (first) failure distribution (i.e. the failure density function) and &lt;math&gt;R(t)=1-F(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{R(t_1)-R(t_2)}{(t_2-t_1) \cdot R(t_1)}
 = \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)} \!&lt;/math&gt;

over a time interval &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) to &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this is a [[conditional probability]], where the condition is that the failure has not occurred at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator.

Hazard rate and ROCOF (rate of occurrence of failures) are often incorrectly seen as the same and equal to the failure rate. {{clarify|date=April 2015}} To clarify; the more promptly items are repaired, the sooner they will break again, so the higher the ROCOF. The hazard rate is however independent of the time to repair and of the logistic delay time.

==Failure rate in the continuous sense==
{{merge from|Unobserved heterogeneity in duration models|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Loglogistichaz.svg|thumb|right|300px|Hazard function &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; plotted for a selection of [[log-logistic distribution]]s.]]
Calculating the failure rate for ever smaller intervals of time, results in the '''{{visible anchor|hazard function}}''' (also called '''hazard rate'''), &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This becomes the ''instantaneous'' failure rate as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt;/math&gt; tends to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

A continuous failure rate depends on the existence of a '''failure distribution''', &lt;math&gt;F(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[cumulative distribution function]] that describes the probability of failure (at least) up to and including time ''t'',

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pr}(T\le t)=F(t)=1-R(t),\quad t\ge 0. \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the failure time.
The failure distribution function is the integral of the failure [[probability density function|''density'' function]], ''f''(''t''),

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} f(\tau)\, d\tau. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The hazard function can be defined now as

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Exponential pdf.svg|thumb|right|300px|Exponential failure density functions. Each of these has a (different) constant hazard function (see text).]]
Many probability distributions can be used to model the failure distribution (''see [[List of probability distributions|List of important probability distributions]]''). A common model is the '''exponential failure distribution''',

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} \lambda e^{-\lambda \tau}\, d\tau = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is based on the [[exponential distribution|exponential density function]]. The hazard rate function for this is:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)} = \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda t}}{e^{-\lambda t}} = \lambda .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for an exponential failure distribution, the hazard rate is a constant with respect to time (that is, the distribution is "[[memorylessness|memory-less]]").  For other distributions, such as a [[Weibull distribution]] or a [[log-normal distribution]], the hazard function may not be constant with respect to time. For some such as the [[deterministic distribution]] it is [[monotonic]] increasing (analogous to [[Wear and tear|"wearing out"]]), for others such as the [[Pareto distribution]] it is monotonic decreasing (analogous to [[Burn-in|"burning in"]]), while for many it is not monotonic.

==Decreasing failure rate==
A decreasing failure rate (DFR) describes a phenomenon where the probability of an event in a fixed time interval in the future decreases over time. A decreasing failure rate can describe a period of "infant mortality" where earlier failures are eliminated or corrected&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-1-84800-986-8_1 | chapter = Introduction | first = Maxim | last = Finkelstein| title = Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk | series = Springer Series in Reliability Engineering | pages = 1–84 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84800-985-1 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponds to the situation where λ(''t'') is a [[decreasing function]].

Mixtures of DFR variables are DFR.&lt;ref name="brown1980"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = M. | title = Bounds, Inequalities, and Monotonicity Properties for Some Specialized Renewal Processes | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176994773 | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 227 | jstor = 2243267| year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixtures of [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] random variables are [[Hyperexponential distribution|hyperexponentially distributed]].

===Renewal processes===

For a [[renewal process]] with DFR renewal function, inter-renewal times are concave.&lt;ref name="brown1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shanthikumar"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shanthikumar | first1 = J. G. | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176991910 | title = DFR Property of First-Passage Times and its Preservation Under Geometric Compounding | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 16 | pages = 397–406 | year = 1988 | jstor = 2243910| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown conjectured the converse, that DFR is also necessary for the inter-renewal times to be concave,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = M. | title = Further Monotonicity Properties for Specialized Renewal Processes | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176994317 | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 891 | year = 1981 | jstor = 2243747| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; however it has been shown that this conjecture holds neither in the discrete case&lt;ref name="shanthikumar" /&gt; nor in the continuous case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yu | first1 = Y. | title = Concave renewal functions do not imply DFR interrenewal times | doi = 10.1239/jap/1308662647 | journal = Journal of Applied Probability | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 583 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1009.2463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===

Increasing failure rate is an intuitive concept caused by components wearing out. Decreasing failure rate describes a system which improves with age.&lt;ref name="proschan" /&gt;
Decreasing failure rates have been found in the lifetimes of spacecraft, Baker and Baker commenting that "those spacecraft that last, last on and on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Baker | first2 = G. A. S. . | doi = 10.2514/3.28040 | title = Impact of the space environment on spacecraft lifetimes | journal = Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 479 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1980JSpRo..17..479B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9781119994077.ch1 | chapter = On Time, Reliability, and Spacecraft | first1 = Joseph Homer | last1 = Saleh | first2 =Jean-François | last2 =Castet| title = Spacecraft Reliability and Multi-State Failures | pages = 1 | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781119994077 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of aircraft air conditioning systems were individually found to have an [[exponential distribution]], and thus in the pooled population a DFR.&lt;ref name="proschan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Proschan | first1 = F. | title = Theoretical Explanation of Observed Decreasing Failure Rate | doi = 10.1080/00401706.1963.10490105 | journal = Technometrics | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–383 | jstor = 1266340| year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coefficient of variation===

When the failure rate is decreasing the [[coefficient of variation]] is ⩾&amp;nbsp;1, and when the failure rate is increasing the coefficient of variation is ⩽&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wierman | first1 = A. | authorlink1 = Adam Wierman| last2 = Bansal | first2 = N. | last3 = Harchol-Balter | first3 = M.|author3-link=Mor Harchol-Balter | title = A note on comparing response times in the M/GI/1/FB and M/GI/1/PS queues | doi = 10.1016/S0167-6377(03)00061-0 | journal = Operations Research Letters | volume = 32 | pages = 73 | url = http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/papers/fbnote.pdf| year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this result only holds when the failure rate is defined for all t&amp;nbsp;⩾&amp;nbsp;0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Analysis of Queues: Methods and Applications | first = Natarajan | last =Gautam | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2012 | page = 703 | isbn = 1439806586}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the converse result (coefficient of variation determining nature of failure rate) does not hold.

==Failure rate data==
Failure rate [[data]] can be obtained in several ways. The most common means are:
;Historical data about the device or system under consideration: Many organizations maintain internal databases of failure information on the devices or systems that they produce, which can be used to calculate failure rates for those devices or systems. For new devices or systems, the historical data for similar devices or systems can serve as a useful estimate.
;Government and commercial failure rate data: Handbooks of failure rate data for various components are available from government and commercial sources. [[#Online|MIL-HDBK-217F]], ''Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment'', is a [[United States Military Standard|military standard]] that provides failure rate data for many military electronic components. Several failure rate data sources are available commercially that focus on commercial components, including some non-electronic components.
;Testing: The most accurate source of data is to test samples of the actual devices or systems in order to generate failure data. This is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, so that the previous data sources are often used instead.

===Units===
Failure rates can be expressed using any measure of time, but '''hours''' is the most common unit in practice. Other units, such as miles, revolutions, etc., can also be used in place of "time" units.

Failure rates are often expressed in [[engineering notation]] as failures per million, or 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, especially for individual components, since their failure rates are often very low.

The '''Failures In Time''' ('''FIT''') rate of a device is the number of failures that can be expected in one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) device-hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;
Xin Li; Michael C. Huang; Kai Shen; Lingkun Chu.
[http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~kshen/papers/usenix2010-li.pdf "A Realistic Evaluation of Memory Hardware Errors and Software System Susceptibility"].
2010.
p. 6.
&lt;/ref&gt;
(E.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, or some other combination.) This term is used particularly by the [[semiconductor]] industry.

The relationship of FIT to MTBF may be expressed as: MTBF = 1,000,000,000 x 1/FIT.

===Additivity===
Under certain [[engineering]] assumptions (e.g. besides the above assumptions for a constant failure rate, the assumption that the considered system has no relevant [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancies]]), the failure rate for a complex [[system]] is simply the sum of the individual failure rates of its components, as long as the units are consistent, e.g. failures per million hours. This permits testing of individual components or [[subsystem]]s, whose failure rates are then added to obtain the total system failure rate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding "redundant" components to eliminate a [[single point of failure]] improves the mission failure rate, but makes the series failure rate (also called the logistics failure rate) worse—the extra components improve the mean time between critical failures (MTBCF), even though the mean time before something fails is worse.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.quanterion.com/mission-reliability-and-logistics-reliability-a-design-paradox/ "Mission Reliability and Logistics Reliability: A Design Paradox"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical [[confidence interval|confidence]] is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows:

Estimated failure rate is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6\text{ failures}}{7502\text{ hours}} = 0.0007998\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}} = 799.8 \times 10^{-6}\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}}, &lt;/math&gt;

or 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation.

==Estimation==
The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] can be used to estimate the cumulative hazard rate function.

{{History of Vietnam}}
The '''fourth Chinese domination''' was a period of the [[history of Vietnam]], from 1407 to 1427 during which the country was invaded and ruled by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]]. It was the result of the [[Ming–Hồ War|conquest of the region]] in 1406 to 1407. The previous periods of Chinese rules, collectively known as the [[Bắc thuộc]] periods in Vietnam, were longer-lasting, constituting much of Vietnam's history from 111 BC to 939 AD. The fourth Chinese occupation of Vietnam was eventually ended with the establishment of the [[Lê dynasty]].

==History==
===Ming invasion of Vietnam===
{{Main|Ming–Hồ War}}
The former ruling dynasty of [[Đại Việt]], the [[Trần dynasty|Trần]], had relations with the Yuan and Ming Empire as a [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary]]. However, in 1400, [[Hồ Quý Ly]] deposed and massacred the Trần house before usurping the throne. After taking the throne, Hồ renamed the country from Dai Viet to Dai Ngu. In 1402, he abdicated the throne in favor of his son, [[Hồ Hán Thương]] (胡漢蒼).

In October 1404, [[Trần Thiêm Bình]] (陳添平) arrived at the Ming imperial court in [[Nanjing]], claiming to be a Trần prince. He notified the court of the treacherous events that had taken place and appealed to the court for the restoration of his throne.

The [[Yongle Emperor]] of the Ming Empire issued an edict reprimanding the usurper and demanding the restoration of the Tran throne, a pretext to the annexation of Vietnam. As the party crossed the border into [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]], Hồ's forces ambushed them and killed the Trần prince that the Ming convoy were escorting back.

In the winter of 1406, the Ming armies began their invasion. [[Zhang Fu]] and [[Mu Sheng]] departed from Guangxi and Yunnan respectively to launch a [[pincer attack]] into enemy territory. On 19 November 1406, they captured the two capitals and other important cities in the [[Red River Delta]].  Hồ Quý Ly and his son were captured on 16 June 1407, they were caged and brought as prisoners to the Yongle Emperor in Nanjing.

===Revolt of Trần aristocrats===
{{Main|Later Trần dynasty}}
There was several revolts among the Vietnamese people against the Ming authorities, only to be crushed by the Ming army. Among the people who led the rebellion were, [[Trần Ngỗi]] (revolted 1407–09), a young son of the late [[Tran dynasty|Trần]] emperor [[Trần Nghệ Tông]] and [[Trần Quý Khoáng]], a nephew. These revolts were short-lived and poorly planned but they helped lay some of the groundwork for Lê Lợi's  war for independence.

===Lam Sơn uprising===
{{Main|Lam Sơn uprising}}
[[Lê Lợi]], one of Vietnam's most celebrated heroes, is credited with rescuing the country from Ming domination in 1428. Born of a wealthy landowning family, he served as a senior scholar-official until the advent of the Ming, whom he refused to serve. After a decade of gathering a resistance movement around him, Le Loi and his forces finally defeated the Ming army in 1428. Rather than putting to death the captured Ming soldiers and administrators, he magnanimously provided ships and supplies to send them back to China. Le Loi then ascended the Vietnamese throne, taking the reign name [[Lê Thái Tổ]] and establishing the [[Lê dynasty]] (1428–1788).

==Suppression of Vietnamese culture==
When the Ming invaded; all classical Vietnamese printing blocks, books and materials were burned and suppressed. Vietnamese records like gazettes, maps, and registers were instructed to be burned, saved for one copy.&lt;ref&gt;http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/916&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy was strictly enforced by Yongle emperor. His command to the army in Vietnam in July 1406 is as follow:

兵入。除釋道經板經文不燬。外一切書板文字以至俚俗童蒙所習。如上大人丘乙已之類。片紙隻字悉皆燬之。其境內中國所立碑刻則存之。但是安南所立者悉壞之。一字不存。

"Once our army enter Annam (Vietnam currently), except Buddhist and Taoist text; all books and notes, including folklore and children book, should be burnt. The stelas erected by China should be protected carefully, while those erected by Annamese (Vietnamese currently), should be completely annihilated, do not spare even one character."

Yongle's command on 21 May 1407 read:

"I have repeatedly told you all to burnt all Annamese books, including folklore and children books and the local stelas should be destroyed immediately upon sight. Recently I heard our soldiers hesitated and read those books before burning them. Most soldiers do not know how to read, if this policy is adapted widely, it will be a waste of our time. Now you have to strictly obey my previous command, and burnt all local books upon sight, without hesitation."

For this reason almost no vernacular [[chữ nôm]] texts survive from before the Ming invasion. Various ancient sites such as pagoda Bao Minh were looted and destroyed. The Ming dynasty applied various [[Sinicization]] policies to spread more [[Chinese culture]] in the occupied nation.

==Economy==
The Ming government began a harsh rule of both colonization and sinicization. Valuable artifacts such as gems, jade, gold, pieces of art as well as craftsmen were transported to China. The Chinese had greatly encouraged the development and the use of gold and silver mines. But right after the silver and gold were extracted they impounded them and sent a fraction of these minerals to [[Beijing]]. They also imposed salt taxes, but a slightly heavier tax against those who produced salt in Annam.

==Military and administration==
Non-Han ethnic minorities fought in the Chinese army against the Ho.&lt;ref&gt;http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/906&lt;/ref&gt; It was instructed that the Ming army should free foreign prisoners who were jailed in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/920&lt;/ref&gt;

To keep the people under control in Vietnam, the Ming government issued, and utilized the "''So Ho''" system, (literally meaning ''Family Book'') at the lowest village community level. Whenever there was a change in a family, a change in the book was recorded and approved. Based on this information, they created a systematic military service enrollment process for all young men deemed fit enough to serve in the future for the [[Imperial Chinese Army]]. This process was no different than what other governments did to subjugated areas, nonetheless, this had created a negative feeling against the Chinese government.
In addition, many talented Vietnamese individuals with varying trades and backgrounds who could make significant contributions were allowed to become government officials in China where they served in the Chinese imperial government.

The Ming's ethnic Vietnamese collaborators included Mac Thuy whose grandfather was [[Mạc Đĩnh Chi]] who was a direct ancestor of [[Mạc Đăng Dung]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2013 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

The conquest of Champa was enabled when Vietnam's north received gunpowder weapons from the Ming dynasty along with Neo-Confucianist thought.&lt;ref name="Kyong-McClainDu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Kyong-McClain|author2=Yongtao Du|title=Chinese History in Geographical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9OSLSLWzJUC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=confucianism+in+vietnam+kelley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M9QqApXWtx&amp;sig=yNWQEJOJHf1tFr1acEhmNjQaD34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj5cm7qrXOAhXICsAKHRcZDKIQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=confucianism%20in%20vietnam%20kelley&amp;f=false|year=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7391-7230-8|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was recorded that the union of Vietnamese women and Chinese (Ngô) men produced offspring which were left behind in Vietnam, and the Chams, Cẩu Hiểm, Laotians, these people, and Vietnamese natives who collaborated with the Ming were made into slaves of the Le government in the [[Complete Annals of Đại Việt]].&lt;ref&gt;https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2016/08/02/the-ngo-in-the-du-dia-chi-were-not-the-ming/#comment-56679&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no mandatory required reparation of the voluntarily remaining Ming Chinese in Vietnam. The return of the Ming Chinese to China was commanded by the Ming and not Le Loi. The Trai made up the supporters of Le Loi in his campaign. He lived among the Trai at the border regions as their leader and seized the Ming ruled lowland Kinh areas after originally forming his base in the southern highland regions. The southern dwelling Trai and Red River dwelling Vietnamese were in effect locked in a "civil war" during the anti Ming rebellion by Le Loi.&lt;ref name="Taylor2013 3"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. W.

{{Campaignbox Georgian-Seljuk wars}}
'''Georgian–Seljuk wars''', also known as '''Georgian Reconquista'''&lt;ref&gt;[[René Grousset]], ''L'Empire du Levant : Histoire de la Question d'Orient'', [[1949]], {{p.|417}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a long series of battles and military clashes that took place from {{Circa}} 1048 until 1213,  between the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and the different [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuqid states]] that occupied most of [[Transcaucasia]]. The conflict is preceded by deadly raids in the Caucasus by the Turks in the 11th century, known in Georgian [[historiography]] as the [[Great Turkish Invasion]].

== Background ==
{{main|Byzantine–Georgian wars}}In 1048-9, the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] under [[Ibrahim Inal|Ibrahim Yinal]] made their first incursion in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier region of [[Iberia (theme)|Iberia]]. The emperor [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine IX]] requested help from the Georgian [[duke]] of [[Liparit IV, Duke of Kldekari|Liparit IV of Kldekari]], whom the Byzantines had aided in his [[Byzantine–Georgian wars#Liparit IV of Kldekari|struggle]] against the Georgian king [[Bagrat IV of Georgia|Bagrat IV]]. Liparit, who had been fighting on the Byzantine side, was captured at the [[Battle of Kapetron]]. Bagrat took advantage of this, and acquired his possessions. 

Although the Byzantine Empire and Georgia had centuries-long cultural and religious ties, and the Seljuqs posed a substantial threat to the empire itself, Constantinople’s aggressiveness on the Caucasian political scene contributed to an atmosphere of distrust and recrimination, and prevented the two Christian nations from effective cooperation against the common threat. With assertion of the Georgian [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagratid]] [[hegemony]] in the Caucasus being the cornerstone of Bagrat’s reign, his policy can be understood as the attempt to play the Seljuqs and Byzantines off against one another.&lt;ref name="Garland"&gt;Lynda Garland &amp; Stephen Rapp. ''Mary 'of Alania': Woman and Empress Between Two Worlds'', pp. 94–5. In: Lynda Garland (ed., 2006), ''Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience, 800–1200''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7546-5737-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial Conflicts: 1060–1080 ==
[[File:Seljuk Empire locator map.svg|thumb|241x241px|[[Seljuk Empire]] at its greatest extent in 1092, upon the death of [[Malik-Shah I|Malik Shah I]]]]The second half of the 11th century was marked by the strategically significant invasion of the Seljuq Turks, who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast empire including most of [[Central Asia]] and [[Iran|Persia]]. The Seljuqs made their first appearances in Georgia in the 1060s, when the Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] laid waste to the south-western provinces of the Georgian kingdom and reduced [[First Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]]. These intruders were part of the same wave of the Turkish movement which inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] army at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] in 1071.&lt;ref name="Suny-34"&gt;{{harvnb|Suny|1994|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Seljuk threat prompted the Georgian and Byzantine governments to seek a closer cooperation. To secure the alliance, Bagrat’s daughter [[Maria of Alania|Maria]] married, at some point between 1066 and 1071, to the Byzantine co-emperor [[Michael VII Doukas|Michael VII Ducas]]. The choice of a Georgian princess was unprecedented, and it was seen in Georgia as a diplomatic success on Bagrat's side.&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Garland with Stephen H. Rapp Jr. (2006). [http://www.roman-emperors.org/maryal.htm Mart'a-Maria 'of Alania']. ''An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors''. Retrieved on 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 1068, Alp Arslan, dissatisfied with the act of the last Caucasian monarch that he had not yet submitted, accompanied by the kings of [[Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget|Lorri]] and [[First Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] as well as the [[Emirate of Tbilisi|emir of Tbilisi]] marched against Bagrat again. The provinces of [[Kartli]] and [[Argveti]] were occupied and pillaged. Bagrat’s long-time rivals, the [[Shaddadids]] of [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], were given compensation: the fortresses of Tbilisi and Rustavi. As soon as Alp Arslan left Georgia, Bagrat recovered Kartli in July 1068. [[Fadl ibn Muhammad|Al-Fadl I b. Muhammad]], of the Shaddadids, encamped at Isani (a suburb of Tbilisi on the left bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]]) and with 33,000 men ravaged the countryside. Bagrat defeated him, however, and forced the Shaddadid troops to flight. On the road through Kakheti, Fadl was taken prisoner by the local ruler [[Aghsartan I of Kakheti|Aghsartan]]. At the price of conceding several fortresses on the [[Iori (river)|Iori River]], Bagrat ransomed Fadl and received from him the surrender of Tbilisi where he reinstated a local emir on the terms of vassalage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Minorsky|V. Minorsky]], "Tiflis", p. 754. In: M. Th. Houtsma, E. van Donzel (1993), ''E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936''. Brill, {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last years of Bagrat's reign coincided with what Professor [[David Marshall Lang]] described as "''the final débacle of eastern Christendom''" — the [[Battle of Manzikert]] — in which Alp Arslan dealt a crushing defeat to the Byzantine army, capturing the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes|Romanos IV]], who soon died in misery. Bagrat IV died the following year, on 24 November 1072, and was buried at the [[Martvili Monastery|Chkondidi Monastery]]. The suzerainty over the troubled kingdom of Georgia passed to his son George II.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1966), ''The Georgians'', p. 111. Praeger Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgians were able to recover [[Iberia (theme)|theme of Iberia]], by the help of Byzantine governor, [[Gregory Pakourianos]], who began to evacuate the region shortly after the disaster inflicted by the Seljuks on the Byzantine army at Manzikert. On this occasion, [[George II of Georgia]] was bestowed with the Byzantine title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', granted the fortress of [[Kars]] and put in charge of the Imperial Eastern limits.

=== Great Turkish Invasion ===
{{main|Great Turkish Invasion}}Although the Georgians were able to recover from Alp Arslan's invasion, the Byzantine withdrawal from [[Anatolia]] brought them in more direct contact with the Seljuqs. In the 1070s, Georgia was twice attacked by the Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik Shah I]], but the Georgian King George II [[Battle of Partskhisi|was still able to fight back]] at times.&lt;ref name="Thomson-310"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|1996|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1076 Malik Shah surged into Georgia and reduced many settlements to ruins, from 1079/80 onward, George was pressured into submitting to Malik-Shah to ensure a precious degree of peace at the price of an annual [[tribute]]. George's acceptance of the Seljuq suzerainty did not bring a real peace for Georgia. The Turks continued their seasonal movement into the Georgian territory to make use of the rich herbage of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura valley]] and the Seljuq garrisons occupied the key fortresses in Georgia's south.&lt;ref name="Allen-98"&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1932|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inroads and settlements had a ruinous effect on Georgia's economic and political order. Cultivated lands were turned into pastures for the nomads and peasant farmers were compelled to seek safety in the mountains.&lt;ref name="Suny-342"&gt;{{harvnb|Suny|1994|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

George II was able to garner the Seljuk military support in his campaign aimed at bringing the eastern Georgian kingdom of [[First Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]], which had long resisted the Bagratid attempts of annexation. However, tired with a protracted siege of the Kakhetian stronghold of [[Vezhini]], George abandoned the campaign when snow fell. The Seljuk auxiliaries also lifted the siege and plundered the fertile Iori Valley in Kakheti. [[Aghsartan I of Kakheti|Aghsartan I]], king of Kakheti, went to the sultan to declare his submission, and in token of loyalty embraced [[Islam]], thus winning a Seljuk protection against the aspirations of the Georgian crown.&lt;ref&gt;Lordkipanidze, Mariam Davydovna; Hewitt, George B. (1987), ''Georgia in the XI-XII Centuries'', pp. 76–78. Ganatleba Publishers: Tbilisi.&lt;/ref&gt;

George II’s wavering character and incompetent political decisions coupled with the Seljuk yoke brought the Kingdom of Georgia into a profound crisis which climaxed in the aftermath of a [[1088 Tmogvi earthquake|disastrous earthquake]] that struck Georgia in 1088.

=== David IV ===
[[File:King_David_Aghmashenebeli.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:King_David_Aghmashenebeli.jpg|left|thumb|246x246px|[[David IV of Georgia]], a fresco from the [[Shio-Mgvime monastery]]]][[File:David_IV_map_de.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:David_IV_map_de.png|thumb|Expansion of Kingdom of Georgia under [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]]'s reign.|250x250px]]Watching his kingdom slip into chaos, [[George II of Georgia|George II]] ceded the crown to his 16-year-old son [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] in 1089. King David IV proved to be a capable statesman and military commander. As he came of age under the guidance of his court minister, [[George of Chqondidi]], David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1089–1100, he organized small detachments to harass and destroy isolated Seljuk troops and began the resettlement of desolate regions. By 1099 David IV's power was considerable enough that he was able to refuse paying [[tribute]] to Seljuqs. In 1104 David’s supporters in the eastern Georgian province of [[Kakheti]], nobles: Baramisdze and Arshiani captured the local king [[Aghsartan II of Kakheti|Aghsartan II]] (1102–1104), a loyal tributary of the Seljuk [[Sultan]] [[Barkiyaruq]] (&lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt;1092-1105), and reunited the area with the rest of Georgia. Following the annexation of Kakheti, in 1105, David routed a Seljuk punitive force at the [[Battle of Ertsukhi]], leading to momentum that helped him to secure the key fortresses of [[Samshvilde]], [[Rustavi]], [[Kiş, Shaki|Gishi]], and [[Lori Fortress|Lori]] between 1110 and 1118.[[File:Didgori_battle_campaign_map_1121.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Didgori_battle_campaign_map_1121.png|thumb|After pillaging the [[County of Edessa]], Seljuqid commander [[Ilghazi]] made peace with the [[Crusades|Crusaders]]. In 1121 he went north towards [[Armenia]] and with supposedly up to 250 000 - 350 000 troops, including men led by his son-in-law Sadaqah and Sultan Malik of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], he invaded Georgia.|250x250px]]To strengthen his army, King David launched a major military reform in 1118–1120 and [[Kipchaks in Georgia|resettled]] several thousand [[Kipchaks]] from the northern steppes to frontier districts of Georgia. In return, the Kipchaks provided one soldier per family, allowing King David to establish a standing army in addition to his royal troops (known as [[Monaspa]]). The new army provided the king with a much-needed force to fight both external threats and internal discontent of powerful lords. The Georgian-Kipchak alliance was facilitated by [[Family of David IV of Georgia|David's earlier marriage]] to the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]'s daughter. Starting in 1120, King David began a more aggressive policy of expansion. He entered the neighbouring [[Shirvan]] and took the town of [[Qabala District|Qabala]]. In the winter of 1120–1121 the Georgian troops successfully attacked the Seljuk settlements on the eastern and southwestern approaches to the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasus]]. Muslim powers became increasingly concerned about the rapid rise of a Christian state in southern Caucasia. In 1121, [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq|Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad]] ({{Circa}} 1118–1131) declared a [[Religious war|holy war]] on Georgia. However, 12 August 1121, King David routed the enemy army on the fields of [[Battle of Didgori|Didgori]], with fleeing Seljuq Turks being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. A huge amount of booty and prisoners were captured by David's army, which had also [[Siege of Tbilisi (1122)|secured Tbilisi]], the last Muslim enclave remaining from the Arab occupation, in 1122 and moved the Georgian capital there and inaugurated [[Georgian Golden Age|Georgia's Golden Age]].&lt;ref name="javaxisvili"&gt;{{ka icon}} [[Ivane Javakhishvili|Javakhishvili, Ivane]] (1982), ''k'art'veli eris istoria'' (The History of the Georgian Nation), vol. 2, pp. 184-187. [[Tbilisi State University]] Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1123, David’s army liberated [[Dmanisi]], the last Seljuk stronghold in southern Georgia. In 1124, David finally conquered [[Shirvan]] and took the [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenian]] city of [[Ani]] from the Muslim [[Emir|emirs]], thus expanding the borders of his kingdom to the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]] basin. Armenians met him as a liberator providing some auxiliary force for his army.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Demetrius I ===
The kingdom continued to flourish under [[Demetrius I of Georgia|Demetrius I]], the son of David. Although his reign saw a disruptive family conflict related to royal succession, Georgia remained a centralized power with a strong military. As soon as, he ascended to the throne, the neighbouring Muslim rulers began attacking Georgia from all sides. The Seljuqid sultans fought to restore the rule of the [[Shirvanshah|Shirvanshahs]]. Shirvan's large Muslim population rose against Georgia. This probably happened in 1129 or 1130, when Demetrius restored the Shirvanshahs to power in [[Shirvan]], installing on the throne [[Manuchihr II of Shirvan|Manuchihr II]], the husband of his daughter [[Rusudan, daughter of Demetrius I of Georgia|Rusudan]]. Shirvanshahs had to provide the Georgian king with troops whenever the latter demanded it.

In 1130 Georgia was attacked by the [[Sultan]] of Ahlat, [[Shah-Armens|Shah-Armen]] [[Sökmen II]] ({{Circa}}1128-1183). This war was started by the passage of Ani into the hands of the Georgians; Demetrius I had to compromise and give up [[Ani]] to [[Fadl ibn Mahmud]] on terms of [[Vassal|vassalage]] and inviolability of the Christian churches. In 1139, Demetrius raided the city of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] in [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]]. He brought the [[Ancient Gates of Ganja|iron gate]] of the defeated city to Georgia and donated it to [[Gelati Monastery]] at [[Kutaisi]]. Despite this brilliant victory, Demetrius could hold Ganja only for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|last1=Rayfield|first1=Donald|date=2013|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1780230702|page=100|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1442241466|edition=2|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply to this, the sultan of Eldiguzids attacked Ganja several times, and in 1143 the town again jell to the sultan. According to [[Mkhitar Gosh]], Demetrius ultimately gained possession of Ganja, but, when he gave his daughter in marriage to the sultan, he presented the latter with the town as dowry, and the sultain appointed his own emir to rule it.

Fadl's successor, [[Fakr al-Din Shaddad ibn Mahmud|Fakr al-Din Shaddad]], a [[Shaddadids|Shaddadid]] emir of Ani asked for [[Saltuk II|Saltuk]]'s daughter's hand, however Saltuk refused him. This caused a deep hatred in Shaddad towards Saltuk. In 1154 he planned a plot and formed a secret alliance with the Demetrius I. While a Georgian army waited in ambush, he offered tribute to [[Saltukids]], ruler of [[Erzurum|Erzerum]] and asked the latter to acccept him as a vassal. In 1153-1154 Emir [[Saltuk II]] marched on Ani, but Shaddad informed his suzerain, the King of Georgia, of this. Demetrius marched to Ani, defeated and captured the emir. At the request of neighbouring Muslim rulers and released him for a ransom of 100,000 [[Dinar|dinars]], paid by Saltuk's sons in law and Saltuk swore not to fight against the Georgians he returned home.&lt;ref name="YS"&gt;Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''Türkiye tarihi Cilt I'', AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991, p 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== George III ===
Demetrius was succeeded by his son [[George III of Georgia|George III]] in 1156, beginning a stage of more offensive foreign policy. The same year he ascended to the throne, George launched a successful campaign against the [[Shah-Armens]]. It may be said that the Shah-Armen took part in almost all the campaigns undertaken against Georgia between 1130s to 1160s. Moreover, Shah-Armens enlisted the assistance of Georgian feudals disaffected with the Georgian monarchs and gave them asylum. In 1156 the Ani's Christian population rose against the emir [[Fakr al-Din Shaddad ibn Mahmud|Fakr al-Din Shaddad]], and turned the town over to his brother [[Fadl ibn Mahmud]]. But Fadl, too, apparently could not satisfy the people of Ani, and this time the town was offered to the George III, who took advantage of this offer and subjugated Ani, appointing his general [[House of Orbeli|Ivane Orbeli]] as its ruler in 1161. 

A coalition consisting of the ruler of Ahlat, Shah-Armen [[Sökmen II]], the ruler of [[Diyarbakır|Diyarbekir]], [[Artuqids#Mardin Branch|Kotb ad-Din il-Ghazi]], Al-Malik of Erzerum, and others was formed as soon as the Georgians seized the town, but the latter defeated the allies. He then marched against one of the members of the coalition, the king of Erzerum, and in the same year, 1161, defeated and made him prisoner, but then released him for a large ransom. The capture of Ani and the defeat of the Saltukid-forces enabled the Georgian king to march on [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]. The following year in August/September 1162, Dvin was temporarily occupied and sacked, the non-Christian population was pillaged and the Georgian troops returned home loaded with booty. The king appointed Ananiya, a member of the local feudal nobility to govern the town. 
[[File:Shaddadid.gif|thumb|Caucasus region during 1072–1174.|250x250px]]
A coalition of [[Muslim]] rulers led by [[Eldiguz|Shams al-Din Eldiguz]], ruler of [[Adurbadagan|Adarbadagan]] and some other regions, embarked upon a campaign against Georgia in early 1163. He was joined by the Shah-Armen Sökmen II, Ak-Sunkur, ruler of [[Maragheh|Maragha]], and others. With an army of 50,000 troops they marched on Georgia. The Georgian army was defeated. The enemy took the [[Gagi Fortress|fortress of Gagi]], laid waste as far as the region of Gagi and [[Gegharkunik Province|Gegharkunik]], seized prisoners and booty, and then moved to Ani. The Muslim rulers were jubilant, and they prepared for a new campaign. However, this time they were forestalled by George III, who marched into [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] at the beginning of 1166, occupied a region extending to [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], devastated the land and turn back with prisoners and booty.

There seemed to be no end to the war between George III and [[atabeg]] [[Eldiguz]]. But the belligerents were exhausted to such an extent that Eldiguz proposed an armistice. George had no choice but to make peace. He restored Ani to its former rulers, the [[Shaddadids]], who became his vassals. The Shaddadids, ruled the town for about 10 years, but in 1174 King George took the [[Shahanshah ibn Mahmud]] as a prisoner and occupied Ani once again. Ivane Orbeli, was appointed governor of the town.

In 1177 George III faced the revolt of [[House of Orbeli]]. Ivane decided to request aid from neighbouring kingdoms. In particular, they requested aid from Shah-Armens and Eldiguzids, but no assistance was forthcoming. George III was able to crush the revolt and embarked on a crackdown campaign on the defiant aristocratic clans; Ivane Orbeli was put to death and the surviving members of his family were driven out of Georgia. [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli|Sargis I Mkhargrdzeli]] was appointed as a governor of Ani. In 1178, George III appointed his daughter and heiress [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] as [[heir apparent]] and co-ruler to forestall any dispute after his death. However, he remained co-regent until his death in 1184.

Tamar was successful in neutralizing this opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by the decline of the hostile [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq Turks]]. Relying on a powerful military [[Elite|élite]], Tamar was able to build an empire which dominated the [[Caucasus]] until its collapse under the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks within two decades after Tamar's death.

Once Tamar succeeded in consolidating her power and found a reliable support in [[David Soslan]], the [[Mkhargrdzeli]], [[House of Toreli|Toreli]], and other noble families, she revived the expansionist foreign policy of her predecessors. Repeated occasions of dynastic strife in Georgia combined with the efforts of regional successors of the [[Seljuk Empire|Great Seljuq Empire]], such as the [[Eldiguzids]], [[Shirvanshah|Shirvanshahs]], and the [[Shah-Armens|Ahlatshahs]], had slowed down the dynamic of the Georgians achieved during the reigns of Tamar's great-grandfather, [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]], and her father, George III. However, the Georgians became again active under Tamar, more prominently in the second decade of her rule.

Early in the 1190s, the Georgian government began to interfere in the affairs of the Eldiguzids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing [[Shirvan]] to a tributary state. The Eldiguzid atabeg [[Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr]] attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the [[Battle of Shamkor]]&lt;ref name="Suny-39"&gt;{{harvnb|Suny|1994|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Eldiguzids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Kenneth Allin.

Retrieved on 2006-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of liberation of Armenia remained of prime importance in Georgia's foreign policy. Tamar's armies led by two Christianised [[Kurds|Kurdish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuehn|2011|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; generals, [[Zakaria II Mkhargrdzeli|Zakare]] and [[Ivane Mkhargrdzeli]] overran fortresses and cities towards the [[Ararat Plain]], reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers.[[File:Seljuk Sultanate of Rum 1190 Locator Map.svg|left|thumb|The [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] in 1190]]Alarmed by the Georgian successes, [[Suleiman II (Rûm)|Süleymanshah II]], the resurgent Seljuqid [[Sultanate of Rum|sultan of Rûm]], rallied his vassal [[Emir|emirs]] and marched against Georgia, but his camp was attacked and destroyed by David Soslan at the [[Battle of Basian]] in 1203 or 1204. The chronicler of Tamar describes how the army was assembled at the rock-hewn town of [[Vardzia]] before marching on to Basian and how the queen addressed the troops from the balcony of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eastmond|1998|p=121}}; {{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|pp=150–151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting her success in this battle, between 1203-1205 Georgians seized the town of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered [[Ahlat|Akhlatshah]] possessions twice and subdued the emir of [[Kars]] (vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum), [[Shah-Armens|Akhlatshahs]], the emirs of [[Saltukids|Erzurum]] and [[House of Mengüjek|Erzincan]].

In 1206 the Georgian army, under the command of [[David Soslan]], captured [[Kars]] and other fortresses and strongholds along the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]]. This campaign was evidently started because the ruler of Erzerum refused to submit to Georgia. The emir of Kars requested aid from the [[Shah-Armens|Akhlatshahs]], but the latter was unable to respond, it was soon taken over by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid Sultanate]] In 1207.[[File:Georgian_invasion_of_northern_Iran.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Georgian_invasion_of_northern_Iran.png|alt=|thumb|[[Georgian expedition to Iran]] in 1208 and 1210-1211 years.]]In 1209, the brothers Mkhargrzeli [[Georgian expedition to Iran|laid waste]] to [[Ardabil]] – according to the Georgian and Armenian annals – as a revenge for the local Muslim ruler's attack on Ani and his massacre of the city's Christian population.&lt;ref name="Lordkipanidze-154"&gt;{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a great final burst, the brothers led an army marshaled throughout Tamar's possessions and vassal territories in a march, through [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] and [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], to [[Marand]], [[Tabriz]], and [[Qazvin]] in northwest [[Iran]], pillaging several settlements on their way.&lt;ref name="Lordkipanidze-154" /&gt; Georgians reached countries where nobody had heard of either their name or existence. These victories brought Georgia to the summit of its power and glory, establishing a pan-Caucasian Empire that extended from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Lake Van]].

== Consequences ==
[[George IV of Georgia|George IV]] continued Tamar's policy. He [[Siege of Ganja (1213)|put down the revolts]] in neighbouring [[Muslim]] vassal states in the 1210s and began preparations for a large-scale campaign against [[Jerusalem]] to support the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] in 1220. However, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] approach to the Georgian borders made the Crusade plan unrealistic. The first [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol expedition]] defeated Georgian armies in 1221–1222. George IV died fighting them in 1223 and his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Rusudan]] made a desperate alliance against Mongols when she and her daughter [[Gürcü Hatun|Tamar]] married to Seljuk princes of [[Erzurum]] and [[Sultanate of Rum]]. The former enemies were now the closest allies ([[Battle of Köse Dağ]]) but that did not prevent the Mongol advance.

The '''Granny Smith Festival''' is an annual festival held in [[Eastwood, New South Wales]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], Australia. It began in 1985 and is now the largest annual event of its type in Sydney's [[Northern Suburbs (Sydney)|Northern District]], attracting over 80,000 people each year.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ryde.nsw.gov.au/Community/Special+Events/Granny+Smith+Festival Granny Smith Festival]". [[City of Ryde]]. Retrieved 4 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is held on and around Eastwood Oval on the third Saturday of October to commemorate 19th-century pioneer [[Maria Ann Smith|Maria Ann "Granny" Smith]], credited with producing the [[Granny Smith|Granny Smith apple]] and celebrated for providing the [[Ryde]]-[[Hunters Hill]] area with prosperity. The festival begins at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am and concludes at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm.

The highlights are the Grand Parade down Rowe Street and the fireworks display. There are also stalls, community events, live entertainment, and rides. It is a festival tradition that the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]] lead the Grand Parade.

==Festivals by year==

===2007===
The Granny Smith Festival in 2007 was of particular significance, in that it became a major campaign venue for the [[Australian federal election, 2007]]. For the first time in the Festival's 22-year history, it was officially opened by the (then) local [[Member of Parliament]], [[Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]]. There were speculations that his appearance was largely due to the emergence of a serious challenge towards not just his Coalition government, but indeed his very own parliamentary seat of [[Division of Bennelong|Bennelong]], from high-profile [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] candidate [[Maxine McKew]]. Apart from Howard and McKew, a number of other local politicians, along with hundreds of volunteers representing numerous political parties and interest groups, attended the Festival, with a large contingent of media crew following their campaign trails.

===2008===
The 2008 Granny Smith Festival was of important significance with the [[Ryde by-election, 2008|Ryde by-election]] being held on the same day, Saturday October 18. This was triggered by the resignation of [[John Watkins (Australian politician)|John Watkins]] who was the MP for [[Electoral district of Ryde|Ryde]] since 1995. An estimated 280 stores were set up in the 2008 event.

'''Iftach Spector''' (born 20 October 1940) is a retired [[Israel]]i [[brigadier general]], a former fighter pilot and commander of the airbases at [[Tel Nof Airbase|Tel Nof]] and [[Ramat David Airbase|Ramat David]]. He serves on the Israel Advisory Council of the [[Israel Policy Forum]].

== Biography ==
Spector was born in [[Petah Tikva]], in what was then [[Mandate Palestine]], in 1940. His parents were both members of the [[Palmach]], the elite strike force of the [[Haganah]]. His father, Zvi Spector, was the commander of [[Operation Boatswain]], a failed 1941 Palmach mission in Lebanon that resulted in the deaths of all participants, and his mother, Shoshana Spector, was among the founding members of the Palmach and served as its adjutant officer. Spector grew up on kibbutz [[Givat Brenner]] and kibbutz [[Hulata]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Spector saw action in the [[Six-Day War]], and was one of the pilots involved in the [[USS Liberty incident|USS ''Liberty'' incident]]. He took part in [[Operation Rimon 20]], an air battle between Israel and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[War of Attrition]], later fought in the [[Yom Kippur War]], and participated in [[Operation Opera]], Israel's 1981 bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor. During his service with the Israeli Air Force, Spector commanded [[101 Squadron (Israel)|101]] and [[107 Squadron (Israel)|107 squadrons]] and both the air bases at [[Ramat David Airbase|Ramat David]] and [[Tel Nof]]. Spector shot down 12 enemy aircraft, eight while flying the [[Mirage III]] and four while flying the [[F-4 Phantom II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aloni|first=Shlomo|title=Israeli Mirage and Nesher Aces|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1-84176-653-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NitWvqWK028C|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aloni|first=Shlomo|title=Israeli Phantom II Aces|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1-84176-783-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKyWYMkW960C|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 he was awarded the [[Yitzhak Sadeh Prize]] for his book ''A Dream in Black and Azure'', a novelized account of a fighter squadron during the [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{He icon}} [http://www.galili.org.il/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=84 The Center for Defence Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114015341/http://galili.org.il/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=84 |date=2015-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, he has been active in the Movement for Disengagement from the Palestinians. In 2003, Spector was one of 27 reserve pilots and former pilots exempt from reserve duty to sign "[[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military#Pilots' letter incident|The pilots' letter]]" refusing to fly missions against targets in the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;David Rodman, 'Book Reviews', ''Israel Affairs'', 16:2, 322–333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Levy]] [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.605001 'Lowest deeds from loftiest heights.'] ''[[Haaretz]]'' 14 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.in/dp/076033630X?_encoding=UTF8&amp;isInIframe=0&amp;n=976389031&amp;ref_=dp_proddesc_0&amp;s=books&amp;showDetailProductDesc=1#product-description_feature_div&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illegal emigration''' refers to a person moving across national borders in a way that violates [[emigration]] laws. Such a person may legally go abroad and refuse to return when demanded by the country of origin.

Special cases are when one flees a country as a [[refugee]] escaping persecution or, after committing a crime, trying to escape prosecution. However, a person who enters another country as an [[illegal immigrant]] may be sent back, and if a criminal, a person may face [[extradition]] or prosecution in the other country.

The position of the [[United Nations]] is that freedom to emigrate is a human right, part of the right to [[freedom of movement]]. According to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], "Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country".

==History==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
While illegal emigration is a concept at least as old as the North American colonies, a [[Freedom of movement]] policy has appeared at least in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Eastern Bloc==
{{Cleanup rewrite|it is poorly written and reads like a list in many places|section|date=June 2018}}
{{Main|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Berlin Wall}}
The [[Russian Republic]] implemented emigration restrictions two months after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], with the various [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]] thereafter banning emigration. After the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] from countries occupied by the Soviet Union during [[World War II]], Eastern Bloc countries instituted emigration bans similar to those in the Soviet Union. After the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, emigration except for ethnic migration reasons mostly halted from east-to-west. A few thousand [[Berlin Wall#Escape attempts|escape attempts from East Germany]] occurred, including those by [[defector|defecting]] border guards. (More generally, escape by any citizen was considered defection.)

Soviet Emigration and any travel abroad were not allowed without an [[Passport system in the Soviet Union|explicit permission from the government]] and [[KGB]].&lt;ref name="dowty70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who were not allowed to leave the country are known as [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|"refuseniks"]]. During the final stages of [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union]] began the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by directly annexing several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]]; these were effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. These included Eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; part of eastern [[Finland]] (became [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name="stalinswars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirer794"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],&lt;ref name="granville"&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of Romania]], the [[People's Republic of Albania]],&lt;ref name="cook17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[East Germany]] from the Soviet zone of German occupation.&lt;ref name="wettig96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc (along with China, Mongolia and North Korea).&lt;ref name="dowty114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 1952, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places.&lt;ref name="dowty121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, before 1961, most of that east-west flow took place between East and West Germany, with over 3.5 million East Germans emigrating to West Germany.&lt;ref name="mynz221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mynz|1995|p=2.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senate Chancellery, Governing Mayor of Berlin, [http://www.berlin.de/mauer/geschichte/index.en.html ''The construction of the Berlin Wall''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402152858/http://www.berlin.de/mauer/geschichte/index.en.html |date=2014-04-02}} states "Between 1945 and 1961, around 3.6 million people left the Soviet zone and East Berlin"&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, 1961, barbed-wire barrier that would become the [[Berlin Wall]] separating East and West Berlin was erected by East Germany.&lt;ref name="pearson75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, police and army engineers began to construct a more permanent concrete wall.&lt;ref name="dowty124"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Germany, the term [[Republikflucht]] (fugitives from the Republic) was used for anyone wishing to leave to non-socialist countries. A propaganda booklet published by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) in 1955 for the use of party agitators outlined the seriousness of [[Republikflucht|'flight from the republic']], stating "leaving the GDR is an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity", and "workers throughout Germany will demand punishment for those who today leave the German Democratic Republic, the strong bastion of the fight for peace, to serve the deadly enemy of the German people, the imperialists and militarists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Wer die Deutsche Demokratische Republik verläßt, stellt sich auf die Seite der Kriegstreiber'' ("He Who Leaves the German Democratic Republic Joins the Warmongers")|work=''Notizbuch des Agitators'' ("Agitator's Notebook") |publisher=[[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], Agitation Department, [[Berlin]] District |date=November 1955 |url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/notiz3.htm |accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous [[defectors]] include Joseph Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva]], Mig-25 pilot [[Viktor Belenko]], U.N. Undersecretary General [[Arkady Shevchenko]], chess grand master [[Viktor Korchnoi]], ballet stars [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Natalia Makarova]] and [[Alexander Godunov]].&lt;ref name="krasnov2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Krasnov|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous East German defectors include author [[Wolfgang Leonhard]], East German soldier [[Conrad Schumann]] who was photographed jumping the Berlin wall while under construction and a number of European football players, including [[Jörg Berger]]. While media sources often reported high level defections, non-prominent defections usually went unreported.&lt;ref name="krasnov5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Krasnov|1985|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba==
{{see also|Human rights in Cuba}}
Previously, the Cuban government forbade its citizens from leaving or returning to Cuba without first obtaining permission from the government. In a translation by [[Human Rights Watch]], under Cuba's criminal code, individuals who, "without completing legal formalities, leave or take actions in preparation for leaving the national territory" faced prison sentences of one to three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/cuba1005/2.htm Cuba’s Restrictions on Travel]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1985 to 1994 the number of illegal emigrants is estimated to 82,500, with an additional 7,500 up to the mid-2000.&lt;ref&gt;Rolando García Quiñones, Director del Centro de Estudios Demográficos (CEDEM), Cuba: [http://www.sela.org/public_html/AA2K2/eng/docs/coop/migra/spsmirdi12-02/spsmirdi12-3.htm International Migrations in Cuba: persinting trends and changes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005002547/http://www.sela.org/public_html/AA2K2/eng/docs/coop/migra/spsmirdi12-02/spsmirdi12-3.htm |date=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even discussing illegal emigration carried a six-month prison sentence.&lt;ref name="kobayashi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fidel Castro’s Cuba: The Views of the Exile Community|author=M. Hollis Kobayashi|year=2005|url=http://eprints.ccsu.edu/archive/00000279/03/KobayashiFT.pdf}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Law-Decree 302, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Cuba on October 16, 2012, went into effect on January 14, 2013. This immigration law eliminates the need for an exit permit but increases passport costs to 100 CUC, the equivalent of 5 months of average salary.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Iran==

It is illegal for an Iranian woman to leave Iran alone without written permission from her husband or male relative if she is not married.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Any woman of any nationality married to an Iranian man automatically becomes an Iranian citizen and is subject to these regulations.{{fact|date=June 2018}} [[Betty Mahmoody]], married to Iranian [[Sayyed Bozorg Mahmoody]], was trapped in Iran after her husband had decided that they would stay there during a two-week vacation. She had to escape to Turkey aided by smugglers because she would not have legally been allowed to leave Iran without first obtaining a divorce from her husband, who would have gained full custody of their daughter, [[Mahtob Mahmoody]].

==Portugal==

Until 1974 individual freedom to emigrate from [[Portugal]] was subordinated to the aims and interests of the nation. The 1933 Constitution says that "The state has the right and the obligation to coordinate and regulate the economic and social life of the Nation with the objective of populating the national territories, protecting emigrants, and disciplining emigration."{{fact|date=June 2018}} The state tried to attain three key goals with this policy: meet labor needs, satisfy interests in Africa, and ensure benefits from emigrant remittances. At least 36 percent of Portuguese emigrants between 1950 and 1988 left the country illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Ioannis B. Baganha. [http://ies.berkeley.edu/research/files/CP02/CP02-Port_Emigration.pdf Portuguese Emigration After World War II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221094933/http://ies.berkeley.edu/research/files/CP02/CP02-Port_Emigration.pdf |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burma==

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the government of [[Burma]] has tightly restricted the number of [[Muslims]] allowed to travel to [[Mecca]] for the [[Haj]] pilgrimage. Muslims claimed they continue to have difficulties getting [[passports]] to travel abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch (2002). [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/07/18/burma4127.htm Burma: Crackdown on Muslims]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisia==
{{update section|date=January 2016}}
In [[Tunisia]] per 2001, authorities continued to deny passports to less prominent critics as well as to family members of political prisoners and expatriate activists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] on [https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/tunisia.html Tunisia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child support==
===United States===
If a person owes more than $2,500 in child support, he or she cannot get his or her US Passport renewed and therefore will not be able to leave the United States and could be deported back to the United States for not having a valid US passport.&lt;ref name="Hasday2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Elaine Hasday|title=Family Law Reimagined|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEd9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|date=16 June 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-36985-6|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===
Australia and New Zealand have a travel ban for people who owe child support.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

===Costa Rica===
People who owe child support are prevented from leaving the country.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

'''Jecheon AIDS Scandal''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 제천 에이즈 스캔들, [[Hanja]]: 堤川 AIDS 醜聞) and '''Jecheon AIDS Crime''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 제천 에이즈 사건, [[Hanja]]: 堤川 AIDS 事件, [[Revised Romanization of Korean]]: Jecheon AIDS Sageon) was a sex scandal in [[South Korea]] that lasted from 2003 to April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koweekly.co.uk/news.php?code=&amp;mode=view&amp;num=6158&amp;page=41|title=제천, 에이즈 20대남 6년간 수십명과 성관계 [영국대표 한인신문]|website=www.koweekly.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the '''Jecheon Crisis'''.

Since 2003, hundreds of sexually active men and women around [[Jecheon]], [[Chungcheong]] province, have become infected with [[HIV]]. The suspect was found to be a 27-year-old taxi driver, arrested on March 11, 2009, on suspicions of stealing women's underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200903160142|title=에이즈공포 제천, 검진신청 20배 늘어|date=16 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police raided his apartment and found a stash of 400 pairs of women's underwear and several amateur pornographic movies filmed on a mobile phone.

The suspect was later revealed to be HIV positive, having been turned away from military service in 2003.

In May 2018, his book ''How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That's Taking Back Our Country'' was published.

==Education==
Weaver graduated from [[Missisquoi Valley Union Middle/High School|Missisquoi Valley Union High School]] in [[Franklin County, Vermont]], in 1983. He attended [[Boston University]] as an undergraduate ROTC candidate. He was arrested there on April 24, 1986, for disorderly conduct, along with 10 other students; they became known as the "BU Eleven." The group began building shanties on campus and tried to prevent university employees from tearing them down. During the incident several students, including Weaver, tried to prevent police from driving away. Some of the students were placed on probation and others suspended. Weaver received an honorable discharge from the Marines' [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1986/9/27/students-sue-bu-in-free-speech/ Students Sue BU In Free Speech Case] Martha A Bridegam, The Harvard Crimson, Sept 27, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1986, Weaver and three other students sued the university for the right to hang banners outside their dormitories. Yosef Abramowitz and two other students had displayed signs promoting divestment of the university with companies doing business with [[South Africa]]. When Abramowitz's sign was taken down, Weaver hung an American flag and two signs, one a Marine recruiting poster and the other reading "In Solidarity With Yosef". The university claimed it had a policy against dormitory banner displays, but the students argued it was selectively enforced, violating the right to free speech. The courts ruled in the students' favor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Judge-Rules-For-Students-Who-Put-Banners-Out-Dormitory-Windows/id-47c23dc9f4c611cf0a3e917771b9a6fb JUDGE RULES FOR STUDENTS WHO PUT BANNERS OUT DORMITORY WINDOWS] Associated Press News Archive, Dec 2, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; providing an immediate injunction against the students being forced to leave their dormitories, and also issuing a permanent injunction preventing the university from taking disciplinary action against the four for exercising their right of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1986/12/4/bu-loses-student-suit-court-says/ B.U. Loses Student Suit; Court Says Banners Stay] The Harvard Crimson, Dec 4, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver later graduated from the [[University of Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvuschool.org/wordpress/mvu-hall-of-famealumni/|title=MVU Hall of Fame/Alumni|work=Missisquoi Valley Union Middle &amp; High School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Weaver's first role as a [[Political campaign staff|campaign staffer]] was in 1986 when he worked for Bernie Sanders's gubernatorial campaign as an Independent. Weaver served as a driver for Sanders.&lt;ref name=message/&gt;&lt;ref name=polco/&gt;

In 1987, one year after his involvement with the Sanders gubernatorial campaign, Weaver launched a campaign of his own, running for [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]] City Ward 4 alderman. He was 21 years old and known locally for his efforts to register new voters. In 1990, Weaver challenged incumbent St. Albans mayor Ron Firkey for his seat. Weaver ran as an Independent and lost with 40% of the vote. In conceding the race, he said, "People haven't seen the last of Jeff Weaver."&lt;ref name=message/&gt;&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;

Weaver was a staffer for Sanders' successful 1990 congressional race. Following the race, he worked as a legislative assistant, eventually working his way up to chief of staff. Weaver later managed Sanders' successful 2006 Senate campaign and served as chief of staff.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;

In 2009, following his role as Sanders' Senate chief of staff, Weaver left the political scene to run a comics and gaming store, Victory Comics, in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=message/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallschurchtimes.com/18121/man-about-town-for-men-and-boys-only/|title=MAN ABOUT TOWN: For Men and Boys Only|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2015/05/15/sanders-picks-longtime-aides-to-run-presidential-campaign|title=Sanders Picks Longtime Aides to Run Presidential Campaign|work=Seven Days}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, after a break from politics, Weaver was appointed campaign manager for Sanders' presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150524/THISJUSTIN/705249917?template=printart|title=Rutland Herald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statement by Jeff Weaver, Bernie Sanders 2016 Campaign Manager - Bernie Sanders|url = https://berniesanders.com/press-release/statement-jeff-weaver/|website = Bernie Sanders|access-date = 2016-02-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The New York Times'' described Weaver as "a long-trusted adviser to Mr. Sanders, who has developed a reputation inside and outside his campaign as a hard-charging operative often willing to go further than the candidate himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/29/top-bernie-sanders-aide-rankles-those-in-and-out-of-campaign/|title=Top Bernie  Sanders Aide Rankles Those In and Out of Campaign|date=29 December 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2016, after Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, Weaver promised "to help organize voters", but did not join her campaign staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sanders' top aide to help organize votes for Clinton|url = http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/jeff-weaver-clinton-votes-225465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Our Revolution===
In August 2016, Weaver was named the president of [[Our Revolution]], a political organization created by Bernie Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-our-revolution-group.html|title=Bernie Sanders’s New Political Group Is Met by Staff Revolt|date=25 August 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his appointment, eight of Our Revolution's 13 staff members resigned.&lt;ref name="NBC News Aug. 2016 Our Rev anti-Weaver resignations"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seitz-Wald |first1=Alex |title=Bernie Sanders' new group hits major trouble on the launchpad |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/bernie-sanders-new-group-hits-major-trouble-launchpad-n636741 |website=NBC News |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2017, he was succeeded by [[Nina Turner]], former state senator of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/29/nina-turner-jeff-weaver-our-revolution-president-240084|title=Turner replaces Weaver as Our Revolution president|date=29 June 2017|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book===
In May 2018, Weaver's book ''How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That's Taking Back Our Country--and Where We Go from Here'' was published.&lt;ref name="How Bernie Won published May 2018"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weaver |first1=Jeff |title=How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That's Taking Back Our Country--and Where We Go from Here |date=05/15/2018 |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press |isbn=9781250144751 |pages=400 |url=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250144751}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an account of the 2016 Sanders campaign and a wide-ranging assessment of its effects.

During the promotional tour for the book, Weaver was interviewed on C-SPAN,&lt;ref name="CSPAN May 29, 2018 interview video"&gt;{{cite web |title=Washington Journal: Jeff Weaver Discusses &lt;em&gt;How Bernie Won&lt;/em&gt; |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?446127-3/washington-journal-jeff-weaver-discusses-how-bernie-won |website=C-SPAN.org |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News&lt;ref name="Fox News May 2018 article/interview video"&gt;{{cite web |title='How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That's Taking Back Our Country - and Where We Go from Here' by Jeff Weaver |url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2018/05/15/how-bernie-won-inside-revolution-thats-taking-back-our-country-and-where-go-from-here-by-jeff-weaver.html |website=Fox News |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Young Turks|"The Young Turks"]].&lt;ref name="May 2018 TYT Interview"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Bernie Sanders Won - Jeff Weaver Interview w/ The Young Turks |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnv-rAToomQ |website=The Young Turks/YouTube |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mule Day''', an annual celebration of all things related to [[mule]]s, is held in [[Columbia, Tennessee]], the self-proclaimed "Mule Capital" of the world. Begun in 1840 as "Breeder's Day", a meeting for mule breeders, it now attracts over 200,000 people &lt;ref name="LoC Mule Day"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mule Day A Local Legacy|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/tn/mule_1|publisher=Library Of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; and takes place over four days.
In addition to mules, traditional [[Appalachia]]n food, [[music]], [[dancing]], and [[crafts]] are featured.&lt;ref name="Mule Day Columbia"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mule Day article at Columbia, TN, web site | publisher=City of Columbia, TN | url=http://www.columbiatn.com/muleday.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Thomas Marion Brown leading the First Mule Day Parade in 1934.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Thomas Marion Brown leading the first Mule Day Parade in 1934]]
"Mule Day" has been a popular Columbia tradition for nearly 170 years, since the 1840s.&lt;ref name="LoC Mule Day" /&gt;
It began as "Breeder's Day", a single day [[livestock]] show and mule market event held on the first Monday in May. Over time, "Mule Day" evolved from a single day event into a multi-day festival, attracting thousands of attendees, lasting almost a week.  According to its official website, the heavy involvement of [[Maury County, Tennessee|Maury County]] in the mule industry caused the event to grow for a time into "one of the largest livestock markets in the world."&lt;ref name="Mule Day Columbia" /&gt;

In 1933, Thomas Marion Brown had the idea for a Mule Day Parade and Celebration as a way to bring in money to the community. He approached W.D. Hastings of the ''[[Daily Herald (Columbia, Tennessee)|Daily Herald]]'' and J.J. Johnson to bring this event to life. They went to the Chamber of Commerce and in 1934 the First Mule Day Parade was a reality. Tom designed the Mule Day Crown which is on display in the Maury County Public Library. He was the first Grand Marshal and led the parade for about 7 years.

Mule Day suddenly gained wider notice in 2006 when the Mule Day Parade listing in the National Asset Database, a [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) list of potential [[terrorism]] targets, was featured in a [[New York Times]] article.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news | title=DHS report questions target listings | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/washington/12assets.html | publisher=The New York Times Company | first=Eric | last=Lipton | date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
Mule Day celebrations include [[square dance|square dances]], mule-driving contests, [[horse show|horse shows]], [[handicraft|crafts festivals]], and [[flea market|flea markets]].
Other events include "working mule", "best of breed", [[lumberjack]] competitions and the Liar's Contest, a rural-themed story-telling competition.
Food served at the event includes [[barbecue]], roasted [[maize|corn]], home-made [[pies]] and [[funnel cake]]s.&lt;ref name="LoC Mule Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mule Day Columbia" /&gt;  

Since 1934,&lt;ref name="LoC Mule Day" /&gt; the festival has been highlighted by a "Mule Day Parade" held on Saturday during the celebration. Floats in the parade compete, with winners in each judged category receiving awards such as ribbons or money.&lt;ref name="Mule Day Columbia" /&gt;

'''Naadam''' ({{lang-mn|Наадам}}, classical Mongolian: {{MongolUnicode|ᠨᠠᠭᠠᠳᠤᠮ}}''Naɣadum'', {{IPA-mn|ˈnaːdəm|}}, ''literally "games"'') is a traditional festival in [[Mongolia]]. The festival is also locally termed "eriin gurvan naadam" ({{lang|mn|эрийн гурван наадам}}) "the three games of men". The games are [[Mongolian wrestling]], [[horse racing]], and [[archery]], and are held throughout the country during midsummer. Women have started participating in the archery and girls in the horse-racing games, but not in Mongolian wrestling.

In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] of [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]].

==Overview==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
Naadam is the most widely watched festival among Mongols, and is believed to have existed for centuries in one fashion or another. It has its origin in the activities, such as military parades and sporting competitions such as archery, horse riding and wrestling, that followed the celebration of various occasions, including weddings or spiritual gatherings. It later served as a way to train soldiers for battle, and was also connected to Mongols' nomadic lifestyle. Mongolians practice their unwritten holiday rules that include a long song to start the holiday, then a ''Biyelgee'' dance. Traditional cuisine, or ''Khuushuur'', is served around the Sports Stadium along with a special drink made of horse milk (''airag''). The three games of wrestling, horse racing, and archery are recorded in the 13th-century book ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''. During the [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Qing dynasty's rule]], Naadam became a festival officially held by [[Sum (country subdivision)|sums]]. Now it formally commemorates the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1921|1921 Revolution]], when Mongolia declared independence from China. Naadam also celebrates the achievements of the new state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Atwood Christopher Pratt, 1964-''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire,'' Facts On File, Ink&lt;/ref&gt; It was celebrated as a Buddhist/shaman holiday until secularization in the 1930s under the Communist influence of the Soviet Union.

The biggest festival (National Naadam) is held in the Mongolian capital, [[Ulaanbaatar]], during the National Holiday from July 11 to 13, in the [[National Sports Stadium (Mongolia)|National Sports Stadium]]. It begins with an elaborate introduction ceremony featuring dancers, athletes, horse riders, and musicians. After the ceremony, the competitions begin. The competitions are mainly horseback riding. Naadam is also celebrated in different regions of Mongolia and [[Inner Mongolia]] in July and August. In the [[Tuva Republic]], Naadam is on 15 August.

The three sports are called ''"Danshig"'' games. They became the great celebration of the new nation, where the nobility got together to dedicate to the [[Jabzundamba Khutugtu]], the new head of state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Genghis Khan]]'s nine horse tails, representing the nine tribes of the Mongols, are still ceremonially transported from Sukhbaatar Square to the Stadium to open the Naadam festivities. At the opening and closing ceremonies, there are impressive parades of mounted cavalry, athletes and monks.

Another popular Naadam activity is the playing of games using ''[[shagai]],'' sheep anklebones that serve as game pieces and tokens of both [[divination]] and friendship. In the larger Naadam festivals, tournaments may take place in a separate venue.

==Three games==

===Wrestling===
[[Image:Naadam wrestling.jpg|thumb|220px|Wrestling in the 2005 Naadam festival]]
{{Main|Mongolian wrestling}}
A total of 512 or 1024 wrestlers meet in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that lasts nine or ten rounds.  Mongolian traditional wrestling is an untimed competition in which wrestlers lose if they touch the ground with any part of their body other than their feet or hands. When picking pairs, the wrestler with the greatest fame has the privilege to choose his opponent.  Wrestlers wear two-piece costumes consisting of a tight shoulder vest (''zodog'') and shorts (''shuudag''). Only men are allowed to participate.

Each wrestler has an "encourager" called a ''zasuul''.  The zasuul sings a song of praise for the winning wrestler after rounds 3, 5, and 7.  Winners of the 7th or 8th stage (depending on whether the competition features 512 or 1024 wrestlers) earn the title of ''zaan'', "elephant".  The winner of the 9th or 10th stage is called ''arslan'', "lion".&lt;ref name=blackbelt&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o84DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=ulan%20bator&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=ulan%20bator&amp;f=false "The Maulers of Mongolia"], ''[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]'' magazine, July 1969, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In the final competition, all the "zasuuls" drop in the wake of each wrestler as they take steps toward each other. Two-time arslans are called the titans / giants, or ''avraga''.&lt;ref name=blackbelt/&gt;

===Horse racing===
{{See also|Mongol horse}}
Unlike Western horse racing, which consists of short sprints generally not much longer than 2&amp;nbsp;km, Mongolian horse racing as featured in Naadam is a cross-country event, with races 15–30&amp;nbsp;km long.  The length of each race is determined by age class.  For example, two-year-old horses race for ten miles and seven-year-olds for seventeen miles. Up to 1000 horses from any part of Mongolia can be chosen to participate.  Race horses are fed a special diet.

Children from 5 to 13 are chosen as jockeys and train in the months preceding the races. While jockeys are an important component, the main purpose of the races is to test the skill of the horses.&lt;ref name="csen.org"&gt;"Naadam Festival." The Center for the Study . 16 Apr 2008 &lt;http://www.csen.org/Mongol.Nadaam/Mongol.text.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the races begin, the audience sings traditional songs and the jockeys sing a song called ''Gingo''.  Prizes are awarded to horses and jockeys. The top five horses in each class earn the title of ''airgiyn tav'' and the top three are given gold, silver, and bronze medals. The winning jockey is praised with the title of ''tumny ekh'' or leader of ten thousand.  The horse that finishes last in the Daaga race (two-year-old horses race) is called ''bayan khodood'' (meaning "full stomach"). A song is sung to the Bayan khodood wishing him luck to be next year's winner.&lt;ref name="csen.org"/&gt; [http://www.toursmongolia.com/mongolia_travel_news/horse-riding-in-mongolia More about horse riding in Mongolia]

===Archery===
{{See also|Mongol bow}}
[[Image:Naadam women archery.jpg|thumb|upright|A women's archery competition held during the 2005 Naadam festival]]
In this competition both men and women may participate. It is played by teams of ten. Each archer is given four arrows; the team must hit 33 ''"surs".'' Men shoot their arrows from 75 meters away while women shoot theirs from 65 meters away. Traditionally the archers wear their national clothing (''Deel'') during the competition. All the archers wear leather bracers up to the elbow on their outstretched arm, so that the ''deel’s'' cuff does not interfere with shooting.
 
Mongolian archery is unique for having dozens of ''surs'' as targets. Each ''sur'' is a small woven or wooden cylinder. They are placed on top of each other forming a wall three-high, which is approximately 8 inches high by 5 feet wide. Knocking a ''sur'' out of the wall with an arrow counts as a hit, though knocking a ''sur'' out of the centre will bring a competitor more points.  When the archer hits the target, the judge says ''uuhai'' which means "hooray". After each hit, an official repairs the damaged wall and makes it ready for the next attempt. The winners of the contest are granted the titles of "national marksman" and "national markswoman".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarn.org/mongolian/mn_nat_arch/messenger.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''O Columbia''''' is an [[opera]] in three parts by [[Gregory Spears]], with an English-language [[libretto]] by [[Royce Vavrek]]. The opera's story celebrates the American spirit of exploration and features [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], an astronaut on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] and the mythological icon [[Lady Columbia]].

The opera was commissioned by [[Houston Grand Opera]] and premiered on September 23, 2015 in a production by Kevin Newbury and conducted by Timothy Myers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.ncopera.org/people/timothy-myers |title=NC Opera |publisher=NC Opera |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
O Columbia traces a history of dreamers and explorers–from Sir Walter Raleigh journeying to the New World, to a Houston teenager experiencing communion, and later, heartbreak, with a Columbia space shuttle astronaut, to future astronauts venturing to the far reaches of the solar system-in an ode to America's pioneering spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstongrandopera.org/community-programs/hgoco-event/o-columbia/ |title=O Columbia |publisher=Houston Grand Opera |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In her review for the Wall Street Journal, Heidi Waleson commented "Mr. Spears writes brilliantly for vocal ensembles. Starting with neoclassical-style clarity, he builds textured, complex musical structures that sound old and new at the same time, and his skillful text settings use minimalist-like repetition to give Mr. Vavrek’s pointed, thoughtful words even more power and emotional specificity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waleson |first=Heidi |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/o-columbia-and-sweeney-todd-reviews-1443477827 |title=‘O Columbia’ and ‘Sweeney Todd’ Reviews |publisher=WSJ |date=2015-09-28 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Six-Day War}}
'''Operation Focus''' ({{lang-he|מבצע מוקד}}, ''Mivtza Moked'') was the opening airstrike by [[Israel]] at the start of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. It is sometimes referred to as "Sinai Air Strike". At 07:45 on June 5, 1967, the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) under Maj. Gen. [[Mordechai Hod]] launched a massive airstrike that destroyed the majority of the [[Egypt]]ian Air Force on the ground. By noon, the [[Egyptian Air Force|Egyptian]], [[Jordanian Air Force|Jordanian]] and [[Syrian Air Force]]s, with about 450 aircraft, were destroyed. It was also very successful in disabling 18 airfields in Egypt, hindering Egyptian Air Force operations for the duration of the war, and remains one of the most successful air attack campaigns in military history.

==Summary==
In three main waves of aerial attacks, and several smaller waves in the days following the operation, a total of 452 aircraft were destroyed, most of them on the ground. That left the IAF in almost complete control of the skies, and it was able to  assist the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) ground units effectively.

The operational success was achieved by concentrating on the initial destruction of the runways with a new kind of weapon, a rocket assisted [[Anti-runway penetration bomb|anti-runway warhead]]. The prototype French/Israeli anti-runway weapon program uses rocket braking over the target to point the warhead directly toward the runway being attacked; at a set altitude, a second accelerator rocket ignites and drives the warhead through the pavement of the runway before it detonates. The explosion creates a small [[explosion crater|crater]] over a large new [[sinkhole]], meaning the damaged runway section must be completely removed before the sinkhole can be repaired rather than a normal bomb crater which is simply filled in and patched. Once the runways were disabled, entire air bases' complements of aircraft were effectively grounded and fell victim to subsequent attack waves, resulting in near-total Israeli [[air supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/80290053/Durandal-BLU-Archived |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019143921/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/80290053/Durandal-BLU-Archived |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Dassault Mirage: The Combat Log", Salvador Mafe Huertas, page-41, {{ISBN|978-0764301681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
===June 5, 1967===
[[File:Six Day War. Egyptian air force base attacked. Egyptian planes destroyed on the ground. June 1967. D326-011.jpg|thumb|Egyptian aircraft destroyed on the ground]]
Operation Moked was launched at 7:45&amp;nbsp;am Israeli time (8:45 Egyptian time).  Nearly all of Israel's 196 combat aircraft (mostly French/[[Dassault Aviation]]) were committed to the airstrike, with only twelve being held back to patrol Israeli airspace.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Egyptian defensive infrastructure was extremely poor, and no airfields were yet equipped with [[Hardened Aircraft Shelter|hardened aircraft shelters]] capable of protecting Egypt's warplanes in the event of an attack. The Israeli warplanes headed out over the [[Mediterranean]] before turning toward Egypt. Meanwhile, the Egyptians hindered their own defense by effectively shutting down their entire [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defense]] system: they were worried that rebel Egyptian forces would shoot down the plane carrying [[Abdel Hakim Amer|Field Marshal Amer]] and Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud, who were en route from [[al Maza]] to [[Bir Tamada]] in the Sinai to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there. In this event it did not make a great deal of difference as the Israeli pilots came in below Egyptian radar cover and well below the lowest point at which Egypt's [[SA-2]] surface-to-air missile batteries could bring down an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, 2003, pp. 114–115 (author interview with General Salahadeen Hadidi who presided over the first court martial of the heads of the air force and the air defence system after the war).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Israeli wave attacked 11 bases, catching much of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground and destroying them before they got airborne. The Israeli jets then returned to Israel, were "quick-turned" (refueled and re-armed) in 7 minutes 30 seconds, and left in a second wave that attacked 14 Egyptian bases and returned with only minor losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eshel|first=Stanley M. Ulanoff, David|title=The fighting Israeli Air Force|date=1985|publisher=Arco Pub.|location=New York|isbn=0-668-05578-2|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They "quick-turned" again and departed in a third wave.

The opening stages of Operation Moked were a complete success: Egypt's air force of nearly 500 combat aircraft was destroyed in the space of three hours, with only minor losses to the [[Israeli Air Force]]. When [[Syria]], Jordan, and [[Iraq]] attacked Israeli targets in retaliation for the airstrike on Egypt, their attacks were mainly directed at civilian targets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and were largely ineffectual. In response many of the IAF planes headed for a third strike on Egypt were diverted en route to Syrian and Jordanian targets, and other IAF aircraft were sent against Arab ground forces in support of Israeli ground forces. By the end of the first day of the Six-day War, Israel had complete [[air superiority]] over Egypt, the [[Golan Heights]], the [[West Bank]], and the entire [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] desert.&lt;ref&gt;"Six Days of War" by Michael Oren (chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 6–10, 1967===
On the second day of the war (June 6) the IAF was used against Egyptian, Jordanian, Syrian, and Iraqi ground forces.

On the third day (June 7) the IAF destroyed hundreds of Egyptian vehicles trying to flee across the Sinai in convoys and trapped thousands more in narrow Sinai passes.  By the end of the third day Jordan's air force of 34 combat aircraft had essentially ceased to exist and the Jordanian military was no longer in the fight.

By the sixth and final day (June 10) [[Syria]] had lost approximately 100 combat aircraft and the fighting was over.

===Aftermath===
During the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Israeli Air Force]], with 196 combat&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft at its disposal had prevailed over a coalition with approximately 600 combat aircraft. The IAF destroyed 452 enemy aircraft, including 79 in air combat, while losing 46 of its own. 24 Israeli pilots and hundreds of Arab pilots were killed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Totals by waves===
#First wave (7:45&amp;nbsp;am): 101 flights; 11 airfields were attacked by 183 IAF aircraft; 197 Egyptian aircraft and 8 [[radar]] stations were destroyed. Five IAF pilots were killed and five more fell captive.
#Second wave (9:30&amp;nbsp;am): 164 flights; 16 {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} airfields were attacked; 107 Egyptian aircraft destroyed; 2 Syrian planes destroyed in dogfights
#Third Wave (12:15&amp;nbsp;pm): 85 flights against Egypt, 48 against Jordan, 67 against Syria and one against [[H-3 Air Base|H-3 air base]] in Iraq.
#Other waves (afternoon &amp; evening): 2 more attacks against H-3; several additional attacks on Egyptian airfields.

==Other effects==
The effectiveness of the operation showed how vulnerable fixed air base installations were to aerial attacks at the time. This caused many nations [[Air force|air forces]] to develop improved defensive measures against it, such as constructing [[hardened aircraft shelter]]s to protect aircraft on the ground and establishing [[highway strip]]s as alternative air bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford History of Modern War|last=Townshend|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780192806451|location=|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forsvarsmakten.se/siteassets/5-information-och-fakta/historia/vagbaserna/fortv_rapport_2006.1.pdf|title=Svenska reservvägbaser|last=Andersson|first=Lennart|date=2006-11-23|website=|language=Swedish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pholcidae''', commonly known as '''cellar spiders''', are a [[spider]] [[Family (biology)|family]] in the suborder [[Araneomorphae]]. The family contains about 1500&amp;nbsp;species divided into about 80&amp;nbsp;genera.

Some species, especially ''[[Pholcus phalangioides]]'', are commonly called '''daddy long-legs spider''', '''granddaddy long-legs spider''', '''carpenter spider''', '''daddy long-legger''', '''vibrating spider''' or '''skull spider'''.

Confusion often arises because the name "daddy long-legs" is also applied to two other, distantly related groups of [[arthropod]]s: [[Opiliones|harvestmen]] (which are [[arachnid]]s but not spiders) and [[crane fly|crane flies]] (which are [[insect]]s).

==Appearance==
Pholcids are thin and fragile arachnids. The body (resembling the shape of a [[peanut]]) being approximately 2–10&amp;nbsp;mm (0.08-0.39&amp;nbsp;inches) in length with legs which may be up to 50&amp;nbsp;mm (1.97&amp;nbsp;inches) long. ''Pholcus'' and ''Smeringopus'' have cylindrical abdomens and eyes arranged in two lateral groups of three and two smaller median contiguous eyes. Arrangements of eight and six eyes both occur in this family. ''Spermophora'' has a small [[globose]] abdomen and its eyes are arranged in two groups of three without median eyes. Pholcids are gray to brown, sometimes clear, with banding or [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] markings.

==Habitat==
Pholcids are found in every continent in the world except [[Antarctica]]. Pholcids hang inverted in their messy and irregular-shaped webs. These webs are constructed in dark and damp recesses such as caves, under rocks and loose bark, abandoned mammal burrows. In areas of human habitation pholcids construct webs in undisturbed areas in buildings such as attics and cellars (hence the common name "cellar spider").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Pholcidae/ |title=Pholcidae information |series=Animal Diversity Web |website=BioKIDS – Kids' Inquiry of Diverse Species |language=en |access-date=2018-07-15 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Crossopriza lyoni Video.ogv|thumb|220px|alt=A tailed cellar spider with very long thin legs rapidly bobs its body up and down|Cellar spider vibrating rapidly in response to a threat]]

===Trapping===
The web of pholcids has no adhesive properties and instead relies on its irregular structure to trap prey. When pholcid spiders detect prey within their webs the spiders quickly envelop prey before inflicting a fatal bite. The prey may be eaten immediately or stored for later. When finished they will clean the web by unhooking the prey and letting it drop from the web.

===Threat response===
Some species of Pholcidae exhibit a threat response when disturbed by a touch to the web or entangled large prey. The arachnid responds by vibrating rapidly in a gyrating motion in its web. While they are not the only species of spider to exhibit this behaviour, this behaviour has led to these spiders sometimes being called "vibrating spiders". There are several proposed reasons for this threat response. The movement may make it difficult for a predator to locate the spider or may be a signal to an assumed rival to leave. Vibrating may also increase the chances of capturing insects that have just brushed their web and are still hovering nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite media |url=http://www.cirrusimage.com/spider_vibrating.htm| title=Video of the "vibrating spider" vibrating |author=Marlin, Bruce |medium=[[QuickTime|QuickTime Movie]] |date=2006-04-25 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the spider continues to be harassed it will retreat into a corner or drop from its web and escape.

===Diet===
Certain species of these spiders invade webs of other spiders to eat the host, the eggs, or the prey. In some cases the spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure the host closer. Pholcids are natural predators of the ''[[Tegenaria]]'' species and are known to attack and eat [[redback spider]]s, [[huntsman spider]]s and [[house spiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Animals+of+Queensland/Spiders/Modern+Spiders+Infraorder+Araneomorphae/Daddy-long-legs+spiders/Daddy-long-legs |title=Daddy Long Legs |publisher=[[Queensland Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/spider/pholcus1.html |title=''Pholcus phalangioides'', the daddy-long-legs spider, in 3D |author=Wim van Egmond}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pholcids may be beneficial to humans living in regions with dense [[hobo spider]] populations as predation on ''Tegenaria'' may keep populations in check.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spiderid.com/spider/pholcidae/pholcus/phalangioides/|title=Pholcus phalangioides (Long-bodied Cellar Spider) - Spider Identification &amp; Pictures|website=spiderid.com|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CellarSpider.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Close-up of a cellar spider's head, showing two groups of three closely clustered eyes]]

===Gait===
''Pholcus phalangioides'' often uses an alternating tetrapod gait (first right leg, then second left leg, then third right leg, etc.), which is commonly found in many spider species. However, frequent variations from this pattern have been documented during observations of the spiders’ movements.

==Misconceptions==
There is a [[urban legend|legend]] that daddy long-legs spiders have the most potent venom of any spider, but that their fangs are either too small or too weak to puncture human skin; the same legend is also repeated of the [[harvestman]] and [[crane fly]], also known as "daddy long-legs" in some regions. Indeed, pholcid spiders do have a short fang structure (called uncate due to its "hooked" shape). [[Brown recluse spider]]s also have uncate fang structure, but are able to deliver medically significant bites.

Possible explanations include: pholcid venom is not toxic to humans; pholcid uncate are smaller than those of brown recluse; or there is a musculature difference between the two arachnids, with recluses, being hunting spiders, possessing stronger muscles for fang penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html |title=Daddy Long Legs Site on UCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rick Vetter of the [[University of California]] at Riverside, the daddy long-legs spider has never harmed a human and there is no evidence that they are dangerous to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html |title=Spider Myths – Daddy Long Legs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend may result from the fact that the daddy long-legs spider preys upon deadly venomous spiders, such as the [[redback spider|redback]], a member of the [[black widow spider|black widow]] genus ''[[Latrodectus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_weavers/Pholcidae.htm |title=Family Pholcidae – daddy long-leg spiders |website=Brisbane Insects and Spiders |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-11-13 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that such entomological information was known to the general public, it was perhaps thought that if the daddy long-legs spider could kill a spider capable of delivering fatal bites to humans, then it must be more venomous, and the uncate fangs were regarded as prohibiting it from killing people. In reality, it is able to cast lengths of silk onto its prey, incapacitating them from a safe distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/researchattepapa/enquiries/spidersweb/what/pages/daddylonglegs.aspx |title=Daddy long-legs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythbusters experiment===
During 2004, the [[Discovery Channel]] television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' tested the daddy long-legs venom myth in [[MythBusters (2004 season)#Daddy Long-Legs|episode 13 - "Buried in concrete"]]. Hosts [[Jamie Hyneman]] and [[Adam Savage]] first established that the spider's venom was not as toxic as other venoms, after being told about an experiment whereby mice were injected with venom from both a daddy long-legs and a black widow, with the black widow venom producing a much stronger reaction.

After measuring the spider's fangs at approximately 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm, Adam Savage inserted his hand into a container with several daddy-long-legs, and reported that he felt a bite which produced a mild, short-lived burning sensation. The bite did in fact penetrate his skin, but did not cause any notable harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/db/animals/daddy-long-leg-spiders.html |series=Myth Files |title=Daddy long-leg spiders |publisher=[[Discovery channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, recent research has shown that pholcid venom is relatively weak in its effects on insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/spidermyth/myths/daddyvenom.html |title=The Spider Myths Site |publisher=[[Burke Museum]] |date=2005-05-12 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Principal Holy Days''' are a type of observance in the [[Anglican Communion]], including the [[Church of England]]. All [[Principal Feast]]s are also Principal Holy Days.  All Principal Holy Days share equal status; however those which are not Principal Feasts, being fast days within the season of [[Lent]], lack a festal character.  They are considered to be the most significant type of observance, the others being [[Festival (Church of England)|Festival]]s, [[Lesser Festival]]s, and [[Commemoration (observance)|Commemoration]]s. Observance of Principal Holy Days is considered obligatory.

'''Qashliq''', '''Isker''' or '''Sibir''' ([[Siberian Tatar language]]: ''Sibir'', ''Qaşliq'' or ''Esker'') was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] (14th–16th century) [[Siberian Tatar]] fortress, in the 16th century the capital of the [[Khanate of Sibir]], located on the right bank of the [[Irtysh River]] at its confluence with the ''Sibirka'' [[stream|rivulet]], some 17&amp;nbsp;km from the modern city of [[Tobolsk]]. 
The fortress is first mentioned in Russian sources of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Istoriia Sibiri s drevneishikh vremem do nashikh dnei'',  Leningrad, 1968, cited after [[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970–1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of the most development was in the first half of the 16th century. In 1582 the troops of [[Cossack]] [[ataman]] [[Yermak]] seized and ruined Qashliq. The ruined city was retaken by the Siberian Tatars in 1584 only to be lost forever in 1586. The nearby city of [[Tobolsk]] was founded in 1587.

Sources differ on the exact location of the fortress. Most give the distance upriver from Tobolsk as 17 or 18&amp;nbsp;km, or [[verst]]s, or ten to eleven miles, but others give 23&amp;nbsp;km. Sources of the early 19th century claim that the ruins of the fortress could still be made out with difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. J. Bell, ''A system of geography, popular and scientific'',  1832, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UhMHACB9iRwC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Sibirka+River&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bqa-TcGBA8OfOuiU9bcF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sibirka%20River&amp;f=false p. 70].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11939">A '''religious festival''' is a time of special importance marked by adherents to that [[religion]].  Religious festivals are commonly celebrated on recurring cycles in a [[calendar year]] or [[lunar calendar]]. Hundreds of very different religious festivals are held around the world each year and a religious festival is about celebrating something that is special to that religion.

===Ancient Roman===
{{Main|Roman festivals}}
[[Image:Compitalia fresco.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Roman men thought to be participating in the [[Compitalia]] festival, in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]]]]

Festivals ''(feriae)'' were an important part of [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious life]] during both the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial eras]], and were one of the primary features of the [[Roman calendar]]. ''Feriae'' ("holidays" in the sense of "holy days") were either public ''(publicae)'' or private ''([[privatus|privatae]])''. State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. ''Feriae privatae'' were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st-century BC scholar [[Varro]] defined ''feriae'' as "days instituted for the sake of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.12 ''(dies deorum causa instituti'', as cited by Scullard, p. 39, noting also the phrase ''dis dedicati'', "dedicated to the gods," in [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.2.&lt;/ref&gt; A deity's festival often marked the anniversary (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]],'' "birthday") of the founding of the deity's temple, or a rededication after a major renovation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "Initia Cereris," in ''Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion'' (Brill, 1956), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Public business was suspended for the performance of religious rites on the ''feriae''. [[Cicero]] says that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] should get a break from their labors.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De legibus'' 2.29, as cited by Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic,'' p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; On calendars of the Republic and early Empire, the [[Roman calendar#Character of the day|religious status of days]] were marked by letters such as ''F'' (for ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fasti|fastus]]'', when it was [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fast|religiously permissible]] to conduct legal business), ''C'' (for ''[[comitia]]lis)'', a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies), and ''N'' (for ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#nefastus|nefastus]]'', when political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited). By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show these letters, probably as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by [[Marcus Aurelius]] that recognized the changed religious environment of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 17, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fasti Praenestini Massimo n2.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the ''[[Fasti Praenestini]]'' for April ''([[Aprilis]]''), with the festivals of [[Vinalia]] ''(VIN)'' and [[Robigalia]] ''(ROB)'' marked in capital letters]]
On surviving Roman calendars, festivals that appear in large capital letters (such as the [[Lupercalia]] and [[Parilia]]) are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard,  ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the oldest festivals are not named for deities.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "Initia Cereris," pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], several traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. Games ''([[ludi]])'', such as the [[Ludi Apollinares]], were often dedicated to particular deities, but were not technically ''feriae'', although they might be holidays in the modern sense of days off work ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#festus|dies festi]])''.  After the mid-1st century AD, there were more frequent [[Roman Empire#Recreation and spectacles|spectacles and games]] ''([[ludi circenses|circenses]])'' held in the venue called a "[[circus (building)|circus]]", in honor of various deities or for imperial anniversaries ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies imperii|dies Augusti]])''. A religious festival held on a single day, such as the [[Floralia]], might be expanded with games over multiple days ''(Ludi Florae)''; the festival of [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] is seen as a precursor of [[May Day]] festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' pp. 17, 120ff., 178; entry on "Bacchanalia and Saturnalia," in ''The Classical Tradition'', edited by [[Anthony Grafton]], [[Glenn W. Most]], and Salvatore Settis (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major source for Roman holidays is [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from [[Ianuarius|January]] to [[Iunius (month)|June]] at the time of [[Augustus]]. Because it ends with June, less is known about Roman festivals in the second half of the year, with the exception of the [[Saturnalia]], a religious festival in honor of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] on December 17 that expanded with celebrations through December 23. Probably the best-known Roman festival, some of its customs, such as gift-giving and the prevalence of candles, are thought to have influenced popular celebrations of [[Christmas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 124; Craig A. Williams, ''Martial: Epigrams Book Two'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 259 (on the custom of gift-giving); entry on "Bacchanalia and Saturnalia," in ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 116; C. Bennet Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist===
{{Main|List of Buddhist festivals|Buddhist holidays}}
[[Japanese festivals]] and [[Barua festivals]] often involve [[Buddhist culture]], as do [[pagoda festival]]s held as [[fairs]] held at [[List of Buddhist temples in Thailand|Buddhist temples in countries such as Thailand]]. Features of Buddhist [[Tibetan festivals]] may include the traditional [[cham dance]], which is also a feature of some Buddhist festivals in [[India]] and [[Bhutan]]. Many [[festivals of Nepal]] are religious festivals involving Buddhism.

===Christian===

The central festival of [[Christianity]] is [[Easter]], on which Christians celebrate their belief that [[Jesus Christ]] [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|rose from the dead]] on the third day after his [[crucifixion]]. Even for Easter, however, there is no agreement among the various Christian traditions regarding the date or manner of the observance, less for [[Christmas]], [[Pentecost]], or various other holidays. Both [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s observe certain festivals commemorating events in the life of Christ. Of these, the two most important are Christmas, which commemorates the [[Birth of Jesus]], and Easter, which marks his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].

===Hindu===

'Utsava' is the [[Sanskrit]] word for Hindu festivals, meaning 'to cause to grow 'upward'.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Hindus observe sacred occasions by festive observances. All festivals in Hinduism are predominantly religious in character and significance. Many festivals are seasonal. Some celebrate harvest and the birth of gods or heroes. Some are dedicated to important events in [[Hindu mythology]]. Many are dedicated to [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Lakshmi]] and [[Brahma]] and [[Saraswati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amulya Mohapatra |author2=Bijaya Mohapatra |title=Hinduism: Analytical Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpiU9m7T_tQC |accessdate=10 November 2011 |date=1 December 1995 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-7099-388-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival may be observed with acts of worship, offerings to deities, fasting, feasting, vigil, rituals, fairs, charity, celebrations, [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]], [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]], [[aarti]] etc. They celebrate individual and community life of Hindus without distinction of caste, gender or class.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In the [[Hindu calendar]] dates are usually prescribed according to the [[lunar calendar]].

[[File:2008 Singapore Grand Prix Renault Nelson Piquet Jr crash.jpg|thumb|right|The wrecked [[Renault R28]] car driven by [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] at the centre of the controversy]]

The '''Renault Formula One crash controversy''', dubbed '''Crashgate''' by some in the media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6842843.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Renault given two-year suspended ban in Crashgate hearing | first=Ben | last=Smith | date=21 September 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3e671f34-a69e-11de-bd14-00144feabdc0.html|title=Renault handed two-year suspended sentence for ‘Crashgate’|work=Financial Times|location=London|first=Roger|last=Blitz|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2013}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[sporting scandal]] perpetrated by the [[Renault F1]] team who [[team orders|ordered]] [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] to crash deliberately during the [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix]], to gain a sporting advantage for his Renault teammate [[Fernando Alonso]].&lt;ref name="Piquetwinlibelcase"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9265296.stm|title=Nelson Piquet Jr and his father win Renault libel case|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 December 2010|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2008, on the 14th lap of the Singapore race, the [[Renault R28]] driven by Piquet crashed into the circuit wall at turn 17, necessitating a [[safety car]] deployment. The other Renault driver, [[Fernando Alonso]], had previously made an early pitstop, and was promoted to the race lead as other cars pitted under safety car conditions. Alonso subsequently won the race after starting 15th on the grid. Piquet described his crash at the time as a simple mistake.

After being dropped by the Renault team following the [[2009 Hungarian Grand Prix]], Piquet alleged that he had been asked by the team to deliberately crash to improve the race situation for Alonso, sparking an investigation of Renault F1 for race fixing by [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), the Formula One governing body. After an investigation, Renault F1 were charged with conspiracy on 4 September, and were to answer the charge on 21 September 2009.

On 16 September Renault stated that they would not contest the charges, and announced that the team's [[managing director]], [[Flavio Briatore]], and its [[executive director]] of [[engineering]], [[Pat Symonds]], had left the team.

On 21 September it was announced that the Renault F1 team had been handed a disqualification from Formula One, which was [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] for two years pending any further comparable rule infringements. Briatore was suspended from all Formula One events and FIA-sanctioned events indefinitely, whilst Symonds received a five-year ban.&lt;ref name="f1ban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8266090.stm|title=Renault handed suspended F1 ban|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2009/Pages/wmsc_210909.aspx |title=FIA Press Release |work=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004081125/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2009/Pages/wmsc_210909.aspx |archivedate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bans were subsequently overturned by a French court, although they both agreed not to work in Formula One or FIA-sanctioned events for a specified time as part of a later settlement reached with the governing body.&lt;ref name="Courtoverturns"&gt;{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Jonathan|title=Court overturns Briatore's F1 ban|publisher=Haymarket Publications|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80743|date=5 January 2010|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=settlement&gt;{{cite news|last=Elizalde|first=Pablo|title=FIA, Briatore reach settlement|publisher=Haymarket Publications|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/82844|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Renault F1===
[[File:Nelson Angelo Piquet.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nelson Piquet Jr.]], December 2007]]
The [[Renault F1]] Formula One team came into existence with the car manufacturer [[Renault]]'s re-entrance into Formula One in 2000, by purchasing the [[Benetton Formula One]] team. Italian businessman [[Flavio Briatore]] had been managing director of Benetton until 1997, when he was replaced by [[Prodrive]] boss [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]]. After managing Renault's motorsport sister company [[Mecachrome]], he returned to the main team following the Renault takeover, again as managing director. In addition to his Formula One sporting interests, as of August 2007, Briatore was Chairman and part owner of the English [[association football|football]] club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]] (QPR), which he purchased jointly with Formula One president [[Bernie Ecclestone]], being joined later by funds from Indian industrialist [[Lakshmi Mittal]].&lt;ref name="Footbal League Briatore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/8260661.stm|title=Football League looks at Briatore|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish racing driver [[Fernando Alonso]] had been involved in Formula One since 2001, and drove for the team from [[2002 Formula One season|2002]] to [[2006 Formula One season|2006]]. After becoming World Champion in 2005 and 2006 and a one-year stint with [[McLaren]], he returned to the team in 2008. English engineer [[Pat Symonds]] had risen to his position as Executive Director of Engineering with Renault F1 having worked for the Benetton team, and having entered Formula One with Benetton's predecessor [[Toleman|Toleman Motosport]] in the early 1980s. Brazilian racing car driver [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] – son of the Formula One triple-world champion [[Nelson Piquet]] – joined the Renault F1 team as the second car driver alongside Alonso for the 2008 season, having been their reserve and test driver during 2007. Since October 2006, Piquet Jr. was also personally contracted to Flavio Briatore's management company FFBB.&lt;ref name=Times18Sep09PiquetSrLegal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6839589.ece|title=Nelson Piquet Sr to begin court fight against Flavio Briatore|work=The Times|location=London|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=18 September 2009|first1=Anushka|last1=Asthana|first2=Jill|last2=Sherman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Singapore incident, Renault F1 had not won a race for almost two years (the last Grand Prix won was on 8 October 2006, the [[2006 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]]), and were said to be close to quitting the sport.&lt;ref name=Telegraph17Sep09QnA/&gt;

===2008 Singapore Grand Prix===

[[File:2008 Singapore Grand Prix podium.jpg|thumb|left|Alonso on the podium of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, with Briatore far right (white shirt)]]
{{wikinews|Fernando Alonso wins 2008 Singapore Grand Prix}}
The [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix]] was the fifteenth race of the [[2008 Formula One season]], and took place on 28 September 2008. The race was Formula One's first night race.&lt;ref name=BBC17Sep09Blame/&gt; On the race weekend, despite Alonso being close to the top in practice, Renault had a poor qualifying session and started well down the grid, with [[Fernando Alonso]] starting in fifteenth place, and [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] alongside him in 16th. Alonso was eliminated during qualifying because of mechanical failure.

After the race started, Alonso was the first driver to make a routine [[pit stop]] for fuel and tyres on lap 12, rejoining the race at the back of the field.&lt;ref name=Guardian4Sep09&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/04/formula-one-renault-crash-hearing-fia |title=FIA charges Renault over Nelson Piquet Jr crash in Singapore|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Maurice| last=Hamilton|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had put in a light fuel load at the start of the race in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low positions tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not want to waste a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of the turns on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the [[safety car]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sportgeza.hu/forma1/2009/09/10/a_17-es_kanyarban_utkozz_ott_nincs_daru/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Felipe Massa 2008 Algarve.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian [[Felipe Massa]] was leading the Grand Prix for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] before Piquet Jr.'s crash]]
Safety car regulations in 2008 meant that the pit lane was closed until all cars had been bunched up behind the safety car. Hence the advantage of the lead cars would be eliminated before they were able to pit and after they did pit, they would re-enter the race at the back of the field. Alonso, having pitted just before the safety car was introduced, therefore gained a significant advantage. (Under previous regulations, the pit lane remained open during safety car incidents and the lead cars could quickly pit before their lead was eliminated and re-enter the race with less loss of track position.) In order to avoid running out of fuel, some drivers did need to pit while the pit lane was closed and they were penalised for the infraction.

Most of the leading cars ended up behind Alonso and also behind some slower drivers who proved difficult to pass on the narrow circuit; those ahead of Alonso were lighter on fuel and whilst they were able to pull away, they still needed to make a pit stop. After gaining the lead in the final third of the race, Alonso went on to win the race.

On 11 September, the day after Piquet Jr.'s statement to the FIA was leaked, Renault F1 stated that it intended to take legal action against Nelson Piquet Jr and his father in both French and British courts, stating that "...today the ING Renault F1 Team and its managing director Flavio Briatore personally wish to state they have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Jr and Nelson Piquet Sr in France concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Mr Piquet Jr to drive for the remainder of the 2009 season".&lt;ref name=Times11Sep09LegalAction&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6830499.ece|title=Renault to start legal action against Nelson Piquet Jr over crash claims|work=The Times|location=London|accessdate=17 September 2009|first=Tom|last=Dart|date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the legal action, Piquet Jr. stated "Because I am telling the truth I have nothing to fear, whether from the Renault team or Mr Briatore – and while I am well aware of the power and influence of those being investigated, and the vast resources at their disposal, I will not be bullied again into making a decision I regret".&lt;ref name=BBC8250436&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8250436.stm |title=Renault to launch Piquet lawsuit|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2009|date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Motorsports Council meeting==
The extraordinary meeting of the World Motorsports Council took place on 21 September 2009 in Paris. After a ninety-minute hearing, the council imposed a disqualification on Renault, [[suspended sentence|suspended]] for two years. This meant that if a similar incident occurred before 2011, Renault would be banned from Formula One. Briatore was banned indefinitely from any FIA-sanctioned event, while Symonds received a five-year ban. Furthermore, Briatore was indefinitely banned from managing drivers when the FIA stated that [[superlicence]]s would not be issued or renewed to any driver associated with him in the future. Alonso was cleared of wrongdoing; the FIA found no evidence that he or his mechanics knew anything about the scheme.&lt;ref name="f1ban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/78770|title=Renault given two-year suspended ban|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council came down hard on Briatore because he denied his involvement despite overwhelming evidence.  Symonds, in contrast, had confessed, expressing his "eternal regret and shame" for his role in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9954.html|title=FIA hands individual punishments to Briatore and Symonds|publisher=Formula One|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In announcing the sanctions, the council stated that Renault's actions were serious enough to merit being thrown out of Formula One altogether. However, it opted to impose a suspended sentence because Renault took swift action in forcing Briatore and Symonds to resign.&lt;ref name="Noble"/&gt;  ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' described the ''de facto'' lifetime ban on Briatore as the harshest sanction ever imposed on an individual in the history of motorsport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/09/21/crashgate-renault-owner-flavio-briatore-slapped-with-lifetime-f1-ban-115875-21690293/|title=Renault owner Flavio Briatore slapped with lifetime F1 ban|first=Byron|last=Young|work=The Daily Mirror|location=London|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major contribution to the punishment of Briatore and Symonds was the testimony of the unnamed "Witness X", a Renault employee who was also present at the pre-race meeting but rejected the idea. [[The Daily Mail]] has reported that Witness X was [[Alan Permane]], the team's chief [[race engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-1215794/Queens-Park-Strangers-F1-chief-Bernie-Ecclestone-says-Flavio-Briatore-ban-harsh--longer-talks-him.html|last=McEvoy|first=Jonathan|title=Queens Park Strangers: F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone says Flavio Briatore ban is harsh – and that he no longer talks to him|work=The Daily Mail|location=London|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
After Renault F1 were formally charged, the alleged offence was thought to be unprecedented within Formula One.&lt;ref name=Guardian4Sep09/&gt; The scandal followed two recent Formula One cheating scandals: a case of [[2007 Formula One espionage controversy|industrial espionage between teams]] (including Renault F1); and an instance of the 2008 World Champion [[Lewis Hamilton]] being found to have [[2009 Australian Grand Prix|lied to race stewards]] in March 2009.

The scandal interrupted the team's parent company [[Renault|Renault S.A.]]'s launch of four electric vehicles at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] after journalists questioned Renault chief executive [[Carlos Ghosn]] over the affair, who directed all inquiries to Bernard Rey, chairman of Renault F1.&lt;ref name=Times6837590&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6837590.ece |title=Renault fearful of dent to global brand |work=The Times|location=London|accessdate=17 September 2009|date=17 September 2009|first=Adam|last=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September, [[Patrick Pelata]], [[Renault|Renault S.A.'s]] [[chief operating officer]], first representative from Renault to officially comment on the Singapore crash affair, stated that "The [Renault F1] team believes that a mistake has been made, and punishment must follow.

He also speculated that the FIA would be lenient on Renault F1 and not expel them, due to the sport's current "shaky" condition after recent team departures.&lt;ref name=BBC17Sep09Irvine&gt;{{cite news

Gorman then postulated that this incident was worse than those because Briatore and Symonds set in motion "an event of violent destruction, the consequences of which they could neither predict nor control."&lt;ref name=Times18Sep09Comparison/&gt; [[Matthew Syed]] countered that while the incident was premeditated, "unspeakably unethical" and dangerous, it was not nearly as reckless as the [[Doping in East Germany|East German athletics doping scandal]] and other instances of long-term doping. Syed also argued that the Renault team would not have been expecting injuries to result from the crash, in contrast to incidents such as the assault on ice skater [[Nancy Kerrigan]].&lt;ref name=Times18Sep09Comparison/&gt;

Responding to Flavio Briatore's resignation from Renault F1, [[Formula One Management|Formula One Management's]] [[Bernie Ecclestone]] stated that "It is a pity that Flavio has ended his Formula One career in this way", "You can't defend him at all.

In response to the scandal, Renault's main sponsors [[ING Group|ING]] and [[Mutua Madrileña]] ended their sponsorship agreements with Renault early, within a week after the FIA's decision and right before the next race, the [[2009 Singapore Grand Prix]], with the team removing their logos from the cars before the event.&lt;ref name="autosportsponsors"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/78841|title=Renault removes ING, Mutua logos|work=autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Publications|first=Pablo|last=Elizalde|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major sponsor Mutua Madrileña withdrew its sponsorship of the Renault F1 team first, just before the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix weekend, believing that the situation "could affect the image, reputation and good name of the team's sponsors."&lt;ref name="BBCMutua"&gt;{{cite news |title=Briatore ban too harsh – F1 boss |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8272812.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutua Madrileña did not withdraw sponsorship of Renault driver [[Fernando Alonso]], as he was not implicated in the scandal.&lt;ref name="MutuaReuters"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Iain|title=Spanish insurer cancels Renault sponsorship|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCATRE58N47R20090924|publisher=Reuters|date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed hours later by the withdrawal of title sponsor [[ING Group]] with immediate effect, who had been previously due to end their sponsorship of the team at the end of 2009.&lt;ref name=Motorsport.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=346518&amp;FS=F1|title=Title sponsor ING axes Renault backing  |publisher=Motorsport.com|date=7 October 2009|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavio Briatore's response===
On 19 October 2009, Flavio Briatore announced his intentions to sue the FIA for his lifetime ban, claiming that "the FIA [had] been used as a tool of vengeance on behalf of one man" and that there were several miscarriages of justice, including a delay in summons, a failure to state the charges in advance and a lack of access to documents and "Witness X".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Briatore takes FIA to court|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/79569|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=19 October 2009|work=autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 2010, the French [[Tribunal d'instance|Tribunal de Grande Instance]] overturned his ban, and awarded him €15,000 in compensation.&lt;ref name="Courtoverturns"/&gt; Symonds' ban was also overturned, and he was awarded €5,000 in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gorman|first=Edward|title=FIA considering appeal after bans on Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds lifted|work=The Times|location=London|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6977111.ece|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briatore was believed to be suing the FIA for damages in addition to getting his ban overturned, and has also stated his intention to pursue legal action against the Piquet family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lostia|first=Michele|author2=Beer, Matt |title=Briatore plans action against Piquets|publisher=Haymarket Publications|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80750|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIA appeal===
On 11 January 2010, the FIA announced that they would appeal the decision of the Tribunal de Grande Instance to overturn the bans imposed on Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds. The FIA reinstated the bans while the appeal was active, but stated that drivers managed by Briatore would be granted their superlicences for 2010.&lt;ref name=BBC8452410&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8452410.stm |title=FIA to appeal against decision to Flavio Briatore ban|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April, the FIA announced a settlement with Briatore and Symonds, and that the legal action had been ended. Both men agreed not to work in Formula One until 2013, nor any other FIA-sanctioned championship until the end of 2011.&lt;ref name=settlement/&gt;

===Libel case against Renault===
On 7 December 2010 it was announced that Nelson Piquet Jr and his father had won a libel case against Renault at the High Court based on the allegations described above. Renault apologised to the Piquets and paid them substantial damages. Admitting they libelled the duo, a Renault statement read: "The team accepts, as it did before the World Motor Sport Council, that the allegations made by Nelson Piquet Junior were not false. As a result, these serious allegations contained in our press release were wholly untrue and unfounded, and we withdraw them unequivocally. We would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Piquet Junior and his father for the distress and embarrassment caused as a result. As a mark of the sincerity of our apology and regret, we have agreed to pay them a substantial amount of damages for libel as well as their costs, and have undertaken not to repeat these allegations at any time in the future. It also accepts that Mr Piquet Junior and his father did not invent these allegations to blackmail the team into allowing him to drive for them for the remainder of the 2009 season."&lt;ref name="Piquetwinlibelcase"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/motorsport/12/07/motorsport.piquet.renault.apology/index.html|title=Piquet duo win libel case over Renault|publisher=CNN|date=7 December 2010|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential consequences==
{{update|section|date=January 2010}}
It was suggested in the media that if Briatore were personally found guilty of race-fixing, he might fail the [[The Football League|English Football League]]'s [[Fit and proper person test]] which applies to football club owners and directors, whose regulations exclude people who are "subject to a ban from a sports governing body relating to the administration of their sport", though a BBC report opined that his position might be secure given that he had left Renault.&lt;ref name="Footbal League Briatore"/&gt; The Football League stated that they would wait for the conclusion of the investigation before examining Briatore's fitness to continue to be a director of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]].&lt;ref name=Times6837747&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6837747.ece |title=‘Crashgate’ could force QPR to find new owner|work=The Times|location=London|accessdate=17 September 2009|date=17 September 2009 |first1=Russell|last1=Kempson|first2=Gary|last2=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further.&lt;ref name=BBC8Oct09Briatore&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/8295331.stm|title=Briatore's QPR fate put on hold|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=8 October 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kNURUzte?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/8295331.stm|archivedate=8 October 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to any sporting sanctions by the FIA, Renault, Piquet Jr. or even Felipe Massa could take legal action over the incident.&lt;ref name=Telegraph17Sep09QnA/&gt; It was speculated by the media that Briatore and Symonds could be [[Extradition|extradited]] to Singapore to face criminal charges relating to the incident, which according to one lawyer could encompass "causing malicious or willful damage to property, endangering a vehicle and criminal conspiracy to commit a serious crime".&lt;ref name=Guardian18Sep09Extradition&gt;{{cite news
|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/18/renault-flavio-briatore-formula-one|title=Singapore unlikely to extradite Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SingaporeBT20Sep09Extradition&gt;{{cite web

|title=Disgraced F1 pair could face S'pore extradition 
|work=Business Times|location=Singapore|date=20 September 2009|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was thought to be unlikely however, with the Singaporean authorities believed to be unwilling to attract the negative publicity charges it would create, and also complicated by the fact that Singapore has an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (Symonds being a British citizen) but not [[Italy]] (Briatore being an Italian citizen).&lt;ref name=Guardian18Sep09Extradition/&gt;

Piquet Jr. was criticised by many in the community and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. [[BBC]] F1 commentator [[Martin Brundle]] suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want to be associated with the Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. "didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brundle|first=Martin|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8254417.stm |title=Piquet 'now unemployable in F1'|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mirror1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferdinand|first=Dan|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/motorsport/2009/09/22/nelson-piquet-can-expect-a-paddock-backlash-for-deliberately-crashing-his-renault-at-last-year-s-singapore-grand-prix-115875-21691484/|title=Nelson Piquet can expect a paddock backlash for deliberately crashing his Renault at last year's Singapore Grand Prix|work=Daily Mirror|location=London|date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, "I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, I probably would not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place." Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull Racing, has added, "I don't think we would have any interest [in Piquet Jr.] at Red Bull Racing."&lt;ref name="Little support for Nelson Piquet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/091002121925.shtml |title=Little support for Nelson Piquet |publisher=F1-Live.com |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piquet Jr. has since joined America's NASCAR circuit, starting in the Camping World Truck Series and Nationwide Series in 2010. He drove for Turner Scott Motorsports part-time in the #30 Chevrolet Silverado in the Camping World Truck Series and full-time in the #30 Chevrolet Camaro in the Nationwide Series. In 2014-2015 Piquet Jr. took part in the inaugural [[Formula E]] season with [[China Racing]], eventually becoming Formula E's inaugural champion by a single point over [[Sébastien Buemi]].

==History==
{{See also|Discovery and development of Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Antagonists}}
Rimonabant is a selective CB1 [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] blocker and was [[drug discovery|discovered]] and [[drug development|developed]] by [[Sanofi|Sanofi-Aventis]];&lt;ref name=Barth_1999&gt;{{Citation | last = Barth | first = F. | last2 =Rinaldi-Carmona  | first2 = M. | title = The Development of Cannabinoid Antagonists| journal =Current Medicinal Chemistry| volume = 6 | pages = 745–755| year = 1999 | url=http://www.bentham.org/cmc/contabs/vol6-8.html | pmid = 10469889 | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2006, the [[European Commission]] approved the sale of rimonabant in the then-25-member European Union as a prescription drug for use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] greater than 30&amp;nbsp;kg/m², or patients with a BMI greater than 27&amp;nbsp;kg/m² with associated risk factors, such as type 2 [[diabetes]] or [[dyslipidaemia]].&lt;ref name=EMAlabel&gt;{{cite web|title=Acomplia EPAR|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/000666/WC500021282.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=January 30, 2009}} From [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000666/human_med_000623.jsp EMA index page]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first in its class to be approved anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=IHS/&gt;

Rimonabant was submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for approval in the United States in 2005; in 2007, the FDA's Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) concluded that Sanofi-Aventis failed to demonstrate the safety of rimonabant and voted against recommending the anti-obesity treatment for approval&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Stephanie|title=F.D.A. Panel Rejects Drug for Obesity|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D9143FF937A25755C0A9619C8B63|work=The New York Times|date=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two weeks later the company withdrew the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sanofi-Aventis Drops Application for Drug|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/30/business/30drug.html|work=The New York Times|date=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug was approved in Brazil in April 2007.&lt;ref name=Moreira2009/&gt;

In October 2008, the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended the suspension of Acomplia after the [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP) had determined that the risks of Acomplia [[risk-benefit analysis|outweighed its benefits]] due to the risk of serious psychiatric problems, including suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2009/11/news_detail_000244.jsp|title=The European Medicines Agency recommends suspension of the marketing authorisation of Acomplia|publisher=European Medicines Agency|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008 an advisory committee in Brazil recommended suspension as well, and that month Sanofi-Aventis suspended sale of the drug worldwide.&lt;ref name=Moreira2009/&gt;  The EMA approval was withdrawn in January 2009.&lt;ref name="euwith"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7687311.stm|title=Anti-obesity drug use suspended|date=23 October 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2009/11/WC500012189.pdf |title=Public Statement on Acomplia (rimonabant) Withdrawal of the Marketing Authorisation in the European Union|publisher=European Medicines Agency |date=30 January 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 India prohibited the manufacture and sale of the drug.&lt;ref name=ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdsco.nic.in/writereaddata/DBC.pdfl|title=Drugs banned in India|publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India|accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Data from clinical trials submitted to regulatory authorities showed that rimonabant caused depressive disorders or mood alterations in up to 10% of subjects and suicidal ideation in around 1%, and in Europe it was contraindicated for people with any psychiatric disorder, including depressed or suicidal individuals.&lt;ref name=EMAlabel/&gt;

Additionally, nausea and upper respiratory tract infections were very common (occurring in more than 10% of people) adverse effects; common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) included [[gastroenteritis]], anxiety, irritability, insomnia and other sleep disorders, hot flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, tendonitis, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and increased risk of falling.

The FDA's advisory committee raised concerns that based on animal data, it appeared that the [[therapeutic window]] with regard to CNS toxicity, and specifically seizures was almost nonexistent; the therapeutic dose and the dose that caused seizures in animals appeared to be the same.&lt;ref name=Moreira2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Briefing Document NDA 21-888 Zimulti (rimonabant) Tablets, 20|url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/briefing/2007-4306b1-fda-backgrounder.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=June 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis-Bruno|first1=Karen|title=Nonclinical Overview: CNS Toxicity with Rimonabant|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/slides/2007-4306s1-09-FDA-Bruno.ppt|publisher=FDA, Division of Metabolism &amp; Endocrinology Products|date=June 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the EMA reviewed [[postmarketing surveillance]] data, it found that the risk of psychiatric disorders in people taking rimonabant was doubled.&lt;ref name=Moreira2009/&gt;

'''Robert Alvin Lewis''' (October 18, 1917 – June 18, 1983) was a [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] serving in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theatre]] during [[World War II]].  He was the [[co-pilot]] of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', the [[B-29 Superfortress]] bomber which dropped the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] [[Little Boy]] on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945.

== Military career ==
{{more footnotes|section|date=July 2017}}
Lewis grew up in [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]], New Jersey, and attended [[Ridgefield Park High School]], graduating in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fosdick |first=George |url=https://sites.google.com/site/ridgefieldparkalumni/calendar |title=History of Ridgefield Park High School |publisher=Ridgefield Park Jr. / Sr. High School Alumni Association |accessdate=February 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, he had to wait after enlisting to be processed into the USAAF [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS). Lewis went on to be a multi-engine [[test pilot]] in [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]], [[Martin B-26 Marauder|B-26]], [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] and B-29 bombers, which later led to him as co-pilot and his crew being selected for the Hiroshima bombing mission.

Lewis was [[Battlefield promotion|field promoted]] to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] by General [[Curtis LeMay]] after demonstrating the B-29 and training the general on how to fly it. LeMay addressed Lieutenant Lewis as "Captain Lewis" on the field at the conclusion of several days of training and testing. Lewis tried to correct the general as to his rank, but LeMay insisted on captain, with the field commission arriving several weeks later by USAAF mail to him based in the midwestern US at the time.

Lewis was always a "crew-first" pilot who survived two crashes due to electrical failure and engine failure. Articles from New York City area newspapers attested to his "cool head under stressful conditions", ultimately leading to his selection as captain of a B-29 crew. Lewis led hundreds of bombing runs from Utah to [[Salton Sea]] in California leading up to his selection with his crew by [[Colonel]] [[Paul Tibbets]]. In early June, Lewis and his co-pilot Dick McNamara flew the entire crew and support crew from Utah to [[Tinian]], in the B-29 specially modified to carry Little Boy to Japan from the huge Tinian base that General LeMay controlled from [[Guam]].

On August 6, 1945 – August 5 in the United States, due to the time difference – Lewis was the co-pilot of the ''Enola Gay'' when it dropped Little Boy on Hiroshima. Normally the aircraft commander assigned to the ''Enola Gay'', for this important mission he acted as co-pilot, assisting ''Enola Gay''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s new aircraft commander, Colonel Tibbets.  Lewis and his crew, minus their original co-pilot Dick McNamara, were Tibbet's crew for the mission, and it included two specialists for the arming of Little Boy, the [[uranium-235]] fission bomb.

The entire story was written by Lewis just before his death in 1983. His log, the only minute-by-minute recording on paper by any crew member that day, is part of his copyrighted historical manuscript. His sons and daughter are in the process of publishing the manuscript before the 75th anniversary of the bombing in 2020.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

After the war, Lewis became a pilot for [[American Overseas Airlines]],&lt;ref name=AsburyObit&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12259595/robert_a_lewis_copilot_of_hiroshima/ |title=Robert A.

===Survivor meetings===
In [[New York City]] in 1951, Lewis met Hiroshima survivor Father [[Hubert Schiffer]],&lt;ref name=TCA&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12345288/enola_gay_pilot_hears_bombs_amazing/ |title='Enola Gay' Pilot Hears Bomb's Amazing Effect |newspaper=The Catholic Advance |location=[[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], Kansas |date=January 19, 1951 |accessdate=July 13, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was eight blocks from [[ground zero]] when the explosion occurred and was seriously injured.&lt;ref name=ADS/&gt; Schiffer invited Lewis to visit Hiroshima in August 1952 for the dedication of a "palace of prayer", which Lewis accepted;&lt;ref name=TCA/&gt; however, there is no record of Lewis actually making such a visit. The two also appeared together at [[Fordham University]] in 1957, on the twelfth anniversary of the bombing, with Schiffer noting that they had become "very fast friends."&lt;ref name=ADS&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12345447/old_pals_differ_on_using_bomb/ |title=Old Pals Differ On Using Bomb |newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |location=[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], Arizona |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=August 7, 1957 |accessdate=July 13, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Lewis appeared on the television show ''[[This is Your Life]]'', in an episode not without controversy. The show had as its guest Reverend [[Kiyoshi Tanimoto]], who had been living in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing and survived the explosion, as recounted in [[John Hersey]]'s  1946 book ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]''. Tanimoto had traveled to the United States with the [[Hiroshima Maidens]] to get reconstructive surgery for them, and while there was the subject of the May 11 episode of ''This Is Your Life.''&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12232053/tanimoto_lewis/ |title=Hollywood Today (column) |first=Louella O. |last=Parsons |agency=[[International News Service|INS]] |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |location=[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Arizona |date=May 14, 1955 |accessdate=July 8, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some acquaintances were introduced and interviewed, a surprise for Tanimoto was meeting Lewis – on [[live television]] broadcast to a nationwide audience – representing the crew of the aircraft that had so dramatically changed his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rakoff |first=David |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1D71331F932A25752C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=lewis+%22enola+gay%22&amp;st=nyt |title=Theater; Hiroshima Bomber and Victims: This Is Your (Puppet's) Life |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 11, 2004 |accessdate=February 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary reaction to the episode was mixed, ranging from "one of [the] best"&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt; to a "new low in poor taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conelrad.blogspot.com/2010/08/hiroshima-this-is-your-life.html |title=Hiroshima: This Is Your Life |website=conelrad.blogspot.com |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis described the ''Enola Gay'''s flight and the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. When asked by host [[Ralph Edwards]] if he remembered his reaction on that fateful day, he remarked, "I wrote down later, 'My God, what have we done?'&amp;nbsp;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_58byuLBu0&amp;t=2m0s |title=White Light/Black Rain excerpt |via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Lewis became a self-taught [[Stone sculpture|stone sculptor]], working in [[marble]] and [[alabaster]], following a business trip to [[Florence]] where he saw some apprentices at work.&lt;ref name=AsburySculpt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12259890/abomb_pilot_carves_new_career/ |title=A-Bomb Pilot Carves New Career |newspaper=[[Asbury Park Press]] |location=[[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]], New Jersey |date=August 2, 1970 |accessdate=July 9, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his sculptures, titled ''‘God’s Wind’ at Hiroshima?'', depicted a [[mushroom cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conelrad.blogspot.com/2010/10/shroom-odyssey-of-robert-lewiss-atomic.html |title=The 'Shroom: The Odyssey of Robert Lewis's Atomic Sculpture |website=conelrad.blogspot.com |date=October 11, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Lewis lived in a small cottage on West Shore Trail in the quiet [[Lake Mohawk, New Jersey|Lake Mohawk]] community of [[Sparta, New Jersey|Sparta]], New Jersey.

In 1971, Lewis sold his manuscript log from the Hiroshima mission, which he had written during the flight at the request of journalist [[William L. Laurence]]; it was auctioned by [[Christies]] and sold for $37,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12308250/copilots_log_of_aattack_auctioned/ |title=Copilot's Log Of A-Attack Auctioned |newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] |location=[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=November 27, 1971 |accessdate=July 12, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was later resold to [[Malcolm Forbes]], and after Forbes' death was purchased by an anonymous buyer.&lt;ref name=Bonhams/&gt; Prior to the 1971 sale, Lewis made six hand-written copies of the log, one each for his wife and five children; one copy was sold in 2015 for $50,000.&lt;ref name=Bonhams&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22456/lot/294/ |title=Lot 294 |website=[[Bonhams]] |date=April 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Lewis took a position with the Estee Candy Corporation, until his retirement in 1981.&lt;ref name=AsburyObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesObit/&gt; He was portrayed by [[Gregory Harrison]] in the 1980 [[television film]] ''Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080689/ |title=Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb (1980) |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis lived in [[Smithfield, Virginia|Smithfield]], Virginia, for two years before his death in 1983 of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at home;&lt;ref name=AsburyObit/&gt; he was declared dead at [[Riverside Health System|Riverside Hospital]] in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=TimesObit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F20C15FA395F0C738EDDAF0894DB484D81 |title=Robert A.

In 1990, Lewis' widow put up for auction a manuscript navigator's log from the Hiroshima mission, however it failed to sell after questions arose about its authenticity, with ''Enola Gay'' navigator [[Theodore Van Kirk]] stating that he still had the log he wrote during the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12308422/enola_gay_flight_log_fails_to_sell/ |title=Enola Gay flight log fails to sell |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |location=[[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=December 8, 1990 |accessdate=July 12, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2018, Nunberg spoke to Ari Melber who asked Nunberg, "People in politics say we knew there was hacking, but the man you used to work for, Donald Trump, and many people around him doubt about how it happened, whether it mattered. Do you think today's indictment, which Donald Trump was briefed on, should change his mind about undermining both the fact that the Russians did this and attacking the probe?" Nunberg replies with, "First of all I think this should change the mind of any Republican voter that doesn't want Donald Trump to be impeached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber/watch/sam-nunberg-speaks-out-as-mueller-circles-mentor-roger-stone-1276735555638 |title=Sam Nunberg speaks out as Mueller circles mentor Roger Stone |first=Ari |last=Melber |website=NBC News |access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Take Our Kids to Work Day''' is an annual career exploration event, held every November, where Grade 9, Senior 1 ([[Manitoba]]) and Secondary III ([[Quebec]]) students across [[Canada]] spend the day in the life of a working professional. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/take-our-kids-work-battah-1.3299485|title=Take Our Kids to Work Day benefits students and employers {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by The Learning Partnership, the initiative started as a one-day event for students in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelearningpartnership.ca/press/celebrating-the-take-our-kids-to-worktm-generation|title=Celebrating the Take Our Kids to Work™ Generation|website=The Learning Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is a national event with more than 250,000 students, 18,000 teachers and 75,000 organizations participating each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelearningpartnership.ca/tokw-media-room|title=Take Our Kids to Work Celebrates 20 years!|website=The Learning Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the event regularly takes place on the first Wednesday of November each year, the next Take Our Kids to Work Day will take place on Wednesday, November 14, 2018 due to a conflict with a major ethnic festival on the 7th. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelearningpartnership.ca/TOKW|title=Take Our Kids to Work Day {{!}} Public Education. Canada’s Future|website=www.thelearningpartnership.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students spend the day at the workplace of a parent, relative, friend or volunteer host, witnessing first-hand the world of work, prompting early career planning, and enabling students to make informed decisions about their future goals and endeavours. The event also gives parents the opportunity to discuss career prospects with their children, and allows businesses to share knowledge, experience and advice around education, career choices and relevant skills required in today’s workplace. 

==Overview==

Developed by The Learning Partnership, Take Our Kids to Work Day is the most recognized career exploration event in Canada, in which Grade 9 students experience a day in the life of various professionals, careers and industries. 

==History==
The Learning Partnership founded Take Our Kids to Work Day in 1994.  The concept of Take our Kids to Work Day was loosely related to Take Your Daughter to Work Day in the United States founded the year prior, which is now called [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day]].  Take Our Kids to Work is The Learning Partnership's flagship program. Unlike its American counterpart, Take Our Kids to Work focuses on Grade 9 students and takes place annually on the first Wednesday of November instead of April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Criger|first1=Erin|title=Wednesday is Take Our Kids to Work day|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2013/11/06/wednesday-is-take-our-kids-to-work-day-3/|website=CityNews Toronto|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  November 5, 2014, marked the 20th anniversary of Take Out Kids to Work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating The Take Our Kids To Work(TM) Generation|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/news-sources/?mid=ccnm.20141007.11G023311-001|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Teatro Fru Fru (Fru Fru Theater)''''' is a theater in [[Mexico City]]. It was inaugurated on January 1, 1899 under the name Teatro Renacimiento. In 1973 it was re-inaugurated with its current name. It is located at number 24 in the Donceles Street, in the [[Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México]]

==History==
In the place where the theater is located was originally located the Gran Teatro Nacional.&lt;ref name="0e2a0e56"&gt;[http://www.actualmx.com/el-teatro-fru-fru/ ''Actualmx.com: The Teatro Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt; When it was demolished, the Teatro Renacimiento was built in its place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maspormas.com/2017/02/24/la-cdmx-tiempo-los-teatros/ ''Máspormás.com: Theaters of Mexico City'']&lt;/ref&gt; The theater was inaugurated on January 1, 1899. It is said that the inauguration was attended by the then President of Mexico [[Porfirio Díaz]]. But in 1906, the theater is acquired by businessman Francisco Cardona, who decides to rename it with the name of his wife, legendary Mexican actress and theater entrepreneur [[Virginia Fábregas]]. At that time was a novelty, since it was the first theater in the Mexican capital to own electric lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enteratedf.com/lugar/teatro-fru-fru ''EnterateDF.com: The Teatro Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The theater lived a period of splendor at the beginning of the century. But in 1933, the theater began to lose its splendor and changed its name to Teatro Mexicano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escenalatina.com/2016/09/hablemos-del-teatro-fru-fru/ ''Escenalatina.com: About the Teatro Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to unknown issues, the theater remained closed for several years and was about to be demolished.

In 1973, the theater was acquired and remodeled by Mexican actress and singer [[Irma Serrano]] ''La Tigresa''. The actress claims to have acquired the property at an auction of the cement company Anahuac.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/12/17/12an1esp.html ''JornadaUNAM.mx: Reopening of the Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt; With an important investment, Serrano reactive the theater baptizing it with the present name. The theater was inaugurated with the controversial theatrical assembly ''Naná'', based on the [[Nana (novel)|homonymous novel]] of [[Emile Zola]], and produced and carried out by Serrano. The work remained on the billboard with great success for a couple of years.&lt;ref name="0e2a0e56" /&gt;

From that moment, the theater becomes the forum for a series of controversial works produced and some also starring by ''La Tigresa''. Among them stand out montages like ''Lucrecia Borgia'' (1977) or ''Yocasta Reina'' (1978), among others.

In the early 1980s, the theater introduced the concept known as ''Midnight Theater'', created by producer and director Pablo Leder, which was based on works aimed at a strictly adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xn--salvadornuez-jhb.com/curiosidades/pablo-leder-y-mexico-gay-de-1960-1970-hubo-una-vez-antes-del-sida/ ''SalvadorNuñez.com: Pablo Leder'']&lt;/ref&gt; This situation gave the theater a reputation of controversial and transgressor, although the theatrical montages stood out by a great quality in production.

At the end of 1980s, the theater gradually stopped performing plays. During 1990s, the venue opened its doors for certain seasons as a night club. In 2003, the theater reopens its doors to being rented by Serrano to the entrepreneur Enrique Vidal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/46915.html ''ElUniversal.com: Reopening of the Teatro Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after a series of conflicts, the enclosure closed its doors for the second time.

Since then, the venue has reopened its doors for theatrical productions sporadically. In recent times the venue has also served as a space for musical events by bands and artists such as Victimas del Doctor Cerebro,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizarro.fm/2016/10/victimas-dr-cerebro-teatro-fru-fru/ ''Bizarro.fm: Víctimas del Doctor Cerebro in the Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalia Lafourcade]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundcheck.com.mx/natalia-lafourcade-visita-el-teatro-fru-fru/ ''SoundCheck.com: Lafourcade visits the Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gang Gang Dance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chilango.com/musica/concierto/2011/09/30/gang-gang-dance-en-mexico ''Chilango.com: Gang Gang Dance in Mexico'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Dresden Dolls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rollingstone.com.mx/tag/the-dresden-dolls-en-el-teatro-fru-fru/ ''Rolling Stone Mexico: The Dresden Dolls in Mexico'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its history and peculiar decorative style, the Teatro Fru Fru  has also served as a space for the recording of music videos and films both national and foreign. Among them are ''[[Cantinflas (film)|Cantinflas]]'' (2014) by Sebastián del Amo and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), by [[Sam Mendes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elproyectormx.com/2015/08/teatro-fru-fru-el-nuevo-lugar-in-para.html ''El Proyectormx.com: The Teatro Fru Fru, the New "in" place to film in Mexico City'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
* In one of the galleries of the precinct existed in the years 1970's and 1980's a cabaret known as ''La Cueva de La Tigresa'', famous for its daring [[burlesque]] shows.
* In the lobby there is a statue of what appears to be a demon carrying a small tray. According to tradition, the actors must leave a sweet as an offering so that their works do not fail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maspormas.com/2017/01/26/habitantes-teatro-fru-fru/ ''Máspormás.com: Habitantes del… Teatro Fru Fru'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to its antiquity, peculiar architecture and decoration and controversial personality of Irma Serrano, its owner, has been the subject of numerous legends and myths that relate paranormal events inside its doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitosmonstruosyleyendas.blogspot.mx/2015/12/fantasmas-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico.html ''Monstruos y leyendas blog: Ghosts in Mexico City'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This was made using Google Translate and the French article. (If those need to be cited, the URLs are [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatotranscriptome] and https://translate.google.com/#fr/en].) Because of this, some of the links may not work, and the whole article is in need of grammatical surgery. I fixed as much as I had the patience to, but that was unfortunately not much. For now though, it's better than nothing. --&gt;

[[File:Affymetrix-microarray.jpg|thumb|[[DNA microarray]] used to analyze the expression of human genes left mouse right.]]

The '''thanatotranscriptome''' denotes (in the fields of [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]] and [[biophysics]] of [[thanatology]] and in particular [[forensic]]) all [[ribonucleic acid|RNA]] from the transcript of the part of [[genome]] still active or awakened in the internal organs of a dead body for 24 to 48 hours following the time of the [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Pozhitkov, A. E., Neme, R., Domazet-Loso, T., Leroux, B., Soni, S., Tautz, D., &amp; Noble, P. A. (2016). Thanatotranscriptome: genes actively expressed after organismal death. bioRxiv, 058305.&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Can, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Soni, S. (2015). The apoptotic thanatotranscriptome associated with the liver of cadavers. Forensic science, medicine, and pathology, 11(4), 509-516 ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-015-9704-6 summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was recently showed that in these 48 hours, some genes continue to be expressed in [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, producing the [[mRNA]] and that certain genes are expressed again that had been inhibited since the end of fetal development) &lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

== Thanatotranscriptomic Analysis ==
It can from a [[serology]] postmortem characterize [[transcriptome]] of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] particular cell type, or compare the transcriptomes between various conditions experimental.

It can be complementary to the analysis of [[thanatomicrobiome]] to better understand the process of transformation of the [[necromass]] in the days following the death;.&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Finley, S. J., Abidin, Z., &amp; Mulle, J. G. (2016) ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4764706/ The Thanatomicrobiome: A Missing Piece of the Microbial Puzzle of Death]''. Frontiers in microbiology, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Characterization and quantification of the transcriptome in a tissue "dead" given and conditions data can identify [[gene]]s assets, to determine the regulatory mechanisms of [[Gene Expression]] and set networks of gene expression.

== Analytical Techniques ==
The techniques commonly used for simultaneously measuring the concentration of a large number of different types of mRNA include [[biochip|Microarray]], high throughput sequencing said RNA [[RNA-Seq]].

== Scientific History ==
Clues to the existence of a post-mortem transcriptome existed at least since the beginning of the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Can, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Soni, S. (2015). ''The apoptotic thanatotranscriptome associated with the liver of cadavers''. Forensic science, medicine, and pathology, 11(4), 509-516.&lt;/ref&gt; but in [[scientific publications]] the word ''thanatotranscriptome'' seems to have been first proposed by Javan et al. in 2015;&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Kwon, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Lee, Y. (2015). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheree_Finley/publication/284233163_Progression_of_Thanatophagy_in_Cadaver_Brain_and_Heart_Tissues/links/567aa20308ae1e63f1df4dc3.pdf Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports].''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Washington]], Peter Noble, Alex Pozhitkov and their colleagues recently (2016) confirmed that up to 2 days (48 hours) after the death of mice or zebrafish, many genes still function in their [[Human body|body]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Anna (2016) “[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2094644-hundreds-of-genes-seen-sparking-to-life-two-days-after-death/ ''Hundreds of genes seen sparking to life two days after death (The discovery that many genes are still working up to 48 hours after death has implications for organ transplants, forensics and our very definition of death)'']”; New Scientist, 21 juin 2016, commentant un article intitulé  “''Genes get active after death''” dont la référence est BioRxiv, DOI: 10.1101/058305; DOI: 10.1101/058370&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;changes in the quantities of [[mRNA]] in the body prove that hundreds of genes with very different functions awoke just after death 548 genes have thus awakened after the death of [[zebrafish]] and 515 in the [[laboratory mice]].&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
Among the genes which thus awake, there are genes involved in the development of the organism, including genes that are normally activated only ''[[in utero]]'' or ''[[in ovo]]'' (in the egg) during fetal development.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

== Applications ==
This information could possibly in the future lead to:

* Construct a definition both more accurate and nuanced phenomenon of "[[death]]";
* More precise time of death by the [[forensic]] (or a biologist or veterinarian in an [[EcoHealth]] investigation who needs information on hours or causes of poisoning, without the case of a [[zoonosis]] for example. &lt;br /&gt;We are far, but if we come to better understand the steps of this phenomenon in the [[Human]], a coroner could via a ''"postmortem serology"''&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, L. I., Tate, C. M., Knott, E. L., McDaniel, J. E., Rogers, S. S., Koons, B. W., ... &amp; Robertson, J. M. (2012). Determination of an effective housekeeping gene for the quantification of mRNA for forensic applications. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 57(4), 1051-1058 ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2012.02086.x/full summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in the future, according to the dosage of the mRNA, establish with greater precision the time since death (by hour, even in minutes rather than days, which can be useful for investigations to reconstruct the conditions of death&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;).
* Illuminate the phenomenon of [[cell death]] of [[apoptosis]] or the death of a body, and in particular the phenomenon of [[ischemia]] ([[myocardial]] including&lt;ref name= Herrera2013/&gt;) and its process [[healing]] or resilience, for perhaps then to facilitate them. &lt;br /&gt;This gene revival also means remaining in the cells for up to 48 hours after the death of these animals enough energy for activating the cellular machinery.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; At least part of these genes appear to be genes involved in physiological healing, healing or "auto-resuscitation".&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
* Understand cancer. It was found that among the genes reactivated soon after death, some of the genes involved in the process of [[cancerous]] (reactivated with a peak of activity reaches about 24 hours after death&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;) ; detailed understanding of this phenomenon could shed light on the phenomenon of carcinogenesis and maybe bring some new elements to better combat.
* Improving the quality of organ transplants. Indeed, the fact that cancer-related genes are activated after the death in animals is information that leads us to consider the time of organ transplantation to reduce the incidence of cancer in people receiving these transplants.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; Persons to which was grafted a new liver actually more cancers after treatment than would be statistically normal. This phenomenon was attributed to the diet imposed on them, or immunosuppressive drugs they receive for their body does not reject the transplant.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; One hypothesis (yet to be verified) is that the cancer genes activated in the [[liver]] of the [[organ donation|donor]] may also play a role.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
* Whether there is the same in humans, because previous studies have already shown that in people dead by trauma, heart attack or suffocation, various genes including those involved in cardiac muscle contraction and wound healing, were active more than 12 hours after death.&lt;ref name= Herrera2013&gt;González-Herrera, L., Valenzuela, A., Marchal, J. A., Lorente, J. A., &amp; Villanueva, E. (2013). Studies on RNA integrity and gene expression in human myocardial tissue, pericardial fluid and blood, and its postmortem stability. Forensic science international, 232(1), 218-228 ([http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(13)00378-2/abstract summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly for gene dental pulp.&lt;ref&gt;Poór, V. S., Lukács, D., Nagy, T., Rácz, E., &amp; Sipos, K. (2016). The rate of RNA degradation in human dental pulp reveals post-mortem interval. International journal of legal medicine, 130(3), 615-619 ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-015-1295-y summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors in 2015 introduced the concept of ''"thanatotranscriptome [[apoptosis|apoptotic]]"''&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Can, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Soni, S. (2015). The apoptotic thanatotranscriptome associated with the liver of cadavers. Forensic science, medicine, and pathology, 11(4), 509-516 ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-015-9704-6 summary].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Test another hypothesis is that after death, a rapid decrease of the "suppressor genes" activity (which normally inhibit the activation of other genes, including those no longer needed after the fetal stage) would allow dormant genes wake up, at least for this short period of time.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 073.jpg|thumb|right|''The Raising of the Cross'' by [[Rembrandt]], 1633. Rembrandt painted himself into the depiction (in blue), partly to represent that he was (spiritually) present at the crucifixion.]]
'''The Raising of the Cross''' is part of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], and has been a distinct subject of [[Christian art]].

Notable depictions include ''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Elevation of the Cross]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and ''The Raising of the Cross'' by [[List of paintings by Rembrandt|Rembrandt]].

In [[Gospel of John|John's gospel]], Jesus predicted that he would be "lifted up from the earth" (John 12:32) in order to draw all men to himself. [[John the Evangelist|John]] notes that Jesus was referring to his death (John 12:33).

{{Donald Trump series}}
The following is a [[timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump]] during the second quarter of 2018. To navigate among quarters, see [[Timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump]].
==Overview==
===Economy===
Over 103,000 jobs were created in March as the unemployment rate remained stable into April. At the start of the quarter, the US stock market experienced daily sell-offs and recoveries due to a burgeoning US-China trade war and increased political scrutiny of American business icons [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iyengar|first1=Rishi|title=How a US-China trade war could hurt (and help) others|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/10/news/economy/us-china-trade-war-fallout-countries/index.html|accessdate=April 24, 2018|publisher=CNN Money|date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helmore|first1=Edward|title=Trouble for big tech as consumers sour on Amazon, Facebook and co|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/01/big-tech-touble-amazon-facebook|accessdate=April 24, 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Labor Department]] reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 3.9% for April and an increase of 164,000 jobs. Wages grew by 2.6%. Hiring gains were broad based with jobs being added in the fields of professional and business services, health care, manufacturing, and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION — APRIL 2018|url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf|website=www.bls.gov|publisher=US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public opinion ===
According to [[FiveThirtyEight]], President Trump's approval rate at the beginning of this quarter was 40.5%, down 4.9% from the start of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings |title=How unpopular is Donald Trump? |website=projects.fivethirtyeight.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616000621/https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/ |archivedate=June 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1, it had improved to 41.2%.

'''Triplemanía XVIII''' (Triplemanía 18) was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event produced by the [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] that took place on June 6, 2010 at the Palacio de los Deportes ("Sports Palace") in [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]]. The show featured eight with the main events being a "dream match" between [[L.A. Park]] and [[La Parka II|La Parka]] with the rights to the La Parka name on the line as well as [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]] defending the [[AAA Mega Championship]] against [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] The show also featured a performance by [[El Tri]], a Mexican [[blues]]/[[hard rock]] band after the wrestling portion of the show was over. All four title matches of the event saw the championship change hands, the show also featured appearances of wrestlers from competing wrestling promotions [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] and [[Perros del Mal (promotion)|Los Perros del Mal]]. The main event between L.A. Park and La Parka originally saw L.A. Park pin La Parka. Later on it was announced that the result thrown out by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission due to outside interference, ruling it a no-contest, but the decision was reversed the next day as AAA declared that L.A. Park had earned the rights to the name "La Parka" with his victory. However, three days later AAA announced that they would respect the Commission's decision and declared the match thrown out.

Through TNA and AAA partnership representatives appeared at this event including Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm), Atsushi Aoki and Go Shiozaki
==Production==

===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]], later known simply as "AAA" or Triple A. After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April, 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Peña and AAA held their first [[Triplemanía]] event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's [[Super Bowl]] event, similar to the [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] being the biggest show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Triplemanía was the 18th year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the 23rd overall show under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía XVIII show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The "Road to Triplemanía" began at AAA's previous major event [[Rey de Reyes (2010)|Rey de Reyes]] which featured the beginning of new storylines and major turning points in other ongoing feuds. The driving force leading into Triplemanía was the developing "family feud" between AAA president Joaquin Roldan and his son Dorian. At Rey de Reyes Dorian Roldan turned on his father and stated that "a new era was about to begin". Dorian Roldan sided with [[Konnan]] and his ''[[La Legión Extranjera]]'' and introduced the returning [[La Parka|L.A. Park]] to the stunned audience.&lt;ref name=AAAReydeReys&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/coberturaenvivordr.html | title= Rey de Reyes, cobertura en vivo aqui | date= March 12, 2010 | accessdate= March 13, 2010 | publisher= [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración|AAA]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ''Rey de Reyes'' event Dorian Roldan and Konnan introduced several "outsiders" who sided with ''La Legión'' including the [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] team of [[Takeshi Morishima]] and [[Taiji Ishimori]] who won the [[AAA World Tag Team Championship]] from ''La Hermandad 187'' ([[Psicosis|Nicho el Millonario]] and [[Joe Lider]]).&lt;ref name=March19&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/tripleaeneljuandelabarrera.html | title= Ya estamos en la Casa | date= March 19, 2010 | accessdate= March 20, 2010 | publisher= [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración|AAA]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorian Roldan was also instrumental in having [[Vampiro]] turn on Joaquin Roldan during an AAA show on April 18, 2010.&lt;ref name=AAAOrizaba&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/orizabacronica.html | title= El licenciado Roldan ¡Atacado! | author= LuchaLibreAAA staff | date= April 18, 2010 | accessdate= April 19, 2010 | publisher= [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración|AAA]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During AAA's television taping on May 19, 2010 Dorian Roldan said that his father did not deserve to run AAA since he was not a blood relative of [[Antonio Peña]] like he was, just married into the family.&lt;ref name=May19&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/actopan.html | title= La Parka y L.A.

In one of the biggest stories of ''lucha libre'' in 2010 L.A. Park, the original La Parka, returned to AAA 13 years after he left the company on bad terms. In the intervening years then-AAA owner Antonio Peña had given the mask, outfit and [[ring name]] to a new wrestler, creating a second version of [[La Parka II|La Parka]]. Over the years AAA and the original Parka have been involved in a legal battle over the rights to the name, until reaching some sort of arrangement to work together again in 2010. L.A. Park's target from the first night has been the new La Parka, claiming that he was just a pale imitation.&lt;ref name=AAAReydeReys/&gt; During an AAA show on March 19, 2010 L.A. Park attacked La Parka and threw him through a table.&lt;ref name=March19/&gt; In order to maintain the illusion that L.A. Park did not actually work for AAA, thus enhancing the tension between the two characters, L.A. Park later claimed that he came to AAA to beat up La Parka, and since he had done that on March 19 he wasn't sure if he even felt like returning to AAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rivera, Luis Manuel | title = LA Park: Habla de AAA y Súper Parka | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 359 | pages= 24–25 | date = April 12, 2010 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; L.A. Park did however return to an AAA ring as he had another brawl with La Parka on AAA's April 18 television taping. During the event La Parka challenged L.A. Park to a match at Triplemanía XVIII, under any stipulation that the original Parka wanted.&lt;ref name=AAAOrizaba/&gt; During AAA's television taping on April 30, 2010 L.A.

After signing the contract Dorian Roldan had the police arrest La Parka for piracy by impersonating La Parka. He was released just in time to run in during the semi-main event to attack L.A. Park.&lt;ref name=May19/&gt;

At Rey de Reyes [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]] won the [[AAA Mega Championship]] by defeating [[Mr. Kennedy|Mr. Anderson]] and [[Ricky Banderas|El Mesías]]. After the match [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]], leader of ''Los Wagnermaníacos'' a group Electroshock was part of, came to the ring to congratulate Electroshock, seemingly putting an end to the building tension between the two. On the March 19 show Dr. Wagner Jr. asked Electroshock to give him a shot at the title, something which Electroshock turned down but instead offered to fight him right then and there. After the two were separated by security it was clear that Electroshock was no longer part of ''Los Wagnermaniacos''.&lt;ref name=March19/&gt; At a later show [[Silver King (wrestler)|Silver King]], Dr. Wagner Jr.'s brother, interfered in a fight between the two by attacking his brother, siding with Electroshock. Silver King stated that he chose friendship over family and was siding with Electroshock in the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Islas, Alejandro | title = Se acabó la Wagnermanía | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 359 | pages= 18–19 | date = April 12, 2010 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2010 AAA confirmed on their website that Electroshock would defend the title against Dr. Wagner Jr.&lt;ref name=MegaCampeonato&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/triplemania.html | title= Megacampeonato: Electroshock vs. Wagner.

At ''[[Héroes Inmortales III]]'' [[Sexy Star]] defeated [[Faby Apache]], with the help of ''[[La Legión Extranjera]]'', to win the [[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship]].

[[Extreme Tiger]] and [[Alex Koslov]] had been feuding for over a year, in a storyline that centered on the [[AAA Cruiserweight Championship]].

For over a year ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rúdo]]'' (bad guy) referee Hijo del Tirantes had been helping the ''rúdos'' win matches, deliberately overlooking any cheating and helping them win by counting faster than referees are supposed to during pinfalls. In the spring of 2010 referee Pierro finally spoke out about the biased refereeing and tried to put a stop to it. During AAA's April 30, 2010 television taping it was announced that each referee would choose three wrestlers to represent them in a match at Triplemanía XVIII where the hair of the referee was on the line.&lt;ref name=April30/&gt; The six men involved in the match were announced at AAA's press conference on May 12, 2010.

===Preliminary matches===
The opening match of Triplemanía XVIII was the [[Tables, Ladders and Chairs match]] (TLC) for the [[AAA World Mini-Estrellas Championship]], the first ever ''Mini-Estrellas'' TLC Match. In addition to the seven participants announced before the show the match also included [[La Parkita (AAA)|La Parkita]] and [[Mini Chessman]] making it a nine-''Mini-Estrellas'' match. Early in the match it became obvious that someone accidentally raised the title belt too high over the ring as the ''Minis'' were not able to reach it from the top of the ladders. At one point La Parkita [[powerbomb]]ed reigning champion Mini Abismo Negro out of the ring and through a table. Mini Histeria climbed the ladder and almost reached the championship belt, but Octagoncito stopped him and sent Mini Histeria through a table with a neckbreaker off the ladder, after which Mini Histeria was removed from the ring on a stretcher. In the end Octagoncito climbed the ladder to take the belt and became the new AAA World Mini-Estrellas Champion. After the match La Parkita was helped from the ring, favoring his shoulder. It was also reported that Mini Abismo Negro had to receive medical attention after the match.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;

The second match of the night was a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six-woman tag team match]] where the person pinned or submitted would have to serve as the slave of the winners for a month. ''La Legión Extranjera'' representatives Sexy Star, Rain and Jennifer Blade maintained the advantage in the night only through the biased refereeing of Hijo del Tirantes, who allowed ''La Legión'' to cheat repeatedly. After a while Mari Apache became fed up by Hijo del Tirantes' biased refereeing and landed a low blow on him. Blade took advantage of the distraction and hit Mari over the back of the head with a broomstick, earning the pinfall for her team. As a result of the loss Mari Apache will now be the servant of ''La Legión'' until July 6, 2010.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;

In the next match Silver King made his first official appearance under the name "Silver Cain", a way to get around Silver King not being allowed to wear his mask any more. During the introduction of the AAA World Tag Team Champions the announced mistakenly announced one of them Nosawa and then never introduced his partner. Throughout the match only Konnan, who was commentating the matches, knew the names of Atsushi Aoki and Go Shiozaki as well as who Beer Money, Inc. actually were. The champions were the first team eliminated when Joe Lider pinned Shiozaki following a [[Backbreaker#Double knee backbreaker|double knee backbreaker]]. In the second fall Konnan left his announcing position, threw James Storm a steel chair and caused a distraction, which allowed him to hit Joe Lider with it and pin him for the second elimination. In the end Silver Cain pinned James Storm following a [[brainbuster]] to make ''Los Maniacos'' the new AAA World Tag Team Champions. Following the match ''[[Capos (professional wrestling)#Los Junior Capos|Los Junior Capos]]'' ([[Máscara Año 2000 Jr.]] and [[Hijo de Cien Caras]]) from IWRG showed up and challenged the new tag team champions. This was the first time the IWRG vs. AAA rivalry was referenced on AAA television.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;

At this point the crowd was estimated to be about 85% capacity with people still entering, putting the attendance at around 17.000.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;

The fourth match, the ''Lucha de Apuesta'' for the hair of the referee, was surprisingly turned into a [[Steel Cage match]] without any build. The winning team would be the team where all three wrestlers first escaped the cage. Octagón was the first wrestler to escape the cage, quickly followed by Alex Koslov. Pimpinela Escarlata was almost out of the ring when he was stopped by Hernandez. Instead of fighting against Hernandez Escarlata surprised him with a big kiss, that distracted/disgusted Hernandez long enough for Escarlata to escape the cage. The {{convert|285|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Hernandez shocked the crowd by diving off the top of the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cage onto the prone Heavy Metal before climbing out of the cage. This left Chessman and Heavy Metal in the cage. At one point Chessman had an opportunity to leave the cage, but instead opted to leap off the top of the cage for a [[moonsault]], only for Heavy Metal to move at the last moment, sending Chessman crashing into the match. When Heavy Metal tried to climb out of the cage Hijo del Tirantes hit him with a chair to stop him from leaving the cage. Afterwards Chessman recovered enough to drag himself out of the ring, winning the match for his team. After the match El Pierro had all his hair shaved off.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;

===Semi-main events===
Cibernético and Abyss fought Vampiro and El Zorro in the next match, a hardcore match that quickly saw the interference of ''La Legión'' members Chessman, Christopher Daniels, Alex Koslov, Nosawa and Hernandez. After a while Cibernetico and Abyss were able to fight ''La Legión'' off. Near the end of the match Vampiro got into an argument with Konnan, resulting in Konnan tossing a handful of white powder into Vampiro's face. Blinded Vampiro was an easy target for Cibernético's ''Garra Cibernetica'' ("The Cybernetic Claw"; a [[chokeslam]]) for the pin fall. After the match La Legión attacked the two again, but were fought off, then beaten down by Cibernético, with assist from ''La Hermandad 187''.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;

Extreme Tiger defended the AAA Cruiserweight title against three challengers in the seventh match of the night. In one of the most dangerous moves of the nights Extreme Tiger leapt off the top rope executing a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#450° splash|450° splash]] to Nosawa, who was prone on the floor. Moments later Tiger eliminated Nosawa using a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving stomp|diving stomp]]. Later on a wrestler wearing an Extreme Tiger mask came to ringside, distracting the real Extreme Tiger long enough for Christopher Daniels to pin him and eliminate him. Following Extreme Tiger's elimination the imitator removed the Extreme Tiger mask, revealing himself to be [[Relampago (wrestler)|Relámpago]]. Evans won the match by pinning Daniels following a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Corkscrew|corkscrew]] 450° splash to earn his first ever AAA Championship.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;

===Main events===
The match for the AAA Mega Championship had originally been scheduled to go on last, but instead it became the second to last match, giving the L.A. Park vs. La Parka match the final spot on the show. The crowd was firmly behind Dr. Wagner Jr. in the match, chanting for the "Good Doctor" throughout most of the match. The match began as a clean, scientific match with Wagner and Electroshock displaying a variety of mat wrestling, exchanging holds and moves. The crowd began booing the match, after watching the buildup to the match they were not pleased with the clean, mat based wrestling even though Dr. Wagner Jr. was in control of most of the match. Dr. Wagner Jr. almost won the match when he used the ''Wagner Driver'' (a [[Professional wrestling throws#Michinoku Driver II|sitout scoop slam piledriver]]) on Electroshock, only to see the champion kick out at the very last moment. Electroshock later applied his ''Electrolock'' (a [[Professional wrestling holds#Abdominal stretch|kneeling abdominal stretch]] with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]]), the same move that had won him both the [[Rey de Reyes (2009)|2009 Rey de Reyes]] and the AAA Mega Championship. Dr. Wagner Jr. managed to hold on and escape the hold only to apply another ''Wagner Driver'' on Electroshock. Following the ''Wagner Driver'' Dr. Wagner Jr. was able to pin Electroshock and win the championship for a second time. Following the match Electroshock shook Dr. Wagner Jr.'s hand as a sign of respect and then left the ring. Moments later [[Ricky Banderas|El Mesías]], still recovering from shoulder surgery, came to the ring to present Dr. Wagner Jr. with the belt and shook his hand.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;

The final match of Triplemanía XVIII was the battle over the name La Parka. First out was L.A. Park, accompanied by Dorian Roldan who carried L.A. Park's trademark steel chair with him to the ring. La Parka was accompanied by AAA managing director Joaquin Roldan. Both wrestlers came out to the sounds of [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[Thriller (song)|Thriller]], although neither were in the mood to dance before the match. The crowd support was divided although more behind the ''rúdo'' L.A. Park than they were behind the ''técnico'' La Parka. Early in the match L.A. Park landed three hard chair shots to his opponent, knocking him out of the ring. While on the floor L.A. Park threw a table into the ring and then threw La Parka into the steel barrier outside the ring. L.A. Park then sprayed La Parka in the face with a [[fire extinguisher]] and threw him into the crowd. The two fought back and forth in the crowd, throwing all rules out of the window. During the fight both wrestlers tore at their opponent's masks, almost tearing them completely apart, they two also bled heavily midway through the match. When the two returned to the ring La Parka threw L.A. Park off the top with a [[Suplex#Superplex|superplex]] that sent L.A. Park crashing through the table. While the crowd was generally split 50/50 for most of the match the boos were overwhelming when La Parka tried to pin L.A. Park, making it clear what outcome most of the fans were hoping for. A few minutes later the referee was accidentally knocked out of the ring, giving L.A. Park the opportunity to use a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|tombstone piledriver]], a move that is illegal in Lucha Libre. Joaquin Roldan entered the ring, when L.A. Park attempted to use a steel chair on La Parka. When L.A. Park teased using the chair on Joaquin instead, Dorian entered the ring to protest, but was pushed down by Park, who then hit Joaquin with the chair, which caused Dorian to turn on him, hitting him with a steel chair three times.

Seconds later [[Halloween (wrestler)|Halloween]] and [[Damián 666]] from the [[Perros del Mal (promotion)|Perros del Mal]] wrestling promotion ran to the ring to chase Dorian Roldan away. Then they dragged L.A. Park on top of La Parka before ''rúdo'' referee Hijo del Tirantes counted to three to give L.A. Park the victory. After the bell rings the rest of Los Perros del Mal, (Perro Aguayo Jr., [[Super Crazy]], [[Hijo de L.A. Park]], [[X-Fly]], [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]], Damián 666's son, Ragde and Pesadilla.) came to the ring to celebrate with L.A. Park who had won the rights to the name "La Parka". After a couple of minutes a group of AAA wrestlers led by Octagón came to ringside and in combination with the arena security managed to remove Los Perros del Mal from the ring. Marisela Roldan and the AAA wrestlers gave tribute to AAA founder [[Antonio Peña]] with Marisela promising that they would beat Los Perros del Mal. La Parka was taken from the ring on a stretcher, not having moved since L.A. Park applied the piledriver.&lt;ref name=SLLive/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAALive/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grita&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gritamx.com/triplemania-xviii-resultados-l-a-p-a-r-k-arrasa-los-perros-se-rebelan-y-aaa-se-convierte-en-un-manicomio/ | title= TripleManía XVIII, resultados: LA Park arrasa, Los Perros se rebelan y AAA se convierte en una manicomio| author= Ramirez, Oscar |date= June 7, 2010 | accessdate= June 8, 2010 | publisher= Grita Radio| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Luchas2000&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.revistaluchas2000.com.mx/sac/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=803:la-park-gana-pero-anulan-el-resultado&amp;catid=2:aaa&amp;Itemid=12 | title= LA Park gana, pero anulan el resultado | author= Laura Fuentes and Armando Gutierrez  |date= June 6, 2010 | accessdate= June 8, 2010 | publisher= ''Luchas2000'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MedioTiempo&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/noticias/2010/06/06/una-gran-fiesta-se-vivio-en-triplemania-xviii | title= Una gran fiesta se vivió en Triplemanía XVIII | author= Ramirez, Oscar |date= June 6, 2010 | accessdate= June 8, 2010 | publisher= Mediotiempo.com | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show closed with a mini-concert by ''[[El Tri]]'', followed by Marisela Peña making the announcement that due to the interference from Los Perros del Mal the main event results had been thrown out and declared a no-contest.&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/06/06/la-park-vencio-a-la-parka-en-triplemania-18/ | title= LA Park venció a La Parka en Triplemanía 18, ¿pero será respetado el resultado? | author= Marquina, Alva | date= June 6, 2010 | accessdate= June 8, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, during the post-Triplemanía press conference Dorian Roldan announced that L.A. Park had indeed won the match and was now officially known as La Parka once again while AAA's La Parka would have to change his name.&lt;ref name=ParkWins&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/laparkganador.html | title= Este es La Parka | date= June 7, 2010 | accessdate= June 8, 2010 | publisher= [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The night after the show AAA held a press conference centered on Dorian Roldan apologizing to his mother Marisela Peña Roldan, making peace with her, turning ''técnico'' once more. The press conference also featured the unity of AAA with Konnan's ''La Legión Extranjera'' against a common enemy in the invading ''Los Perros del Mal''. While Konnan was reluctant to trust AAA after having feuded with them for the previous 4–5 years the invading Perros del Mal forced his hand.&lt;ref name=PostTMPress&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/konnanbuscaacercamiento.html | title= Qué pasó después de TripleManía XVIII | date= June 7, 2010 | accessdate= June 8, 2010 | publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10 AAA announced that it would respect Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission's decision to throw out the main event match between La Parka and L.A. Park and as a result both wrestlers would keep their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/06/11/aaa-acepta-la-decision-de-la-comision-de-lucha-libre-del-df-la-lucha-de-las-parkas-queda-anulada/ | title= AAA acepta la decisión de la comisión de Lucha Libre del DF: La lucha de las Parkas queda anulada | author= Ruiz Glez, Alex | date= June 11, 2010 | accessdate= June 17, 2010 | publisher=''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The event received mainly positive reviews from critics, although the main event received mixed reviews; on a one hand, praised by the match itself, like ''Grita Radio'' described how the main event was so emotional that fans were on their feet with their hearts in their throats and Laura Fuentes and Armando Gutierrez of ''Luchas 2000'' Magazine calling the main event as a "memorable battle".&lt;ref name=Grita/&gt;&lt;ref name=Luchas2000/&gt; but heavily panned by the match's ending and the booking treatment on it.

An article in the Mexican newspaper Récord was very critical of the event, stating that it had started late, the fights were flat and that there was little public interest. The claims were refused by Super Luchas magazine publisher Jorge Ocampo, stating that the author of the event was anti-AAA since the event had started exactly on time, the time printed on the tickets and that the crowd was more into the event than they had been for a long time. Ocampo also cited other factual errors in the article, stating that the author knew very little about wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/06/07/ignorantes-comentarios-contra-triplemania-publicados-por-el-periodico-record/ | title=Ignorantes comentarios contra Triplemanía publicados por el periódico RECORD | date= June 7, 2010 | accessdate= June 8, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 555''', adopted on 12 October 1984, after recalling previous [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions]] on the topic, as well as studying the report by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] on the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) approved in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 426|426]] (1978), the Council decided to extend the mandate of UNIFIL for a further six months until 19 April 1985.

The Council then reemphasised the mandate of the Force and requested the Secretary-General to report back on the progress made with regard to the implementation of resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|425]] (1978) and 426 (1978).

Resolution 555 was adopted by 13 votes to none, with two [[abstention]]s from the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and [[Soviet Union]].

'''Villa Grove''' is a city in [[Douglas County, Illinois|Douglas County]], [[Illinois]], along the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]].  The population was 2,537 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Villa Grove was chartered in 1903 after the area was recognized by the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]] (C&amp;EI) as being exactly halfway between Chicago and St. Louis. This made it a desirable location for a steam locomotive repair facility.&lt;ref name="VillaGrove.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.villagrove.org/1_5_History.html |title= Villa Grove History page |website= villagrove.org |accessdate= October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Villa Grove later became the site of a C&amp;EI division headquarters and [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HeoXblcqcicC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Mattoon and Charleston Area Railroads |first= Craig |last= Sanders |publisher= Arcadia Publishing |year= 2008 |ISBN= 9780738552286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Villa Grove was known for its Pancake Festivals in the 1940s, which drew crowds over 10,000. In the 1970s, the festival was replaced by the Ag Days celebration.&lt;ref name="VillaGrove.org" /&gt; 

In 1923, Villa Grove's high school basketball team, the Blue Devils, defeated Rockford 32-29 to win the [[Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship]].&lt;ref name="1908-49 results"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ihsa.org/activity/bkb/records/xbyyr1.htm |title= Boys Basketball Tournament Scores (1908-49) |website= ihsa.org |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080331132814/http://www.ihsa.org/activity/bkb/records/xbyyr1.htm |archivedate= March 31, 2008 |accessdate= June 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villa Grove's historic rail depot was demolished in the predawn hours of Friday, October 29, 1976 despite a city ordinance that was intended to protect the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Historic Railroad Depot Torn down; Town is Unhappy |location= Mt Vernon, IL |newspaper= Register News |date= November 1, 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city later received reparation for the destruction.&lt;ref name="VillaGrove.org" /&gt;

On August 10, 2011, a 100-year-old vacant building on main street in Villa Grove was destroyed by a fire set by a two boys age 14 and 9. At least 15 fire departments responded to the blaze containing it to the original structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2011-08-10/fire-downtown-villa-grove.html |title= Fire in downtown Villa Grove |newspaper= News Gazette |location= Champaign, IL |date= August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys were ordered to pay $126,076 in restitution. The 14-year-old received 3 years probation, 30 days in jail and 100 hours of community service. The 9 year old received 2 years probation and 50 hours community service. State law prohibited jail time for the 9 year old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2011-12-14/restitution-set-two-boys-who-admitted-setting-villa-grove-building-fire.html |title= Restitution set for two boys who admitted setting Villa Grove building on fire |date= December 14, 2011 |first= Tim |last= Mitchell |newspaper= News Gazette |location= Champaign, IL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent businesses were temporarily displaced due to damage caused by smoke and heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2011-08-26/salon-owner-packs-business-van-after-fire-villa-grove.html |title= Salon owner packs business into van after fire in Villa Grove |date= August 26, 2011 |first=  Amy |last= Rose |newspaper= News Gazette |location= Champaign, IL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flooding ===
Villa Grove's location at the confluence of Jordan Slough and the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]] has resulted in flooding during the city's history. In January 1950, Villa Grove was isolated by flooding, more than 1/3 of the city was underwater and the Red Cross reported 100 families were homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Southern Illinois River Areas Brace for Flood; Wabash Rises at Mt. Carmel |location= Harrisburg, IL |newspaper= Daily Register |date= January 5, 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= National Guard Battles Floods; At least 4,000 people in area are homeless |location= Jacksonville, IL |newspaper= Daily Journal |date= January 8, 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Army to Check Flood Problem at Villa Grove |location= Mattoon, IL |newspaper= Daily Journal Gazette |date= January 21, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another flood in April 1994 left over half of the city's 1,000 homes flooded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Flood weary residents run for high ground |location= Lawrence, KS |newspaper= Journal World |date= April 14, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city's water supply was tainted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Floodwaters Return; Midwesterners Victimized Again |location= Harrisonburg, IL |newspaper= Daily News Record |date= April 15, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, portions of main street were 6 feet underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Heavy April Showers Bring Flooding |newspaper= Daily Herald |location= Arlington Heights, IL |date= April 13, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the severe flooding in 1994 and additional flooding in the following years, a program was implemented to purchase and demolish homes voluntarily from owners in the [[flood plain]]. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) and the [[Illinois Emergency Management Agency]] (IEMA) used the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to purchase 17 homes in two phases from 1995 to 2000. IEMA noted that when another flood occurred in June 2008, the 17 properties purchased would have again been flooded had they not been purchased and demolished. Additional plans were also made to purchase more flood prone properties after the 2008 flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.llis.dhs.gov/content/when-enough-really-enough |title= When Enough is Really Enough |website= llis.dhs.gov |accessdate= November 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After flooding in April 2013, FEMA again provided funding to purchase and demolish eight more homes and one public building in Villa Grove under HMGP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2014/02/13/fema-awards-351066-grant-villa-grove-hazard-mitigation-funds-will-be-used-0 |title= FEMA Awards $351,066 Grant to Villa Grove: Hazard mitigation funds will be used to acquire and demolish nine flood prone structures  |website= FEMA |date= February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
