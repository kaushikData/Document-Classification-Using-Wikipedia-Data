      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19580">'''Acoustical engineering''' (also known as '''acoustic engineering''') is the branch of [[engineering]] dealing with [[sound]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]. It is the application of [[acoustics]], the science of sound and vibration, in technology. Acoustical engineers are typically concerned with the design, analysis and control of sound.

One goal of acoustical engineering can be the reduction of unwanted noise, which is referred to as [[noise control]]. Unwanted noise can have significant impacts on animal and human health and well-being, reduce attainment by pupils in schools, and cause hearing loss.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=World Health Organisation|title=Burden of disease from  environmental noise|year=2011|publisher=WHO|isbn=978 92 890 0229 5|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/136466/e94888.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noise control]] principles are implemented into technology and design in a variety of ways, including control by redesigning sound sources, the design of noise barriers, sound absorbers, suppressors, and buffer zones, and the use of hearing protection ([[earmuffs]] or [[earplug]]s).

[[Image:Hamer Hall equipment detail.jpg|right|thumb|The transparent [[sound baffle|baffle]]s inside this auditorium were installed to optimise sound projection and reproduction, key factors in acoustical engineering.]]

But acoustical engineering is not just about [[noise control]]; it also covers positive uses of sound, from the use of [[ultrasound]] in medicine to the programming of digital sound [[synthesizer]]s, and from designing a concert hall to enhance the sound of an orchestra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barron|first=Michael|title=Auditorium Acoustics and Architectural Design|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0419245100}}&lt;/ref&gt; to specifying a railway station's sound system so announcements are [[Intelligibility (communication)|intelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahnert|first=Wolfgang|title=Sound Reinforcement Engineering: Fundamentals and Practice|year=2000|isbn=978-0415238700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic engineer (professional) {{anchor|acoustic engineer}} ==

Acoustic engineers usually possess a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher qualification in [[acoustics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Education in acoustics |title= MSc Engineering Acoustics, DTU |url=http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/msc/Programmes/engineering_acoustics|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]] or another [[engineering]] discipline. Practicing as an acoustic engineer usually requires a [[bachelor's degree]] with significant scientific and mathematical content. Acoustic engineers might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in particular fields, such as [[architectural acoustics]], [[environmental noise]] or [[vibration control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles: Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other industries, acoustic engineers might: design [[automobile]] sound systems; investigate human response to sounds, such as urban soundscapes and domestic appliances; develop audio signal processing software for mixing desks, and design loudspeakers and microphones for mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Graduate Jobs in Acoustics|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=roles|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=Acoustics and You|url=http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|accessdate=13 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225726/http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|archive-date=2017-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acousticians are also involved in researching and understanding sound scientifically. Some positions, such as [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] require a [[Doctor of Philosophy]].

In most countries, a degree in [[acoustics]] can represent the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program may be certified by a [[professional body]]. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated the title of [[Chartered Engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth]] countries).

==Subdisciplines==

The listed subdisciplines are loosely based on the PACS ([[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]]) coding used by the [[Acoustical Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=PACS 2010 Regular Edition—Acoustics Appendix|url=http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514111126/http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|archive-date=2013-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aeroacoustics===
{{main|Aeroacoustics}}

[[Aeroacoustics]] is concerned with how noise is generated by the movement of air, for instance via turbulence, and how sound propagates through the fluid air. Aeroacoustics plays an important role in understanding how noise is generated by [[aircraft]] and [[wind turbine]]s, as well as exploring how [[wind instrument|wind]] [[musical instrument]]s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=da Silva|first=Andrey Ricardo|title=Aeroacoustics of Wind Instruments: Investigations and Numerical Methods|year=2009|publisher=VDM Verlag|isbn=978-3639210644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio signal processing===
{{main|Audio signal processing}}

[[Audio signal processing]] is the electronic manipulation of audio signals using [[Analog signal processing|analog]] and [[digital signal processing]].

[[Audio signal processing]] is done for a variety of reasons such as:
* to enhance a sound, for instance by applying an audio effect such as [[reverberation]];
* to remove unwanted noises from a signal, for instance [[echo cancellation]] on [[Skype]];
* to compress an audio signal to allow efficient transmission, e.g. perceptual coding in [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], and 
* to understand the content of the signal, e.g. [[music information retrieval]] to allow the identification of music tracks via [[Shazam (service)]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pohlmann|first=Ken|title=Principles of Digital Audio, Sixth Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071663472|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audio engineers]] develop and use [[audio signal processing]] algorithms.

===Architectural acoustics===
{{main|Architectural acoustics}}
[[Image:Disney Concert Hall by Carol Highsmith.jpg|right|thumb|[[Walt Disney Concert Hall|Disney's Concert Hall]] was meticulously designed for superior acoustical qualities.]]
[[File:Heichal Hatarbut1.jpg|thumb|Ceiling of [[Culture Palace (Tel Aviv)]] concert hall is covered with [[perforated metal]] panels]]
Architectural acoustics (also known as '''building acoustics''') is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morfey|first=Christopher|title=Dictionary of Acoustics|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a theatre, restaurant or railway station, enhancing the quality of music in a concert hall or recording studio, or suppressing noise to make offices and homes more productive and pleasant places to work and live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Templeton|first=Duncan|title=Acoustics in the Built Environment: Advice for the Design Team|year=1993|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn=978-0750605380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioacoustics===
{{main|Bioacoustics}}

Bioacoustics usually concerns the scientific study of sound production and hearing in animals. It can include: acoustic communication and associated animal behaviour and evolution of species; how sound is produced by animals; the auditory mechanisms and neurophysiology of animals; the use of sound to monitor animal populations, and the effect of man-made noise on animals.&lt;ref name= "bioacoustics"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ASA|url=http://www.animalbioacoustics.org/bioacoustics.html |title= Acoustical Society of America Animal Bioacoustics Technical Committee.

{{See also|Audio engineering|Sound reinforcement system}}
This branch of acoustic engineering deals with the design of headphones, microphones, loudspeakers, sound systems, sound reproduction and recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=Acoustics and You (A Career in Acoustics?)|url=http://asaweb.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|accessdate=21 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904010934/http://asaweb.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|archive-date=2015-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a rapid increase in the use of portable electronic devices which can reproduce sound and rely on electroacoustic engineering, e.g. [[mobile phone]]s, [[portable media player]]s, and [[tablet computer]]s.

===Environmental noise===
{{main|Environmental noise}}
{{see also|Noise pollution|Noise control}}
[[Image:Woodstock 2007.jpg|right|thumb|At outdoor concerts like [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock]], acoustic analysis is critical to creating the best experience for the audience and the performers.]]
Environmental acoustics is concerned with the control of noise and vibrations caused by traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment, recreational activities and anything else that might be considered a nuisance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Acoustical engineers concerned with environmental acoustics face the challenge of measuring or predicting likely noise levels, determining an acceptable level for that noise, and determining how the noise can be controlled. Environmental acoustics work is usually done by acoustic consultants or those working in [[environmental health]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Recent research work has put a strong emphasis on [[soundscape]]s, the positive use of sound (e.g. fountains, bird song), and the preservation of [[tranquility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kang|first=Jian|title=Urban Sound Environment|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0415358576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical acoustics===
{{main|Musical acoustics}}

Musical acoustics is concerned with researching and describing the physics of music and its perception – how [[sound]]s employed as [[music]] work. This includes: the function and design of [[musical instrument]]s including electronic [[synthesizers]]; the human voice (the [[physics]] and [[neurophysiology]] of [[singing]]); computer analysis of music and composition; the clinical use of music in music therapy, and the perception and cognition of [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Technical Committee on Musical Acoustics (TCMU) of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA)|url=http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/|title=ASA TCMU Home Page|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010613120620/http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/|archive-date=2001-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise control===
{{main|Noise control}}

Noise control is a set of strategies to reduce [[noise pollution]] by reducing noise at its source, by inhibiting sound propagation using [[noise barrier]]s or similar, or by the use of ear protection ([[earmuffs]] or [[earplug]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bies|first=David|title=Engineering Noise Control: Theory and Practice|year=2009|isbn=978-0415487078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control at the source is the most cost-effective way of providing noise control. Noise control engineering applied to cars and trucks is known as [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH). Other techniques to reduce product noise include [[vibration isolation]], application of acoustic absorbent and acoustic enclosures. Acoustical engineering can go beyond noise control to look at what is the best sound for a product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Making products sound better|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/res/cox/sound_quality/}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, manipulating the sound of door closures on [[automobile]]s.

===Psychoacoustics===
{{main|Psychoacoustics}}

[[Psychoacoustics]] tries to explain how humans respond to what they hear, whether that is an annoying noise or beautiful music. In many branches of acoustic engineering, a human listener is a final arbitrator as to whether a design is successful, for instance, whether [[sound localisation]] works in a [[surround sound]] system. "Psychoacoustics seeks to reconcile acoustical stimuli and all the scientific, objective, and physical properties that surround them, with the physiological and psychological responses evoked by them."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Speech===
{{main|Speech}}

Speech is a major area of study for acoustical engineering, including the production, processing and perception of speech. This can include [[physics]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], [[audio signal processing]] and [[linguistics]]. [[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] are two important aspects of the machine processing of speech. Ensuring [[speech transmission index|speech is transmitted intelligibly]], efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through telephone systems are other important areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Speech Communication Technical Committee|title=Speech Communication|url=http://acosoc.org/TechComm/SCTC/|publisher=Acoustical Society of America|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasonics===
{{main|Ultrasound}}
[[File:CRL Crown rump lengh 12 weeks ecografia Dr. Wolfgang Moroder.jpg|thumb|right|Ultrasound image of a fetus in the womb, viewed at 12 weeks of pregnancy (bidimensional-scan)]]Ultrasonics deals with sound waves in solids, liquids and gases at frequencies too high to be heard by the average person. Specialists areas include medical ultrasonics (including [[medical ultrasonography]]), [[sonochemistry]], [[nondestructive testing]], material characterisation and [[underwater acoustics]] ([[sonar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ensminger|first=Dale|title=Ultrasonics: Fundamentals, Technologies, and Applications|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underwater acoustics===
{{main|Underwater acoustics}}

Underwater acoustics is the scientific study of sound in water. It is concerned with both natural and man-made sound and its generation underwater; how it propagates, and the perception of the sound by animals. Applications include [[sonar]] to locate submerged objects such as [[submarines]], underwater communication by animals, observation of sea temperatures for climate change monitoring, and marine biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ASA Underwater Acoustics Technical Committee |title=Underwater Acoustics |url=http://www.apl.washington.edu/projects/ASA-UATC/index.php |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730104616/http://www.apl.washington.edu/projects/ASA-UATC/index.php |archivedate=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vibration and dynamics===
{{main|Vibration}}

Acoustic engineers working on [[vibration]] study the motions and interactions of mechanical systems with their environments, including measurement, analysis and control. This might include: [[ground vibrations]] from railways and construction; [[vibration isolation]] to reduce noise getting into recording studios; studying the effects of vibration on humans ([[vibration white finger]]); [[vibration control]] to protect a bridge from [[earthquakes]], or modelling the propagation of structure-borne sound through buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Structural Acoustics &amp; Vibration Technical Committee |title=Structural Acoustics &amp; Vibration Technical Committee |url=http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~bbard/savtc.html |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103180745/http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~bbard/savtc.html |archivedate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental science==

Although the way in which sound interacts with its surroundings is often extremely complex, there are a few ideal sound wave behaviours that are fundamental to understanding acoustical design.  Complex sound wave behaviors include [[Absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], [[reverberation]], [[diffraction]], and [[refraction]]. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface. Just as light waves reflect off of surfaces, sound waves also reflect off of surfaces, and every reflection results in a loss of energy.  Absorption refers both to the sound that transmits through and the energy that is dissipated by a material.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 2002, ch. 7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reverberation is the persistence of sound that is caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces.  In addition to reflecting off of surfaces, sound waves also bend around surfaces in the path of the waves.  This bending is known as diffraction.  Refraction is another kind of sound wave bending.  This type of bending, however, is caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing and not the presence of obstacles in the path of a sound wave.  Temperature gradients, for example, cause bending in sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hemond, 1983, pp. 24–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with complex mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">The '''archaeology of religion and ritual''' is a growing field of study within [[archaeology]] that applies ideas from [[religious studies]],  theory and methods, anthropological theory, and archaeological and [[historical method]]s and theories to the study of [[religion]] and [[ritual]] in past human societies from a material perspective.

==Definitions==

Religion may be defined as “a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs,” &lt;ref name=dict&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Religion) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ritual is “an established or prescribed procedure for a religious or other rite.” &lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ritual) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists may study the material traces of religious ritual (for example, the ritual destruction of ceramic vessels during the [[Aztec]] [[New Fire ceremony]] &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ‘’Ancient Mesoamerica, ‘’ Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;) or the material correlates of religion as a totalized worldview (for example, Elizabeth Kyder-Reid’s study of the Southern [[Redemptorist]]s’ reconfiguration of landscape and artifacts to reflect their ideals of community and poverty in material form &lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ‘’Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.’’  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

As in [[religious studies]] and the [[Anthropology of religion]], many archaeologists differentiate between “[[world religions]],” and “traditional” or “[[indigenous religions]].”  “World religions” are defined by Bowie (2000: 26) &lt;ref name="Bowie"&gt;Bowie, F.  (2000) The Anthropology of religion.  Oxford: Blackwell.  Quoted in Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; as:

# Based on written scriptures.
# Has a notion of salvation, often from outside.
# Universal, or potentially universal.
# Can subsume or supplant primal religions.
# Often forms a separate sphere of activity.

while indigenous religions are defined as:

# Oral, or if literate, lacks written/formal scriptures and creeds.
# ‘This worldly’.
#  Confined to a single language or ethnic group.
#  Form basis from which world religions have developed.
#  Religious and social life are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Bowie"/&gt;

However, Timothy Insoll (2004: 9) &lt;ref&gt;Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that these categorizations arise from a much-critiqued [[neo-evolutionism|neo-evolutionary]] perspective.  Strict dichotomies of religious forms may also contribute to skewing research toward state religions, leaving [[household]] religious practice, and the relationships between these, under-investigated (a trend noted by Elson and Smith, 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  Ancient Mesoamerica, Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;).  Insoll (2004:9) argues that archaeologists may contribute to blurring the boundaries of world and indigenous religions.

The archaeology of religion also incorporates related anthropological or religious concepts and terms such as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[tradition]], [[religious symbolism|symbolism]], and the [[sacred]].

==Theory==

===Anthropology of religion===

Theory within the archaeology of religion borrows heavily from the [[Anthropology of religion]], which encompasses a broad range of perspectives.  These include: [[Émile Durkheim]]’s functionalist understanding of religion as serving to separate the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and the profane]];&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile. (1998)  ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.’’  Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]]’s idea of religion as “[[the opium of the people|the opium of the masses]]” or a [[false consciousness]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1992) ‘’Early Writings.’’  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifford Geertz]]’s loose definition of religion as a “system of symbols” that orders the world,&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford (1973:90) ''The Interpretation of Cultures.’’  New York: Basic Books.  P. 90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Turner]]’s work on ritual, including [[rites of passage]] and [[liminality]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Victor (1995) ''The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure.’’  Aldine Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]]’s religious types &lt;ref&gt;Heydebrand, Wolf (1994) ‘’Sociological Writings: Max Weber.’’  Continuum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and thoughts on the relationship between economics and religion;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (2002) ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: and Other Writings.''  Trans. Peter Baehr.  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]’ structuralist understandings of [[totemism]] and [[myth]];&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Paul-François (2008) ‘’Lévi-Strauss on Religion: The Structuring Mind (Key Thinkers in the Study of Religion’’).  Equionox Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Douglas]]’ idea of the division of “[[Purity and Danger|purity and danger]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary (2003 [1966]) ''Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concept of Pullution and Taboo.''  Routledge Classics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion, identity, and practice===

Archaeological studies of religion increasingly recognize religion as an organizing principle in social life, rather than as a separate sphere of activity.  They include religion as an axis of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that structures social life and personal experience.  Therefore, entire artifact assemblages (rather than specifically “religious” artifacts, such as rosary beads) can be interpreted according to the ways that they simultaneously create, display, and constrain notions of self according to religious ideas.  For example, John Chenoweth (2009) &lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"&gt;Chenoweth, John M.  (2009)  Social identity, material culture, and the archaeology of religion: Quaker practices in context.  ''Journal of Social Archaeology'' 9: 319&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted ceramic assemblages and burials according to [[Quaker]] ideals of plainness and modesty.

Because social identity is both imposed and negotiated through social practice, including material practice, archaeologies of religion increasingly incorporate practice-based theory.  Building upon [[Anthony Giddens]]’ idea of structuration &lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1986) ‘’The Constitution of Society: Outline of A Theory of Structuration.’’  Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s ideas of both practice &lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1977) ‘’Outline of a Theory of Practice.’’  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural capital,&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1987) ‘’Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.’’  Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; theories of material practice posit that people use material goods to negotiate their places within social structures.  Examples of the archaeological interpretation of religion and ritual as part of social negotiation, transformation or reinforcement include Chenoweth’s work on [[Quaker]] religious practice,&lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"/&gt; Kyder-Reid’s work on the Southern Redemptorists,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.''  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Timothy Pauketat’s work on feasting in [[Cahokia]] (Pauketat et al., 2002 &lt;ref&gt;Pauketat, Timothy, Lucretia S. Kelly, Gayle J. Fritz, Neal H. Lopinot, Scott Elias, and Eve Hargrave (2002) The Residues of Feasting and Public Ritual at Cahokia.  ''American Antiquity,'' Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 257–279&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Religion, power, and inequality===

Because religion and political power are often intertwined&lt;ref&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics].  ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582–601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1991) ''Religious Regimes and State Formation: Perspectives From European Ethnography.''  State University of New York Press (August 13, 1991) {{ISBN|978-0791406519}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in early states, the archaeology of religion may also engage theories of [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]].   John Janusek’s study of [[Tiwanaku]] religion, for example, explored the ways that religion served to integrate societies within the Andean state.&lt;ref&gt;Janusek, John Wayne (2006) The changing ‘nature’ of Tiwanaku religion and the rise of the Andean state.  ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 38(3): 469–492&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Colonialism|Colonial]] regimes frequently justified expansion through a commitment to religious conversion; archaeologies of coloniality may therefore intersect with the archaeology of religion.  James Delle’s 2001 article on [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] and landscape in [[Jamaica]] &lt;ref&gt;Delle, James (2001) Race, Missionaries, and the Struggle to Free Jamaica.  In ''Race and the Archaeology of Identity.''  Charles E. Orser, Jr., ed.  Pp. 177–195.  Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Voss’ work on missions, [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[empire]] &lt;ref&gt;Voss, Barbara (2008) Domesticating Imperialism: Sexual Politics and the Archaeology of Empire.  ''American Anthropologist'' 110(2): 191–203&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate how religion has intersected with colonial regimes.

===Historical method and theory===

Historical archaeologists have made major contributions to the understanding of the religion and ritual of peoples who have remained underrepresented (or misrepresented) in the historical record, such as colonized peoples, indigenous peoples, and enslaved peoples.  Mandatory religious conversion was common in many colonial situations (e.g. the Spanish colonization of the Americas), which led to syncretic religious practice, rejection or resistance to new religions, covert practice of indigenous religions, and/or misunderstandings and misinterpretations of both indigenous and colonizer religions (Hanks 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William F. (2010).  ''Converting Words: Maya in the Age of the Cross''.  Berkeley: University of California Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Klor de Alva 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Klor de Alva, J. Jorge (1982).  Spiritual Conflict and Accommodation in New Spain: Toward a Typology of Aztec Responses to Christianity.  In George A. Collier, Renato Rosaldo, and John D. Wirth (eds), ''The Inca and Aztec States, 1400–1800: Anthropology and History.''  New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Wernke 2007&lt;ref name="Wernke, Steven 2007"&gt;Wernke, Steven (2007)  Analogy or Erasure?  Dialectics of Religious Transformation in the Early Doctrinas of the Colca Valley, Peru.  ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'', Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;).

This research combines archaeological and anthropological method and theory with historical method and theory.  In addition to recovering, recording, and analyzing material culture, historical archaeologists use archives, oral histories, ethnohistorical accounts.  Researchers read texts critically, emphasizing the historical context of the documents (especially regarding underrepresented peoples whose voices may be distorted or missing) in order to better understand religious practices that may have been discouraged or even severely punished.  Combined archaeological, historical, and anthropological data sets may contradict each other, or the material record may illuminate the details of covert or syncretic religious practice, as well as resistance to dominant religious forms. For example, our understanding of the religious practice of enslaved peoples in the United States (e.g. Leone and Frye 2001,&lt;ref name="Leone, Mark P 2001"&gt;Leone, Mark P. and Gladys Marie Frye (2001) A Coherent Religion among African Slaves.  In ''Race and the Archaeology of Identity'', ed. By C. Orser.  University of Utah Press&lt;/ref&gt; Fennell 2007 &lt;ref name="Fennell, Christopher 2007"&gt;Fennell, Christopher (2007) ''Crossroads and Cosmologies: Diasporas and Ethnogenesis in the New World''.  University of Florida Press,&lt;/ref&gt;) has increased dramatically thanks to research in historical archaeology.

== Material correlates==

Because archaeology studies human history through objects, buildings, bodies, and spaces, archaeologists must engage theories that connect anthropological and sociological theories of religion to [[material culture]] and landscapes. Theories of materiality &lt;ref&gt;Meskell, Lynn (2005) ''Archaeologies of Materiality.''  Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and landscape &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Matthew (2006) ''Ideas of Landscape.'' Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; serve to connect human activities, experiences, and behaviors to social practices, including religion.  Theories of [[:wikt:embody|embodiment]] &lt;ref&gt;Hammelkis, Yannis, Mark Pluciennik, and Sarah Tarlow (eds) (2001) ''Thinking Through the Body: Archaeologies of Corporeality.''  Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; also serve to interpret human remains as they relate to religion and ritual.

The archaeology of religion makes use of the same material evidence as other branches of archaeology, but certain artifact classes are particularly emphasized in studying religion and ritual in the past:

*'''Human remains and [[burial]] assemblages''' can offer many clues to religious and ritual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Christopher (1995) Mortuary Practices: Their Social, Philosophical-Religious, Circumstantial, and Physical Determinants.  ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'', Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 105–200&lt;/ref&gt;  Human remains themselves are used in all branches of archaeology for information on sex, age, occupation, and disease.  Methods of interment (including burial position, cremation, burial location, primary and secondary burials, etc.) contribute to understanding changing religious practice, as well as social difference within groups (e.g. Lohmann 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, Roger Ivar (2005) The Afterlife of Asabano Corpses: Relationships with the Deceased in Papua New Guinea.  ''Ethnology,'' Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 189–206&lt;/ref&gt;).  Total burial contexts, i.e., the setting, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[ecofacts]], and human remains themselves, may provide evidence of religious beliefs about [[death]] and the afterworld.
*'''Religious buildings''', such as [[temple]] complexes, [[kivas]], and missions, are often used to examine communal religious and ritual activity (e.g. Barnes 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Gina L. (1995) An Introduction to Buddhist Archaeology.  ‘’World Archaeology,’’ Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 165–182&lt;/ref&gt; Graham 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Elizabeth (1998) Mission Archaeology.  ‘’Annual Review of Anthropology’’, Vol. 27, pp. 25–62&lt;/ref&gt; Reid ''et al.'' 1997 &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Andrew, Paul Lane, Alinah Segobye, Lowe Borjeson, Nonofo Mathibidi, and Princess Sekgarametso (1997) Tswana Architecture and Responses to Colonialism.  ''World Archaeology,'' Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 370–392&lt;/ref&gt; ).  Part of [[archaeoastronomy]] is the investigation of how buildings are aligned to astral bodies and events, such as solstices, which often coincide with religious or ritual activities.  Archaeological examinations of religious buildings can reveal unequal access to religious knowledge and ritual.  Religious buildings frequently contain religious iconography that provides insight into the symbolic dimensions of religious life.
*Within landscape archaeology, '''sacred [[landscapes]]''' are an increasingly important focus of study (e.g. Clendinnen 1980 &lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest.  ''Comparative Studies in Society and History,'' Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393
&lt;/ref&gt;). Landscapes are imbued with sacred meaning throughout the world; [[aboriginal Australian]] [[songlines]], and the related belief that mythical events are marked on the landscape, are one example.  Human modifications to landscapes, such as Kyder-Reid’s study of the Redemtorists’ modifications of their estate to emphasize communality,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. '' Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; may point to the enactment of religious views.

*'''Religious iconography, [[symbols]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Robb, John E. (1998) The Archaeology of Symbols.  ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Vol. 27, pp. 329–346&lt;/ref&gt; '''ethnographic texts and ethnographic analogy''' are important tools that archaeologists use to compare with the material record to examine religions in the past (e.g. Clendinnen 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest. ‘’ Comparative Studies in Society and History,’’ Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393&lt;/ref&gt; Elson and Smith 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ''Ancient Mesoamerica,'' Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;). Though texts are not direct “windows to the past,” particularly for societies with few or no written records, they are valuable lines of evidence that may be contradicted or supported by the material record.
*'''Common artifact classes''' such as [[ceramic art|ceramics]] have been increasingly reinterpreted within a religious framework. According to the idea of religion as a form of social practice and a total worldview, any artifact may potentially be used to embody religious ideas and ideals in material form.  Patterns of artifact and [[ecofact]] use within ritual contexts may expose preferences or sacred meanings of certain materials; the ritual use of [[pine]] among the ancient Maya is one example (Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Morehart, Christopher T., David L. Lentz, and Keith M. Prufer (2005)  Wood of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Pine (PINUS SPP.) by the Ancient Lowland Maya.  ''Latin American Antiquity'’, 16(3), pp. 255–274&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Modern religious use of archaeological sites===
Contemporary religious groups often claim archaeological sites as part of their heritage, and make use of archaeological sites and artifacts in their religious practice (e.g. Wallis 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Robert J. and Jenny Blain (2003) Sites, Sacredness, and Stories: Interactions of Archaeology and Contemporary Paganism.  ‘’Folklore’’, Vol. 114, No. 3, pp. 307–321&lt;/ref&gt;).  These practices and religious interpretations of sites may clash with archaeological interpretations, leading to disputes about heritage, preservation, use of sites, and the “ownership” of history (Bender 1999 &lt;ref&gt;Bender, Barbara (1999) ‘’Stonehenge: Making Space’’.  Berg Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Biblical archaeology===
Biblical archaeology is a field of archaeology that seeks to correlate events in the Bible with concrete archaeological sites and artifacts (Meyers 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Eric M. (1984) The Bible and Archaeology.  ‘’The Biblical Archaeologist,’’ Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 36–40&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson 1916&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G.H. (1916) The Value of Biblical Archaeology.  ‘’The Biblical World,’’ Vol. 47, No. 6, pp. 381–387&lt;/ref&gt;).

The '''Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study''' (or '''CHEERS''') was a study conducted by the United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] designed to examine how children may be exposed to [[pesticide]]s and other chemicals used in U.S. households, such as [[phthalate]]s, [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and [[Fluorocarbon|perfluorinated compound]]s ([[PFOS]], [[PFOA]], [[PFNA]], and others).&lt;ref&gt;Tulve, N. S. AND R. C. Fortmann. LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF YOUNG CHILDREN'S EXPOSURES IN THEIR HOMES TO SELECTED PESTICIDES, PHTHALATES, BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS, AND PERFLUORINATED CHEMICALS (A CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE RESEARCH STUDY - CHEERS). Presented at American Chemistry Council Peer Advisory Committee Meeting, Arlington, VA, October 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-year study began in the summer of 2004 and was conducted in [[Duval County, Florida]], a region with high concentration of pesticides.

On April 8, 2005, [[Stephen L. Johnson]] cancelled the study after the program was criticized. Johnson himself was heavily criticized for his support in the use of human test subjects during his tenure as EPA's Assistant Administrator for Toxic Substances.

== Mechanics of the study ==
The study was due to be completed in two years, researchers would follow the progress of 60 young children whose parents sprayed pesticides frequently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethical Issues in Clinical Research: A Practical Guide|last=Lo|first=Bernard|publisher=Wolter Kluwer|year=2010|isbn=9780781788175|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would collect data every six months taken from biological samples such as blood and urine. Parents were also required to document specific information such as food and liquid intake. They must also record their children's activities on video. To qualify, a family has to have a confirmed history of residential pesticide use, a child under the age of 13 months and must agree to continue using pesticides inside the residential abode.

Participating families were promised monetary compensation of up to $970, study T-shirt, framed Certificate of Appreciation, study bib for the baby, calendar, study newsletter, and a [[camcorder]].

==Controversies==
EPA recruiting information for CHEERS claimed that participation in the study presented "no risk" to the subjects or their families. Critics, however, contended that the state of knowledge about pesticide exposure risks to infants and children while imprecise, suggests that residential pesticide exposure poses developmental risks to infants and children. This meant that CHEERS would have paid families to expose their children to pesticides for two years. EPA denied this, stressing that because CHEERS would have only examined families who used pesticides prior to the study, CHEERS would not have increased the subject families' exposure to pesticides. The argument is based on the fact that the study had an observational, rather than experimental design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Research with Human Subjects: Protecting People, Advancing Science, Promoting Trust|last=Resnik|first=David|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319687551|location=Berlin|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was fear, however, that the study could induce parents to intentionally expose their children to pesticides to be able to qualify in the high-use group of the study.

The study was also criticized for using disproportionately black, lower-income families as subjects. EPA's claim was that Duval County was chosen because they knew that many families in the area were using large amounts of pesticides to control roaches and pests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The EPA also received $2 million of the proposed 9 million budget for the CHEERS study from the [[American Chemistry Council]], a [[lobbying]] group representing 135 chemical companies&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wrong Complexion for Protection: How the Government Response to Disaster Endangers African American Communities|last=Bullard|first=Robert|last2=Wright|first2=Beverly|publisher=New York University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780814799932|location=New York|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in exchange for measuring levels of common household chemicals such as flame, retardants, and ingredients in plastic products along with pesticides.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the results could directly affect rules for chemical manufacturers, this was interpreted by organizations like the [[Environmental Working Group]] as a [[conflict of interest]]. There are also those who criticized the need to accept money from donors when the agency's budget for research was $572 million.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The CHEERS project was terminated in 2005 after it became a political matter.

[[Image:Cat claw closeup.jpg|thumb|A domestic [[cat]]'s retractable claw in protracted position]]
A '''claw''' is a curved, pointed appendage, found at the end of a toe or finger in most [[amniote]]s ([[mammals]], [[reptiles]], [[birds]]).

Some [[invertebrate]]s such as beetles and spiders have somewhat similar fine hooked structures at the end of the leg or [[Arthropod leg|tarsus]] for gripping a surface as the creature walks. Crabs', lobsters' and scorpions' pincers, or more formally, their [[chelae]], are sometimes called claws.

A true claw is made of hard protein called [[keratin]]. Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs, but may also be used for such purposes as digging, climbing trees, self-defense, and grooming, in those and other species.

Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called [[nail (anatomy)|nails]] instead. Claw-like projections that do not form at the end of digits, but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named [[Spur (zoology)|spur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rand|first=A.L.|title=On the Spurs on Birds' Wings|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|year=1954|volume=66|issue=2|pages=127–134|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v066n02/p0127-p0134.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tetrapods==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pangolin]] --&gt;
In [[tetrapod]]s, claws are made of [[keratin]] and consist of two layers. The '''unguis''' is the harder external layer, which consists of keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an oblique angle. The '''subunguis''' is the softer, flaky underside layer whose grain is parallel to the direction of growth. The claw grows outward from the '''nail matrix''' at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while travelling across the '''nail bed'''. The unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to produce a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle, producing a more or less sharp point. Tetrapods use their claws in many ways, commonly to grasp or kill prey, to dig and to climb and hang.

===Mammals===

[[File:Katzenkralle.jpg|right|thumb|A claw sheath from a cat]]

All [[Carnivora]] have claws, which vary considerably in length and shape. Claws grow out of the third [[Phalanx bones|phalange]]s of the paws and are made of [[keratin]]. Many [[predator]]y mammals have [[Protraction|protractile]] claws that can partially hide inside the animal's [[paw]], especially the cat family, [[Felidae]], almost all of which members have fully protractible claws. Outside of the cat family, retractable claws are found only in certain species of the [[Viverridae]] (and the extinct [[Nimravidae]]).&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Mauricio (1997). ''The Big Cats and Their Fossil Relatives''. Columbia University Press. pp. 130-33. {{ISBN|978-0-231-10228-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A claw that is retractable is protected from wear and tear.

Most cats and dogs also have a [[dewclaw]] on the inside of the front paws. It is much less functional than the other claws but does help the cats to grasp prey. Because the dew claw does not touch the ground, it receives less wear and tends to be sharper and longer.

A '''[[nail (anatomy)|nail]]''' is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to a claw but is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point. A nail that is big enough to bear weight is called a "[[hoof]]". (Nevertheless, one side of the cloven-hoof of [[Artiodactyla|artiodactyl]] [[ungulate]]s may also be called a claw).

Every so often, the growth of claws stops and restarts, as does [[hair]]. In hair, this results in the hair falling out and being replaced by a new one. In claws, this results in an [[abscission]] layer, and the old segment breaks off. This process takes several months for [[human]] thumbnails. [[Cat]]s are often seen working old unguis layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose. Ungulates' hooves wear or self-trim by ground contact. Domesticated [[Equus (genus)|equid]]s ([[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s) usually need regular trimming by a [[farrier]], as a consequence of reduced activity on hard ground.

====Primates====
[[Primate]] [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] consist of the unguis alone, as the subunguis has disappeared. With the evolution of grasping hands and feet, claws are no longer necessary for locomotion, and instead most digits exhibit [[nail (anatomy)|nail]]s. However, claw-like nails are found in small-bodied [[callitrichids]] on all digits except the [[hallux]] or big toe. A laterally flattened [[grooming claw]], used for grooming, can be found on the second toe in living [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]], and the second and third in [[tarsiers]]. [[Aye-aye]]s have functional claws on all other digits except the hallux, including a grooming claw on the second toe.&lt;ref name="Soligo"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Soligo | first1 = C. | last2 = Müller | first2 = A.

===Reptiles===

[[File:Therizinosaurus claw.jpg|thumb|At just under a meter, the claws of ''[[Therizinosaurus]]'' are among the largest recorded.]]
[[File:Grenn lizzard.jpg|thumb|right|Using its claws for anchoring, a [[Balkan green lizard|green lizard]] basks.]]

Most reptiles have well-developed claws. Most lizards have toes ending in stout claws, forming from the last scale on the toe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alibardi, L. |year=2008|title= Microscopic analysis of lizard claw morphogenesis and hypothesis on its evolution|journal=[[Acta Zoologica: Morphology and Evolution]]|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6395.2007.00312.x|volume=89|issue=2|pages=169–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In snakes, feet and claws are absent, but in many [[boidae|boids]] such as ''[[Boa constrictor]]'', remnants of highly reduced hind-limbs emerge with a single claw as "spurs" on each side of the anal opening.

Lizard claws are used as aids in climbing, and in holding down prey in carnivorous species.

===Birds===
A '''talon''' is the claw of a [[bird of prey]], its primary hunting tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007999|author= Fowler, D.W., Freedman, E.A., &amp; Scannella, J.B.|year=2009|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007999 |title=Predatory Functional Morphology in Raptors: Interdigital Variation in Talon Size Is Related to Prey Restraint and Immobilisation Technique|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=11|pages=e7999|pmid=19946365|pmc=2776979|editor1-last=Pizzari|editor1-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey would not be able to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for defensive purposes. [[Cassowary|Cassowaries]] use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lumeij|first=J.

The [[hoatzin]] and [[turaco]] are unique among [[extant taxon|extant]] birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop.&lt;ref name=Parallel&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fain, Matthew G.  |author2=Houde, Peter |year=2004|title= Parallel radiations in the primary clades of birds|journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]|volume=58|issue=11|pages= 2558–2573|doi=10.1554/04-235|pmid= 15612298|url=http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/~houde/Parallel_radiations.pdf |accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1891.tb00045.x|last=Parker|first= W.

===Amphibians===
The only [[amphibian]]s to bear claws are the [[African clawed frog]]s. Claws appear to have evolved separately in the amphibian and [[amniote]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The anatomy and development of the claws of ''Xenopus laevis'' (Lissamphibia: Anura) reveal alternate pathways of structural evolution in the integument of tetrapods|pmid=19422431|year=2009|last1=Maddin|first1=HC|last2=Eckhart|first2=L|last3=Jaeger|first3=K|last4=Russell|first4=AP|last5=Ghannadan|first5=M|volume=214|issue=4|pages=607–19|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01052.x|pmc=2736125|journal=Journal of Anatomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthropods==
{{main|Chela (organ)}}
The scientifically correct term for the "claw" of an arthropod, such as a lobster or crab, is a '''[[Chela (organ)|chela]]''' (plural ''chelae''). Legs bearing a chela are called '''[[cheliped]]s'''. Chelae are also called '''[[pincer (biology)|pincers]]'''.

'''Conversion theory''' is [[Serge Moscovici]]'s conceptual analysis of the cognitive and interpersonal processes that mediate the direct and indirect impact of a consistent minority on the majority (Moscovici, 1976). Initially, Moscovici's conversion theory of [[minority influence]] began as a minority opinion that was rejected by many researchers, but eventually members of opposition validated it, thus confirming the theory's exact predictions. Asch's studies highlighted the power that majorities have over groups and their subsequent conformity, but Moscovici was more interested in the power exerted by minorities.

Contrasting the "majority rules" model of social influence, conversion theory maintains that disagreement within the group results in conflict, and that group members are motivated to reduce that conflict—either by changing their own opinions or attempting to get others to change. Minorities have a different process of influence, and Moscovici theorized that they do so by a ''validation process'' (majorities undergo comparison processes). If someone within the minority breaks that unanimity of the majority, this captures the majority's attention, causing them to consider their arguments and reasoning for disagreement (Moscovici, 1976). If the new information/opinions garnered from the minority are validated, this may sway the majority and lead to more long lasting changes than changes occurring via comparison processes.  This is because validation leads to private acceptance, whereas comparison processes result in direct influence as members publicly comply.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Generally, validation is a long process, so the effects of a minority are somewhat slower to emerge and identify.

One of the first tests of this theory was a reversal of [[Asch conformity experiments]] by adding two confederates in a six person group, and arranging for them to systematically disagree with the majority decision. Instead of lines, the participants judged (aloud) the color and brightness of a series of 36 colored slides (all were blue with varying luminosity). The confederates were told to consistently state "green" rather than "blue." When tested alone, the error rate of participants was 0.25% (i.e., saying green when the answer was blue), but when tested in the presence of the green-saying confederates, the error rate increased to 8.4%, thus confirming the power of a minority (Forsyth, 2010).

'''Dermatoglyphics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''derma'', "skin", and ''[[glyph]]'', "carving") is the scientific study of [[fingerprint]]s, lines, mounts and shapes of hands. Dermatoglyphics refers to the making of naturally occurring ridges on certain body parts, namely palms, fingers, soles, and toes. These are areas where hair usually does not grow, and these ridges allow for increased leverage when picking up objects or walking barefoot. The fingerprints of both hands are not the same. They do not change size or shape throughout a person's life, except in cases of serious injuries that scar the [[dermis]].

As a term, dermatoglyphics is used to distinguish it from the superficially similar [[pseudoscience]] of [[palmistry]]. Recently, the scientific basis underlying dermatoglyphics was questioned by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in a 2009 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciences|first1=National Academy of|title=Strengthening Forensic Science: A Path Forward|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12589/strengthening-forensic-science-in-the-united-states-a-path-forward|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for relying on subjective comparisons instead of conclusions drawn from the [[scientific method]].

==Dermatoglyphics and genetic aberrations==
Dermatoglyphics, when correlated with [[Genetic disorder|genetic abnormalities]], is useful in the diagnosis of these disorders at birth or soon after. They aid in the diagnosis of [[Birth defect|congenital malformations]].

==History==
The scientific study of [[Dermis#Dermal papillae|papillary ridges]] of the hands and feet is credited as the beginning with the work of [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně]] in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grzybowski |first1=Andrzej |last2=Pietrzak |first2=Krzysztof |title=Jan Evangelista Purkynje (1787-1869): first to describe fingerprints |journal=[[Clinics in Dermatology]] |date=2015 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=117–121 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2014.07.011 |pmid=25530005 |issn=1879-1131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet]] (1858) was the first to experiment with fingerprints in India.

Sir [[Francis Galton]] (1892) conducted extensive research on the importance of skin ridge patterns to demonstrate their permanence, but also their use for identification. In 1892, Galton published the book ''Fingerprints'' and in doing so advanced the science of fingerprint identification.

Sir [[Edward Henry]] (1893) published the book ''The classification and uses of fingerprints'' which established the modern era of fingerprint identification, which is now the basis for other classification systems.

[[Harold Cummins]] and Charles Midlo M D (1929) together with others published a widely referred book ''Fingerprints, Palms and soles'', a bible in the field of Dermatoglyphics.

[[Lionel Penrose]] (1945), inspired by the works of Cummins and Midlo, conducted his own dermatoglyphic investigations as a further aspect of his research into Down's syndrome and other congenital medical disorders.

Schaumann and Alter (1976) published a book ''Dermatoglyphics in Medical disorders'' which summarizes the findings of dermatoglyphic patterns in disease conditions.

Seltzer, et al. (1982) conducted a study on patients with breast cancer, and concluded that the presence of six or more whorls on the fingertips of a person provided a high risk for breast cancer.

The current state of medical dermatoglyphics is that the diagnosis of illnesses can now be done with dermatoglyphic analysis alone. Currently, dermatoglyphic researchers claim a high degree of accuracy in their prognostic ability from the hand features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8634">In astrophysics, '''Dirichlet's ellipsoidal problem''' addresses the question under what conditions one can have an ellipsoidal configuration at all times of a homogeneous rotating fluid mass and in which the motion, in an inertial frame is a linear function of the coordinates, named after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]. Dirichlet's basic idea was to reduce [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] to system of ordinary differential equations such that the position of a fluid particle in a homogeneous [[ellipsoid]] at any time is a linear and homogeneous function of initial position of the fluid particle, using Lagrangian framework instead of the Eulerian framework&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1969). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium (Vol. 10, p. 253). New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1967). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium—an historical account. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 20(2), 251-265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lebovitz, N. R. (1998). The mathematical development of the classical ellipsoids. International journal of engineering science, 36(12), 1407-1420.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

In the winter of 1856-57, Dirichlet found some solutions of Euler equations and he presented those in his lectures on partial differential equations in July 1857 and published the results in the same month&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet G. Lejeune, Nach von der KoÈnig Gesell der Wiss zu GoÈtt 14 (1857) 205&lt;/ref&gt;. But he could not finish the work he started because of his sudden death in 1859, but his notes were collated and published by [[Richard Dedekind]] posthumously in 1860&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet, P. G. L. (1860). Untersuchungen über ein Problem der Hydrodynamik (Vol. 8). Dieterichschen Buchhandlung.&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, [[Bernhard Riemann]] quoted, ''In his posthumous paper, edited for publication by Dedekind, Dirichlet has opened up, in a most remarkable way, an entirely new avenue for investigations on the motion of a self-gravitating homogeneous ellipsoid. The further development of his beautiful discovery has a particular interest to the mathematician even apart from its relevance to the forms of heavenly bodies which initially instigated these investigations.''

==Riemann-Lebovitz formulation==

The Dirichlet's problem is generalized by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1860&lt;ref&gt;Riemann, B. (1860). Über die Fortpflanzung ebener Luftwellen von endlicher Schwingungsweite. Verlag der Dieterichschen Buchhandlung.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Norman R. Lebovitz in modern form in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Norman R. Lebovitz (1965), The Riemann ellipsoids, (lecture notes, Inst. Ap., Cointe-Sclessin, Belgium)&lt;/ref&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a_1(t)\ ,a_2(t)\ , a_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; be the semi-axes of the ellipsoid, which varies with time and since the ellipsoid is homogeneous, the constancy of mass requires the constancy of the volume of the ellipsoid,

:&lt;math&gt;a_1(t)a_2(t)a_3(t) = a_1(0)a_2(0)a_3(0)&lt;/math&gt;,

same as the initial volume. Consider an inertial frame &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,X_3)&lt;/math&gt; and a rotating frame &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,x_3)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}(t)&lt;/math&gt; being the linear transformation such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x=\mathbf L\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; and it is clear that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf L&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf L\mathbf L^T=\mathbf L^T\mathbf T = \mathbf I&lt;/math&gt;. We can define an anti-symmetric matrix with this,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega^* = \frac{d\mathbf L}{dt}\mathbf L^T&lt;/math&gt;

where we can write the dual &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega^*&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{ij}^* = \epsilon_{ijk}\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;2\Omega_i = \epsilon_{ijk}\Omega_{jk}^*&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega(t)&lt;/math&gt; is nothing but the time-dependent rotation of the rotating frame with respect to the inertial frame.

Without loss of generality, let us assume that the inertial frame and the moving frame coincide initially, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X(0) = \mathbf x(0)&lt;/math&gt;. By definition, Dirichlet's problem is looking for a solution which is a linear function of initial condition &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X(0) = \mathbf x(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Let us assume the following form,

:&lt;math&gt;X_i(t) = \sum_{j=1}^3 P_{ij}(t) \frac{x_j(0)}{a_j(0)}&lt;/math&gt;.

and we define a diagonal matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A(t)&lt;/math&gt; with diagonal elements being the semi-axes of the ellipsoid, then above equation can be written in matrix form as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf X = \mathbf P \mathbf A_0^{-1} \mathbf x(0)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_0 = \mathbf A(0)&lt;/math&gt;. It can shown then that the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf S=\mathbf A^{-1}\mathbf L\mathbf P&lt;/math&gt; transforms the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_0^{-1}\mathbf x(0)&lt;/math&gt; linearly to the same vector at any later time &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^{-1}\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^{-1}\mathbf x=\mathbf S\mathbf A_0^{-1}\mathbf x(0)&lt;/math&gt;. From the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;, we can realize the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^{-1}\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; represents a unit normal on the surface of the ellipsoid (true only at the boundary). Therefore, we see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf S&lt;/math&gt; transforms one unit vector on the boundary to another unit vector on the boundary, in other words, it is orthogonal, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf S\mathbf S^T = \mathbf S^T\mathbf S=\mathbf I&lt;/math&gt;. In a similar manner as before, we can define another anti-symmetric matrix as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Lambda^*= \frac{d\mathbf S}{dt}\mathbf S^T&lt;/math&gt;,

where its dual is defined as &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{ij}^*=\epsilon_{ijk}\Lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;2\Lambda_i = \epsilon_{ijk}\Lambda_{jk}^*&lt;/math&gt;). The problem is one of uniform vorticity &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt; with components given by

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_k = -\frac{a_i^2+a_j^2}{a_ia_j}\Lambda_k,\quad (i\neq j\neq k).&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure can take only quadratic form, can be seen from the momentum equation (and using the vanishing condition at the surface) given by

:&lt;math&gt;p = p_c(t)\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{x_i^2}{a_i^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the central pressure, so that &lt;math&gt;\nabla p = -2 p_c \mathbf A^{-2}\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the tensor momentum equation reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\mathbf A}{dt^2} + \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf A\mathbf\Lambda^*-\mathbf\Omega^*\mathbf A) + \frac{d\mathbf A}{dt}\mathbf\Lambda^* - \mathbf\Omega^*\frac{d\mathbf A}{dt} + \mathbf A\mathbf\Lambda^{*2} + \mathbf\Omega^{*2}\mathbf A -2\mathbf\Omega^*\mathbf A\mathbf\Lambda^*= - 2\pi G\rho \mathbf B\mathbf A + \frac{2p_c}{\rho}\mathbf A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B&lt;/math&gt; is diagonal matrix, whose diagonal elements are given by

:&lt;math&gt;B_i = a_1 a_2 a_3 \int_0^\infty \frac{du}{(a_i^2+u)\sqrt{(a_1^2+u)(a_2^2+u)(a_3^2+u)}}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The tensor momentum equation and the conservation of mass equation, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2a_3=a_1(0)a_2(0)a_3(0)&lt;/math&gt; provides us with ten equations for the ten unknowns, &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ a_2,\ a_3,\ p_c,\ \mathbf{\Lambda},\ \mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Dedekind's theorem==

It states that ''if a motion determined by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X(t)=\mathbf P(t)\mathbf A_0^{-1} \mathbf x(0)&lt;/math&gt; is admissible under the conditions of Dirichlet's problem, then the motion determined by the transpose &lt;math&gt;\mathbf P^T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf P&lt;/math&gt; is also admissible.''  In other words, the theorem can be stated as ''for any state of motions that preserves a ellipsoidal figure, there is an adjoint state of motions that preserves the same ellipsoidal figure''.

By taking transpose of the tensor momentum equation, one sees that the role of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega^*&lt;/math&gt; are interchanged. If there is solution for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A,\ \mathbf\Lambda^*,\ \mathbf\Omega^*&lt;/math&gt;, then for the same &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;, there exists another solution with the role of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega^*&lt;/math&gt; interchanged. But interchanging &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega^*&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to replacing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf P&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf P^T&lt;/math&gt;. The following relations confirms the previous statement.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf P=\mathbf L^T\mathbf A\mathbf S&lt;/math&gt;

where, further

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf S}{dt} = \mathbf\Lambda^* \mathbf S,\quad \frac{d\mathbf L}{dt} = \mathbf\Omega^* \mathbf L, \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf S(0)=\mathbf L(0) = \mathbf I&lt;/math&gt;.

The typical configuration of this theorem is the [[Jacobi ellipsoid]] and its adjoint is called as Dedekind ellipsoid, in other words, both ellipsoid have same shape, but their internal fluid motions are different.

'''Dynamic programming''' is both a [[mathematical optimization]] method and a computer programming method. The method was developed by [[Richard Bellman]] in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from [[aerospace engineering]] to [[economics]]. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a [[Recursion|recursive]] manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have [[optimal substructure]].

If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cormen, T. H.; Leiserson, C. E.; Rivest, R. L.; Stein, C. (2001), Introduction to Algorithms (2nd ed.), MIT Press &amp; McGraw–Hill, {{ISBN|0-262-03293-7}} . pp. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; In the optimization literature this relationship is called the [[Bellman equation]].

== Overview ==

=== Mathematical optimization ===
In terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of '''value functions''' ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; taking ''y'' as an argument representing the '''[[State variable|state]]''' of the system at times ''i'' from 1 to ''n''. The definition of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') is the value obtained in state ''y'' at the last time ''n''. The values ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; at earlier times ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;1 can be found by working backwards, using a [[Recursion|recursive]] relationship called the [[Bellman equation]]. For ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; at any state ''y'' is calculated from ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and the function ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; for those states. Finally, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.

=== Control theory ===
In [[control theory]], a typical problem is to find an admissible control &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; which causes the system &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{g} \left( \mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t \right)&lt;/math&gt; to follow an admissible trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; on a continuous time interval &lt;math&gt;t_{0} \leq t \leq t_{1}&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes a [[Loss function|cost function]]
:&lt;math&gt;J = b \left( \mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \right) + \int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} f \left( \mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t \right) \mathrm{d} t&lt;/math&gt; 
The solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}^{\ast} = h(\mathbf{x}(t), t)&lt;/math&gt;, which produces an optimal trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; and an optimized loss function &lt;math&gt;J^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt;. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming:
:&lt;math&gt;- J_{t}^{\ast} = \min_{\mathbf{u}} \left\{ f \left( \mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t \right) + J_{x}^{\ast \mathsf{T}} \mathbf{g} \left( \mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t \right) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
a [[partial differential equation]] known as the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]], in which &lt;math&gt;J_{x}^{\ast} = \frac{\partial J^{\ast}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = \left[ \frac{\partial J^{\ast}}{\partial x_{1}} ~~~~ \frac{\partial J^{\ast}}{\partial x_{2}} ~~~~ \dots ~~~~  \frac{\partial J^{\ast}}{\partial x_{n}} \right]^{\mathsf{T}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_{t}^{\ast} = \frac{\partial J^{\ast}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;. One finds the minimizing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, and the unknown function &lt;math&gt;J_{x}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; and then substitutes the result into the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation to get the partial differential equation to be solved with boundary condition &lt;math&gt;J \left( t_{1} \right) = b \left( \mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M.

Alternatively, the continuous process can be approximated by a discrete system, which leads to a following recurrence relation analog to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation:
:&lt;math&gt;J_{k}^{\ast} \left( \mathbf{x}_{n-k} \right) = \min_{\mathbf{u}_{n-k}} \left\{ \hat{f} \left( \mathbf{x}_{n-k}, \mathbf{u}_{n-k} \right) + J_{k-1}^{\ast} \left( \hat{g} \left( \mathbf{x}_{n-k}, \mathbf{u}_{n-k} \right) \right) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

This functional equation is known as the [[Bellman equation]], which can be solved for an exact solution of the discrete approximation of the optimization equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Kirk |title=Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-13-638098-6 |page=94–95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCh2SAtWIdwC&amp;pg=PA94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example from economics: Ramsey's problem of optimal saving ====
{{See also|Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model}}
In economics, the objective is generally to maximize (rather than minimize) some dynamic [[social welfare function]]. In Ramsey's problem, this function relates amounts of consumption to levels of [[utility]]. Loosely speaking, the planner faces the trade-off between contemporaneous consumption and future consumption (via investment in [[Physical capital|capital stock]] that is used in production), known as [[intertemporal choice]]. Future consumption is discounted at a constant rate &lt;math&gt;\beta \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. A discrete approximation to the transition equation of capital is given by
:&lt;math&gt;k_{t+1} = \hat{g} \left( k_{t}, c_{t} \right) = f(k_{t}) - c_{t}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is consumption, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is capital, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[production function]] satisfying the [[Inada conditions]]. An initial capital stock &lt;math&gt;k_{0} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is assumed.

Let &lt;math&gt;c_t&lt;/math&gt; be consumption in period {{mvar|t}}, and assume consumption yields [[utility]] &lt;math&gt;u(c_t)=\ln(c_t)&lt;/math&gt; as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he [[discounting|discounts]] future utility by a factor {{mvar|b}} each period, where &lt;math&gt;0&lt;b&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;k_t&lt;/math&gt; be [[capital (economics)|capital]] in period {{mvar|t}}. Assume initial capital is a given amount &lt;math&gt;k_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose that this period's capital and consumption determine next period's capital as &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|A}} is a positive constant and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;a&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Assume capital cannot be negative. Then the consumer's decision problem can be written as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\max \sum_{t=0}^T b^t \ln(c_t)&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t=0,1,2,\ldots,T&lt;/math&gt;

Written this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables &lt;math&gt;c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_T&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; is not a choice variable—the consumer's initial capital is taken as given.)

The dynamic programming approach to solve this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of ''value functions'' &lt;math&gt;V_t(k)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;t=0,1,2,\ldots,T,T+1&lt;/math&gt; which represent the value of having any amount of capital {{mvar|k}} at each time {{mvar|t}}. Note that &lt;math&gt;V_{T+1}(k)=0&lt;/math&gt;, that is, there is (by assumption) no utility from having capital after death.

The value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by [[backward induction]] using the [[Bellman equation]]. In this problem, for each &lt;math&gt;t=0,1,2,\ldots,T&lt;/math&gt;, the Bellman equation is

: &lt;math&gt;V_t(k_t) \, = \, \max \left( \ln(c_t) + b V_{t+1}(k_{t+1}) \right)&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

This problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, &lt;math&gt;c_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time {{mvar|t}}, his current capital &lt;math&gt;k_t&lt;/math&gt; is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption &lt;math&gt;c_t&lt;/math&gt; and saving &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

To actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as {{mvar|k}}. &lt;math&gt;V_{T+1}(k)&lt;/math&gt; is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate &lt;math&gt;V_T(k)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on until we get to &lt;math&gt;V_0(k)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the ''value'' of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime. In other words, once we know &lt;math&gt;V_{T-j+1}(k)&lt;/math&gt;, we can calculate &lt;math&gt;V_{T-j}(k)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the maximum of &lt;math&gt;\ln(c_{T-j}) + b V_{T-j+1}(Ak^a-c_{T-j})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_{T-j}&lt;/math&gt; is the choice variable and &lt;math&gt;Ak^a-c_{T-j} \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Working backwards, it can be shown that the value function at time &lt;math&gt;t=T-j&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;V_{T-j}(k) \, = \, a \sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i \ln k + v_{T-j}&lt;/math&gt;

where each &lt;math&gt;v_{T-j}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, and the optimal amount to consume at time &lt;math&gt;t=T-j&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;c_{T-j}(k) \, = \, \frac{1}{\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i} Ak^a&lt;/math&gt;

which can be simplified to

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c_{T}(k) &amp; = Ak^a\\
c_{T-1}(k) &amp; = \frac{Ak^a}{1+ab}\\
c_{T-2}(k) &amp; = \frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2}\\
&amp;\dots\\
c_2(k) &amp; = \frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}}\\
c_1(k) &amp; = \frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}}\\
c_0(k) &amp; = \frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}+a^Tb^T}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We see that it is optimal to consume a larger fraction of current wealth as one gets older, finally consuming all remaining wealth in period {{mvar|T}}, the last period of life.

=== Computer programming ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: [[optimal substructure]] and [[overlapping subproblem|overlapping sub-problem]]s. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to ''non-overlapping'' sub-problems, the strategy is called "[[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]" instead&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  This is why [[mergesort|merge sort]] and [[quicksort|quick sort]] are not classified as dynamic programming problems.

''Optimal substructure'' means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of [[recursion]]. For example, given a graph ''G=(V,E)'', the shortest path ''p'' from a vertex ''u'' to a vertex ''v'' exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex ''w'' on this shortest path ''p''. If ''p'' is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' from ''u'' to ''w'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' from ''w'' to ''v'' such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]''). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the [[Bellman–Ford algorithm]] or the [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]] does.

''Overlapping'' sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with base case ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Then ''F''&lt;sub&gt;43&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;. Now ''F''&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both ''F''&lt;sub&gt;43&lt;/sub&gt; as well as ''F''&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;. Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.

[[Image:Fibonacci dynamic programming.svg|thumb|108px|'''Figure 2.''' The subproblem graph for the Fibonacci sequence. The fact that it is not a [[tree structure|tree]] indicates overlapping subproblems.]]

This can be achieved in either of two ways:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Top-down approach]]'': This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily [[memoize]] or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.
* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Bottom-up approach]]'': Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;, we can directly calculate the value of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Some [[programming language]]s can automatically [[memoization|memoize]] the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up [[call-by-name]] evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as ''[[call-by-need]]''). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Common Lisp]] or [[Perl]]). Some languages have automatic [[memoization]] &lt;!-- still not a typo for "memor-" --&gt; built in, such as tabled [[Prolog]] and [[J (programming language)|J]], which supports memoization with the ''M.'' adverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M. Memo|url=http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dmcapdot.htm|work=J Vocabulary|publisher=J Software|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, this is only possible for a [[referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]] function. Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as [[Wolfram Language]].

=== Bioinformatics ===
Dynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for the tasks such as [[sequence alignment]], protein folding, RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. The first dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by [[Charles DeLisi]] in USA&lt;ref&gt;DeLisi, Biopolymers, 1974, Volume 13, Issue 7, pages 1511–1512, July 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Gurskiĭ GV, Zasedatelev AS, Biofizika, 1978 Sep-Oct;23(5):932-46&lt;/ref&gt; Recently these algorithms have become very popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of [[nucleosome]] positioning and [[transcription factor]] binding.

=== Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem ===

}}

is a paraphrasing of [[Richard Bellman|Bellman's]] famous [[Principle of Optimality]] in the context of the [[shortest path problem]].

=== Fibonacci sequence ===

Here is a naïve implementation of a function finding the ''n''th member of the [[Fibonacci sequence]], based directly on the mathematical definition:

    '''function''' fib(n)
        '''if''' n &lt;= 1 '''return''' n
        '''return''' fib(n − 1) + fib(n − 2)

Notice that if we call, say, &lt;code&gt;fib(5)&lt;/code&gt;, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times:

# &lt;code&gt;fib(5)&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;fib(4) + fib(3)&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;(fib(3) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;((fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;(((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))&lt;/code&gt;

In particular, &lt;code&gt;fib(2)&lt;/code&gt; was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt;, or ''subproblems'', are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.

Now, suppose we have a simple [[Associative array|map]] object, ''m'', which maps each value of &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') time instead of exponential time (but requires [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') space):

    '''var''' m := '''''map'''''(0 → 0, 1 → 1)
    '''function''' fib(n)
        '''if ''key''''' n '''is not in ''map''''' m 
            m[n] := fib(n − 1) + fib(n − 2)
        '''return''' m[n]

This technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called ''[[memoization]]''; &lt;!-- Yes, memoization, not memorization. Not a typo. --&gt; this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.

In the '''bottom-up''' approach, we calculate the smaller values of &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(''n'') time since it contains a loop that repeats n − 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(''n'') space to store the map.

    '''function''' fib(n)
        '''if''' n = 0
            '''return''' 0
        '''else'''
            '''var''' previousFib := 0, currentFib := 1
            '''repeat''' n − 1 '''times''' ''// loop is skipped if n = 1''
                '''var''' newFib := previousFib + currentFib
                previousFib := currentFib
                currentFib  := newFib
        '''return''' currentFib

In both examples, we only calculate &lt;code&gt;fib(2)&lt;/code&gt; one time, and then use it to calculate both &lt;code&gt;fib(4)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fib(3)&lt;/code&gt;, instead of computing it every time either of them is evaluated.

Note that the above method actually takes &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time for large n because addition of two integers with &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; bits each takes &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; time. (The ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; fibonacci number has &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; bits.) Also, there is a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence, [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet#Binet's Fibonacci number formula|known as Binet's formula]], from which the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th term can be [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations|computed]] in approximately &lt;math&gt;O(n(\log n)^2)&lt;/math&gt; time, which is more efficient than the above dynamic programming technique. However, the simple recurrence directly gives [[Fibonacci sequence#Matrix form|the matrix form]] that leads to an approximately &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; algorithm by fast [[matrix exponentiation]].

=== A type of balanced 0–1 matrix ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Consider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} matrix, with {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} even, so that each row and each column contains exactly {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; / 2}} zeros and {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; / 2}} ones. We ask how many different assignments there are for a given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For example, when {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 4}}, four possible solutions are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} \text{ and } \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} \text{ and } \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \text{ and } \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

There are at least three possible approaches: [[Brute-force search|brute force]], [[backtracking]], and dynamic programming.

Brute force consists of checking all assignments of zeros and ones and counting those that have balanced rows and columns ({{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; / 2}} zeros and {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; / 2}} ones). As there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{n/2}^n&lt;/math&gt; possible assignments, this strategy is not practical except maybe up to &lt;math&gt;n=6&lt;/math&gt;.

Backtracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; / 2}}. While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8, as we shall see.

Dynamic programming makes it possible to count the number of solutions without visiting them all. Imagine backtracking values for the first row – what information would we require about the remaining rows, in order to be able to accurately count the solutions obtained for each first row value? We consider {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} boards, where {{math|1 &amp;le; &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; &amp;le; &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}, whose &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; rows contain &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; zeros and &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; ones. The function ''f'' to which [[memoization]] is applied maps vectors of ''n'' pairs of integers to the number of admissible boards (solutions). There is one pair for each column, and its two components indicate respectively the number of zeros and ones that have yet to be placed in that column. We seek the value of &lt;math&gt; f((n/2, n/2), (n/2, n/2), \ldots (n/2, n/2)) &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; arguments or one vector of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements). The process of subproblem creation involves iterating over every one of  &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{n/2}&lt;/math&gt; possible assignments for the top row of the board, and going through every column, subtracting one from the appropriate element of the pair for that column, depending on whether the assignment for the top row contained a zero or a one at that position. If any one of the results is negative, then the assignment is invalid and does not contribute to the set of solutions (recursion stops). Otherwise, we have an assignment for the top row of the {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} board and recursively compute the number of solutions to the remaining {{math|(&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; &amp;minus; 1) &amp;times; &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} board, adding the numbers of solutions for every admissible assignment of the top row and returning the sum, which is being memoized. The base case is the trivial subproblem, which occurs for a {{math|1 &amp;times; &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} board. The number of solutions for this board is either zero or one, depending on whether the vector is a permutation of {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; / 2}} &lt;math&gt;(0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; / 2}} &lt;math&gt;(1, 0)&lt;/math&gt; pairs or not.

For example, in the first two boards shown above the sequences of vectors would be
&lt;PRE WIDTH=80&gt;
((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))       ((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))     k = 4
  0      1      0      1              0      0      1      1

((1, 2) (2, 1) (1, 2) (2, 1))       ((1, 2) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 1))     k = 3
  1      0      1      0              0      0      1      1

((1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1))       ((0, 2) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 0))     k = 2
  0      1      0      1              1      1      0      0

((0, 1) (1, 0) (0, 1) (1, 0))       ((0, 1) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 0))     k = 1
  1      0      1      0              1      1      0      0

((0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0))       ((0, 0) (0, 0), (0, 0) (0, 0))
&lt;/PRE&gt;

The number of solutions {{OEIS|id=A058527}} is

:&lt;math&gt; 1,\, 2,\,  90,\, 297200,\, 116963796250,\, 6736218287430460752, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

=== Checkerboard ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Consider a [[checkerboard]] with ''n'' × ''n'' squares and a cost-function ''c''(''i'', ''j'') which returns a cost associated with square ''i'', ''j'' (''i'' being the row, ''j'' being the column). For instance (on a 5 × 5 checkerboard),

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! 5
| 6 || 7 || 4 || 7 || 8
|-
! 4
| 7 || 6 || 1 || 1 || 4
|-
! 3
| 3 || 5 || 7 || 8 || 2
|-
! 2
| – || 6 || 7 || 0 || –
|-
! 1
| – || – || *5* || – || –
|-
!width="15"| !! style="width:15px;"|1 !! style="width:15px;"|2 !! style="width:15px;"|3 !! style="width:15px;"|4 !! style="width:15px;"|5
|}
Thus ''c''(1, 3) = 5

Let us say there was a checker that could start at any square on the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path (sum of the costs of the visited squares are at a minimum) to get to the last rank, assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on (1,3) can move to (2,2), (2,3) or (2,4).
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! 5
|  ||  ||  ||  ||
|-
! 4
|  ||  ||  ||  ||

|  ||  ||  ||  ||

|}

This problem exhibits '''optimal substructure'''. That is, the solution to the entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems. Let us define a function ''q''(''i'', ''j'') as

:''q''(''i'', ''j'') = the minimum cost to reach square (''i'', ''j'').

If we can find the values of this function for all the squares at rank ''n'', we pick the minimum and follow that path backwards to get the shortest path.

Note that ''q''(''i'', ''j'') is equal to the minimum cost to get to any of the three squares below it (since those are the only squares that can reach it) plus ''c''(''i'', ''j''). For instance:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! 5
|  ||  ||  ||  ||
|-
! 4
|  ||  || A  ||  ||
|-
! 3
|  || B || C || D ||
|-
! 2
|  ||  ||  ||  ||
|-
! 1
|  ||  ||  ||  ||
|-
!width="15"| !! style="width:15px;"|1 !! style="width:15px;"|2 !! style="width:15px;"|3 !! style="width:15px;"|4 !! style="width:15px;"|5
|}

: &lt;math&gt;q(A) = \min(q(B),q(C),q(D))+c(A) \, &lt;/math&gt;

Now, let us define ''q''(''i'', ''j'') in somewhat more general terms:

: &lt;math&gt;q(i,j)=\begin{cases} \infty &amp; j &lt; 1 \text{ or }j &gt; n \\ c(i, j) &amp; i = 1 \\ \min(q(i-1, j-1), q(i-1, j), q(i-1, j+1)) + c(i,j) &amp; \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The first line of this equation is there to make the recursive property simpler (when dealing with the edges, so we need only one recursion). The second line says what happens in the last rank, to provide a base case. The third line, the recursion, is the important part. It is similar to the A,B,C,D example. From this definition we can make a straightforward recursive code for ''q''(''i'', ''j''). In the following pseudocode, ''n'' is the size of the board, &lt;code&gt;c(i, j)&lt;/code&gt; is the cost-function, and &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; returns the minimum of a number of values:

 '''function''' minCost(i, j)
     '''if''' j &amp;lt; 1 '''or''' j &gt; n
         '''return''' infinity
     '''else if''' i = 1
         '''return''' c(i, j)
     '''else'''
         '''return''' '''min'''( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)

It should be noted that this function only computes the path-cost, not the actual path. We will get to the path soon. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow since it wastes time recomputing the same shortest paths over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path-costs in a two-dimensional array &lt;code&gt;q[i, j]&lt;/code&gt; rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; before computing the cost of a path, we check the array &lt;code&gt;q[i, j]&lt;/code&gt; to see if the path cost is already there.

We also need to know what the actual shortest path is. To do this, we use another array &lt;code&gt;p[i, j]&lt;/code&gt;, a ''predecessor array''. This array implicitly stores the path to any square ''s'' by storing the previous node on the shortest path to ''s'', i.e. the predecessor. To reconstruct the path, we lookup the predecessor of ''s'', then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on, until we reach the starting square. Consider the following code:

  '''function''' computeShortestPathArrays()
      '''for''' x '''from''' 1 '''to''' n
          q[1, x] := c(1, x)
      '''for''' y '''from''' 1 '''to''' n
          q[y, 0]     := infinity
          q[y, n + 1] := infinity
      '''for''' y '''from''' 2 '''to''' n
          '''for''' x '''from''' 1 '''to''' n
              m := min(q[y-1, x-1], q[y-1, x], q[y-1, x+1])
              q[y, x] := m + c(y, x)
              '''if''' m = q[y-1, x-1]
                  p[y, x] := -1
              '''else if''' m = q[y-1, x]
                  p[y, x] :=  0
              '''else'''
                  p[y, x] :=  1

Now the rest is a simple matter of finding the minimum and printing it.

  '''function''' computeShortestPath()
      computeShortestPathArrays()
      minIndex := 1
      min := q[n, 1]
      '''for''' i '''from''' 2 '''to''' n
          '''if''' q[n, i] &amp;lt; min
              minIndex := i
              min := q[n, i]
      printPath(n, minIndex)

  '''function''' printPath(y, x)
      '''print'''(x)
      '''print'''("&amp;lt;-")
      '''if''' y = 2
          '''print'''(x + p[y, x])
      '''else'''
          printPath(y-1, x + p[y, x])

=== Sequence alignment ===
In [[genetics]], [[sequence alignment]] is an important application where dynamic programming is essential.&lt;ref name="Eddy"/&gt;  Typically, the problem consists of transforming one sequence into another using edit operations that replace, insert, or remove an element.  Each operation has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the [[edit distance|sequence of edits with the lowest total cost]].

The problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:

# inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B
# deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B
# replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.

The partial alignments can be tabulated in a matrix, where cell (i,j) contains the cost of the optimal alignment of A[1..i] to B[1..j].  The cost in cell (i,j) can be calculated by adding the cost of the relevant operations to the cost of its neighboring cells, and selecting the optimum.

Different variants exist, see [[Smith–Waterman algorithm]] and [[Needleman–Wunsch algorithm]].

=== Tower of Hanoi puzzle ===
[[Image:Tower of Hanoi.jpeg|300px|thumb|A model set of the Towers of Hanoi (with 8 disks)]]
[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|300px|thumb|An animated solution of the '''Tower of Hanoi''' puzzle for ''T(4,3)''.]]
The '''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' or '''Towers of [[Hanoi]]''' is a [[mathematical game]] or [[puzzle]]. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:

* Only one disk may be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The dynamic programming solution consists of solving the [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]

: S(n,h,t) = S(n-1,h, not(h,t)) ; S(1,h,t) ; S(n-1,not(h,t),t)

where n denotes the number of disks to be moved, h denotes the home rod, t denotes the target rod, not(h,t) denotes the third rod (neither h nor t), ";" denotes concatenation, and

: S(n, h, t) := solution to a problem consisting of n disks that are to be moved from rod h to rod t.

Note that for n=1 the problem is trivial, namely S(1,h,t) = "move a disk from rod h to rod t" (there is only one disk left).

The  number of moves required by this solution is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. If the objective is to '''maximize''' the number of moves (without cycling) then the dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]  is slightly more complicated and  3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 moves are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Moshe Sniedovich |title= OR/MS Games: 2.

=== Egg dropping puzzle ===
The following is a description of the instance of this famous [[puzzle]] involving N=2 eggs and a building with H=36 floors:&lt;ref&gt;Konhauser J.D.E., Velleman, D., and Wagon, S. (1996). [http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780883853252 Which way did the Bicycle Go?] Dolciani Mathematical Expositions – No 18.  [[The Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 36-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing (using [[U.S. English]] terminology, in which the first floor is at ground level). We make a few assumptions:

:* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
:* A broken egg must be discarded.
:* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
:* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher window.
:* If an egg survives a fall, then it would survive a shorter fall.
:* It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor windows.

: If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings. Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the lowest number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?

To derive a dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]] for this puzzle, let the '''state''' of the dynamic programming model be a pair s = (n,k), where

: ''n'' = number of test eggs available, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.
: ''k'' = number of (consecutive) floors yet to be tested, ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., ''H''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

For instance, ''s'' = (2,6) indicates that two test eggs are available and 6 (consecutive) floors are yet to be tested. The initial state of the process is ''s'' = (''N'',''H'') where ''N'' denotes the number of test eggs available at the commencement of the experiment. The process terminates either when there are no more test eggs (''n'' = 0) or when ''k'' = 0, whichever occurs first. If termination occurs at state ''s'' = (0,''k'') and ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, then the test failed.

Now, let

: ''W''(''n'',''k'') = minimum number of trials required to identify the value of the critical floor under the worst-case scenario given that the process is in state ''s'' = (''n'',''k'').

Then it can be shown that&lt;ref name="sniedovich_03"&gt;Sniedovich, M. (2003). [http://pubsonline.informs.org/toc/ited/4/1 The joy of egg-dropping in Braunschweig and Hong Kong].  INFORMS Transactions on Education,  4(1) 48–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''W''(''n'',''k'') = 1 + min{max(''W''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1, ''x'' &amp;minus; 1), ''W''(''n'',''k'' &amp;minus; ''x'')): ''x'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k'' }

with ''W''(''n'',0) = 0 for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and ''W''(1,''k'') = ''k'' for all&amp;nbsp;''k''. It is easy to solve this equation iteratively by systematically increasing the values of ''n'' and&amp;nbsp;''k''.

An interactive online facility is available for experimentation with this model as well as with other versions of this puzzle (e.g. when the objective is to minimize the '''expected value''' of the number of trials.)&lt;ref name="sniedovich_03" /&gt;

==== Faster DP solution using a different parametrization ====
Notice that the above solution takes &lt;math&gt;O( n k^2 )&lt;/math&gt; time with a DP solution. This can be improved to &lt;math&gt;O( n k \log k )&lt;/math&gt; time by binary searching on the optimal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the above recurrence, since &lt;math&gt;W(n-1,x-1)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;W(n,k-x)&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, thus a local minimum of &lt;math&gt;\max(W(n-1,x-1),W(n,k-x))&lt;/math&gt; is a global minimum. Also, by storing the optimal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each cell in the DP table and referring to its value for the previous cell, the optimal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each cell can be found in constant time, improving it to &lt;math&gt;O( n k )&lt;/math&gt; time. However, there is an even faster solution that involves a different parametrization of the problem:

Let &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; be the total number of floors such that the eggs break when dropped from the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th floor (The example above is equivalent to taking &lt;math&gt;k=37&lt;/math&gt;).

Let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; be the minimum floor from which the egg must be dropped to be broken.

Let &lt;math&gt;f(t,n)&lt;/math&gt; be the maximum number of values of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that are distinguishable using &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; tries and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; eggs.

Then &lt;math&gt;f(t,0) = f(0,n) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t,n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be the floor from which the first egg is dropped in the optimal strategy.

If the first egg broke, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and distinguishable using at most &lt;math&gt;t-1&lt;/math&gt; tries and &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; eggs.

If the first egg did not break, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is from &lt;math&gt;a+1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and distinguishable using &lt;math&gt;t-1&lt;/math&gt; tries and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; eggs.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;f(t,n) = f(t-1,n-1) + f(t-1,n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x,n) \geq k&lt;/math&gt;.

To do so, we could compute &lt;math&gt;\{ f(t,i) : 0 \leq i \leq n \}&lt;/math&gt; in order of increasing &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, which would take &lt;math&gt;O( n x )&lt;/math&gt; time.

Thus, if we separately handle the case of &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, the algorithm would take &lt;math&gt;O( n \sqrt{k} )&lt;/math&gt; time.

But the recurrence relation can in fact be solved, giving &lt;math&gt;f(t,n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{ \binom{t}{i} }&lt;/math&gt;, which can be computed in &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time using the identity &lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{i+1} = \binom{t}{i} \frac{t-i}{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;f(t,n) \leq f(t+1,n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can binary search on &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to find &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, giving an &lt;math&gt;O( n \log k )&lt;/math&gt; algorithm.

=== Matrix chain multiplication ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
{{Main|Matrix chain multiplication}}
&lt;!--Show how the placement of parentheses affects the number of scalar multiplications required when multiplying a bunch of matrices.
Show how to write a dynamic program to calculate the optimal parentheses placement.
This is such a long example that it might be better to make it its own article.--&gt;

Matrix chain multiplication is a well-known example that demonstrates utility of dynamic programming. For example,  engineering applications often have to multiply a chain of matrices. It is not surprising to find matrices of large dimensions, for example 100×100. Therefore, our task is to multiply matrices {{tmath|A_1, A_2, .... A_n}}. As we know from basic linear algebra, matrix multiplication is not commutative, but is associative; and we can multiply only two matrices at a time. So, we can multiply this chain of matrices in many different ways, for example:

: {{math|((A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) × A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) × ... A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}}

: {{math|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×(((A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)× ... ) × A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

: {{math|(A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) × (A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; × ... A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

and so on. There are numerous ways to multiply this chain of matrices. They will all produce the same final result, however they will take more or less time to compute, based on which particular matrices are multiplied. If matrix A has dimensions m×n and matrix B has dimensions n×q, then matrix C=A×B will have dimensions m×q, and will require m*n*q scalar multiplications (using a simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm for purposes of illustration).

For example, let us multiply matrices A, B and C. Let us assume that their dimensions are m×n, n×p, and p×s, respectively. Matrix A×B×C will be of size m×s and can be calculated in two ways shown below:

# Ax(B×C)    This order of matrix multiplication will require nps + mns scalar multiplications.  
# (A×B)×C    This order of matrix multiplication will require mnp + mps scalar calculations.

Let us assume that m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to multiply the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. Obviously, the second way is faster, and we should multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.

Therefore, our conclusion is that the order of parenthesis matters, and that our task is to find the optimal order of parenthesis.

At this point, we have several choices, one of which is to design a dynamic programming algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The dynamic programming solution is presented below.

Let's call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j (i.e. A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; × .... × A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. i&lt;=j). We split the chain at some matrix k, such that i &lt;= k &lt; j, and try to find out which combination produces minimum m[i,j].

The formula is:

        '''if''' i = j, m[i,j]= 0
        '''if''' i &lt; j, m[i,j]= min over all possible values of k {{nowrap|(m[i,k]+m[k+1,j] + &lt;math&gt;p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j&lt;/math&gt;)}} 
where ''k'' ranges from ''i'' to ''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

*{{tmath|p_{{(}}i-1{{)}}}} is the row dimension of matrix i,
*{{tmath|p_k}} is the column dimension of matrix k,
*{{tmath|p_j}} is the column dimension of matrix j.

This formula can be coded as shown below, where input parameter "chain" is the chain of matrices, i.e. {{tmath|A_1, A_2, ... A_n}}:

  '''function''' OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain)
      n = length(chain)
      '''for''' i = 1, n
            m[i,i] = 0       ''//since it takes no calculations to multiply one matrix''
      '''for''' len = 2, n
         '''for''' i = 1, n - len + 1
            '''for''' j = i + 1, len -1
               m[i,j] = infinity         ''//so that the first calculation updates ''
               '''for''' k = i, j-1
                   {{nowrap|1=q = m[i, k] + m[k+1, j] + &lt;math&gt;p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j&lt;/math&gt;}}
                   '''if''' q &lt; m[i, j]     ''// the new order of parenthesis is better than what we had''
                          m[i, j] = q       ''//update''
                          s[i, j] = k       ''//record which k to split on, i.e. where to place the parenthesis''

So far, we have calculated values for all possible {{math|''m''[''i'', ''j'']}}, the minimum number of calculations to multiply a chain from matrix ''i'' to matrix ''j'', and we have recorded the corresponding "split point"{{math|''s''[''i'', ''j'']}}. For example, if we are multiplying chain {{math|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and it turns out that {{math|1=''m''[1, 3] = 100}} and {{math|1=''s''[1, 3] = 2}}, that means that the optimal placement of parenthesis for matrices 1 to 3 is {{tmath|(A_1\times A_2)\times A_3}} and to multiply those matrices will require 100 scalar calculation.

This algorithm will produce "tables" ''m''[, ] and ''s''[, ] that will have entries for all possible values of i and j. The final solution for the entire chain is m[1, n], with corresponding split at s[1, n]. Unraveling the solution will be recursive, starting from the top and continuing until we reach the base case, i.e. multiplication of single matrices.

Therefore, the next step is to actually split the chain, i.e. to place the parenthesis where they (optimally) belong. For this purpose we could use the following algorithm:

  '''function''' PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, j)
      '''if''' i = j
         print "A"i
      '''else'''
         print "("  PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, s[i, j])  PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, s[i, j] + 1, j) ")"

Of course, this algorithm is not useful for actual multiplication. This algorithm is just a user-friendly way to see what the result looks like.

To actually multiply the matrices using the proper splits, we need the following algorithm:
&lt;source lang="javascript" enclose="div"&gt;
   function MatrixChainMultiply(chain from 1 to n)         // returns the final matrix, i.e. A1×A2×... ×An
      OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain from 1 to n)  // this will produce s[ . ] and m[ . ] "tables"
      OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, chain from 1 to n)    // actually multiply

   function OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, j)   // returns the result of multiplying a chain of matrices from Ai to Aj in optimal way
      if i &lt; j
         // keep on splitting the chain and multiplying the matrices in left and right sides
         LeftSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, s[i, j])
         RightSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, s[i, j] + 1, j)
         return MatrixMultiply(LeftSide, RightSide) 
      else if i = j
         return Ai   // matrix at position i
      else 
         print "error, i &lt;= j must hold"

    function MatrixMultiply(A, B)    // function that multiplies two matrices
      if columns(A) = rows(B) 
         for i = 1, rows(A)
            for j = 1, columns(B)
               C[i, j] = 0
               for k = 1, columns(A)
                   C[i, j] = C[i, j] + A[i, k]*B[k, j] 
               return C 
      else 
          print "error, incompatible dimensions."
&lt;/source&gt;

== History ==
The term ''dynamic programming'' was originally used in the 1940s by [[Richard Bellman]] to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another.  By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Dreyfus. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050110161049/http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf "Richard Bellman on the birth of Dynamical Programming"].&lt;/ref&gt;  and the field was thereafter recognized by the [[IEEE]] as a [[systems analysis]] and [[engineering]] topic.  Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the [[Bellman equation]], a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] form.

Bellman explains the reasoning behind the term ''dynamic programming'' in his autobiography, ''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'' (1984, page 159). He explains:

:"I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Wilson]]. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities."

The word ''dynamic'' was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive.&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=S. R. |authorlink=Sean Eddy |title=What is Dynamic Programming? |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=22 |issue= 7|pages=909–910 |year=2004 |doi=10.1038/nbt0704-909 |pmid=15229554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''programming'' referred to the use of the method to find an optimal ''program'', in the sense of a military schedule for training or logistics.  This usage is the same as that in the phrases ''[[linear programming]]'' and ''mathematical programming'', a synonym for [[mathematical optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nocedal |first=J. |last2=Wright |first2=S. J. |title=Numerical Optimization |page=9 |publisher=Springer |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above explanation of the origin of the term is lacking. As Russell and Norvig in their book have written, referring to the above story: "''This cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.''”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=S. |last2=Norvig |first2=P. |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-13-207148-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is a comment in a speech by [http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award/2004-00-00t000000/harold-j-kushner Harold J. Kushner], where he remembers Bellman. Quoting Kushner as he speaks of Bellman: "''On the other hand, when I asked him the same question, he replied that he was trying to upstage Dantzig's linear programming by adding dynamic. Perhaps both motivations were true.''"

'''e-Administration''', or [[electronics|electronic]] administration, refers to any of a number of mechanisms which convert what in a traditional office are paper processes into electronic processes, with the goal being to create a [[paperless office]].  This is an ICT tool, with the goal being to improve productivity and performance.

e-Administration can encompass both intra-office and inter-office [[communication]] for any organization.

Its objective is to introduce total [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] leading to better [[e-Governance]] within any organization.  In [[Germany]], this initiative is especially targeted at [[government]] organizations, where public accountability is of special concern.  Similar processes are being developed in many [[United States|American]] [[corporations]] to aid compliance with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].

The implementation of any e-administration solution should be customer centric rather than organization centric, should remove dependence on specific individuals, and should introduce transparent systems of working.  Examples of e-administration include, online timesheets and expense account. These can be used to help reduce costs to an organization.

[[File:ElevatedPlusMaze.svg|thumb|Schematic drawing of an elevated plus maze.]]

The '''elevated plus maze''' (EPM) is a test measuring [[anxiety]] in laboratory animals that usually uses [[Animal testing on rodents|rodents]] as a [[Drug discovery#Screening and design|screening]] test for putative [[anxiolytic]] or [[anxiogenic]] compounds and as a general research tool in [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] anxiety research such as [[PTSD]] and [[Traumatic brain injury|TBI]].&lt;ref name="Ojo2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ojo |first=J |author2=Mouzon, B |title=Chronic Repetitive Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Results in Reduced Cerebral Blood Flow, Axonal Injury, Gliosis, and Increased T-Tau and Tau Oligomers. |journal=J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. |date=May 2016 |pmid=27251042 |doi=10.1093/jnen/nlw035 |volume=75 |pages=636–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is based on the test animal's aversion to open spaces and tendency to be [[thigmotaxis|thigmotaxic]]. In the EPM, this anxiety is expressed by the animal spending more time in the enclosed arms.

==Method==
[[Image:+maze.jpg|thumb|240px|An elevated plus maze (for mice)]]
The test uses an elevated, plus-shaped (+) apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms. The behavioral model is based on the general aversion of rodents to open spaces. This aversion leads to the behavior termed [[thigmotaxis]], a preference for remaining in enclosed spaces or close to the edges of a bounded space. In the EPM, this translates into the animals limiting their movement to the enclosed arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pellow, S., Chopin, P., File, S.E. and Briley, M.|title=Validation of open:closed arm entries in an elevated plus-maze as a measure of anxiety in the rat|journal=J.

Anxiety reduction is indicated in the plus-maze by an increase in the proportion of time spent in the open arms (time in open arms/total time in open or closed arms) and an increase in the proportion of entries into the open arms (entries into open arms/total entries into open or closed arms). The total number of arm entries and number of closed-arm entries are sometimes used as measures of general activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hogg S.A.|title=Review of the validity and variability of the elevated plus-maze as an animal model of anxiety|journal=Pharmacol.

==Criticism==
While EPM is the most commonly employed animal behavioral model of anxiety, there are several issues concerning the validity of the model. Classical clinical anxiolytics, such as [[benzodiazepines]] (e.g., [[Valium]]), do reduce measures of anxiety in EPM. However, more novel compounds, such as 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; agonists (e.g., [[Buspar]]) give mixed results. [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] and [[tricyclic antidepressants]], which are commonly employed in clinical settings to treat anxiety disorders, also do not lead to a stable anxiolytic effect on EPM.&lt;ref name="Carobrez"/&gt; This raises the possibility that EPM is a suitable model for testing [[GABA]]-related compounds, such as benzodiazepines or direct GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonists, but not for other drugs. Despite this, the model is commonly employed for screening putative anxiolytics and for general research into the brain mechanisms of anxiety,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Engin, E. |author2=Treit, D.|title=The effects of intra-cerebral drug infusions on animals' unconditioned fear reactions: A systematic review.|journal=Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.03.020|volume=32|pages=1399–1419}}&lt;/ref&gt; likely due to the ease of employment and the vast number of studies already in the literature.

== Variations ==
=== Elevated zero maze ===
[[File:Elevated Zero Maze.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Elevated zero maze (mouse can be seen in the top right)]]
The elevated zero maze (EZM) is an elevated circular runway with alternating open light areas and enclosed dark areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alline C|last2=Fogaca|first2=Manoela V|last3=Aguiar|first3=Daniele C|last4=Guimaraes|first4=Francisco S|title=Animal models of anxiety disorders and stress|journal=Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria|date=2013|volume=35|pages=101–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous nature of this apparatus eliminates the problem of the EPM in how to account for the animal's presence in the center area of the EPM. In the EPM test, animals may spend up to 30% of their time in the ambiguous central start area or return to it often, making it difficult to evaluate the biological significance of anxiety related behaviour. Animal will return to the central area because they are habituated to that area and associate it with being "safe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=KR|last2=Crawley|first2=JN|title=Methods of Behavior Analysis in Neuroscience|date=2009|publisher=CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Boca Raton (FL)|edition=2nd|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5221/|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Untreated rodents show a higher exploration of open areas in the EZM then in the EPM. This could indicate the EPM inhibits exploration, but the fact that rodents spent time in the central zone of the EPM needs to be taken into account. The EZM is more sensitive to changes then the EPM due to the baseline level in the EZM being lower than the EPM.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braun|first1=Amanda A|last2=Skelton|first2=Matthew R|last3=Vorhees|first3=Charles V|last4=Williams|first4=Michael Y|title=Comparison of the elevated plus and elevated zero mazes in treated and untreated male Sprague-Dawley rats: Effects of anxiolytic and anxiogenic agents|journal=Pharmacol Biochem Behav|date=2011|volume=97|issue=3|pages=406–415|doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2010.09.013|pmc=3006066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elevated T maze ===
The elevated T maze (ETM) has three arms in the shape of the letter "T". One arm is closed and perpendicular to the other two arms which are open. This test is designed to observe anxiety effects and how it affects learning. The rodent is placed on the enclosed arm and allowed to explore. The trial ends when the rodents sets all four paws in on the open arms. Rats are allowed multiple trials until they learn to stay in the open arm for 300 seconds. This is a measurement of [[Long-term potentiation#Inhibitory avoidance|inhibitory avoidance]].Depending on what the rodents were treated with during the training sessions, they would learn at different rates giving information on how the brain stores memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asth|first1=Laila|last2=Rachetti|first2=Vanessa|last3=Gavioli|first3=Elaine C|last4=Andre|first4=Eunice|last5=Lobao-Soares|first5=Bruno|title=The elevated T-maze task as an animal model to simultaneously investigate the effects of drugs on long-term memory and anxiety in mice|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=2012|volume=87|pages=526–533|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2012.02.008|pmid=22394406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test can be used to assess long term memory. When a rodent has been sufficiently trained, researchers will test the rodent again after a week to observe if the rodent still remembers to stay in the enclosed arm.

=== Plus-maze discriminative avoidance test ===
[[File:Plus-Maze Discriminative Avoidance Task Apparatus.tiff|thumb|240px|Schematic representation of the apparatus used for the plus-maze discriminative avoidance test.]]
Like the standard EPM, the apparatus used in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance test (PMDAT) has four arms. This test has been used to investigate interactions between aversive memory and anxiety responses in rodents. The apparatus has two open arms opposite to two enclosed arms. In this test, one of the enclosed arms is paired with aversive stimuli (e.g. bright light, loud white noise). During training, animals are placed in the apparatus facing the intercept between the open arms. Each time the animal enters the aversive enclosed arm, the aversive stimulus is presented until the animal leaves the arm. Upon a second exposure to the maze (e.g. 24 h later) the aversive stimuli is no longer presented. Retention of the aversive memory is assessed based on the relative time spent in the non-aversive arm compared to the previously aversive arm and anxiety behavior is calculated based on the time spent in the open arms during the training session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leão|first1=Anderson|last2=Medeiros|first2=Andre|last3=Apolinario|first3=Genedy|last4=Cabral|first4=Alicia|last5=Ribeiro|first5=Alessandra|last6=Barbosa|first6=Flavio|last7=Silva|first7=Regina|title=Hippocampal-dependent memory in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task: The role of spatial cues and CA1 activity|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|date=2016|volume=304|pages=24–33|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.02.012|pmid=26876135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multivariate Concentric Square Field test (MCSF-test) ===
The MCSF-test is a behaviour model used to study risk assessment, risk taking, anxiety and security seeking behaviour. It has a completely different design compared to the t-maze, but instead of using a battery of different behaviour models this test can be used to measure a variety of dependent and independent variables. In this context "multivariate" is defined as that the subject has a free choice of different environments contained in the same apparatus and session.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyerson|first=Bengt J.|last2=Augustsson|first2=Hanna|last3=Berg|first3=Marita|last4=Roman|first4=Erika|title=The Concentric Square Field: A multivariate test arena for analysis of explorative strategies|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166432805004614|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=168|issue=1|pages=100–113|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2005.10.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MCSF consists of different areas associated with risk-taking and shelter-seeking. The subject can therefore choose between locations with different qualities regarding open areas, illuminations, shelter and exploratory challenges. The arena consists of a dark room enclosed by walls and ceiling, dimly illuminated corridors, open area with moderate illumination, a hole-board area which requires a certain physical effort to reach and an elevated bridge with high illumination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Elevated plus maze for humans using virtual reality ===
Using a combination of virtual reality and real-world elements, the EPM has been transferred to usage with humans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biedermann|first=Sarah V.|last2=Biedermann|first2=Daniel G.|last3=Wenzlaff|first3=Frederike|last4=Kurjak|first4=Tim|last5=Nouri|first5=Sawis|last6=Auer|first6=Matthias K.|last7=Wiedemann|first7=Klaus|last8=Briken|first8=Peer|last9=Fuss|first9=Johannes|date=2017-12-21|title=An elevated plus-maze in mixed reality for studying human anxiety-related behavior|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-017-0463-6|journal=BMC Biology|volume=15|pages=125|doi=10.1186/s12915-017-0463-6|issn=1741-7007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants who partook in the study were placed on a 3.5 by 3.5 meters wide and 0.3m high wooden cross while wearing a virtual reality headset. In the virtual environment, the real cross was matched in exact dimension and orientation. Open arms were above a 50-meter drop over open water, while the closed arms were surrounded by a stable and firm surface around the platform.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similar to the observed rodent behavior on an EPM, participants reported higher anxiety on open arms while also avoiding those more. Participants with high anxiety also exhibited higher avoidance of open arms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Environmental policy''' is the commitment of an organization or government to the laws, regulations, and other policy mechanisms concerning [[environmental issue]]s. These issues generally include [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution]], [[waste management]], [[ecosystem management]], maintenance of [[biodiversity]], the protection of [[natural resource]]s, [[wildlife]] and [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Global-Environmental-Policy-Concepts-Principles-ebook/dp/B005H6M86Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice]. {{ISBN|978-1439847664}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning environmental policy, the importance of implementation of an eco-energy-oriented policy at a global level to address the issues of global warming and climate changes should be accentuated.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dražan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Energy, Vol. 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2-11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005&lt;/ref&gt;
Policies concerning energy or regulation of [[toxic substances]] including [[pesticide]]s and many types of [[industrial waste]] are part of the topic of environmental policy. This policy can be deliberately taken to direct and oversee human activities and thereby prevent harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical environment]] and natural resources, as well as to make sure that changes in the environment do not have harmful effects on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Definition==
It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[policy]]. Environment refers to the physical ecosystems, but can also take into consideration the social dimension (quality of life, health) and an economic dimension (resource management, biodiversity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Environmental issues]] generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution]], [[waste management]], [[ecosystem]] management, [[biodiversity]] protection, the protection of [[natural resource]]s, [[wildlife]] and [[endangered species]], and the preservation of these natural resources for future generations. Relatively recently, environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;A major article outlining and analyzing the history of environmental communication policy within the European Union has recently come out in ''The Information Society'', a journal based in the United States.  See Mathur, Piyush.  "Environmental Communication in the Information Society:  The Blueprint from Europe," ''The Information Society:  An International Journal'', 25: 2, March 2009 , pp. 119–38.  Accessible:  http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a909229825~db=all~jumptype=rss&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The rationale for governmental involvement in the environment is [[market failure]] in the form of forces beyond the control of one person, including the [[free rider problem]] and the [[tragedy of the commons]]. An example of an externality is when a factory produces waste [[water pollution|pollution]] which may be dumped into a river, ultimately contaminating water. The cost of such action is paid by society-at-large, when they must clean the water before drinking it and is external to the costs of the factory. The free rider problem is when the private marginal cost of taking action to protect the environment is greater than the private marginal benefit, but the social marginal cost is less than the social marginal benefit. The tragedy of the commons is the problem that, because no one person owns the commons, each individual has an incentive to utilize common resources as much as possible. Without governmental involvement, the commons is overused.  Examples of tragedies of the commons are [[overfishing]] and [[overgrazing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Instruments, problems, and issues==
Environmental policy instruments are tools used by governments to implement their environmental policies. Governments may use a number of different types of instruments. For example, economic incentives and [[market-based instruments]] such as taxes and tax exemptions, tradable permits, and fees can be very effective to encourage compliance with environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34295_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate companies who engage in efficient environmental management and are transparent about their environmental data and reporting benefit from improved business performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/environmental-compliance-corporate-performance-can-you-have-it-all/|title=Environmental Compliance &amp; Corporate Performance - Can You Have It All?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.emisoft.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilateral agreements between the government and private firms and commitments made by firms independent of government requirement are examples of voluntary environmental measures. Another instrument is the implementation of greener public purchasing programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347 en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_ 1,00.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610225031/http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347 |date=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instruments are sometimes combined in a policy mix to address a certain environmental problem. Since environmental issues have many aspects, several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore, a combination of different policies may give firms greater flexibility in policy compliance and reduce uncertainty as to the cost of such compliance.

Government policies must be carefully formulated so that the individual measures do not undermine one another, or create a rigid and cost-ineffective framework. Overlapping policies result in unnecessary administrative costs, increasing the cost of implementation.&lt;ref&gt;"Instrument Mixes for Environmental Policy" (Paris: OECD Publications, 2007) 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; To help governments realize their policy goals, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Environment Directorate collects data on the efficiency and consequences of environmental policies implemented by the national governments.&lt;ref&gt;“Environmental Policies and Instruments,” http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The website, www.economicinstruments.com, [http://www.economicinstruments.com] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economicinstruments.com |title=Economic Instruments |publisher=Economic Instruments |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides database detailing countries' experiences with their environmental policies. The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]], through [[UNECE Environmental Performance Reviews]], evaluates progress made by its member countries in improving their environmental policies.

The current reliance on a market-based framework is controversial, however, and many environmentalists contend that a more radical, overarching approach is needed than a set of specific initiatives, to deal with [[climate change]]. For example, energy efficiency measures may actually increase energy consumption in the absence of a cap on fossil fuel use, as people might drive more fuel-efficient cars. Thus, Aubrey Meyer calls for a 'framework-based market' of [[contraction and convergence]]. The [[Cap and Share]] and the Sky Trust are proposals based on the idea.

Environmental impact assessments (EIA) are conducted to compare impacts of various policy alternatives. Moreover, it is assumed that policymakers make rational decisions based on the merits of the project. Eccleston and March argue that although policymakers normally have access to reasonably accurate information, political and economic factors often lead to environmentally destructive decisions in the long run.

The decision-making theory casts doubt on this premise. Irrational decisions are reached based on unconscious biases, illogical assumptions, and the desire to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston C. and Doub P., Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments:  A Users Guide to Best Professional Practices, CRC Press Inc., 300 pages (publication date: March 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles H. Eccleston|Eccleston]] identifies and describes four of the most critical environmental policy issues facing humanity: [[water scarcity]], [[food scarcity]], [[climate change]], and the [[Income and fertility|population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston C. and March F., Global Environmental Policy: Principles, Concepts And Practice, CRC Press Inc. 412 pages (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/the-population-paradox&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and innovation policy==
Synergic to the environmental policy is the [[environmental research]] and [[innovation policy]]. An example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Europe is particularly active in this field, via a set of strategies, actions and programmes to promote more and better research and innovation for building a resource-efficient, climate resilient society and thriving economy in sync with its natural environment. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1960s marked the beginning of modern environmental policy making. Although mainstream America remained oblivious to environmental concerns, the stage had been set for change by the publication of Rachel Carson's New York Times bestseller Silent Spring in 1962. Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, then a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. Administrator Ruckelshaus was confirmed by the Senate on December 2, 1970, which is the traditional date used as the birth of the agency. Five months earlier, in July 1970, President Nixon had signed Reorganization Plan No. 3 calling for the establishment of EPA in July 1970. At the time, Environmental Policy was a bipartisan issue and the efforts of the [[United States of America]] helped spark countries around the world to create environmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://search.proquest.com/docview/207664697/ Managing the Environment, Managing Ourselves: A History of American Environmental Policy]”&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, legislation was passed to regulate pollutants that go into the air, water tables, and solid waste disposal. President Nixon signed the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] in 1970 which set the USA as one of the world leaders in environmental conservation.

In the European Union, the very first Environmental Action Programmed was adopted by national government representatives in July 1973 during the first meeting of the Council of Environmental Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, C. and Liefferink, D. (2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e).  Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an increasingly dense network of legislation has developed, which now extends to all areas of [[environmental protection]] including air pollution control, water protection and waste policy but also nature conservation and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks. [[EU environmental policy]] has thus become a core area of European politics.

Overall organizations are becoming more aware of their environmental risks and performance requirements. In line with the [[ISO 14001]] standard they are developing environmental policies suitable for their organization.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Global-Environmental-Policy-Concepts-Principles-ebook/dp/B005H6M86Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice]. Chapter 7. {{ISBN|978-1439847664}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement outlines environmental performance of the organization as well as its environmental objectives. Written by top management of the organization they document a commitment to continuous improvement and complying with legal and other requirements, such as the environmental policy objectives set by their governments.

== Environmental policy integration ==

The concept of '''environmental policy integration''' (EPI) refers to the process of integrating environmental objectives into non-environmental policy areas, such as energy, agriculture and transport, rather than leaving them to be pursued solely through purely environmental policy practices. This is oftentimes particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=December 2, 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=232–244|ssrn=1970698|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPI is widely recognised as one of the key elements of sustainable development. More recently, the notion of ‘climate policy integration’, also denoted as ‘mainstreaming’, has been applied to indicate the integration of climate considerations (both mitigation and adaptation) into the normal (often economically focused) activity of government.&lt;ref&gt;Taskforce on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental policy studies==
Given the growing need for trained environmental practitioners, [[graduate school]]s throughout the world offer specialized [[professional degree]]s in environmental policy studies. While there is not a standard [[curriculum]], students typically take classes in [[policy analysis]], [[environmental science]], [[environmental law]] and [[environmental politics|politics]], [[ecology]], [[energy]], and [[natural resource management]]. Graduates of these programs are employed by [[government]]s, [[international organizations]], [[private sector]], [[think tanks]], [[universities]], and so on.

Due to the lack of standard [[nomenclature]], institutions use varying designations to refer to academic degrees they award. However, the degrees typically fall in one of four broad categories: [[master of arts]], [[master of science]], [[master of public administration]], and [[PhD]] in environmental policy. Sometimes, more specific names are used to reflect the focus of the academic program. For example, the [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey]] awards master of arts in international environmental policy (MAIEP) to emphasize the international orientation of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Monterey Institute of International Studies|url=http://www.miis.edu/academics/programs/environmentalpolicy |title=MA in International Environmental Policy |publisher=Miis.edu |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eosinophils''', sometimes called '''eosinophiles''' or, less commonly, '''acidophils''', are a variety of [[white blood cell]]s and one of the [[immune system]] components responsible for combating multicellular [[parasite]]s and certain [[infection]]s in [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/c/eosinophilic-disorders/conditions/eosinophil|title=What is an Eosinophil? {{!}} Definition &amp; Function {{!}} CCED|website=www.cincinnatichildrens.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[mast cell]]s and [[basophils]], they also control mechanisms associated with [[allergy]] and [[asthma]].  They are [[granulocyte]]s that develop during [[hematopoiesis]] in the [[bone marrow]] before migrating into blood, after which they are terminally differentiated and do not multiply.&lt;ref name="Uhm" /&gt;

These [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are [[eosinophilic]] or "[[acid]]-loving" due to their large acidophilic cytoplasmic granules, which show their affinity for acids by their affinity to coal tar dyes:  Normally [[transparency (optics)|transparent]], it is this affinity that causes them to appear brick-red after [[staining]] with [[eosin]], a red [[dye]], using the [[Romanowsky stain|Romanowsky method]].&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenberg HF, Phipps S, Foster PS | title = Eosinophil trafficking in allergy and asthma | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 119 | issue = 6 | pages = 1303–10; quiz 1311–2 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17481712 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2007.03.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The staining is concentrated in small [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] within the cellular [[cytoplasm]], which contain many chemical mediators, such as [[eosinophil peroxidase]], [[ribonuclease]] (RNase), [[deoxyribonuclease]]s (DNase), [[lipase]], [[plasminogen]], and [[major basic protein]]. These mediators are released by a process called [[degranulation]] following activation of the eosinophil, and are [[toxin|toxic]] to both parasite and host tissues.

In normal individuals, eosinophils make up about 1–3% of white blood cells, and are about 12–17 [[micrometre]]s in size with bilobed nuclei.&lt;ref name="Uhm"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uhm TG, Kim BS, Chung IY | title = Eosinophil development, regulation of eosinophil-specific genes, and role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of asthma | journal = Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Research | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 68–79 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22379601 | doi = 10.4168/aair.2012.4.2.68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Young | first = Barbara | last2 = Lowe | first2 = joseph o'connell | last3 = Stevens | first3 = Alan | last4 = Heath | first4 = John W. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Wheater's Functional Histology | publisher = Elsevier Limited | year = 2006 | edition = 5th | isbn = 0-443-06850-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are released into the bloodstream as neutrophils are, eosinophils reside in tissue.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; They are found in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] and the junction between the [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] and medulla of the [[thymus]], and, in the lower [[gastrointestinal]] tract, [[ovary]], [[uterus]], [[spleen]], and [[lymph nodes]], but not in the [[lung]], [[skin]], [[esophagus]], or some other internal organs {{Vague|date=September 2009}} under normal conditions.

==Development==
[[File:Illu blood cell lineage.jpg|thumb|Blood cell lineage]]
[[TH2]] and [[ILC2]] cells both express the transcription factor [[GATA-3]] which promotes the production of TH2 cytokines, including the interleukins (ILs).&lt;ref name="Lambrecht" /&gt;  [[Interleukin 5|IL-5]] controls the development of eosinophils in the bone marrow, as they differentiate from myeloid precursor cells.&lt;ref name="Lambrecht" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalf D, Begley CG, Nicola NA, Johnson GR | title = Quantitative responsiveness of murine hemopoietic populations in vitro and in vivo to recombinant multi-CSF (IL-3) | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–95 | date = March 1987 | pmid = 3493174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalf D, Burgess AW, Johnson GR, Nicola NA, Nice EC, DeLamarter J, Thatcher DR, Mermod JJ | title = In vitro actions on hemopoietic cells of recombinant murine GM-CSF purified after production in Escherichia coli: comparison with purified native GM-CSF | journal = Journal of Cellular Physiology | volume = 128 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–31 | date = September 1986 | pmid = 3528176 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.1041280311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamaguchi Y, Suda T, Suda J, Eguchi M, Miura Y, Harada N, Tominaga A, Takatsu K | title = Purified interleukin 5 supports the terminal differentiation and proliferation of murine eosinophilic precursors | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 167 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–56 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 3257253 | pmc = 2188821 | doi = 10.1084/jem.167.1.43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their lineage fate is determined by transcription factors, including GATA and C/EBP.&lt;ref name="Uhm" /&gt; Eosinophils produce and store many secondary granule proteins prior to their exit from the bone marrow. After maturation, eosinophils circulate in blood and migrate to inflammatory sites in tissues, or to sites of [[helminth]] infection in response to [[chemokines]] like [[CCL11]] (eotaxin-1), CCL24 (eotaxin-2), CCL5 ([[RANTES]]), [[5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid|5-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]], and certain [[leukotrienes]] like leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and MCP1/4. Interleukin-13, another TH2 cytokine, primes eosinophilic exit from the bone marrow by lining vessel walls with adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.&lt;ref name="Lambrecht" /&gt;
When eosinophils are activated, they undergo cytolysis, where the breaking of the cell releases eosinophilic granules found in extracellular DNA traps.&lt;ref name="Lambrecht" /&gt; High concentrations of these DNA traps are known to cause cellular damage, as the granules they contain are responsible for the ligand-induced secretion of eosinophilic toxins which cause structural damage.&lt;ref name="Lambrecht" /&gt; There is evidence to suggest that eosinophil granule protein expression is regulated by the non-coding RNA [[EGOT (gene)|EGOT]].&lt;ref name="pmid17351112"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner LA, Christensen CJ, Dunn DM, Spangrude GJ, Georgelas A, Kelley L, Esplin MS, Weiss RB, Gleich GJ | title = EGO, a novel, noncoding RNA gene, regulates eosinophil granule protein transcript expression | journal = Blood | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 5191–8 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17351112 | pmc = 1890841 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-06-027987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Following activation, eosinophils effector functions include production of the following:
* Cationic granule proteins and their release by [[degranulation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trulson A, Byström J, Engström A, Larsson R, Venge P | title = The functional heterogeneity of eosinophil cationic protein is determined by a gene polymorphism and post-translational modifications | journal = Clinical and Experimental Allergy | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 208–18 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17250693 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02644.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hogan&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hogan SP, Rosenberg HF, Moqbel R, Phipps S, Foster PS, Lacy P, Kay AB, Rothenberg ME | title = Eosinophils: biological properties and role in health and disease | journal = Clinical and Experimental Allergy | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 709–50 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18384431 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2008.02958.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lacy&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lacy P | title = The role of Rho GTPases and SNAREs in mediator release from granulocytes | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 358–76 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 15951020 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reactive oxygen species]] such as [[hypobromite]], [[superoxide]], and [[peroxide]] (hypobromous acid, which is preferentially produced by [[eosinophil peroxidase]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saito K, Nagata M, Kikuchi I, Sakamoto Y | title = Leukotriene D4 and eosinophil transendothelial migration, superoxide generation, and degranulation via beta2 integrin | journal = Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 594–600 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15609771 | doi = 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)61269-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lipid mediators like the [[eicosanoid]]s from the [[leukotriene]] (e.g., [[leukotriene C4|LTC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[leukotriene D4|LTD&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[leukotriene E4|LTE&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[prostaglandin]] (e.g., [[Prostaglandin E2|PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) families&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bandeira-Melo C, Bozza PT, Weller PF | title = The cellular biology of eosinophil eicosanoid formation and function | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 109 | issue = 3 | pages = 393–400 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11897981 | doi = 10.1067/mai.2002.121529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enzymes, such as [[elastase]]
* [[Growth factors]] such as [[TGF beta]], [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]], and [[PDGF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kato Y, Fujisawa T, Nishimori H, Katsumata H, Atsuta J, Iguchi K, Kamiya H | title = Leukotriene D4 induces production of transforming growth factor-beta1 by eosinophils | journal = International Archives of Allergy and Immunology | volume = 137 Suppl 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–20 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15947480 | doi = 10.1159/000085427 | series = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horiuchi T, Weller PF | title = Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by human eosinophils: upregulation by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-5 | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–7 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9224211 | doi = 10.1165/ajrcmb.17.1.2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cytokines]] such as [[interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[interleukin 2|IL-2]], [[interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[interleukin 5|IL-5]], [[interleukin 6|IL-6]], [[interleukin 8|IL-8]], [[interleukin 13|IL-13]], and [[TNF alpha]]&lt;ref name="hogan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=rothenberg&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothenberg ME, Hogan SP | title = The eosinophil | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–74 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16551246 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.24.021605.090720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also eosinophils that play a role in fighting viral infections, which is evident from the abundance of [[RNase]]s they contain within their granules, and in [[fibrin]] removal during [[inflammation]]. Eosinophils, along with [[basophils]] and [[mast cells]], are important mediators of [[Allergy|allergic response]]s and [[asthma]] [[pathogenesis]] and are associated with disease severity. They also fight [[helminth]] (worm) colonization and may be slightly elevated in the presence of certain parasites. Eosinophils are also involved in many other biological processes, including postpubertal [[mammary gland]] development, [[Estrous cycle|oestrus cycling]], [[allograft]] rejection and [[neoplasia]].&lt;ref name=rothenberg/&gt; They have also been implicated in [[antigen presentation]] to [[T cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shi HZ | title = Eosinophils function as antigen-presenting cells | journal = Journal of Leukocyte Biology | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 520–7 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15218055 | doi = 10.1189/jlb.0404228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eosinophils are responsible for tissue damage and inflammation in many diseases, including asthma.&lt;ref name="Lambrecht" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; High levels of interleukin-5 has been observed to up regulate the expression of adhesion molecules, which then facilitate the adhesion of eosinophils to endothelial cells, thereby causing inflammation and tissue damage.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt;

An accumulation of eosinophils in the [[nasal mucosa]] is considered a major diagnostic criterion for [[allergic rhinitis]] (nasal allergies).

==Granule proteins==
Following activation by an immune stimulus, eosinophils degranulate to release an array of cytotoxic granule cationic proteins that are capable of inducing tissue damage and dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gleich GJ, Adolphson CR | title = The eosinophilic leukocyte: structure and function | journal = Advances in Immunology | volume = 39 | issue =  | pages = 177–253 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3538819 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2776(08)60351-X | isbn = 9780120224395 | series = Advances in Immunology }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

==Clinical significance==
===Eosinophilia===
{{Main|Eosinophilia}}
An increase in eosinophils, i.e., the presence of more than 500 eosinophils/microlitre of blood is called an [[eosinophilia]], and is typically seen in people with a parasitic infestation of the [[intestine]]s; [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] and [[connective tissue diseases|collagen vascular disease]] (such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]]) and [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]; [[malignant]] diseases such as [[eosinophilic leukemia]], [[clonal hypereosinophilia]], and [[Hodgkin's disease]]; [[lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia]]; extensive [[skin]] diseases (such as exfoliative [[dermatitis]]); [[Addison's disease]] and other causes of low [[corticosteroid]] production (corticosteroids suppress blood eosinophil levels); [[reflux esophagitis]] (in which eosinophils will be found in the squamous epithelium of the esophagus) and [[eosinophilic esophagitis]]; and with the use of certain [[medication|drugs]] such as [[penicillin]]. But, perhaps the most common cause for eosinophilia is an allergic condition such as asthma.  In 1989, contaminated [[L-tryptophan]] supplements caused a deadly form of eosinophilia known as [[eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome]], which was reminiscent of the [[Toxic Oil Syndrome]] in Spain in 1981.

[[File:Reference ranges for blood tests - white blood cells.png|thumb|500px|center|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]] of white blood cells, comparing eosinophil granulocyte amount (shown in light red) with other cells]]

Eosinophils play an important role in asthma as the number of accumulated eosinophils corresponds to the severity of asthmatic reaction.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; Eosinophilia in mice models are shown to be associated with high interleukin-5 levels.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; Furthermore,  mucosal bronchial biopsies conducted on patients with diseases such as asthma have been found to have higher levels of interleukin-5 leading to higher levels of eosinophils.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; The infiltration of eosinophils at these high concentrations causes an inflammatory reaction.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; This ultimately leads to airway remodelling and difficulty of breathing.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt;

Eosinophils can also cause tissue damage in the lungs of asthmatic patients.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; High concentrations of eosinophil major basic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin that approach cytotoxic levels are observed at degranulation sites in the lungs as well as in the asthmatic sputum.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt;

===Treatment===
Treatments used to combat autoimmune diseases and conditions caused by eosinophils include:
*[[corticosteroids]] – promote [[apoptosis]]. Numbers of eosinophils in blood are rapidly reduced
*[[monoclonal antibody therapy]] – e.g., [[mepolizumab]] or [[reslizumab]] against [[Interleukin-5|IL-5]], prevents eosinophilopoiesis

== Animal studies ==
Within the fat ([[Adipose tissue|adipose]]) tissue of [[CCR2]] deficient [[Mouse|mice]], there is an increased number of eosinophils, greater alternative [[macrophage]] activation, and a propensity towards type 2 [[cytokine]] expression. Furthermore, this effect was exaggerated when the mice became [[Obesity|obese]] from a high fat diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolus WR, Gutierrez DA, Kennedy AJ, Anderson-Baucum EK, Hasty AH | title = CCR2 deficiency leads to increased eosinophils, alternative macrophage activation, and type 2 cytokine expression in adipose tissue | journal = Journal of Leukocyte Biology | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | pages = 467–77 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 25934927 | pmc = 4763864 | doi = 10.1189/jlb.3HI0115-018R | url = http://www.jleukbio.org/content/98/4/467.long | access-date = 2016-09-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170509015901/http://www.jleukbio.org/content/98/4/467.long | archive-date = 2017-05-09 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Garfield was born in 1925 in New York City as Eugene Eli Garfinkle,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; and was raised in a Lithuanian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deeds and Dreams of Eugene Garfield|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/chemicalintelligencerp26y1999.pdf|work=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;-Italian [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name=his-bio&gt;{{cite book|title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[University of Colorado]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]] before getting a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[chemistry]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=infoplease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/eugenegarfield.html|title=Eugene Garfield Biography|website=infoplease.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timeshigher&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302142809/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/citation-analytics-pioneer-eugene-garfield-dies-aged-91|archivedate=2017-03-02|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/citation-analytics-pioneer-eugene-garfield-dies-aged-91|website=[[Times Higher Education]]|first=John|last=Elmes|year=2017|title=Citation analytics pioneer Eugene Garfield dies, aged 91|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield also received a degree in Library Science from Columbia University in 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wouters|first=Paul|date=2017-03-23|title=Eugene Garfield (1925-2017)|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7646/full/543492a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7646|pages=492–492|doi=10.1038/543492a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Web on Knowledge|last=Cronin|first=Blaise|publisher=ASIS|year=2000|isbn=1-57387-099-4|location=Medford, NJ|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to do his [[PhD]] in the Department of [[Linguistics]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], which he completed in 1961 for developing an [[algorithm]] for translating [[chemical nomenclature]] into [[chemical formula]]s.&lt;ref name=garfieldphd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Eugene Eli|last=Garfield |title=

==Career and research==
Garfield founded the [[Institute for Scientific Information|Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)]], which was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt; ISI formed a major part of the science division of Thomson Reuters. In October 2016 Thomson Reuters completed the sale of its intellectual property and science division; it is now known as [[Clarivate Analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarivate.com/news/ip-and-science-launched-as-independent-company/|title=Acquisition of the Thomson Reuters Intellectual Property and Science Business by Onex and Baring Asia Completed|website=clarivate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield is responsible for many innovative bibliographic products, including ''[[Current Contents]]'', the ''[[Science Citation Index]]'' (SCI), and other citation databases, the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', and ''Index Chemicus''. He is the founding editor and publisher of ''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'', a news magazine for life scientists. In 2003, the [[University of South Florida]] School of Information was honored to have him as lecturer for the [[Alice G. Smith Lecture]]. In 2007, he launched [[Histcite|HistCite]], a bibliometric analysis and visualization software package.

Following ideas inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s highly cited 1945 article ''[[As We May Think]]'', Garfield undertook the development of a comprehensive [[citation index]] showing the propagation of scientific thinking; he started the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] in 1955 (it was sold to the Thomson Corporation in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Thomson Corporation acquired ISI | journal = [[Online (magazine)|Online]] | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12394745.html |date = July 1992 | accessdate = 2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  According to Garfield, "the citation index ... may help a historian to measure the influence of an article — that is, its 'impact factor'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garfield E |title=Citation indexes for science: A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=Science |volume=122 |pages=108–11 |year=1955 |doi=10.1126/science.122.3159.108 |pmid=14385826}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of the ''Science Citation Index'' made it possible to calculate [[impact factor]],&lt;ref name="pmid16391221"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garfield E |title=The history and meaning of the journal impact factor |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=1 |pages=90–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16391221 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.1.90}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ostensibly measures the importance of scientific journals.  It led to the unexpected discovery that a few journals like ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' were core for all of [[hard science]].  The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Buranyi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buranyi|first1=Stephen|title=Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science|accessdate=15 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodall|first1=Amanda|last2=Oswald|first2=Andrew|title=Do the social sciences need a shake-up?|work=THE World University Rankings|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/do-the-social-sciences-need-a-shake-up/2016165.article|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masic|first1=Izet|title=The Most Influential Scientist in the Development of Medical informatics (17): Eugene Garfield|journal=Acta Informatica Medica|date=2017|volume=25|issue=2|pages=145|doi=10.5455/aim.2017.25.145-145|pmc=5544436|pmid=28883683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His entrepreneurial flair in having turned what was, at least at the time, an obscure and specialist metric into a highly profitable business has been noted.&lt;ref name=annurev/&gt;

Garfield's work led to the development of several [[information retrieval]] algorithms, like the [[HITS algorithm]] and [[PageRank]]. Both use the structured citation between websites through hyperlinks.  [[Google]] co-founders [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] acknowledged Gene in their development of PageRank, the algorithm that powers their company's search engine.&lt;ref name=annurev&gt;{{cite web|url=https://annualreviewsnews.org/2017/02/27/eugene-garfield-1925-2017/|title=Eugene Garfield – 1925-2017 – a life of impact|website=annualreviewsnews.org|first=Richard|last=Gallagher|year=2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228172321/https://annualreviewsnews.org/2017/02/27/eugene-garfield-1925-2017/|archivedate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Garfield was awarded the [[John Price Wetherill Medal]] in 1984&lt;ref name="OralHistory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiliams |first1= Robert V.|title=Eugene Garfield, Transcript of an Interview Conducted by Robert V. Williams at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 29 July 1997 |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/oralhistorybywilliams.pdf |place=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] |date= July 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard J.

Bolte Sr. Award for Supporting Industries|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/richard-j-bolte-sr-award-for-supporting-industries|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Library and Information Science Education]] has a fund for doctoral research through an award named after Garfield.

==Criticism==
Writing in ''Physiology News'', No. 69, Winter 2007, David Colquhoun of the Department of Pharmacology, University College London, described the "impact factor," a method for comparing scholarly journals, as "the invention of Eugene Garfield, a man who has done enormous harm to true science." Colquhoun ridiculed C. Hoeffel's assertion that Garfield's impact factor "has the advantage of already being in existence and is therefore a good technique for scientific evaluation" by saying, "you can't get much dumber than that. It is a 'good technique' because it is already in existence? There is something better. Read the papers."

==Personal life==
Garfield is survived by a wife, three sons, a daughter, a step-daughter, two granddaughters, and two great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webofstories.com/people/eugene.garfield|title= Eugene Garfield tells his life story (video)|website=webofstories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7700">The '''European Parliamentary Technology Assessment''' (EPTA) is a network of [[technology assessment]] (TA) institutions specialising in advising parliamentary bodies in Europe.

[[Image:epta.jpg|thumb|EPTA-Logo]]

== Objectives ==

The EPTA partners advise parliaments on the possible social, economic and environmental impact of new sciences and technologies. The common aim is to provide impartial and high quality analysis and reports of developments in issues such as for example [[bioethics]] and [[biotechnology]], [[public health]], environment and energy, [[information and communication technologies|ICTs]], and R&amp;D policy. Such work is seen as an aid to the democratic control of scientific and technological innovations, and was pioneered in the 1970s by the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) of the [[US Congress]]. EPTA aims to advance the establishment of [[technology assessment]] (TA) as an integral part of policy formation in parliamentary decision-making processes in Europe, and to strengthen the links between TA units in Europe.

== History and Organisation ==

The EPTA network was formally established in 1990, on a recommendation by the UK’s parliamentary TA office – [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]], under the patronage of the President of the [[European Parliament]], Mr [[Enrique Baron Crespo]]. The network has a light structure, guided by the EPTA ''Council'' and by meetings of the ''Directors'' of the EPTA partner organisations. The EPTA Council is the steering committee of the EPTA network, and consists of Members of Parliament or representatives of the advisory boards for the respective EPTA organisation. The Council decides on organisational matters such as co-operation within the network and the status of members and associates. The ''Presidency'' of EPTA rotates among full members each year. The tasks of the EPTA member organisation holding the presidency are to coordinate the EPTA network activities and to host the annual EPTA conference, Council meeting and Directors' meeting.

== Members ==

Parliamentary TA is institutionalised in different ways, ranging from permanent parliamentary committees for TA; separate TA units as part of the parliamentary administration; to independent institutions with a mandate to serve as a permanent consulting institution for the parliament. The members of the EPTA network are European organisations, which carry out TA studies on behalf of parliaments. Full membership can be obtained by a unit that operates in Europe, is devoted to TA or related activities, serves a (supra-national, national or regional) parliament, has its own budget and secretariat and has an active work programme including publications on issues with a scientific and technological component. Associate membership can be granted to other TA units that have a TA programme and the resources to realise it, but that do not fulfil other criteria for full membership. Associates are involved in all EPTA activities but are not represented in the EPTA Council. Further, other units interested in the work of EPTA can act as observers.

There are currently '''12 full members''':
* Scientific and Technological Options Assessment ([[STOA]]), European Parliament&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.europarl.europa.eu STOA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature''' ('''EDGES''') is an experiment and radio telescope located in a [[radio quiet zone]] at the [[Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory]] in Western Australia. It is a collaboration between [[Arizona State University]] and [[Haystack Observatory]], with infrastructure provided by [[CSIRO]].&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; EoR stands for [[epoch of reionization]], a time in [[cosmic history]] when neutral atomic hydrogen gas became ionised due to ultraviolet light from the first stars.

== Low-band instruments ==
The experiment has two low-band instruments, each of which has a dipole antenna pointed to the [[zenith]] and observing a single polarisation.&lt;ref name="Nature_Mar18" /&gt; The antenna is around {{convert|2|x|1|m|ft}} in size, sat on a {{convert|30|x|30|m|ft}} ground shield. It is coupled with a radio receiver, with a 100m cable run to a digital spectrometer.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; The instruments operate at {{convert|50|–|100|MHz|m|abbr=on}}, and are separated by 150m. Observations started in August 2015.&lt;ref name="Nature_Mar18" /&gt;

=== 78 MHz absorption profile ===
In March 2018 the collaboration published a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' announcing the discovery of a broad absorption profile centered at a frequency of &lt;math&gt;78\pm1&lt;/math&gt;MHz in the sky-averaged signal after subtracting Galactic [[synchrotron emission]]. The absorption profile has a width of &lt;math&gt;19_{-2}^{+4}&lt;/math&gt;MHz and an amplitude of &lt;math&gt;0.5_{-0.2}^{+0.5}&lt;/math&gt;K, against a background [[Root mean square|RMS]] of 0.025K, giving it a signal-to-noise ratio of 37. The equivalent [[redshift]] is centered at &lt;math&gt;z\approx17&lt;/math&gt;, spanning z=20–15. The signal is possibly due to ultraviolet light from the first stars in the Universe altering the emission of the [[21cm line]]. A "more exotic scenario" is that the signal is due to interactions between [[dark matter]] and [[baryon]]s.&lt;ref name="Nature_Mar18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature_DM_Mar18" /&gt;

== High-band instruments ==
The high-band instrument is of similar design, and operates at {{convert|90|–|200|MHz|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Nature_Mar18" /&gt;

{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}
A [[Sovereign state|country]]'s '''foreign policy''', also called  '''[[foreign relations]]''' or '''foreign affairs policy''', consists of self-interest strategies chosen by the state to safeguard its national interests and to achieve goals within its [[international relations]] 	milieu. The approaches are strategically employed to interact with other countries. The study of such strategies is called [[foreign policy analysis]]. In recent times, due to the deepening level of globalization and transnational activities, the states will also have to interact with [[non-state actor]]s. The aforementioned interaction is evaluated and monitored in attempts to maximize benefits of multilateral international cooperation. Since the [[national interest]]s are paramount, foreign policies are designed by the government through high-level decision making processes. National interests accomplishment can occur as a result of peaceful cooperation with other nations, or through exploitation. Usually, creating foreign policy is the job of the [[head of government]] and the [[foreign minister]] (or equivalent). In some countries the [[legislature]] also has considerable effects.  Foreign policies of countries have varying rates of change and scopes of intent,  which can be affected by factors that change the perceived national interests or even affect the stability of the country itself.  The foreign policy of a country can have profound and lasting impact on many other countries and on the course of international relations as a whole, such as the [[Monroe Doctrine]] conflicting with the [[mercantilism]] policies of 19th-century European countries and the goals of independence of newly formed [[Central American]] and [[South American]] countries.

==History==

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] described humans as social animals. Therefore, friendships and relations have existed between humans since the beginning of human interaction. As the organization developed in human affairs, relations between people also organized. Foreign policy thus goes back to primitive times. The inception in human affairs of foreign relations and the need for foreign policy to deal with them is as old as the organization of human life in groups. Before writing, most of these relations were carried out by word of mouth and left little direct archaeological evidence.

The literature from ancient times, the [[Bible]], the [[Homer]]ic poems, the histories of [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], and many others, show an accumulation of experience in dealing with foreigners. Ancient Chinese and Indian writings{{Which|date=July 2014}} give much evidence of thought concerned with the management of relations between peoples in the form of diplomatic correspondence between rulers and officials of different states and within systems of multi-tiered political relations such as the [[Han dynasty]] and its subordinate [[Kings of the Han Dynasty|kings]], the more powerful of which{{Which|date=February 2015}} conducted their own limited foreign relations as long as those did not interfere with their primary obligations to the central government, treatises by [[Chanakya]] and other scholars, and the preserved text of ancient treaties, as well as frequent references by known ancient writers to other, even older sources which have since been lost or remain in fragmentary form only.

==20th century==

Global wars were fought two times in the twentieth century. Consequently, international relations became a public concern as well as an important field of study and research.
After the [[World War II|Second World War]] and during the 1960s, many researchers{{Who|date=July 2014}} in the U.S. particularly, and from other countries in common, brought forth a wealth of research work and theory. This work was done for international relations and not for foreign policy as such. Gradually, various theories began to grow around international relations, international systems, and international politics, but the need for a theory of foreign policy (that is, the starting point in each sovereign state) continued to receive negligible attention. The reason was that the states used to keep their foreign policies under official secrecy, and unlike today, it was not considered appropriate for the public to know about these policies.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} This iron-bound secrecy is an essential part for the framework of foreign policy formulation.

World War II and its devastation posed a great threat and challenge for humanity which revealed to everyone the importance of international relations. Though foreign policy formulation continued to remain a closely guarded process at the national level, wider access to governmental records and greater public interest provided more data from which academic work placed international relations in a structured framework of political science. Graduate and post-graduate courses developed. Research was encouraged, and gradually, international relations became an academic discipline in universities throughout the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The subject of whether or not constructive attempts at involvement by citizens benefits the disciplines of the "art," or whether or not such disciplines as intercultural and interpersonal communications and others may play a significant part in the future of international relations could be a subject for further study by interested individuals/groups and is encouraged at the educational level.

Writers{{Who|date=July 2014}} researching foreign policy in the 20th century were unaware of whether or not agencies who most closely dealt with foreign policy kept logs of [[Statistics|statistical]] experience not unlike the [[Actuary|actuarial]] statistics kept by organizations of the [[insurance]] industry assessing the [[risk]] and danger involved (e.g., when situation "C" happened before, and subject included instances of "E" and "L", how was it handled and what was the result? When were peaceful and amicable results leading to better relations ever obtained through considered action and what was that action?).

The writers who worked with the foreign policy can be divided into two groups:
# World war writers who treat international politics and foreign policy as an indifferent, single field of study
# Writers who recognize foreign policy as a source rather than the substance of international politics and bring it under study as a subject
(The second group restricts to foreign policy making.)

The works of the second group come closer to the theory of foreign policy, but there is no attempt to formulate a basic theory of foreign policy. [[Hans Morgenthau]]’s works on principal elements of foreign policy seem to have covered the most ground.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, Hans J.. ''Politics among nations; the struggle for power and peace''. 4th ed. New York: Knopf, 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for a general theory of foreign policy==
{{Main|International relations theory}}
Shapiro, in his comparative study of the foreign policy of different countries, felt that the lack of a basic theory of foreign policy was particularly disabling and pointed out the harmful effect of the absence of a general theory of foreign policy on foreign policy literature.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The most fundamental question that arises here is: why do we lack theories of foreign policy? Or why do we need a general theory of foreign policy?
 	
The absence of a general theory in this field leads to some serious consequences. Without theory:

* We cannot explain the relationships we discover; we can make predictions only about the foreign policy behavior.
* We will have to depend on luck and educative guesses to come up with worthwhile research hypothesis.
* Research will become an ad-hoc or unplanned research, with no justification provided for the selection of cases—no system and no consistency.
* A field without theory is hardly an area of disciplined scientific inquiry.
* A diplomat will be likely to have a more complex estimate or knowledge of other governments. His or her estimate, however, will certainly be simplistic and heavily influenced by his or her own perceptual blinders, leading to faulty (or biased) policy judgments.

A theoretical framework of foreign policy is needed to analyze the day-to-day interactions in international relations and to compare individual foreign policies. The focus is primarily on the policies of [[state actor]]s with defined territories and jurisdictional boundaries, and less so on non-state actors, except in the context of how they impact national government decisions and policies. The formal field of study of international relations is itself fairly{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} recent and a specific subset of international relations such as foreign policy analysis does not receive wide attention as a field of scientific study, as opposed to the widespread use of terms like "foreign policy" and "foreign policy expert" in news media and general discussions about government when such experts may have more extensive backgrounds in fields other than foreign policy analysis. The organization [[Foreign Policy Interrupted]] recognized the gender disparity in foreign policy expert representation and is amplifying the number of female voices in foreign policy media coverage. Government officials involved in making foreign policy often perceive risk in giving away information about their policy-making processes and do not discuss the subject since control of information is itself often a part of foreign policy.

The vast record of empirical data and research is given academic attention to fit it into the framework of a general theory of foreign policy.

The second group of writers has made contributions in its development in many ways:

* Collation of systematic empirical studies with a view to articulating general pro-positions pertaining to state behavior.
* Analysis of foreign policy making with an emphasis on the process itself and the determinants that influence foreign policy.
* Development of a scientific approach to and model for foreign policy analysis such as the [[rational actor model]], domestic-public model, etc.
* Studies undertaken to prepare [[International relations|world order]] models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18417">Guttural pouches are large, [[Eustachian tube|auditory-tube]] diverticula that contain between 300 and 600 ml of air. They are present in [[Odd-toed ungulate|odd-toed mammals]], some [[bat]]s, [[hyrax]]es, and the American forest mouse. They are paired bilaterally just below the ears, behind the skull and connect to the [[Pharynx|nasopharynx]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollock|first=P. J.|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|last5=|first5=|last6=|first6=|date=|year=2007|title=Diagnosis and management of guttural pouch mycosis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2746/095777307X240162/pdf|journal=Equine Veterinary Education|volume=19|issue=10|pages=522–527|doi=10.2746/095777307X240162|issn=|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the general inaccessibility of the pouches in horses, they can be an area of infection by [[Mold|fungi]] and [[bacteria]], and these infections can be extremely severe and hard to treat.  The condition ''guttural pouch tympany'' affects several breeds, including the [[Arabian horse]].  The condition predisposes young horses to infection, often including severe swelling and often requires surgery to correct. The guttural pouch is also the site of infection in equine [[strangles]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Structure  ==
The guttural pouches are located behind the cranial cavity, caudally the skull and below the wings of the [[Atlas vertebra|atlas]] (C1). They are enclosed by the [[Parotid gland|parotid]] and [[Salivary gland|mandibular salivary glands]], and the [[Lateral pterygoid muscle|pterygoid]] muscles. The ventral portion lays on the pharynx and beginning of the esophagus, with the [[retropharyngeal lymph nodes]] located between the ventral wall and pharynx. The left and right pouches are separated by the [[Longus capitis muscle|longus capitis]] and [[Rectus capitis anterior muscle|rectus capitis ventralis]] muscles dorsomedially. Below these muscles, the two pouches fuse to form a median septum.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikivet.net/Guttural_Pouches_-_Anatomy_&amp;_Physiology|title=Guttural Pouches - Anatomy &amp; Physiology - WikiVet English|website=en.wikivet.net|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guttural pouches connect the middle ear to the pharynx. The opening into the pharynx is called the nasopharyngeal ostium, which is composed of the pharyngeal wall laterally and a [[Fibrocartilage|fibrocartilaginous]] fold medially. This opening leads to a short soft tissue passageway into the respective guttural pouch. The openings are located [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|rostrally]] to enable drainage of mucous when the head is lowered and prevent fluid build-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=J.

The plica salpingopharyngea can sometimes act as a one-way valve trapping air in the pouch, causing ''guttural pouch tympany''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perkins|first=Gillian A.|last2=Pease|first2=Anthony|last3=Crotty|first3=Erin|last4=Fubini|first4=Susan L.|year=2003|title=Diagnosing Guttural Pouch Disorders and Managing Guttural Pouch Empyema in Adult Horses|url=http://www.vetfolio.com/internal-medicine/diagnosing-guttural-pouch-disorders-and-managing-guttural-pouch-empyema-in-adult-horses|journal=Compendium|volume=25|pages=966–973|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Each pouch is moulded around the stylohyoid bone which divides the medial and lateral compartments. The medial compartment is much larger, and protrudes more caudally and ventrally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[epithelium]] is [[Pseudostratified columnar epithelium|pseudostratified]] and ciliated containing mucous-secreting [[goblet cell]]s; lymph nodules are also present.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The compartments of each guttural pouch contain many important structures including several [[cranial nerves]] and arteries that lie directly against the pouch as they pass into and out of [[Foramen|foramina]] in the caudal aspect of the skull.

The [[external carotid artery]] passes ventral to the medial compartment before crossing to the lateral wall of the lateral compartment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The pouch also covers the temporohyoid joint.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Function ==
For many years, the functionality of the guttural pouches remained an unsolved mystery. Recent studies have shown that they play a role in cooling the blood from the internal carotid destined for the brain during [[hyperthermia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baptiste|first=Keith E.|last2=Naylor|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Bailey|first3=Jeremy|last4=Barber|first4=Ernest M.|last5=Post|first5=Klass|last6=Thornhill|first6=Jim|date=2000-02-01|title=Physiology - A function for guttural pouches in the horse|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12647122_Physiology_-_A_function_for_guttural_pouches_in_the_horse|journal=Nature|volume=403|issue=6768|pages=382–383|doi=10.1038/35000284|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even-toed ''[[Even-toed ungulate|artiodactyls]]'' possess a carotid rete, responsible for heat exchange, to cool [[arterial blood]] before it enters the [[cranial cavity]]. This anatomical adaptation acts to protect friable brain tissue from injury due to overheating.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Graham|last2=Fuller|first2=Andrea|last3=Maloney|first3=Shane K|last4=Rump|first4=Nicola|last5=Mitchell|first5=Duncan|date=2006-09-22|title=Guttural pouches, brain temperature and exercise in horses|journal=Biology Letters|volume=2|issue=3|pages=475–477|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0469|issn=1744-9561|pmc=1686210|pmid=17148434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odd-toed ''[[Odd-toed ungulate|perrisodactyls]]'' such as horses lack a carotid rete, but since the internal carotid artery passes through the guttural pouches, it has been discovered that the air within the pouches cools the blood during exercise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Brain cooling by convection in the [[Cerebral cortex|cerebral]] blood also occurs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Pathology ==
If the drainage tract becomes blocked for any reason, the mucous secretions can accumulate and cause the pouch to distend, producing a visible and palpable protrusion behind the [[mandible]]. The [[exudate]] may become contaminated with pathogens. The bacteria [[Strangles|Streptococcus equi]], the causative agent of strangles, is commonly involved. [[Mycosis|Mycotic]] infections can also occur.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some visible symptoms of guttural pouch disease include abnormal head and neck carriage, nasal discharge, painful swelling and occasional abnormal functioning of the structures associated with the pouch.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Secondary problems may include inflammation of the middle ear due to migration of the infection along the auditory tube; nasal bleeding caused by damage to the internal carotid artery; with vagus nerve involvement there may be [https://www.acvs.org/large-animal/laryngeal-hemiplegia laryngeal hemiplegia] (roaring) or difficulty swallowing (also if glossopharyngeal nerve is involved); and [[Horner's syndrome|Horner’s syndrome]] from the involvement of sympathetic nerves. Involvement of the facial nerve is rare.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As the guttural pouches are covered by [[respiratory epithelium]] and mucosa, they have the potential to be affected by all respiratory pathogens.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=P. M.|last2=James|first2=O. A.|date=2016-12-01|title=Equine guttural pouch empyema, why does it become chronic?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eve.12707/abstract|journal=Equine Veterinary Education|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/eve.12707|issn=2042-3292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most infections are self-limiting, requiring no or little medical intervention. Upon endoscopy, affected guttural pouches often house [[Mucopurulent discharge|mucopurulent fluid]] that is in the process of draining.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Guttural Pouch Empyema ===
Guttural pouch empyema is characterized by the accretion of purulent, bacteria infested exudate in the pouch. The bacteria is primarily ''Streptococcus equi'', the infectious agent of strangles. Clinically apparent symptoms include painful swelling of the parotid area and recurrent infected nasal discharge, and in severe circumstances, difficulty breathing and abnormal head carriage may be observable.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/guttural-pouch-disease-in-horses|title=Guttural Pouch Disease in Horses|last=Rush|first=Bonnie, R.|date=|work=|newspaper=|access-date=2017-01-11|via=Merck Veterinary Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fever, anorexia, difficulty swallowing and [[soft palate]] displacement may or may not be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perkins|first=Justin D.|last2=Schumacher|first2=Jim|last3=Kelly|first3=Ger|last4=Gomez|first4=Jorge H.|last5=Schumacher|first5=John|date=2006-10-01|title=Standing surgical removal of inspissated guttural pouch exudate (chondroids) in ten horses|journal=Veterinary surgery: VS|volume=35|issue=7|pages=658–662|doi=10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00204.x|issn=0161-3499|pmid=17026551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empyema is often secondary to guttural pouch tympany (distention of the pouches with air) in [[foal]]s and [[weanling]]s. [[Arabian horse|Arabians]], in particular, are inclined to guttural pouch tympany, as many have a [[Congenital disorder|congenital defect]] in the pharyngeal orifices of the pouches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2iEkI4YKoHgC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;lpg=PA357&amp;dq=guttural+pouch+empyema&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mz2PdhrMJ7&amp;sig=17HxtiiCMHlgU5u5N3d6G7OEJPU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3jseE2a3RAhWK3YMKHUUjDDA4FBDoAQgjMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=guttural%20pouch%20empyema&amp;f=false|title=Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult: Equine|last=Lavoie|first=Jean-Pierre|last2=Hinchcliff|first2=Kenneth William|date=2008-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780813814872|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infection can also be due to the rupture of the nearby retropharyngeal lymph nodes, usually caused by an [[abscess]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itarget.com.br/newclients/abraveq2012/down/2012/weva/437.pdf|title=Diseases of the Guttural Pouches|last=Fjeldborg|first=J.|last2=Baptiste|first2=Keith|date=2017-01-03|website=|publisher=University of Copenhagen, Denmark|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis is established through and endoscopic examination. [[Radiography|Radiographic examination]] of the area will show an opaque fluid line in the pouch and if a retropharyngeal lymph node is involved, it may reveal a mass.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In mild, acute cases of empyema, a saline or polyionic solution [[lavage]] is often performed via an endoscope or [[catheter]] repeatedly until the exudate drains.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Antimicrobial therapy without a lavage seldom remedies the infection.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In more complex cases, where concretions have formed, surgical intervention may be necessary to ensure appropriate drainage and removal of the hardened material. The area can be accessed surgically through the Viborg’s triangle&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Guttural Pouch Tympany ===
Guttural pouch tympany is an uncommon ailment in which excessive amounts of air become trapped in the pouch, resulting in abnormal expansion. Tympany is usually unilateral, but in some cases can affect both pouches. It is seen most often in young foals and is more common in females than in males.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=q-26Cz4t-P0C&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=guttural+pouch+tympany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=llI5YryEWW&amp;sig=05-4IGbP7pObJKyjIpl-AMYUceo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY_sDKjK7RAhXM7oMKHbG8CnY4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=guttural%20pouch%20tympany&amp;f=false|title=Current Therapy in Equine Medicine|last=Robinson|first=Norman Edward|last2=Sprayberry|first2=Kim A.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1416054758|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tympany results in non-painful, soft swelling beneath the ear and behind the jaw. Additional symptoms may include roaring, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing and/or [[aspiration pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Chris|date=2017-01-11|title=Pharyngeal neuromuscular dysfunction associated with bilateral guttural pouch tympany in a foal|journal=The Canadian Veterinary Journal|volume=48|issue=2|pages=192–194|issn=0008-5286|pmc=1780239|pmid=17334035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is achieved through radiography and endoscopic evaluation. The specific cause of guttural pouch tympany is not known, but it is suspected that it is more common when there are defects of the plica salpingopharyngeus, and/or the pharyngeal orifice where they act as a one-way valve that does not allow air to escape.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Because of the risk of secondary infection, it is crucial that tympany be treated as soon as possible. Treatment protocols may include, but are not limited to, surgical intervention and in cases where surgery is not an option, insertion of a transnasal [[Foley catheter|Foley balloon catheter]] in an attempt to remodel the pharyngeal orifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caston|first=S.

=== Guttural Pouch Mycosis ===
Guttural pouch mycosis (GPM) is a fungal disease that is rare but potentially life-threatening. GPM is of unknown [[pathogenesis]] currently and no predisposing factors have been identified. Fungal plaque is usually located in the medial guttural pouch, near the internal carotid artery.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Clinical signs include unilateral or bilateral [[Nosebleed|epistaxis]] due to erosion of the artery walls,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; nasal discharge and cranial nerve dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZs_WBKZ-PwC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=guttural+pouch+tympany+prognosis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4DxdpBp9ND&amp;sig=XC8Sm2GpyVKzn49mLm4ex4MhTKE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjijt699LXRAhXM1IMKHTTxC4o4ChDoAQglMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=guttural%20pouch%20tympany%20prognosis&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Veterinary Advisor: The Horse|last=Wilson|first=David|date=2010-11-28|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1437714498|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPM is a dangerous condition as spontaneous fatal [[Bleeding|hemorrhaging]] can occur, usually within a few days to weeks after the first bout of epistaxis&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The most common fungus associated with GPM is ''[[Aspergillosis]]''.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepage|first=O.  M.|last2=Perron|first2=M. F.|last3=Cadoré|first3=J.

Diagnosis is made based on the history of the animal, presenting clinical signs and endoscopic exploration. [[Pharmaceutical drug|Pharmaceutical treatment]] is not suggested without coinciding surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobesova|first=O.|last2=Schwarz|first2=B.|last3=Velde|first3=K.|last4=Jahn|first4=P.|last5=Zert|first5=Z.|last6=Bezdekova|first6=B.|year=2012|title=Guttural pouch mycosis in horses: a retrospective study of 28 cases|url=http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/171/22/561.abstract|journal=Veterinary Record|volume=171|pages=561|via=Veterinary Record|doi=10.1136/vr.100700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment typically consists of topical as well as [[systemic administration|systemic]] antifungal medication, paired with surgery to occlude or [[Embolization|embolise]] affected arteries.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Early intervention is necessary to ensure the best chance of survival. Horses that experience [[dysphagia]] or other forms of nerve dysfunction as a result of GPM have a poorer [[prognosis]] that those who have not exhibited those symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.equinews.com/article/fungal-infections-guttural-pouch-horses|title=Fungal Infections of the Guttural Pouch in Horses|last=Kentucky Equine Research Staff|first=|date=2013|work=EquiNews|access-date=2017-01-11|via=Kentucky Equine Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">'''Human–animal marriage'''  is a marriage between a (non-human) animal and a human. This topic has appeared in mythology and [[magic in fiction|magical fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diacronia.ro/en/journal/issue/4/A58/en/pdf Naithani, Sadhana (2014). Folklore Theory in Postwar Germany.] University Press of Mississippi. pp. 48–52. {{ISBN|9781617039942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century there have been numerous reports from around the world of humans marrying their pets and other animals. Human–animal marriage is often seen in accordance with [[zoophilia]], however they are not necessarily linked. Although animal-human marriage is not mentioned specifically in national laws, the act of engaging in [[Zoophilia and the law|sexual acts with an animal]] is illegal in many countries under animal abuse laws.

== Animal-human marriage in mythology ==
The practice of animal-human marriage has made appearances in several [[Mythology|mythological]] stories and [[folklore]], and is often understood to mean a deity-human marriage involving gods or heroes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Alan L.|date=1995-01-01|title=The Woman Who Married a Horse: Five Ways of Looking at a Chinese Folktale|jstor=1178945|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=54|issue=2|pages=275–305|doi=10.2307/1178945}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese folktale 'The Goddess Of The Silkworm' is an example of a tale where a woman marries a horse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A similar Irish legend tells of a king who marries a horse, symbolizing a divine union between the king and the goddess of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_Y-7XvMVeYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography|last=Freeman|first=Philip|date=2004-03-17|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743267496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the indigenous [[Cheyenne]] have a story of animal-human marriage in 'The Girl who Married a dog'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stensland|first=Anna Lee|date=1977-01-01|title=The Indian Presence in American Literature|jstor=815804|journal=The English Journal|volume=66|issue=3|pages=37–41|doi=10.2307/815804}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many Native American stories about people who married animals. In these Native American myths, animal spirits frequently assume human form.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Mi-Ni/Native-American-Mythology.html|title=Native American Mythology - Myth Encyclopedia - god, story, legend, names, ancient, animal, snake, world, creation, life|website=www.mythencyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not seen as literal animals, but representatives from the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Animal-Human marriage in the real world ==
Although it is uncertain if there is a legal basis for marrying an animal, several individuals claim to have done so. The [[Sudanese goat marriage incident]] made big headlines in 2006 when a man was forced to marry a goat after being caught in a sexual interaction with the goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1550479/Man-marries-goat-captivates-millions.html|title='Man marries goat' captivates millions|last=Staff|first=By Our Foreign|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of marriage include animals such as dogs, cats, frogs and a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3004930.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} South Asia {{!}} Girl weds dog to break 'evil spell'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/11/13/man-in-india-marries-dog-to-atone-for-stoning-to-death-mating-canines.html|title=Man in India Marries Dog to Atone for Stoning to Death Mating Canines|date=2007-11-13|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334993/Joseph-Guiso-marries-dog-Honey-sunset-ceremony.html|title=Sealed with a kiss: Man 'marries' his dog in sunset ceremony - but assures guests 'it's not sexual'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8658327.stm|title=BBC News - German man 'marries' his dying cat|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4290761/Seven-year-old-Indian-girls-marry-frogs.html|title=Seven-year-old Indian girls 'marry' frogs|last=Delhi|first=By Dean Nelson in|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/01/03/british-woman-marries-dolphin.html|title=British Woman Marries Dolphin|date=2006-01-03|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other incidents of human animal relations took place in 2010, when 18-year-old Balinese man Ngurah Alit was found having sexual intercourse with a cow, who he claimed flirted with him.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/bali-teenager-passes-out-marrying-cow-he-had-sex-with/|title=Bali Teenager Passes Out Marrying Cow He Had Sex With {{!}} Jakarta Globe|work=Jakarta Globe|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Pecaruan ritual, the man was forced to marry the animal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The ceremony was thought to cleanse the village of the immoral act of bestiality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The cow was drowned in the ocean, while Alit was symbolically drowned as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''Industrial arts''' is an educational program which features fabrication of objects in wood or metal using a variety of hand, power, or machine tools. It may include [[small engine repair]] and [[automobile maintenance]], and all programs usually cover [[technical drawing]] as part of the curricula. As an educational term, ''industrial arts'' dates from 1904 when Charles R. Richards of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York suggested it to replace ''[[manual training]]''.

In the [[U.S.A.|United States]], industrial arts classes are colloquially known as "'''[[Workshop |shop]] class'''"; these programs expose children to the basics of home repair, manual craftsmanship, and machine safety. Most industrial arts programs were established in comprehensive rather than dedicated [[vocational schools]] and focused on a broad range of skills rather than on a specific [[vocational training]]. In 1980, the name of industrial arts education in New York State was changed to "[[technology education]]" during what was called the "Figuring Project". The project goal was to increase students' [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/ |title= History {{!}} Department of Technology |last=|first= |date= 2017 |website= www.oswego.edu |at=sec. Technology Education |language= en |archive-url=|archive-date= |dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC, Australia) industrial arts is still a key part of the high school curriculum. The term now describes a key study of [[technology]] that focuses on both engineering and industrial technologies. Additionally, [[design]] using the aforementioned technologies is now a key part of the industrial arts curriculum and has been since the mid-1980s when the subject of technics was introduced into Victorian high schools.

One of the most important aspects of industrial arts is still that while students design they ultimately realize a solution; learning the challenges involved with working with materials and also the challenges of small scale project management.

Some universities have doctoral programs in industrial arts.

==Industrial arts clubs==
An industrial arts club is an organization that promotes the use of industrial fabrication equipment by the general public. Clubs have grown out of the decline of industrial arts (aka shop class) programs in comprehensive school systems in the US.
Clubs began as student organizations in primary and secondary schools offering industrial, the [[TechShop]] and Sparqs Industrial Arts Club based in Massachusetts which grew out of campus activities at [[MIT]].

==Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
Industrial Arts (IA) is an important part of the (NSW) high school curriculum. Industrial Arts syllabi are managed, like all NSW syllabi by the [[Board of Studies]]. In some schools Industrial Arts faculties have become part of a larger Technology faculty, however many schools still have a stand-alone Industrial Arts faculty.

The primary role of Industrial Arts education is to expose students to a variety of industrial and [[engineering]] technologies that improve their understanding of the industrial and engineered world. Moreover, students learn both project management and design principles, most courses are project based with students realizing a solution to a design or engineering challenge. Two key components of the projects are '''synthesis''' of a solution and '''evaluation''' of the final product. Both of these components are the highest order objectives in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]].

===Industrial Arts Curricula in NSW===
Industrial Arts has a single compulsory course for Years 7 and 8: Technology (Mandatory). This course also has area that cover Home Economics concepts and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) content.

For Years 9 and 10 all Industrial Arts courses are electives, the three electives on offer are Design and Technology, Graphics Technology and Industrial Technology. The most popular Industrial Arts elective is Industrial Technology.

*'''Design and Technology''': this course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. Students are given a design challenge and they come up with a solution. Their passage through the design process is documented in a Design Folio. In some schools Design and Technology may not be delivered by the Industrial Arts faculty, in some schools the [[Home Economics]] faculty may run the Design and Technology course.
*'''Graphics Technology''': this course introduces students to both manual (pencil) technical drawing and [[Computer Aided Design]] (CAD). This course has a core study in Year 9 and then a variety of electives for Year 10 including: Engineering Drawing, Architectural Drawing and Computer Animation.
*'''Industrial Technology''': this course may be studied with a variety of different disciplines with the most popular ones being: [[timber]], [[metal]], [[electronics]], [[multimedia]] and [[engineering]]. All have a common theme that students are involved in designing and making projects relevant to the context being studied. For example, a student in Industrial Technology – Multimedia may be asked to design an animation or website advertising a product. The development of their project is documented in their Project Report. A key part of the project report is evaluation of the finished product.

In Years 11 and 12 Industrial Arts offers three [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) non-Vocational courses: Design and Technology, Engineering Studies and Industrial Technology.
*'''Design and Technology''' is an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. For their HSC students must create a Major Design Project. Students establish a need and then try to solve it and realise a solution. A key part of the project is evaluation through the design process. The Major Design project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark.
*'''Engineering Studies''' is primarily a theory course that introduces students to the engineered world. The course looks at a variety of engineering applications and fields of engineering. Students learn about engineering history and societal implications, [[engineering mechanics]], [[engineering materials]], engineering electronics and engineering communication methods. The course introduces students to many concepts that they would otherwise first encounter in undergraduate engineering programmes at university.  One of the fundamental aspects of the course is learning engineering through the investigation of real life applications. This builds greater significance and understanding in students.
*'''Industrial Technology''' is also an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on students working within a prescribed technology such as: Timber Products and Furniture Industries, Multimedia Industries Automotive Industries, Electronics Industries, Graphics Industries and Metal and Engineering Industries. For their HSC students must create a Major Project. Students develop a project and document their progress through the project. Hence they learn the vital skills of project management. Similar to Design and Technology evaluation of the project is an important part of the associated documentation.  The Major Project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark. The fundamental difference between Industrial Technology and Design and Technology is that a student studying Industrial Technology must study theory relevant to specific technology and also study industry practices relevant to their technology.

==Professional Association for Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
In NSW the professional association for Industrial Arts teachers is the [[Institute of Industrial Arts Technology Education]] ([[IIATE]]). This organisation releases a quarterly journal (on CD) and also runs an annual conference that investigates matters relevant to Industrial Arts education. Moreover, the IIATE represents Industrial Arts teachers in a variety of situations such as syllabus development meetings and teacher training interviews.

Another important role that The IIATE fulfils is that of Professional Learning. The IIATE has run some very successful training days called ''Hands on Technology'' where teachers are able to build their skills and knowledge in a variety of areas. This ''Hands on'' concept has now been extended with the ''Hands on Engineering'' day now being developed to assist teachers in delivering the Industrial Arts' courses Industrial Technology - Engineering and Engineering Studies.

The IIATE has also successfully run training programmes for CAD software which has enable many more teachers to effectively embed CAD into their teaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">'''Interactive Specialization''' is a theory of brain development proposed by the British developmental cognitive neuroscientist [[Mark H. Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], formerly head of the  Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbcd.bbk.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], London and who is now Head of Psychology at the University of Cambridge.

In his book ''Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience'' 
,&lt;ref name="Johnson2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Mark|title=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 2nd Ed.|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2005|isbn= 1-4051-2629-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson contrasts two views of development. According to the first, the maturational hypothesis, the relationship between structure and function (i.e. which parts of the brain perform a particular task) is static, and specific cognitive skills come “on-line” as the cortical circuitry intrinsic to a particular task matures. Johnson likens this to a "mosaic" view of development.

According to the second, the Interactive Specialization (IS) &lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, M.H.|title=Functional brain development in infants: Elements of an interactive specialization framework|year=2000|journal=Child Development|issue=1
|pages=75–81|volume=71|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00120|pmid=10836560}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesis, development is 
not a unidirectional maturational process, but rather a set of complex, dynamic and back-propagated interactions between genetics, brain, body and environment. Development is not a simple question of a brain being built according to a pre-specified genetic blueprint - rather, the components of the brain are interacting with each other constantly - even prenatally, when patterns of spontaneous firing of cells in the eyes (before they have opened) transmit signals that appear to help develop the layered structure of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] 
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O'Leary D.D.M |author2=Nakagawa Y. |title=Patterning centers, regulatory genes and extrinsic mechanisms controlling arealization of the neocortex|year=2002|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|issue=1

The hypothesis has attracted increasing attention in recent years as a number of neuroimaging studies on younger children have provided data that appears to fit specific predictions made by Johnson's model 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Redcay E. |author2=Haist F. |author3=Courchesne E. |title=Paper: Functional neuroimaging of speech perception during a pivotal period in language acquisition|year=2008|journal=Developmental Science|issue=2

|pages=24–28|volume=15|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00400.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
In 1996, Johnson co-authored (with [[Jeffrey Elman]], [http://www.psyc.bbk.ac.uk/research/DNL/personalpages/annette.html Annette Karmiloff-Smith], [[Elizabeth Bates]], Domenico Parisi, and Kim Plunkett), the book ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]''

, which argues against a strong nativist (innate) view on development. Other key influences include Gilbert Gottlieb's theory of Probabilistic Epigenesis 
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gottlieb, G., Lickliter, R.|title=FProbabilistic epigenesis|year=2007|journal=Developmental Science|issue=1

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''International Political Sociology''' is a critical approach within [[security studies]]. According to [[Didier Bigo]] an IPS approach to security argues that both security and insecurity are the result of an (in)securitization process based on a speech act calling for a politics of exception and a general frame linked to the existence of transnational bureaucracies and private agents managing insecurity that compete to frame security issues.&lt;ref&gt; Bigo, D. (2008), 'International Political Sociology' in ''Security Studies: An Introduction'', P. Williams (ed), Routledge: Abingdon, pp. 116-128&lt;/ref&gt; Bigo further argues that this (in)securitization process is embedded in the use of technology in every day practices. IPS approaches to security criticize of the characterization of security studies as a sub-discipline of [[international relations]] and the association of security with survival. IPS challenges the Copenhagen School's understanding of the securitization process arguing that securitization is not the result of a successful speech act but mundane bureaucratic decisions, use of technologies and Weberian routines of rationalization.&lt;ref&gt; Bigo, D. (2008), 'International Political Sociology' in ''Security Studies: An Introduction'', P. Williams (ed), Routledge: Abingdon, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The International Political Sociology approach to security is particularly influenced by a Foucaultian reading of policing as a form of governmentality.

'''Sociology of security''' is the scientific study of the relationships between community and security. It addresses the questions what understanding of security does society create and conversely, what society does security establish. In other words, sociology of security is the study of mutual interactions between security and the society that result in developing or production and reproduction of security in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sociology of Security|last = Navidnia|first = Manijeh|publisher = ISA |number=57 |journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer to the question "what is the Sociology of Security?" can be discussed from two viewpoints. The first says that the Sociology of Security addresses the "understanding of security", so it asks:

# What kind of understanding of security does the society provide? 
# Based on what elements does society formulate the security? 
# How does society organize the stable and fragile society? 
# How much does the society want to institutionalize the security? 
# How do distinctions and differences between security and insecurity form and reproduce in society? 

On the other hand, because the aim of Sociology of Security is to study mutual interaction between society and security, the second viewpoint asks:

# What kind of society does the security form? 
# What are the benefits and barriers of security for the society? 
# What type of interactions does security provide in different environments (urban / rural…) in various situations (parties / union...) in different groups (family / friends...)? 
# How does security use social forces such as classes of society? 
# What restrictions or barriers does security form for society?

==Types of marriage==

===Nikāḥ===
[[Image:Signing the Nikah.jpg|thumb|A Muslim bride signing the '''nikkah nama''' or marriage certificate]]
{{Main article|Nikah}}
''nikāḥ'' (Arabic: نكاح, literally, "to collect and bind together")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp Nikah.com Information: Definition of Nikah (Islamic marriage)]&lt;/ref&gt; is the first&amp;mdash;and most common&amp;mdash;form of marriage for [[Muslim]]s. It is described in the Qur'an in Surah 4:4.&lt;ref name="Q44"&gt;{{cite quran|4|4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations:
*While intended to be a permanent state, it can be terminated by the husband engaging in the ''[[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]]'' process or the wife seeking a ''[[Khula]]''.
*The couple inherit from each other.
*A legal [[contract]] is signed when entering the marriage. However it is not a requirement that the contract be in writing, it may be oral especially amongst illiterates; and if an agreed end-date is specified in the nikāḥ contract:
**In [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] jurisprudence, the contract is invalid.
**In [[Shia Islam|Shia]] jurisprudence, the contract defines a temporary marriage, ''nikāḥ mut'ah''.
{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated that prophet said, "fornicatoresses are those who marry without proof." (Tirmidhi vol. 2 book 6 no.1103)}}
Requirement of witnesses:
*two (2) witnesses from both sides&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html Witnesses for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110182956/http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html |date=2005-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permission from [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Wali]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm Nikah without Parents' Knowledge?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133650/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sunni: Compulsory ([[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]) ''or'' Strongly recommended ([[Hanafi]])
*Shia: Depending on the scholar, it is either obligatory or obligatory based on precaution.

===Nikāḥ mut‘ah===
{{Main article|Nikah mut‘ah}}
''nikāḥ mut‘ah'' (Arabic: نكاح متعة, temporary marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |website=Answering-Ansar.org |title=Mut'ah, a comprehensive guide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224032516/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |archivedate=2008-02-24 |date=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, There is controversy on the Islamic legality of this type of marriage, since Sunnis believe it was abrogated by Muhammad or Umar.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhara&lt;/ref&gt;while Shias do not hold this. According to Shia Hadith: Ali (r) said ‘Had Umar not banned Mut’ah then the only person to fornicate would have been a disgraceful person, since Mut’ah is easy, and one can attain the objective, there would have then been no need to indulge in haraam acts. It is clear that if Mut’ah’s abrogation was Sahih then Jabir would not have opposed Omar, and that if Islamic prophet outlawed it, the Companions would not have practiced it during the reign of Abu Bakr. Someone asked Abdullah bin Umar (about Mut’ah) saying: ‘Your father prohibited it. (Ibn Umar replied): ‘Is the order of the Messenger of Allah, more deserving to be followed, or the order of my father?’ [http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/mutah/umar-banned-mutah.html].

''However, similar to normal marriages that are common among Sunnis and Shi'ias, the woman still is given her ''[[mahr]]'',and the woman must still observe the ''[[iddah]]'', a period of time where the woman cannot remarry. This is to ensure that there is no pregnancy from the ex-husband and thus clarifies paternal lineage.''

Quran 4:24 (Pickthall)- And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-24/ Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 24 )]&lt;/ref&gt;

nikāḥ Misyaar is a nikāḥ in Sunni's carried out via the normal contractual procedure, with the specificity that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of [[polygamy]], the wife's rights to housing, and maintenance money (''"[[nafaqa]]"''), and the husband's right of homekeeping, and access etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |first=Yusuf |last=Al-Qaradawi |title=Misyar marriage |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104035953/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |archivedate=2011-01-04 |date=2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between this and Mut'ah is that Mut'ah has the condition of a definite time period. Allowing both husband and wife aware of a separation date, prior to a marriage contract. Sunnah Scholars have said it is permissible to marry a Woman with the intention of getting divorced, If the Wife is not informed or expecting a divorce during a marriage contract. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misyar_marriage]

===Nikah Istibdaa===
It is a marriage ( نکاح استبضاع) in which a husband would send his wife to another person, usually of noble lineage, to have sexual relations with him. The husband would refrain from sexual relations with his wife until she became pregnant by the other man. Afterwards, the man would claim paternity of the conceived child. This was done to get a child of noble breed. It was eradicated by Islam.&lt;ref&gt; Sahih Bukhari 5127 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikāḥ Shighār===
It is marriage (نکاح شغار) in which two men would exchange their daughters, sisters or other close  women for marriage without paying [[Mahr]]. It was prohibited by [[Muhammad]]. &lt;ref&gt; sahih Bukhari 6960 &lt;/ref&gt;
=== Nikāḥ ijtimaa===
{{main article|Nikah Ijtimah}}
This is polyandrous marriage, in which up to ten men would have sexual relations with the same woman at around the same time. When she bore a child she would call all the men and attribute paternity of the child to a man of her choosing. This practice was eradicated by Islam.

===Interfaith marriage===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}

Muslim males may marry a non-Muslim female, specifically, one from the "[[People of the Book]]", which includes [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. Conversion is optional for the woman,  but she is nonetheless charged with having a proper understanding of her respective faith as well as engaging in its true and thorough practise. Muslim women have generally forbidden from marrying non-Muslims by some interpretations. But today, more and more scholars have been questioning this ages-long assumption.

==Restrictions on marriage==

===Polygyny===
{{Main article|Polygyny in Islam}}
[[Muslim]] men are allowed to practise [[polygyny]], that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four, per [[Sura]] 4 Verse 3. A man does not need approval of his first wife for a second marriage as there is no evidence in the Qur'an or hadith to suggest this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#18._SECOND_MARRIAGE_WITHOUT_FIRST_WIFE_CONSENT_ Section 30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/61 Validity of second marriage without consent of first]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=82068 IslamWeb Fatwa Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; The only requirement is to create fairness among his wives and to never hurt one wife to please another as this would be unjust. If this requirement cannot be fulfilled, then he can only marry one woman.

[[Polyandry]], the practice of a woman having more than one husband, by contrast, is not permitted. One of the main reasons for this would be the potential questioning of paternal lineage. The Quran states: (30:21): “And among His signs is that He has created for you, from your selves, mates, that you may incline towards them and find rest in them, and He has engendered love and tenderness between you. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.”

===Permissible age===
''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' permits marriage once a person reaches sexual maturity (i.e.: menstruation, voice changing, wet dreams)  (''[[baligh]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Sexual maturity in Sharia law is typically understood to mean puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Islam and the Everyday World: Public Policy Dilemmas{{snd}} Page 102, Sohrab Behdad, Farhad Nomani, Farhad Nomani{{snd}} 2006&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, intercourse is forbidden until they are able to physically bear it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#4._MARRIAGE_AGE_ Requirement for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}
Traditionally, Muslim jurists hold that Muslim women may only enter into marriage with Muslim men. The Qur'an explicitly allows Muslim men to marry chaste women of the [[People of the Book]], a term which includes [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|5|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interfaith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scholarofthehouse.com/oninma.html |title=On Christian Men marrying Muslim Women |accessdate=2008-01-20 |last=El Fadl |first=Abou |year=2006 |work=Scholar of the House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arranged and forced marriages===
An [[Arranged marriage|engagement may be arranged]] between families for their children, but Islamic requirements for a legal marriage include the requirement that both parties, bride, groom and guardian for the bride (''[[wali]]''), give their legal consent. A marriage without the consent of the bride or [[forced marriage|performed under coercion]] is illegal according to the majority of scholars.

If a girl has not attained the age of puberty, the vast majority of scholars hold that she cannot be married; and many stipulate that it must be in her best interest in order to be considered a valid marriage. There is some dispute as to whether or not an under-age bride can leave her family's custody and be transferred to her husband's custody, if she has not yet reached puberty. Some evidence supporting both sides can be seen in the following narrations from Muhammad:

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that 'Aisha remained with the Prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).

Sahih Bukhari 7.18 Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for 'Aisha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said "But I am your brother." The Prophet said, "You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry."

however; evidence from other Islamic sources seems to suggest that this is not something allowed for all Muslims; rather specifically for Muhammad. The evidence for this view is as follows:

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: "A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness)." [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim &amp; Others]

It is reported in a hadith that A'ishah related that she once asked the Prophet: "In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?" He replied: "Yes, she must give her permission." She then said: "But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!" He replied: "Her silence is [considered as] her permission." [Al-Bukhari, Muslim, &amp; Others]

It appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary for her marriage to be considered valid;the above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract.

===Adulterers===
Islam does not give [[Adultery|adulterous]] men the right to marry a [[Chastity|chaste]] woman and nor may an adulterous woman marry a chaste man, except if the matter has not gone to court and the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|3|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|221|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], [[Mizan]], Chapter:The Social Law of Islam, [[Al-Mawrid]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity|{{cite quran|24|26|style=ref}}}}

===Other===
A woman or man may propose marriage directly or through an intermediary ([[Matchmaking|matchmaker]]).

Recognition or celebration of same-sex marriage is completely unjustified in the view of Islamic law. [[Homosexuality and Islam|Islam forbids homosexuality]] in Qur'anic injunctions and Islamic tradition.

A marriage is registered by the ''[[Qadi]]'' who performs the short ceremony.

Unlike the [[wedding ring]] in Western societies, there is no visible sign worn to show a woman or a man is married. However, some Muslims have found the wedding ring to be a non-religious tradition and have used a ring.

===Mahr===
{{Main article|Mahr}}
Mahr is a mandatory gift given by the groom to the bride. Unlike a [[bride price]], however, it is given directly to the bride and not to her father.  Although the gift is often money, it can be anything agreed upon by bride and groom such as a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she chooses.

===Islamic marriage contract===
{{Main article|Islamic marriage contract}}
The purpose, rules, and regulations of the [[Islamic marriage contract]]. A Muslim marriage is not a ''sacrament'', but a simple, legal agreement in which either partner is free to include conditions. These conditions are stipulated in a written contract. Violating any of the conditions stipulated in this contract is legal grounds for a partner seeking divorce. The first part of the Nikah, ''marriage ceremony'' is the signing of the marriage contract itself.

Various traditions may differ in how Nikah is performed because different groups accept different texts as authoritative. Therefore, Sunnis will likely accept the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]], while Shia will have their own collections, for example [[Kitab al-Kafi|Furu al-Kafi]], thus producing different procedures. This contract requires the consent of both parties. There is a tradition, outside of the religion, in some Muslim countries to pre-arrange a marriage for young children. However, the marriage still requires consent for the wedding to legally take place.

Divorce is not forbidden as a last resort, however the dissolution of the contract [[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]], is often described as the most disliked of permissible things in Islam and should be used as a last resort.

==Walima==
{{main article|Walima}}
The [[Walima]] is a dinner given by the groom's side of the family to celebrate the welcoming of the bride to the family. It is a strong [[sunnah]] (the repetition of an action of Muhammad) and it is recommended to be held the earliest possible day after the Nikah.

==Behavior within marriage==

===Spousal rights and obligations===
{{Main article|Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam}}
Islam advocates a role-based relationship between husband and wife.

[[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar]] narrated:
{{quote|The Prophet said, "All of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards. The ruler is a guardian and the man is a guardian of his family; the lady is a guardian and is responsible for her husband's house and his offspring; and so all of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards."|Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 7, Book 62, Number 128}}

It puts the main responsibility of earning over the husband. Both are obliged to fulfill the other's sexual needs. Both are obliged to treat each other with kindness.

====Separate accommodation for wife====
The wife has the right to live in separate accommodation with her husband and children, if she does not like to share it with anyone like her in-law or relatives. This is the view of most of the Hanafi, Shaafa’i and Hanbali fuqaha. She also has the right to refuse to live with her husband's father, mother and siblings.

Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: That he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for his charge." I definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet also said, "A man is a guardian of his father's property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges."[Sahih Bukhari]

This indicates that a wife is responsible for the house of her husband. Also that a man should be the guardian of his family, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;after his marriage he moves out of his father's house, and runs his own family affairs and is guardian of his family. In joint family, typically the head is either the father of the husband, or mother of the husband. This also indicates that a husband should look after his parent's house, as "a man is a guardian of his father's property". So the wife should not object to her husband when he is looking after affairs of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learndeen.com/jm/blog/85-razi-blog/183-rights-of-spouses-and-issues-in-joint-family-system.html Rights of Spouses and issues with joint family]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexuality====
{{Main article|Islamic sexual jurisprudence}}
Sexuality in Islam is largely described by the Qur'an, Islamic tradition, and religious leaders both past and present as being confined to marital relationships between men and women. While most traditions discourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity and modesty with regards to any relationships across gender lines, holding forth that intimacy as perceived within Islam (encompassing a swath of life more broad than strictly sex) is to be reserved for marriage.

[[Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud]] narrated:
{{quote|We were with the Prophet while we were young and had no wealth whatever. So Allah's Apostle said, "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual desire."|Volume 7, Book 62, Number 4:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614011220/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.086 |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While adulterous relationships are strictly forbidden, permissible sexual relationships within marriage are described in Islamic sources as great wells of love and closeness for the couple involved. Sexual relationship between married couples are even source of rewards from [[God]] as doing the opposite; i.e.,&amp;nbsp;satisfying sexual needs through illicit means has punishment. Specific occasions (most notably daytime [[Fasting#Islam|fasting]] (see [[sawm]]) and [[menstruation]]) are times forbidden for intercourse, though not for other ways of touching and being close to one another. [[Islamic views on anal sex|Anal sex]] with one's wife is also strictly prohibited.

Islam has an open and playful approach to sex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10031095/Sex-What-Muslim-women-really-want-in-the-bedroom.html], Article titled “Sex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom”, by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, May 2, 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "100 facts" &gt;[http://facts.randomhistory.com/islam-facts.html ], 100 Interesting Facts About …&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery.

===Gender roles===
The Qur'an asserts that there are innate differences between women and men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/3/36 "And the male is not like the female."]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Islam places different rights over the husband and wife.

Some similar rights which both the husband and wife owe to each other are:
* The right to enjoy each other.
* The right to inherit from each other.
* The right of confirmation of the lineage of their children.

Some rights which the husband owes to his wife are:
* The dower (Mahr)
* Support
* Kind and proper treatment&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Part 2: The Duties of Men |url=https://www.al-islam.org/principles-marriage-family-ethics-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/part-2-duties-men}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marital relations
* Not to be beaten on face
* Privacy
* Justice between multiple wives
* To be taught her religion
* Defense of her honor&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"/&gt;

Some rights which the wife owes to her husband are:

* Being head of the household
* To be obeyed in all that is not disobedience to Allah
* Marital relations
* That she not allow anyone in the house of whom he disapproves
* That she not leave the house without his permission
* That she protect his property
* To be thanked for his efforts
* That she can only undertake a voluntary fast with his permission

These are some of the rights which spouses owe one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_8.php Rights of spouses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#15.

'''The Lancaster Environment Centre''' ('''LEC''') in [[Lancaster, England]], is an interdisciplinary centre for teaching, research and collaboration at [[Lancaster University]], founded in 2003.

==Facilities==
Its facilities were a joint investment eventually costing over £35 million by [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] / [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology|CEH]] and Lancaster University. There are CEH and Lancaster University laboratories, developed partly by a new extension to Lancaster University’s former Biological and Environmental Sciences building and partly by extensive refurbishment of areas of the existing laboratories. Research activities span both organisations. There are extensive research laboratories, fifteen glasshouses and ten walk-in controlled environment rooms. These include high-grade containment facilities for research with genetically modified organisms and radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/about/ | title = Lancaster Environment Centre Website| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/news/lecopen.htm| title = LEC News Article| accessdate = 2007-10-29| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118085642/http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/news/lecopen.htm| archivedate = 18 November 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gordon Manley]] Building, (LEC III) was opened by [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Lord Rees of Ludlow Kt]]. The £8.4m building provides new office, laboratory and meeting-room space for geographers and environmental scientists, and provides offices, meeting and training rooms for LEC’s Enterprise &amp; Business Partnerships Team and offices for companies wishing to locate into LEC or to co-locate new activities.

In addition to the main site is a 1000m² [[prefabricated building]] at the northern end of [[campus]], which houses environmental engineering and instrumentation workshops and large-scale sample preparation facilities for CEH. There is a weather station and several field stations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/facilities/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The research themes of LEC are organised around several Grand Challenges:&lt;ref name="lancaster.ac.uk"&gt;http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/research/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Agri-Food - facilitate the development of globally relevant and accessible food systems by 2030.
* Eco-Innovation - sustainable patterns of consumption and production 
* Sustainable Catchments
* Tropical Futures

Specific research groups were reorganized in 2016:&lt;ref name="lancaster.ac.uk"/&gt;
*Atmosphere, Climate and Pollution -  the sources, transformation, trends and fate of chemicals in the environment with a focus on atmospheric composition, air quality and climate.
* Critical Geographies -  critical geographies that are vital to sustainability, social and environmental justice and our collective futures. 
* Earth Science: Volcanology and Hazards, Contemporary Environmental Processes, Sub-surface Fluids, and Palaeoclimatology and Palaeoenvironments.
* Ecology and Conservation -  molecular, behavioural and ecological techniques to understand how ecosystems function, how they respond to global change, and how they can be managed to enhance biodiversity and its associated services.
* Environmental and Biogeochemistry -  inorganic chemistry, stable and radioactive isotopes, noble gases, and trace organic analysis. 
* Geospatial Data Science -  innovative spatial techniques in order to increase our understanding of a wide range of environmental and socio-ecological systems.
* Political Ecology - relationship between culture, politics and nature.
* Soil, Plant and Land Systems - molecular to the crop scale 
* Water Science 
* Pentland Centre - transdisciplinary research on sustainability and business, jointly with the Management School.  
* Centre for Global Ecoinnovation - positive environmental impacts through new products, processes and services for the global marketplace.

The science programmes and themes of CEH are:

*Water
*Biodiversity
*Biogeochemistry
*Environmental Informatics
*Climate Change
*Sustainable Economies

These provide a range of research interests within the Lancaster Environment Centre and are post-disciplinary.  A Graduate School of the Environment was launched in 2016, to provide a focus for Masters and PhD students, in partnership with CEH and [[Rothamsted Research]].

== LEC Centres ==

In addition to this research endeavour, the two organisations developed research centres to provide a specific strategic research focus on particular areas of current concern. These undertake [[blue skies research]] and provide a strategic focus for LEC's collaborative work with science users, including policymakers and industry. Most have now been folded into the research groups noted above.

They included:

===The Centre for Sustainable Chemical Management===
Led by Professor Kevin Jones, the Centre has been established to provide an integrated approach covering all aspects of chemical fate, behaviour and effects. This ranges from development of new chemicals designed for fitness of purpose without resulting in adverse impact on human health or the environment to safe disposal options. This includes providing input to the "design" of new chemicals that are "fit for their purpose" but avoid the physico-chemical properties which lead to undesirable traits in the environment, such as persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.

===The Centre for Environmental Informatics===
Led by Professor Ian Marshall, the Centre is currently targeting the development of self-managing heterogeneous infrastructures for data gathering and analysis at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales for both science and industry.

According to the '''Life-span model of motivation''' the personal goals that individuals set are a function of the opportunities and challenges that are present in their social environment. Personal goals are an important determinant to the way individuals direct their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-01-01|title=Personal project pursuit: Goals, action, and human flourishing.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-11798-000|journal=APA PsycNET|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model introduces four key processes; channeling, choice, co-agency and compensation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmela-Aro|first=Katariina|date=2009-03-01|title=Personal goals and well-being during critical life transitions: The four C's—Channelling, choice, co-agency and compensation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260809000045|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|series=Linked Lives and Self-Regulation.

== The 4 C's ==
Developmental trajectories are ''channeled'' by the [[social environment]], which represents the "opportunity space" for development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, individuals are active agents in constructing their development, and hence make ''choices'' regarding their goals and commitments. Given that development occurs in a social context, others in the environment such as peers, family members or teachers have a role in ''co-regulation'' of development. And last, success and failures in personal goals and tasks serve as feedback and basis for ''compensation'' in order to optimize development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C0zbcXRqyMIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Developmental+Regulation+in+Adulthood:+Age-Normative+and+Sociostructural+Constraints+as+Adaptive+Challenges&amp;ots=XfOdup072Z&amp;sig=g96rMe7VkZQwL1MvcrT5PktzLLo#v=onepage&amp;q=Developmental%20Regulation%20in%20Adulthood:%20Age-Normative%20and%20Sociostructural%20Constraints%20as%20Adaptive%20Challenges&amp;f=false|title=Developmental Regulation in Adulthood: Age-Normative and Sociostructural Constraints as Adaptive Challenges|last=Heckhausen|first=Jutta|date=2006-06-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521027137|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">A '''ligule''' (from {{Lang-la|ligula}} "strap", variant of ''lingula'', from ''lingua'' "tongue") — is a thin outgrowth at the junction of [[leaf]] and leafstalk of many [[Poaceae|grasses (Poaceae)]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the [[corolla (flower)|corolla]], such as that of a [[ray floret]] in plants in the daisy family [[Asteraceae]].

==Poaceae and Cyperaceae==
[[Image:Ligula.jpg|200px|right]]
The ligule is part of the leaf that is found at the junction of the blade and sheath of the leaf. It may take several forms, but it is commonly some form of translucent membrane or a fringe of hairs. The membranous ligule can be very short 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Kentucky bluegrass]], ''Poa pratensis'') to very long 10&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Johnson grass]], ''Sorghum halepense''), it can also be smooth on the edge or very ragged. Some grasses do not have a ligule, for example barnyardgrass (''[[Echinochloa crus-galli]]'').

A ligule can also be defined as a membrane-like tissue or row of delicate hairs typically found in grasses at the junction of the leaf sheath and blade. The ligule appears to be a continuation of the leaf sheath and encircles or clasps the stem as does the leaf sheath. The three basic types of ligules are: membranous, a fringe of hairs (ciliate), and absent or lacking. Most grasses have ligules, and the shape, length, and appearance of the ligule margin provide consistent characters for separating genera and some species of grasses.

In grass-like plants such as sedges ([[Cyperaceae]]) and rushes ([[Juncaceae]]), ligules are usually absent or poorly developed.

==Asteraceae==

In members of [[Asteraceae]], a '''ligule''' is the elongated tongue of the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] of a [[ray flower]] or [[ligulate flower]].&lt;ref name=CDF&gt;Sia Morhardt, Emil Morhardt, California Desert Flowers, University of California Press, pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubmosses==
The microphylls of [[Lycopodiophyta]] of the families [[Selaginellaceae]] (spikemosses or lesser clubmosses) and [[Isoetaceae]] (quillworts) have minute, scale-like flaps of tissue called ligules at the base of the upper surface of each leaf blade. This feature distinguishes them from clubmosses of the family [[Lycopodiaceae]].&lt;ref name=Stace&gt;{{cite book|last=Stace|first=C. A.|authorlink = Stace, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15556">The '''measure problem''' in [[cosmology]] concerns how to compute fractions of [[universes]] of different types within a [[multiverse]]. It typically arises in the context of [[eternal inflation]]. The problem arises because different approaches to calculating these fractions yield different results, and it's not clear which approach (if any) is correct.&lt;ref name=Carroll2011 /&gt;

Measures can be evaluated by whether they predict observed physical constants, as well as whether they avoid counterintuitive implications, such as the [[Fermi paradox#Inflation hypothesis and the youngness argument|youngness paradox]] or [[Boltzmann brain]]s.&lt;ref name=LindeVanchurinWinitzki2009&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrei Linde|author2=Vitaly Vanchurin|author3=Sergei Winitzki|title=Stationary Measure in the Multiverse|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|date=15 Jan 2009|issue=01|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2009/01/031|arxiv = 0812.0005 |bibcode = 2009JCAP...01..031L|volume=2009|pages=031}}&lt;/ref&gt; While dozens of measures have been proposed,&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrei Linde|author2=Mahdiyar Noorbala|title=Measure problem for eternal and non-eternal inflation|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|date=9 Sep 2010|issue=09|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2010/09/008|arxiv = 1006.2170 |bibcode = 2010JCAP...09..008L|volume=2010|pages=008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} few physicists consider the problem to be solved.&lt;ref name=WolchoverByrne2014 /&gt;

==The problem==

Infinite multiverse theories are becoming increasingly popular, but because they involve infinitely many instances of different types of universes, it's unclear how to compute the fractions of each type of universe.&lt;ref name=WolchoverByrne2014 /&gt; [[Alan Guth]] put it this way:&lt;ref name=WolchoverByrne2014 /&gt;
: In a single universe, cows born with two heads are rarer than cows born with one head. [But in an infinitely branching multiverse] there are an infinite number of one-headed cows and an infinite number of two-headed cows. What happens to the ratio?

[[Sean M. Carroll]] offered another informal example:&lt;ref name=Carroll2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|title=The Eternally Existing, Self-Reproducing, Frequently Puzzling Inflationary Universe|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/10/21/the-eternally-existing-self-reproducing-frequently-puzzling-inflationary-universe/|accessdate=8 January 2015|publisher=Discover|date=21 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Say there are an infinite number of universes in which George W. Bush became President in 2000, and also an infinite number in which Al Gore became President in 2000. To calculate the fraction N(Bush)/N(Gore), we need to have a measure — a way of taming those infinities. Usually this is done by “regularization.” We start with a small piece of universe where all the numbers are finite, calculate the fraction, and then let our piece get bigger, and calculate the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that our fraction approaches.
Different procedures for computing the limit of this fraction yield wildly different answers.&lt;ref name=Carroll2011 /&gt;

One way to illustrate how different regularization methods produce different answers is to calculate the limit of the fraction of sets positive integers that are even. Suppose the integers are ordered the usual way,

: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...

At a ''cutoff'' of "the first five elements of the list", the fraction is 2/5; at a cutoff of "the first six elements" the fraction is 1/2; the limit of the fraction, as the subset grows, converges to 1/2. However, if the integers are ordered in a different way,

: 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 8, 5, 10, 12, 7, 14, 16, ...

the limit of the fraction of integers that are even converges to 2/3 rather than 1/2.&lt;ref name="tegmark chapter 11"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|title=Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality|date=2014|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=Chapter 11|isbn=9780307744258|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular way to decide what ordering to use in regularization is to pick the simplest or most natural-seeming method of ordering. Everyone agrees that the first sequence, ordered by increasing size of the integers, seems more natural. Similarly, many physicists agree that the "proper-time cutoff measure" (below) seems the simplest and most natural method of regularization. Unfortunately, the proper-time cutoff measure seems to produce incorrect results.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="tegmark chapter 11"/&gt;

The measure problem is important in cosmology because in order to compare cosmological theories in an infinite multiverse, we need to know which types of universes theories predict to be more common than others.&lt;ref name=WolchoverByrne2014 /&gt;

==Proposed measures==
[[File:Measure problem.svg|thumb|right|550px|In this toy multiverse, the left-hand region exits inflation (red line) later than the right-hand region does. With the proper-time cutoff shown by the black dotted lines, the immediately post-inflation portion of the left-hand universe dominates the measure, flooding the measure with five "Boltzmann babies" (red) that are freakishly young. Extending the proper-time cutoff to later times does not help, as other regions (not pictured) that exit inflation even later would then dominate. With the scale-factor cutoff shown by the gray dotted lines, only observers who exist before the region has expanded by the scale factor are counted, giving normal observers (blue) time to dominate the measure, while the left-hand universe hits the scale cutoff even before it exits inflation in this example.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;]]

===Proper-time cutoff===

The ''proper-time cutoff measure'' considers the probability &lt;math&gt;P(\phi, t)&lt;/math&gt; of finding a given scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; at a given [[proper time]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|1–2}} During [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], the region around a point grows like &lt;math&gt;e^{3 H \Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; in a small proper-time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|1}}

This measure has the advantage of being stationary in the sense that probabilities remain the same over time in the limit of large &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|1}} However, it suffers from the ''youngness paradox'', which has the effect of making it exponentially more probable that we'd be in regions of high temperature, in conflict with what we observe; this is because regions that exited inflation later than our region, spent more time than us experiencing runaway inflationary exponential growth.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}} For example, observers in a Universe of 13.7 billion years old (our observed age) are outnumbered by observers in a 13.0 billion year old Universe by a factor of &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{60}}&lt;/math&gt;. This lopsidedness continues, until the most numerous observers resembling us are "Boltzmann babies" formed by improbable fluctuations in the hot, very early, Universe. Therefore, physicists reject the simple proper-time cutoff as a failed hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Bousso, R., Freivogel, B., &amp; Yang, I. S. (2008). Boltzmann babies in the proper time measure. Physical Review D, 77(10), 103514.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale-factor cutoff===

Time can be parameterized in different ways than proper time.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|1}} One choice is to parameterize by the scale factor of space &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, or more commonly by &lt;math&gt;\eta \sim \log a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|1}} Then a given region of space expands as &lt;math&gt;e^{3\Delta \eta}&lt;/math&gt;, independent of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|1}}

This approach can be generalized to a family of measures in which a small region grows as &lt;math&gt;e^{3 H^\beta \Delta t_\beta}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and time-slicing approach &lt;math&gt;t_\beta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|1–2}} Any choice for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; remains stationary for large times.

The ''scale-factor cutoff measure'' takes &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which avoids the youngness paradox by not giving greater weight to regions that retain high energy density for long periods. &lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}}

This measure is very sensitive to the choice of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; because any &lt;math&gt;\beta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; yields the youngness paradox, while any &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; yields an "oldness paradox" in which most life is predicted to exist in cold, empty space as Boltzmann brains rather than as the evolved creatures with orderly experiences that we seem to be.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}}

De Simone et al. (2010) consider the scale-factor cutoff measure to be a very promising solution to the measure problem.&lt;ref name=DeSimoneEtAl2010 /&gt; This measure has also been shown to produce good agreement with observational values of the [[cosmological constant]].&lt;ref name=DeSimoneEtAl2008&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrea De Simone|author2=Alan H. Guth|author3=Michael P. Salem|author4=Alexander Vilenkin|title=Predicting the cosmological constant with the scale-factor cutoff measure|journal=Phys. Rev.

The '''stationary measure''' proceeds from the observation that different processes achieve stationarity of &lt;math&gt;P(\phi, t)&lt;/math&gt; at different times.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}} Thus, rather than comparing processes at a given time since the beginning, the stationary measure compares them in terms of time since each process individually become stationary.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}} For instance, different regions of the universe can be compared based on time since star formation began.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|3}}

[[Andrei Linde]] and coauthors have suggested that the stationary measure avoids both the youngness paradox and Boltzmann brains.&lt;ref name=LindeVanchurinWinitzki2009 /&gt; However, the stationary measure predicts extreme (either very large or very small) values of the [[primordial density contrast]] &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and the [[gravitational constant]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, inconsistent with observations.&lt;ref name=DeSimoneEtAl2010&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrea De Simone|author2=Alan H. Guth|author3=Andrei Linde|author4=Mahdiyar Noorbala|author5=Michael P. Salem|author6=Alexander Vilenkin|title=Boltzmann brains and the scale-factor cutoff measure of the multiverse|journal=Phys. Rev. D|date=14 Sep 2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.82.063520|arxiv = 0808.3778 |bibcode = 2010PhRvD..82f3520D|volume=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

===Causal diamond===

[[Inflation (cosmology)#Reheating|Reheating]] marks the end of inflation. The ''causal diamond'' is the finite four-volume formed by intersecting the future [[light cone]] of an observer crossing the reheating hypersurface with the past light cone of the point where the observer has exited a given vacuum.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}} Put another way, the causal diamond is&lt;ref name=WolchoverByrne2014 /&gt;
: the largest swath accessible to a single observer traveling from the beginning of time to the end of time. The finite boundaries of a causal diamond are formed by the intersection of two cones of light, like the dispersing rays from a pair of flashlights pointed toward each other in the dark. One cone points outward from the moment matter was created after a Big Bang — the earliest conceivable birth of an observer — and the other aims backward from the farthest reach of our future horizon, the moment when the causal diamond becomes an empty, timeless void and the observer can no longer access information linking cause to effect.

The ''causal diamond measure'' multiplies the following quantities:&lt;ref name=Bousso2006&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raphael Bousso|title=Holographic probabilities in eternal inflation|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=6 November 2006|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.191302|arxiv = hep-th/0605263 |bibcode = 2006PhRvL..97s1302B|volume=97|pmid=17155610|page=191302}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,4}}
* the prior probability that a [[world line]] enters a given vacuum
* the probability that observers emerge in that vacuum, approximated as the difference in entropy between exiting and entering the diamond. ("[T]he more free energy, the more likely it is that observers will emerge.")
Different prior probabilities of vacuum types yield different results.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}} Entropy production can be approximated as the number of galaxies in the diamond.&lt;ref name=LindeNoorbala2010 /&gt;{{rp|2}}

An attraction of this approach is that it avoids comparing infinities, which is the original source of the measure problem.&lt;ref name=WolchoverByrne2014&gt;{{cite news|author1=Natalie Wolchover|author2=Peter Byrne|title=In a Multiverse, What Are the Odds?|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20141103-in-a-multiverse-what-are-the-odds/|accessdate=8 January 2015|date=3 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watcher===

The ''watcher measure'' imagines the world line of an eternal "watcher" that passes through an infinite number of [[big crunch]] singularities.&lt;ref name=GarrigaVilenkin2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jaume Garriga|author2=Alexander Vilenkin|title=Watchers of the multiverse|date=24 Apr 2013|arxiv=1210.7540|bibcode = 2013JCAP...05..037G |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2013/05/037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guth-Vanchurin paradox ==

In all "cutoff" schemes for an expanding infinite multiverse, a finite percentage of observers reach the cutoff during their lifetimes. If our universe doubles in size every five billion years, then under most schemes, if a current observer is still alive five billion years from now, then the later stages of his life must somehow be "discounted" by a factor of two compared to his current stages of life. For such an observer, [[Bayes' theorem]] may appear to break down over this timescale due to anthropic selection effects; this hypothetical breakdown is sometimes called the "Guth-Vanchurin paradox". One proposed resolution to the paradox is to posit a physical "end of time" that has a fifty percent chance of occurring in the next five billion years. Another, overlapping, proposal is to posit that an observer no longer physically exists when it passes outside a given causal patch, similar to models where a particle is destroyed or ceases to exist when it falls through a black hole's event horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Courtland |first1=Rachel |title=Countdown to oblivion: Why time itself could end |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19513-countdown-to-oblivion-why-time-itself-could-end/ |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freivogel |first1=Ben |title=Making predictions in the multiverse |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |date=21 October 2011 |volume=28 |issue=20 |pages=204007 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/20/204007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guth and Vanchurin have pushed back on such "end of time" proposals, stating that while "(later) stages of my life will contribute (less) to multiversal averages" than earlier stages, this paradox need not be interpreted as a physical "end of time".&lt;ref&gt;Guth, Alan H., and Vitaly Vanchurin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43392">'''Mycoremediation''' (from [[ancient Greek]] ''μύκης (mukēs)'', meaning "fungus" and the suffix ''-remedium'', in [[Latin]] meaning 'restoring balance') is a form of [[bioremediation]] in which [[fungi]]-based [[technology]] is used to [[decontamination|decontaminate]] the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Fungi have been proven to be a very cheap, effective and environmentally sound way for helping to remove a wide array of toxins from damaged environments or [[wastewater]]. The toxins include [[heavy metals]], persistent organic pollutants, textile [[dyes]], [[leather tanning]] industry chemicals and wastewater, petroleum fuels, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]], pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides and herbicide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deshmukh|first1=Radhika|last2=Khardenavis|first2=Anshuman A.|last3=Purohit|first3=Hemant J.|date=2016|title=Diverse Metabolic Capacities of Fungi for Bioremediation|journal=Indian Journal of Microbiology|volume=56|issue=3|pages=247–264|doi=10.1007/s12088-016-0584-6|issn=0046-8991|pmc=4920763|pmid=27407289}}&lt;/ref&gt; in land, fresh water and marine environments.

Mycoremediation is one of the cheaper solutions to remediation, and it doesn't usually require expensive equipment. For this reasons it is often used also in small scale applications, such as [[mycofiltration]] of domestic [[wastewater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molla|first1=Abul Hossain|last2=Fakhru'l-Razi|first2=Ahmadun|title=Mycoremediation--a prospective environmental friendly technique of bioseparation and dewatering of domestic wastewater sludge|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International|date=2012|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1612–1619|doi=10.1007/s11356-011-0676-0|language=en|issn=1614-7499|quote=Within 2-3 days of treatment application, encouraging results were achieved in total dry solids (TDS), total suspended solid (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), and pH due to fungal treatment in recognition of bioseparation and dewaterability of wastewater sludge compared to control.|pmid=22134862}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to help with the decomposition process of a [[compost toilet]].

=== Metals ===
Pollution from metals is very common, as they are used in many industrial processes such as [[electroplating]], [[paint]] and [[leather]]. The wastewater from these industries is often used for agricultural purposes, so besides the immediate damage to the ecosystem it is spilled into, the metals can enter far away creatures and humans through the food chain. Mycoremediation is one of the cheapest, most effective and environmental-friendly solutions to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshi|first1=P. K.|last2=Swarup|first2=Anand|last3=Maheshwari|first3=Sonu|last4=Kumar|first4=Raman|last5=Singh|first5=Namita|title=Bioremediation of Heavy Metals in Liquid Media Through Fungi Isolated from Contaminated Sources|journal=Indian Journal of Microbiology|date=October 2011|volume=51|issue=4|pages=482–487|doi=10.1007/s12088-011-0110-9|language=en|issn=0046-8991|quote=Wastewater particularly from electroplating, paint, leather, metal and tanning industries contain enormous amount of heavy metals. Microorganisms including fungi have been reported to exclude heavy metals from wastewater through bioaccumulation and biosorption at low cost and in eco-friendly way.|pmc=3209935|pmid=23024411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many fungi are [[hyperaccumulators]], that means they are able to concentrate toxins in their fruiting bodies for later removal. This is usually true for [[populations]] that have been exposed to contaminants for long time, and have developed a high tolerance, and happens via [[biosorption]] on the cellular surface, which means that the metals enter the mycelium in a passive way with very little intracellular uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gazem|first1=MufedaA.H.|last2=Nazareth|first2=Sarita|title=Sorption of lead and copper from an aqueous phase system by marine-derived Aspergillus species|journal=Annals of Microbiology|date=1 June 2013|volume=63|issue=2|pages=503–511|doi=10.1007/s13213-012-0495-7|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13213-012-0495-7|accessdate=25 September 2017|language=English|issn=1590-4261|quote=The sequestration of the metal occurred mainly by sorption to the cell-surface with very little intracellular uptake.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity of certain fungi to extract metals from the ground also can be useful for [[bioindicator]] purposes, and can be a problem when the mushroom is an edible one. For example, the shaggy ink cap (''[[Coprinus comatus]]''), a common edible north-hemisphere mushroom, can be a very good bioindicator of mercury, and accumulate it in its body, which can also be toxic to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falandysz|first1=Jerzy|title=Mercury bio-extraction by fungus Coprinus comatus: a possible bioindicator and mycoremediator of polluted soils?|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International|date=2016|volume=23|issue=8|pages=7444–7451|doi=10.1007/s11356-015-5971-8|language=en|issn=1614-7499|quote=Eating them when foraged from the urban places can provide to a consumer Hg at relatively high dose, while unresolved question is absorption rate of Hg compounds contained in ingested mushroom meal.|pmid=26705753|pmc=4846694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dyes ===

[[Dye]]s are used in many industries, like paper printing or textile. They are often recalcitant to degradation and in some cases, like some [[azo dyes]], [[cancerogenic]] or otherwise toxic.

The mechanism the fungi degrade this dyes is their lignolytic enzymes, especially laccase, so white rot mushrooms are the most commonly used.

Mycoremediation has proven to be a cheap and effective remediation technology for dyes such as [[malachite green]], [[nigrosin]] and [[basic fuchsin]] with ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and ''[[Phanerochaete chrysosporium]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rani|first1=Babita|last2=Kumar|first2=Vivek|last3=Singh|first3=Jagvijay|last4=Bisht|first4=Sandeep|last5=Teotia|first5=Priyanku|last6=Sharma|first6=Shivesh|last7=Kela|first7=Ritu|title=Bioremediation of dyes by fungi isolated from contaminated dye effluent sites for bio-usability|journal=Brazilian Journal of Microbiology|date=9 October 2014|volume=45|issue=3|pages=1055–1063|language=en|issn=1517-8382|quote=Aspergillus niger recorded maximum decolorization of the dye Basic fuchsin (81.85%) followed by Nigrosin (77.47%), Malachite green (72.77%) and dye mixture (33.08%) under shaking condition.

== Synergy with phytoremediation ==

[[Phytoremediation]] is the use of plant-based technologies to decontamination an area. Most of the plants can form a symbiosis with fungi, from which both the organisms get an advantage. This relationship is called [[mycorrhiza]].

Mycorrhizal fungi, especially [[arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] (AMF), can greatly improve the phytoremediation capacity of some plants. This is mostly because the stress the plants suffer because of the pollutants is greatly reduced in presence of AMF, so they can grow more and produce more biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabie|first1=Gamal H.|title=Role of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Phytoremediation of Soil Rhizosphere Spiked with Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons|journal=Mycobiology|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.4489/MYCO.2005.33.1.041|language=en|issn=1229-8093|quote=As consequence of the treatment with Am [Arbuscolar mycorrhize], the plants provide a greater sink for the contaminants since they are better able to survive and grow.|pmc=3774856|pmid=24049473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi also provide more nutrition, especially [[phosphorus]], and promotes the overall health of the plant. The mycelium quick expansion also can greatly extend the rhizosphere influenze zone ([[hyphosphere]]), providing the plant with access to more nutrients and contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajtor|first1=Monika|last2=Piotrowska-Seget|first2=Zofia|title=Prospects for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to assist in phytoremediation of soil hydrocarbon contaminants|journal=Chemosphere|date=2016|volume=162|pages=105–116|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.071|issn=1879-1298|quote=AMF have been considered to be a tool to enhance phytoremediation, as their mycelium create a widespread underground network that acts as a bridge between plant roots, soil and rhizosphere microorganisms.

NAPLPS was developed from the [[Telidon]] system developed in Canada, with a small number of additions from [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]. The basics of NAPLPS were later used as the basis for several other [[microcomputer]]-based graphics systems.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Viewtron testing area.jpg|thumb|left|NAPLPS graphics on [[Viewtron]]]] --&gt;

The Canadian [[Communications Research Centre]] (CRC), based in [[Ottawa]], had been working on various graphics systems since the late 1960s, much of it led by Herb Bown.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Cynthia Boyko, [http://www.friendsofcrc.ca/Projects/Telidon/Telidon.html "Telidon"], Friends of the CRC, 14 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1970s they turned their attention to building out a system of "picture description instructions", which encoded graphics commands as a text stream. Graphics were encoded as a series of instructions (graphics primitives) each represented by a single [[ASCII]] character. Graphic coordinates were encoded in multiple 6 bit strings of XY coordinate data, flagged to place them in the printable ASCII range so that they could be transmitted with conventional text transmission techniques. [[Shift Out and Shift In characters|ASCII SI/SO]] characters were used to differentiate the text from graphic portions of a transmitted "page". These instructions were decoded by separate programs to produce graphics output, on a [[plotter]] for instance. Other work produced a fully interactive version. In 1975, the CRC gave a contract to Norpak to develop an interactive graphics terminal that could decode the instructions and display them on a color display.

During this period, a number of companies were developing the first [[teletext]] systems, notably the [[BBC]]'s [[Ceefax]] system. Ceefax encoded character data into the lines in the [[vertical blanking interval]]  of normal [[television]] signals where they could not be seen on-screen, and then used a buffer and decoder in the user's television to convert these into "pages" of text on the display. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] quickly introduced their own [[ORACLE (teletext)|ORACLE]] system, and the two organizations subsequently agreed to use a single standard, the "Broadcast Teletext Specification".

At about the same time, other organizations were developing [[videotex]] systems, similar to teletext except they used modems to transmit their data instead of television signals. This was potentially slower and used up a telephone line, but had the major advantage of allowing the user to transmit data back to the sender.  The UK's [[General Post Office]] developed a system using the Ceefax/ORACLE standard, launching it as [[Prestel]], while France prepared the first steps for its ultimately very successful [[Minitel]] system, using a rival display standard called [[Antiope (teletext)|Antiope]].

By 1977 the Norpak system was running, and from this work the CRC decided to create their own teletext/videotext system. Unlike the systems being rolled out in Europe, the CRC decided from the start that the system should be able to run on any combination of communications links. For instance, it could use the vertical blanking interval to send data to the user, and a modem to return selections to the servers. It could be used in a one-way or two-way system.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt;

In teletext mode, character codes were sent to users' televisions by encoding them as dot patterns in the vertical blanking interval of the video signal. Various technical "tweaks" and details of the [[NTSC]] signals used by North American televisions allowed the downstream videotex channel to increase to 600 bit/s, about twice that used in the European systems. In videotext mode, [[Bell 202]] modems were typical, offering a 1,200 bit/s download rate. A set top box attached to the TV decoded these signals back into text and graphic pages, which the user could select among. 

The system was publicly launched as '''Telidon''' on August 15, 1978. Compared to the European standards, the CRC system was faster, bi-directional, and offered real graphics as opposed to simple [[character graphic]]s. The downside of the system was that it required much more advanced decoders, typically featuring [[Zilog Z80]] or [[Motorola 6809]] processors with RGB and/or RF output. The [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]] (then Department of Communications) launched a four-year plan to fund public roll-outs of the technology in an effort to spur the development of a commercial Telidon system.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt;

[[AT&amp;T Corporation]] was so impressed by Telidon that they decided to join the project. They added a number of useful extensions, notably the ability to define original graphics commands (''macro'') and character sets (''DRCS''). They also tabled algorithms for proportionally spaced text, which greatly improved the quality of the displayed pages. A joint [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]]/[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] working group (X3L2.1) revised the specifications, which were submitted for standardization. In 1983, they became CSA T500 and ANSI X3.110, or NAPLPS. The data encoding system was also standardized as the [[NABTS]] (North American Broadcast Teletext Specification) protocol.

Business models for Telidon services were poorly developed. Unlike the UK, where teletext was supported by one of only two large companies whose whole revenue model was based on a read-only medium (television), in [[North America]] Telidon was being offered by companies who worked on a subscriber basis.

== One-way systems ==

Telidon-based [[teletext]] was tested in a few North American trials in the early 1980s &amp;mdash; [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] IRIS, [[TVOntario]], [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]]-sponsored [[Project IDA]], to name a few.

NAPLPS was also part of the [[NABTS]] teletext standard, for the encoding and display of teletext pages.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[SportsChannel]] ran a service called [[Sports Plus Network]], which ran sports news and scores while SportsChannel was not otherwise on the air. The screens, which frequently featured team logos or likenesses of players in addition to text, were drawn entirely with NAPLPS graphics and resembled the loading of [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] pages over a modem, though slightly faster.

== Two-way systems ==

Various two-way systems using NAPLPS appeared in North America in the early 1980s. The biggest North American examples were [[Knight Ridder]]'s [[Viewtron]] (based in [[Miami]]) and the [[Los Angeles Times]]' [[Gateway (online service)|Gateway]] service (based in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]). Both used the [[AT&amp;T Sceptre|Sceptre]] NAPLPS terminal from AT&amp;T. The Sceptre contained a slow modem that connected over the consumer's telephone line to host computers. The Sceptre was expensive whether purchased or rented. Despite huge investments by their parent companies, neither Viewtron nor Gateway lasted into the second half of the decade. Another system - Keycom - was developed by a joint venture of Honeywell, Centel (since acquired by Sprint) and the Chicago Sun Times newspaper. Keycom used a proprietary NAPLPS terminal device.

Other early-1980s NAPLPS technology was deployed in Canada, both as a way for rural Canadians to get news and weather information and as the platform for touchscreen information kiosks. In [[Vancouver]] these were featured at [[Expo 86]].  The kiosks became ubiquitous in [[Toronto]] under the name ''Teleguide,'' and were deployed in many shopping centres and at major tourist attractions. The latter city was the North American nexus of NAPLPS and the home of [[Norpak]], the most successful of NAPLPS-oriented developers. Norpak created and sold hardware and software for NAPLPS development and display. [[TVOntario]] also developed NAPLPS content creation software.

London, Ontario - based Cableshare used NAPLPS as the basis of touch-screen information kiosks for shopping malls, the flagship of which was deployed at Toronto's [[Eaton Centre]]. The system relied on an 8085-based microcomputer which drove several NAPLPS terminals fitted with touch screens, all communicating via [[Datapac]] to a back end database. The system offered news, weather and sports information along with shopping mall guides and coupons. Cableshare also developed and sold a leading NAPLPS page creation utility called the "Picture Painter."

In the late 1980s, [[Tribune Media Services]] (TMS) and the [[Associated Press]] operated a cable television channel called AP News Plus that provided NAPLPS-based news screens to [[cable television]] subscribers in many U.S. cities. The news pages were created and edited by TMS staffers working on an [[Atex (software)|Atex]] editing system in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]], and sent by satellite to NAPLPS decoder devices located at the local cable television companies. Among the firms providing technology to TMS and the Associated Press for the AP News Plus channel was [[Minneapolis]]-based Electronic Publishers Inc. (1985–1988).

In 1981, two amateur radio operators (VE3FTT and VE3GQW) received special permission from the Canadian Department of Communications to carry out on-air experiments using NAPLPS syntax which was technically not legal at the time because it was a "coded transmission".  Following their report on the success of the tests, the DOC then permitted general use of NAPLPS on amateur radioteletype.  This was reported in the ARRL Radio Handbook for several years following.

Between 1988 and 1994, [[Bell Canada]] offered a [[Modem|dial-up]] Telidon service called [[Alex (videotex service)|Alex]], similar in spirit to the French [[Minitel]], with the telephone directory its principal information offering.

== Decline ==
NAPLPS lived on into the early 1990s as the graphical basis for the [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] online service. Some [[bulletin board system|bulletin board]]s were able to serve NAPLPS content to callers on their 1200 and 2400 bit/s [[modem]]s. But the technology's chief advantage in an era of slow telecommunication - its ability to encode complex graphics in terse object commands - became moot as data communication speeds increased and [[raster graphics]] compression became popular.

== Legacy ==
In the 1980s the [[Graphical Kernel System]] (GKS) [[Library (computing)|library]], based on a 1970s specification with a similar basic geometry and command structure to NAPLPS, was widely implemented on microcomputers, and became the basis of [[Digital Research]]'s "GSX" graphics system used in their [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. GKS was later extended into a 3D version, and additions to this resulted in [[PHIGS]] (Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System), a competitor to [[OpenGL]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17017">'''Neuroergonomics''' is the application of [[neuroscience]] to [[ergonomics]].  Traditional ergonomic studies rely predominantly on [[psychological]] explanations to address [[human factors]] issues such as: work performance, operational safety, and workplace-related risks (e.g., repetitive stress injuries).  Neuroergonomics, in contrast, addresses the biological substrates of ergonomic concerns, with an emphasis on the role of the human nervous system.

==Overview==
Neuroergonomics has two major aims: to use existing/emerging knowledge of human performance and brain function to design systems for safer and more efficient operation, and to advance this understanding of the relationship between brain function and performance in real-world tasks.

To meet these goals, neuroergonomics combines two disciplines—neuroscience, the study of brain function, and human factors, the study of how to match technology with the capabilities and limitations of people so they can work effectively and safely. The goal of merging these two fields is to use the startling discoveries of human brain and physiological functioning both to inform the design of technologies in the workplace and home, and to provide new training methods that enhance performance, expand capabilities, and optimize the fit between people and technology.

Research in the area of neuroergonomics has blossomed in recent years with the emergence of noninvasive techniques for monitoring human brain function that can be used to study various aspects of human behavior in relation to technology and work, including [[mental workload]], visual [[attention]], [[working memory]], [[motor control]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-automation interaction]], and adaptive [[automation]]. Consequently, this [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] is concerned with investigations of the [[nervous system|neural]] bases of human [[perception]], [[cognition]], and performance in relation to systems and technologies in the [[real life|real world]]—for example, in the use of [[computer]]s and various other machines at home or in the workplace, and in operating vehicles such as aircraft, cars, trains, and ships.

Some studies have shown the promise of using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) and [[transcranial direct-current stimulation]] (tDCS) to improve cognitive skills during tasks. While initially used to treat various neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease or dementia, the scope of TMS is expanding. In TMS, electricity is passed through a magnetic coil that is positioned near the person’s scalp. Results from studies show that noninvasive brain stimulation leads to 20 more minutes of sustained vigilance performance.&lt;ref&gt;R. Andy, M., Nathaniel, B., Craig M., W., &amp; Jeremy, N. (n.d). Modulating the brain at work using noninvasive transcranial stimulation. ''NeuroImage'', 59(Neuroergonomics: The human brain in action and at work), 129-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroimaging &amp; Mental Workload==
A major component of neuroergonomic studies has been neuroimaging. There are two ways that neuroimaging methods are used. The first way is to display cerebral metabolic processes associated with neural activity with the use of a [[functional MRI]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial Doppler]] (TCD) sonography. An fMRI allows for researchers to localize neural activity within the brain. One of the major advantages of fMRI is the fact that it is a noninvasive imaging method. Before the invention of the fMRI, methods such as positron emission tomography required the injection of a radioactive tracer.&lt;ref&gt;Kalbfleisch, M. (2008). Getting to the Heart of the Brain: Using Cognitive Neuroscience to Explore the Nature of Human Ability and Performance.''Roeper Review'', 30(3), 162-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The second way that neuroimaging is used is to identify the timing of neural processing, with the use of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[event-related potentials]] (ERPs).

Using an fMRI, mental workload can be quantified by an increase in cerebral blood flow in regions of the [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC). Many fMRI studies show that there is increased PFC activation during a working memory task. Equally important as measuring mental workload, is evaluating the operator vigilance, or attentiveness. Using TCD to monitor blood flow velocity in intercranial arteries, it was shown that a decrease in blood flow was associated with a decrease in vigilance and depletion of cognitive resources.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, R. (2008). "Putting the brain to work: Neuroergonomics past, present, and future". ''Human Factors'', 50(3), 468-474.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptive Automation==
Adaptive automation, a novel neuroergonomic concept, refers to a human-machine system that uses real-time assessment of the operator’s workload to make the necessary changes to enhance performance. For adaptive automation to work, the system must utilize an accurate operator-state classifier for the real-time assessment. Operator-state classifiers such as discriminant analysis and [[artificial neural networks]] show an accuracy of 70% to 85% in real-time. An important part to properly implementing adaptive automation is figuring out how big a workload needs to be to require intervention. Implementing neuroergonomic adaptive automation would require the development of nonintrusive sensors and even techniques to track eye movement. Current research into assessing a person's mental state includes using [[facial electromyography]] to detect confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Durso, F. T. (2012). "Detecting Confusion Using Facial Electromyography". ''Human Factors'', 54(1), 60-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments show that a human-robot team performs better at controlling air and ground vehicles than either a human or robot (i.e. the automatic target recognition system). When compared to 100% human control and static automation, participants showed higher trust and self-confidence, as well as lower perceived workload, when using adaptive automation.&lt;ref&gt;de Visser, E., &amp; Parasuraman, R. (2011). Adaptive aiding of human-robot teaming: Effects of imperfect automation on performance, trust, and workload. ''Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making'', 5(2), 209-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

In adaptive automation, getting the machine to accurately reason how to respond to the changes and get back to peak performance is the biggest challenge. The machine has to be able to determine to what extent it must make the changes. This is also a consequence of the complexity of the system and factors such as: how easily can the sensed parameter be quantified, how many parameters in the machine’s system can be changed, and how well can these different machine parameters be coordinated.

==Brain Computer Interfaces==
A developing area of research called [[brain-computer interfaces]] (BCIs) strives to use different types of brain signals to operate external devices, without any motor input from the person. BCIs provide promise for patients with limited motor capabilities, such as those with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. When the user engages in a specific mental activity, it generates a unique brain electrical potential that is processed and relayed into a signal for the external device. BCIs using signals from EEGs and ERPs have been used to operate voice synthesizers and move robotic arms. Research for BCIs began in the 1970s at the University of California Los Angeles, and its current focus is towards neuroprosthetic applications. BCIs can be substantially improved by incorporating high-level control, context, the environment, as well as virtual reality into its design.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, B., Leeb, R., Brunner, C., Muller-Putz, G., Bauernfeind, G., Kelly, J., &amp; Neuper, C. (n.d). Toward smarter BCIs: extending BCIs through hybridization and intelligent control. ''Journal of Neural Engineering'', 9(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications in Stroke Rehabilitation===
As of 2011, there has been an effort to applying a rehabilitation robot connected to a non-invasive brain-computer interface to promote brain plasticity and motor learning following a [[stroke]]. Half of stroke survivors experience unilateral paralysis or weakness, and approximately 30-60% of them do not regain function. Typical treatment, post-stroke, involves [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] and robotic therapy, which work to restore motor activity by forcing the movement of the weak limbs. Current active therapy cannot be utilized by patients who suffer complete control loss or paralysis, and do not have any residual motor ability to work with.

With a focus on these underserved patients, a BCI was created that used the electrical brain signals detected by an EEG to control an upper-limb rehabilitative robot. The user is instructed to imagine the motor activity while the EEG picks up the associated brain signals. The BCI uses a linear transformation algorithm to convert the EEG spectral features into commands for the robot. An experiment done on 24 subjects tested a non-BCI group, which used sensorimotor rhythms to control the robot, against the BCI-group, which used the BCI-robot system. The results from the brain-plasticity analysis showed that there was a decrease in [[beta wave]] activity in the subjects of the BCI-group, which is associated with a change in movement. The results also showed that the BCI-group performed better than the non-BCI group in every measure for motor learning.&lt;!--Why does this not violate WP:CRYSTAL? All in all, BCI implementation could help in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke victims, and has great potential in new rehabilitation protocols.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babalola, K. (2011). [http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/41164 Brain-computer interfaces for inducing brain plasticity and motor learning: implications for brain-injury rehabilitation] / by Karolyn Olatubosun Babalola. Atlanta, Ga. : Georgia Institute of Technology, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{undue weight inline|date=November 2012}}

==Virtual Reality==
Virtual reality could allow for testing how human operators would work in dangerous environments without actually putting them in harm’s way. For example, it would allow the testing of how fatigue or a new technology would affect a driver or a pilot in their specific environment, without the possibility of injury. Being able to evaluate the effects of some new workplace technology in virtual reality, before real life implementation, could save money and lives. Bringing virtual reality technology to the point where it can accurately mimic real life is difficult, but its potential is vast.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, R., &amp; Rizzo, M. (2007). ''Neuroergonomics: The brain at work''. Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare Training===
Healthcare training programs have adopted virtual reality simulation (VRS) as a training tool for nursing students. This computer-based three-dimensional simulation tool allows for nursing students to practice various nursing skills repeatedly in a risk-free environment. A nursing program at a major Midwestern state university agreed to utilize a VRS module for teaching the insertion of an intravenous (IV) [[catheter]], and complete an evaluation on the effectiveness of the program. The VRS composed of a computer program and a haptic arm device, which worked together to simulate the feel of vascular access. On the computer screen, the user would have to select the equipment for the procedure in the correct order.  The user then palpates the veins of the haptic arm, and virtually inserts the IV catheter. The program provides immediate feedback by notifying the user when he/she misses a step and needs to restart the procedure.

Results of evaluation pointed to the VRS an “excellent learning tool” for increasing a student’s knowledge on the procedure. All eight of the nursing faculty who participated agreed to this much, and that they would recommend that students work with the VRS before performing the IV catheter insertion on real patients.

This tool allows educators to expose students to an extensive range of real-life patient conditions and nursing experiences. The central advantage of the VRS program is the availability of a variety of case scenarios, which allow students to increase their awareness of differences in patient responses to IV catheter insertion. From the standpoint of the student, the virtual reality simulation helps bridge the gap between nursing theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, C., &amp; Forsyth, D. (2012). Virtual Reality Simulation: Using Three-dimensional Technology to Teach Nursing Students. CIN: Computers, Informatics, Nursing, 30(6), 312-318.&lt;/ref&gt;{{undue weight inline|date=November 2012}}

==Applications for Neurocognitive Disabilities==
Neuroergonomic assessments have tremendous potential for evaluating the psychomotor performance in an individual with a neurocognitive disability or following a stroke or surgery. They would allow for a standardized method for measuring the change in neurocognitive function during rehabilitation for a neurocognitive disability. In terms of rehabilitation, it would allow for the efforts to be goal-oriented. These tests could be applied for measuring change following operational procedures such as neurosurgery, [[carotid endarterectomy]], and [[coronary artery bypass graft]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry J., M., &amp; David J., M. (n.d). Neurocognitive disability, stroke, and surgery: A role for neuroergonomics?. ''Journal of Psychosomatic Research'', 63, 613-615.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for Driving Safety==
One of the main application domains of neuroergonomics is driving safety, especially for older drivers with cognitive impairments. Driving requires the integration of multiple cognitive processes, which can be studied separately if the right kinds of tools are used. The types of tools used to evaluate cognition during driving include driving simulators, instrumented vehicles, and part task simulators.&lt;ref&gt;Lees, M. N., Cosman, J. D., Lee, J. D., Fricke, N., &amp; Rizzo, M. (2010). Translating cognitive neuroscience to the driver's operational environment: A neuroergonomic approach. ''American Journal of Psychology'', 123(4), 391-411.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crossmodal Research Laboratory in Oxford is working on developing a system of warning signals to grab the attention of a distracted driver, in an effort to make driving safer for everybody. The research has found that using auditory icons, such as a car horn, is a better warning signal than a pure tone. On top of that, spatial auditory cues work better at redirecting the driver’s attention than non-spatialized auditory cues. Cues that integrate multiple senses, such as an audiotactile signal, grab attention better than unisensory cues.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, C. (2012). Drive safely with neuroergonomics. ''Psychologist'', 25(9), 664-667.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have evaluated different types of in-vehicle notifications (i.e., auditory icons, speech commands) designed for task management in [[autonomous trucks]] for their relevance to separable neural mechanisms; this serves as an effective method to clarify often conflicting findings drawn from behavioral results alone &lt;ref&gt;Glatz, C., Krupenia, S. S., Bülthoff, H. H., &amp; Chuang, L. L. (2018, April).

== Historical overview ==

===Origins===
The [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted thinkers, such as [[Karl Marx]] with his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. (1967/1845). The German ideology. In L.D.

(1933) ''The human problems of an industrial civilization''. New York: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to inject the impact of work on workers into the subject matter psychology addresses. About the time Taylorism arose, [[James Hartness|Hartness]] reconsidered worker-machine interaction and its impact on worker psychology.&lt;ref name=Hartness1912&gt;{{Citation |last=Hartness |first=James |title=The human factor in works management |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1912 |location=New York and London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB41AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |oclc=1065709 |postscript=.

''Monitor on Psychology'', [[American Psychological Association]]. 33(2). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/milestones.aspx] Retrieved July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When this change was coupled with an increased recognition of the impact of stress on a range of problems in the workplace, NIOSH found that their stress-related programs were significantly increasing in  prominence.&lt;ref name="sauter1999" /&gt; In 1990, Raymond et al.&lt;ref name="Raymond, J. 1990"/&gt; argued that the time has come for doctoral-level psychologists to get interdisciplinary OHP training, integrating [[health psychology]] with [[public health]], because creating healthy workplaces should be a goal for the field.

===Emergence as a discipline===
Established in 1987, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' is the first and "longest established journal in the fast developing discipline that is occupational health psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"&gt;Cox, T., &amp; Tisserand, M. (2006). Editorial: Work &amp; Stress comes of age: Twenty years of occupational health psychology. ''Work &amp; Stress, 20'', 1–5. doi:10.1080/02678370600739795&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) and NIOSH jointly organized the first international Work, Stress, and Health conference in Washington, DC. The conference has since become a biannual OHP meeting.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"&gt;Barling, J., &amp; Griffiths, A. (2011). A history of occupational health psychology. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E.

Washington, D.C., American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the first issue of the ''[[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]]'' was published by APA. That same year, the [[International Commission on Occupational Health]] created the Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS) scientific committee,&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Occupational Health-Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors [http://www.icohweb.org/site/scientific-committee-detail.asp?sc=33]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/ico_scientific_committees.asp International Commission on Occupational Health]&lt;/ref&gt; which focused primarily on OHP.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; In 1999, the [[European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology]] (EA-OHP) was established at the first European Workshop on Occupational Health Psychology in Lund, Sweden.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"&gt;Houdmont, J.

[http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV7October2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; That workshop is considered to be the first EA-OHP conference, the first of a continuing series of conferences EA-OHP organizes and devotes to OHP research and practice.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"/&gt;

In 2000 the informal International Coordinating Group for Occupational Health Psychology (ICGOHP) was founded for the purpose of facilitating OHP-related research, education, and practice as well as coordinating international conference scheduling.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; Also in 2000, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' became associated with the EA-OHP.&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"/&gt; In 2005, the [[Society for Occupational Health Psychology]] (SOHP) was established in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schonfeld, I.S.

== Research topics ==

===Important theoretical models in OHP research===

Three influential theoretical models in OHP research are the demand-control-support, demand-resources, and effort-reward imbalance models.

==== Demand-control-support model ====
The most influential model in OHP research has been the original demand-control model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; According to the model, the combination of low levels of work-related decision latitude (i.e., [[job control (workplace)|autonomy and control over the job]]) combined with high workloads (high levels of work demands) can be particularly harmful to workers (they can lead to "job strain," a term representing the combination of low decision latitude and high workload leading to poorer mental or physical health).&lt;ref name = "karasek 1979"&gt;Karasek, R.A. (1979). Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain: Implications for job redesign. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 24''(2), 285–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests not only that these two job factors are related to poorer health but that high levels of decision latitude on the job will buffer or reduce the adverse health impact of high levels of demands. Research has clearly supported the idea that decision latitude and demands relate to strains, but research findings about buffering have been mixed with only some studies providing support.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange, A.H., Taris, T.W., Kompier, M.A., Houtman, I.L., &amp; Bongers, P.M. (2003). "The very best of the millennium": Longitudinal research and the demand-control-(support) model. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 8'', 282–305. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.8.4.282&lt;/ref&gt; The demand-control model asserts that job control can come in two broad forms: ‘skill discretion’ and ‘decision authority’.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"&gt;Bean, C.G., Winefield, H.R., Sargent, C., &amp; Hutchinson, A.D. (2015). Differential associations of job control components with both waist circumference and body mass index. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 143'', 1–8. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.034&lt;/ref&gt; Skill discretion refers to the level of skill and creativity required on the job and the flexibility an employee is permitted in deciding what skills to use (e.g. opportunity to use skills, similar to job variety).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"&gt;de Araújo, T.M., Karasek. R. (2008) Validity and reliability of the job content questionnaire in formal and informal jobs in Brazil. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 6'', Suppl. 52–59&lt;/ref&gt; Decision authority refers to employees being able to make decisions about their work (e.g., having autonomy).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"/&gt; These two forms of job control are traditionally assessed together in a composite measure of decision latitude; there is, however, some evidence that the two types of job control may not be similarly related to health outcomes.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joensuu, M. et al. et al. (2012). Differential associations of job control components with mortality: A cohort study, 1986–2005. ''American Journal of Epidemiology, 175'', 609–619. doi:10.1093/aje/kws028&lt;/ref&gt;

About a decade after Karasek first introduced the demand-control model, Johnson, Hall, and Theorell (1989),&lt;ref name="Johnson, 1989"&gt;Johnson, J. V., Hall, E. M., &amp; Theorell, T. (1989). Combined effects of job strain and social isolation on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in a random sample of the Swedish male working population. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 15'', 271–279. doi:10.5271/sjweh.1852&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of research on heart disease, extended the model to include social isolation. Johnson et al. labeled the combination of high levels of demands, low levels of control, and low levels of coworker support “iso-strain.” The resulting expanded model has been labeled the demand–control–support (DCS) model. Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that one or more of the components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and lack of social support), if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Job demands-resources model ====

An alternative model, the [[job demands-resources model|job demands-resources (JD-R) model]],&lt;ref&gt;Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F., &amp; Schaufeli, W.B. (2001). The job demands-resources model of burnout. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 86'', 499–512. doi:10.1037//0021-9010.86.3.499&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains more or less the same as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Effort-reward imbalance model====
After the DCS model, the, perhaps, second most influential model in OHP research has been the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model. It links job demands to the rewards employees receive for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J., &amp; Peter, R. (1994). Job stressors and coping characteristics in work-related disease: Issues of validity. ''Work &amp; Stress, 8'', 130–140. doi: 10.1080/02678379408259985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J. (1996). Adverse health effects of high-effort/low-reward conditions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 27–41. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.1.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; That model holds that high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related intrinsic (e.g., recognition) and extrinsic (e.g., pay) rewards triggers high levels of activation in neurohormonal pathways that, cumulatively, are thought to exert adverse effects on mental and physical health.

=== Occupational stress and physical health ===
A number of work-related, psychosocial factors have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD).

====Cardiovascular disease====
{{Main|Occupational stress|Cardiovascular disease}}
Research has identified health-behavioral and biological factors that are related to increased risk for CVD. These risk factors include smoking, obesity, low density lipoprotein (the "bad" cholesterol), lack of exercise, and blood pressure. Psychosocial working conditions are also risk factors for CVD.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; In a case-control study involving two large U.S. data sets, Murphy (1991) found that hazardous work situations, jobs that required vigilance and responsibility for others, and work that required  attention to devices were related to increased risk for cardiovascular disability.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, L.R. (1991). Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 44''(2), 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt; These included jobs in transportation (e.g., air traffic controllers, airline pilots, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), preschool teachers, and craftsmen.

Fredikson, Sundin, and Frankenhaeuser (1985) found that reactions to psychological stressors include increased activity in the brain axes which play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Fredrikson M., Sundin O., &amp; Frankenhaeuser M. (1985). Cortisol excretion during the defence reaction in humans. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 47'', 313–319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeQuattro, V., &amp; Hamad, R. (1985).

(1998). Is the effect of job strain on myocardial infarction risk due to interaction between high psychological demands and low decision latitude? Results from Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP). ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 46''(11), 1405–1415.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.V., &amp; Hall, E.M. (1988).

''American Journal of Public Health, 78''(10), 1336–1342.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 17 [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] having reasonably high [[internal validity]] found that 8 showed a significant relation between the combination of low levels of decision latitude and high workload (the job strain condition) and CVD and 3 more showed a nonsignificant relation.&lt;ref&gt;Belkic, K.L., Landsbergis, P.A., Schnall, P.L., &amp; Baker, D. (2004). Is job strain a source of major cardiovascular risk? ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment, and Health, 30''(2), 85–128.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings, however, were clearer for men than for women, on whom data were more sparse. Fishta and Backé's&lt;ref&gt;Fishta, A., &amp; Backé, E. (2015). Psychosocial stress at work and cardiovascular diseases: An overview of systematic reviews. ''International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 88'',997–1014. doi:10.1007/s00420-015-1019-0.&lt;/ref&gt; review-of-reviews also links work-related psychosocial stress to elevated risk of CVD in men. In a massive (''n'' &gt; 197,000) longitudinal study that combined data from 13 independent studies, Kivimäki et al. (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Kivimäki, M., Nyberg, S., Batty, G., Fransson, E., Heikkilä, K., Alfredsson, L., . . . Theorell, T. (2012). Job strain as a risk factor for coronary heart disease: A collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data. ''The Lancet, 380'', 1491–1497. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60994-5&lt;/ref&gt; found that, controlling for other risk factors, the combination of high levels of demands and low control at baseline increased the risk of CVD in initially healthy workers by between 20 and 30% over a follow-up period that averaged 7.5 years. In this study the effects were similar for men and women. Meta-analytic research also links job strain (the combination of high demands and low control) to stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Y., Xu, S., Hua, J. et al. (2015). Association between job strain and risk of incident stroke: A meta-analysis. ''Neurology, 85'', 1648–1654. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000002098&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that, consistent with the ERI model, high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related rewards adversely affects cardiovascular health. At least five studies of men have linked effort-reward imbalance with CVD.&lt;ref&gt;Landsbergis, P., et al. (2003).

=== Workplace mistreatment ===
{{Main|Workplace aggression|Workplace violence}}

There are many forms of workplace mistreatment ranging from relatively minor discourtesies to serious cases of bullying and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, L., Caughlin, D.E., Gazica, M.W., Truxillo, D.M., &amp; Spector, P.E. (2014). Workplace mistreatment climate and potential employee and organizational outcomes: A meta-analytic review from the target’s perspective.

====Workplace incivility====
{{Main|Incivility}}
[[Workplace incivility]] has been defined as "low-intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target....Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others" (p.&amp;nbsp;457).&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, L. M., &amp; Pearson, C. M. (1999). Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace. ''Academy of Management Review, 24'', 452–471. doi:10.5465/AMR.1999.2202131&lt;/ref&gt;  Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, social isolation, etc. A summary of research conducted in Europe suggests that workplace incivility is common there.&lt;ref name="cortina magley"&gt;Cortina, L.M., Magley, V., Williams, J.H., &amp; Langhout, R.D.  (2001). Incivility in the workplace: Incidence and impact. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 6'', 64–80. doi:10.1037//1076-8998.6.1.64&lt;/ref&gt; In research on more than 1000 U.S. civil service workers, more than 70% of the sample experienced workplace incivility in the past five years. Compared to men, women were more exposed to incivility; incivility was associated with psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="cortina magley" /&gt;

====Abusive supervision====
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive supervision is the extent to which a [[supervisor]] engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, B. J. (2000). "Consequences of abusive supervision". ''Academy of Management Journal'', 43, 178–190. doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1556375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A.A., Kern, J.H., &amp; Frone, M.R. (2007).

====Workplace bullying====
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Although definitions of [[workplace bullying]] vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual by one or more others who have more power than the target.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P.E. Spector (Eds.), ''Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets'' (pp. 271–296). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. doi:10.1037/10893-011&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace bullying is sometimes termed ''[[mobbing]]''.

====Sexual harassment====
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
[[Sexual harassment]] is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, creates an offensive workplace, and interferes with an individual being able to do the job.&lt;ref&gt;Rospenda, K.M., &amp; Richman, J.A. (2005). Harassment and discrimination. In J. Barling, E.K. Kelloway &amp; M.R. Frone (Eds.), ''Handbook of work stress'' (pp. 149–188). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Workplace violence ====
{{Main|Workplace violence}}
Workplace violence is a significant health hazard for employees, both physically and psychologically.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

::-Nonfatal assault-
Most workplace assaults are nonfatal, with an annual physical assault rate of 6% in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., Frone, M.R., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Prevalence of workplace aggression in the U.S. workforce. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J.  Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 47–89). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Assaultive behavior in the workplace often produces injury, psychological distress, and economic loss. One study of California workers found a rate of 72.9 non-fatal, officially documented [[assault]]s per 100,000 workers per year, with workers in the education, retail, and health care sectors subject to excess risk.&lt;ref&gt;Peek Asa, C., Howard, J., Vargas, L., Kraus, J.F. (1997). Incidence of non-fatal workplace assault injuries determined from employer's reports in California. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 39''(1), 44–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Minnesota workers' compensation study found that women workers had a twofold higher risk of being injured in an assault than men, and health and social service workers, transit workers, and members of the education sector were at high risk for injury compared to workers in other economic sectors.&lt;ref name="LaMar, 1998"/&gt; A West Virginia workers' compensation study found that workers in the [[health care]] sector and, to a lesser extent, the education sector were at elevated risk for assault-related injury.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, S.S., Edla, S.R., Mujuru, P., Doyle, E.J., &amp; Ducatman, A.M. (2003). Risk factors for physical assault. State managed workers' compensation experience. ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 25''(1), 31–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another workers' compensation study found that excessively high rates of assault-related injury in schools, healthcare, and, to a lesser extent, banking.&lt;ref&gt;Hashemi, L., &amp; Webster, B.S. (1998). Non-fatal workplace violence workers' compensation claims (1993 1996). ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 40'', 561–567. doi:10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00095-3&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the physical injury that results from being a victim of workplace violence, individuals who witness such violence without being directly [[victimized]] are at increased risk for experiencing adverse psychological effects, including high levels of distress and arousal, as found in a study of Los Angeles teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, A.M. (1978). Combat neurosis in inner-city schools. ''American Journal of Psychiatry, 135''(10), 1189–1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

::-Homicide-
In 1996 there were 927 work-associated homicides in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2004). ''1992–2001 Census of fatal occupational injuries (CFOI) Revised data.'' Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

[http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost]&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate works out to be about 7 homicides per million workers for the one year. Men are more likely to be victims of workplace homicide than women.&lt;ref name="LaMar, 1998"&gt;LaMar W.J., Gerberich, S.G., Lohman, W.H., Zaidman, B. (1998). Work-related physical assault. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 40''(4), 317–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental disorder ===
{{Main|Mental disorder}}
Research has found that psychosocial workplace factors are among the risk factors for a number of categories of mental disorder.

==== Alcohol abuse ====
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Workplace factors can contribute to alcohol abuse and dependence of employees. Rates of abuse can vary by occupation, with high rates in the construction and transportation industries as well as among waiters and waitresses.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell W., Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., &amp; Garrison, R. (1992). Alcoholism and occupations: A review and analysis of 104 occupations.  ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 16'', 734–746. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1992.tb00670.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the transportation sector, heavy truck drivers and material movers were shown to be at especially high risk.  A prospective study of ECA subjects who were followed one year after the initial interviews provided data on newly [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incident]] cases of alcohol abuse and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, R.M., Muntaner. C., Eaton. W.W., &amp; Anthony. J.C. (1995). Occupational stress and the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence. ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 19'', 647–655. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb01562.x&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that workers in jobs that combined low control with high physical demands were at increased risk of developing alcohol problems although the findings were confined to men.

==== Depression ====
{{Main|Major depressive disorder}}
Using data from the ECA study, Eaton, Anthony, Mandel, and Garrison (1990) found that members of three occupational groups, lawyers, secretaries, and special education teachers (but not other types of teachers) showed elevated rates of [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''DSM-III'']] major depression, adjusting for social demographic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., Mandel, W., &amp; Garrison, R. (1990). Occupations and the prevalence of major depressive disorder. ''Journal of Occupational Medicine, 32''(11), 1079–1087.&lt;/ref&gt; The ECA study involved representative samples of American adults from five geographical areas, providing relatively unbiased estimates of the risk of mental disorder by occupation; however, because the data were [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]], no conclusions bearing on cause-and-effect relations are warranted.   Evidence from a Canadian prospective study indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of occupational stress (high-strain jobs as per the demand-control model) are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of major depression.&lt;ref&gt;Wang J. (2005). Work stress as a risk factor for major depressive episode(s). ''Psychological Medicine, 35'', 865–871. doi:10.1017/S0033291704003241&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review and [[meta-analysis]] links high demands, low control, and low support to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, I.H., Nyberg, S.T.,  Magnusson Hanson, L.L., et al. (2017). Job strain as a risk factor for clinical depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis with additional individual participant data. ''Psychological Medicine, 47'', 1342–135. doi:10.1017/S003329171600355X&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis that pooled the results of 11 well-designed longitudinal studies indicated that a number of facets of the psychosocial work environment (e.g., low decision latitude, high psychological workload, lack of social support at work, effort-reward imbalance, and job insecurity) increase the risk of common mental disorders such as depression.&lt;ref name="Stansfeld 2006"/&gt;

==== Personality disorders ====
{{Main|Personality disorder}}
Depending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty coping with work or the workplace, potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with [[interpersonal relationships]]. Indirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as [[substance abuse]] and co-morbid mental disorders, can plague sufferers. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average work abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the sufferer to exploit his or her co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L. (2011). Personality disorders and Work. In Schultz &amp; Rogers (Eds.), ''Work accommodation and retention in mental health'' (pp. 163–188). New York: Springer. doi:10.1007978-1-4419-0428-9_9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L., Maclean, J.C., &amp; French, M.T. (2011). Does having a dysfunctional personality hurt your career? Axis II personality disorders and labor market outcomes. ''Industrial Relations, 50'', 149–173. doi:10.1111/j.1468-232X.2010.00629.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schizophrenia ====
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
In a case-control study, Link, Dohrenwend, and Skodol found that, compared to depressed and well control subjects, schizophrenic patients were more likely to have had jobs, prior to their first episode of the disorder, that exposed them to “noisesome” work characteristics (e.g., noise, humidity, heat, cold, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Link, B.G., Dohrenwend, B.P., &amp; Skodol, A.E. (1986). Socio-economic status and schizophrenia: Noisome occupational characteristics as a risk factor. ''American Sociological Review, 51'', 242–258. doi:10.2307/2095519&lt;/ref&gt; The jobs tended to be of higher status than other blue collar jobs, suggesting that downward drift in already-affected individuals does not account for the finding. One explanation involving a [[diathesis-stress model]] suggests that the job-related stressors helped precipitate the first episode in already-vulnerable individuals. There is some supporting evidence from the [[Psychiatric epidemiology#Example: The Epidemiological Catchment Area Project|Epidemiologic Catchment Area]] (ECA) study.&lt;ref&gt;Muntaner, C., Tien, A.Y., Eaton, W.W., &amp; Garrison R. (1991). Occupational characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic disorders. ''Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 26'', 273–280. doi:10.1007/BF00789219&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological distress ===
{{Main|Psychological distress}}
[[longitudinal study|Longitudinal studies]] have suggested adverse working conditions can contribute to the development of psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, M.T., Matthews, R.A., Wooldridge, J.D., Mishra, V., Kakar, U.M., &amp; Strahan, S.R. (2014). How do occupational stressor-strain effects vary with time? A review and meta-analysis of the relevance of time lags in longitudinal studies. Work &amp; Stress, 28, 9–30. doi: 10.1080/02678373.2013.877096&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress refers to [[negative affect]], without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Dohrenwend, B.P., Shrout, P.E., Egri, G., &amp; Mendelsohn, F.S.

Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and [[anxiety]] symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. [[Job satisfaction]] is also related to negative health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, E.S., &amp; Grunberg, L. (1995). Work alienation and problem alcohol behavior.

==== Psychosocial working conditions====
Parkes (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, K.R. (1982). Occupational stress among student nurses: A natural experiment. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 67'', 784–796. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.67.6.784&lt;/ref&gt; studied the relation of working conditions to psychological distress in British student nurses. She found that in this "[[natural experiment]]," student nurses experienced higher levels of distress and lower levels of job satisfaction in medical wards than in surgical wards; compared to surgical wards, medical wards make greater affective demands on the nurses. In another study, Frese (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Frese, M. (1985). Stress at work and psychosomatic complaints: A causal interpretation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 70'', 314–328. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.70.2.314&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that objective working conditions (e.g., noise, ambiguities, conflicts) give rise to subjective stress and psychosomatic symptoms in blue collar German workers. In addition to the above studies, a number of other well-controlled longitudinal studies have implicated work stressors in the development of psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Carayon, P. (1992).  A longitudinal study of job design and worker strain: Preliminary results. In J.C. Quick, L.R. Murphy, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Work and well-being:  Assessments and instruments for occupational mental health'' (pp. 19–32).

''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 75'', 33–58. doi:10.1348/096317902167630&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unemployment ====
A comprehensive meta-analysis involving 86 studies indicated that involuntary job loss is linked to increased psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul, K. I., &amp; Moser, K. (2009). Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analyses. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 74'', 264–282. doi:10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of involuntary unemployment was comparatively weaker in countries that had greater income equality and better social safety nets.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; The research evidence also indicates that poorer mental health slightly, but significantly, increases the risk of later job loss.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

==== Economic insecurity ====
Some OHP research is concerned with (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' physical and mental health and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis.&lt;ref name="probst sears"&gt;Probst, T.M., &amp; Sears, L.E. (2009). Stress during the financial crisis. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 5'', 3–4. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV5January2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic insecurity contributes, at least partly, to psychological distress and work-family conflict.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"&gt;Sinclair, R.R., Probst, T., Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schaffer, M.M.

Northampton, MA, US: Edward Elgar Publishing. doi:10.4337/9780857933843.00030&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing job insecurity, even in the absence of job loss, is related to higher levels of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and worse overall health.&lt;ref name="Burgard"&gt;Burgard, S.A., Brand, J.E., &amp; House, J.S. (2009). Perceived job insecurity and worker health in the United States. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 69'', 777–785. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.06.029.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Work-family balance ====
{{Main|Work–family conflict|Double burden|Work–life balance}}

Employees must balance their working lives with their home lives. Work–family conflict is a situation in which the demands of work conflict with the demands of family or vice versa, making it difficult to adequately do both, giving rise to distress.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"&gt;Greenhaus, J.G., &amp; Allen, T. (2011). Work-family balance: A review and extension. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 165–183). Washington DC, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more research has been conducted on work-family conflict, there is also the phenomenon of work-family enhancement, which occurs when positive effects carry over from one domain into the other.&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"/&gt;

=== Workplace interventions ===
A number of stress management interventions have emerged that have shown demonstrable effects in reducing job stress.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Richardson, K. M., &amp; Rothstein, H. R. (2008). Effects of occupational stress management intervention programs: A meta-analysis. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13'', 69–93. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.13.1.69&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral interventions have tended to have greatest impact on stress reduction.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

====Industrial organizations====
OHP interventions often concern both the health of the individual and the health of the organization. Adkins (1999) described the development of one such intervention,  an organizational health center (OHC) at a California industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, J.A. (1999). Promoting organizational health: The evolving practice of occupational health psychology. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 30''(2), 129 137. doi:10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.129&lt;/ref&gt; The OHC helped to improve both organizational and individual health as well as help workers manage job stress. Innovations included labor-management partnerships, suicide risk reduction, conflict mediation, and occupational mental health support. OHC practitioners also coordinated their services with previously underutilized local community services in the same city, thus reducing redundancy in service delivery.

Hugentobler, Israel, and Schurman (1992) detailed a different, multi-layered intervention in a mid-sized Michigan manufacturing plant.&lt;ref&gt;Hugentobler, M.K., Israel, B.A., &amp; Schurman, S.J. (1992). An action research approach to workplace health: Integrating methods. ''Health Education Quarterly, 19''(1), 55–76. doi:10.1177/109019819201900105&lt;/ref&gt; The hub of the intervention was the Stress and Wellness Committee (SWC) which solicited ideas from workers on ways to improve both their well-being and [[productivity]]. Innovations the SWC developed included improvements that ensured two-way communication between workers and management and reduction in stress resulting from diminished conflict over issues of quantity versus quality. Both the interventions described by Adkins and Hugentobler et al. had a positive impact on productivity.

====Modestly scaled interventions====
Schmitt (2007) described three different modestly scaled OHP-related interventions that helped workers abstain from smoking, exercise more frequently, and shed weight.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2007). OHP interventions: Wellness programs. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other OHP interventions include a campaign to improve the rates of hand washing, an effort to get workers to walk more often, and a drive to get employees to be more compliant with regard to taking prescribed medicines.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2008). OHP interventions: Wellness programs (Part 2). ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2'', 6–7.

==== Health promotion ====

Organizations can play a role in the health behavior of employees by providing resources to encourage healthy behavior in areas of exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J.B., Cook, R.F., &amp; Pelletier, K.R.

==== Prevention ====
Although the dimensions of the problem of workplace violence vary by economic sector, one sector, [[school violence#Prevention and intervention|education]], has had some limited success in introducing programmatic, psychologically-based efforts to reduce the level of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2006). School violence. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 169–229). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED494566.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that there continue to be difficulties in successfully "screening out applicants [for jobs] who may be prone to engaging in aggressive behavior,"&lt;ref&gt;Day, A.L, &amp; Catano, V.M.

====Total Worker Health™====
{{Main|Total Worker Health}}

Because many companies have implemented worker safety and health measures in a fragmented way,&lt;ref name = "Schill"&gt;Schill, A. L., &amp; Chosewood, L. C. (2013). The NIOSH Total Worker Health™ program: An overview. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55''(12 Suppl.), S8–S11. doi:10.1097/JOM.0000000000000037&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach to worker safety and health has emerged in response, driven by efforts advanced by [[NIOSH]]. NIOSH trademarked that approach, naming it Total Worker Health. Total Worker Health involves the coordination of evidence-based (a) health promotion practices at the level of the individual worker and (b) umbrella-like health and safety practices at the level of the organizational unit.&lt;ref name = "Schill"/&gt; Research findings indicate that this two-pronged approach is effective in preventing work-related illness and injury.&lt;ref&gt;Anger, W.

===Accidents and safety===
{{Main|Work accident}}

Psychological factors are an important factor in [[occupational accident]]s that can lead to injury and death of employees. An important influence on the incidence of accidents is the organization's [[safety climate]] that is employees' shared beliefs about how supervisors reward and support safety behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2010). Thirty years of safety climate research: Reflections and future directions. ''Accident Analysis and Prevention, 42'', 1517–1522. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2009.12.019.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], a '''parallel random-access machine''' ('''PRAM''') is a [[shared memory architecture|shared-memory]] [[abstract machine]]. As its name indicates, the PRAM was intended as the parallel-computing analogy to the [[random-access machine]] (RAM). In the same way that the RAM is used by sequential-algorithm designers to model algorithmic performance (such as time complexity), the PRAM is used by parallel-algorithm designers to model parallel algorithmic performance (such as time complexity, where the number of processors assumed is typically also stated). Similar to the way in which the RAM model neglects practical issues, such as access time to cache memory versus main memory, the PRAM model neglects such issues as [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] and [[communication]], but provides any (problem-size-dependent) number of processors. Algorithm cost, for instance, is estimated using two parameters O(time) and O(time × processor_number).

==Read/write conflicts==
Read/write conflicts, commonly termed interlocking in accessing the same shared memory location simultaneously are resolved by one of the following strategies:

#Exclusive read exclusive write (EREW)—every memory cell can be read or written to by only one processor at a time
#Concurrent read exclusive write (CREW)—multiple processors can read a memory cell but only one can write at a time
#Exclusive read concurrent write (ERCW)—never considered
#Concurrent read concurrent write (CRCW)—multiple processors can read and write. A CRCW PRAM is sometimes called a '''concurrent random-access machine'''.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Immerman, ''Expressibility and parallel complexity''. Siam Journal on Computing, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 625-638, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, E and C stand for 'exclusive' and 'concurrent' respectively. The read causes no discrepancies while the concurrent write is further defined as:
::''Common''—all processors write the same value; otherwise is illegal
::''Arbitrary''—only one arbitrary attempt is successful, others retire
::''Priority''—processor rank indicates who gets to write
::Another kind of ''[[Fortran language features#Arrays intrinsic functions|array reduction]]'' operation like SUM, Logical AND or MAX.

Several simplifying assumptions are made while considering the development of algorithms for PRAM. They are:
# There is no limit on the number of processors in the machine.
# Any memory location is uniformly accessible from any processor.
# There is no limit on the amount of shared memory in the system.
# [[Resource contention]] is absent.
# The programs written on these machines are, in general, of type [[SIMD]].

These kinds of algorithms are useful for understanding the exploitation of concurrency, dividing the original problem into similar sub-problems and solving them in parallel. The introduction of the formal 'P-RAM' model in Wyllie's 1979 thesis&lt;ref&gt;Wyllie, James C. The Complexity of Parallel Computations, PhD Thesis, Dept. of Computer Science, Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; had the aim of quantifying analysis of parallel algorithms in a way analogous to the [[Turing Machine]]. The analysis focused on a MIMD model of programming using a CREW model but showed that many variants, including implementing a CRCW model and implementing on an SIMD machine, were possible with only constant overhead.

==Implementation==
PRAM algorithms cannot be parallelized with the combination of [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) because DRAM does not allow concurrent access; but they can be implemented in hardware or read/write to the internal [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM) blocks of a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA), it can be done using a CRCW algorithm.

However, the test for practical relevance of PRAM (or RAM) algorithms depends on whether their cost model provides an effective abstraction of some computer; the structure of that computer can be quite different than the abstract model. The knowledge of the layers of software and hardware that need to be inserted is beyond the scope of this article. But, articles such as {{harvtxt|Vishkin|2011}} demonstrate how a PRAM-like abstraction can be supported by the [[explicit multi-threading]] (XMT) paradigm and articles such as {{harvtxt|Caragea|Vishkin|2011}} demonstrate that a PRAM algorithm for the [[maximum flow problem]] can provide strong speedups relative to the fastest serial program for the same problem.

==Example code==
This is an example of [[SystemVerilog]] code which finds the maximum value in the array in only 2 clock cycles. It compares all the combinations of the elements in the array at the first clock, and merges the result at the second clock. It uses CRCW memory; &lt;code&gt;m[i] &lt;= 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maxNo &lt;= data[i]&lt;/code&gt; are written concurrently. The concurrency causes no conflicts because the algorithm guarantees that the same value is written to the same memory. This code can be run on [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] hardware.

&lt;source lang="SystemVerilog"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">In [[computational geometry]] and [[database]] theory, a '''range reporting''' query asks for a list of the points that match the query. The query is often specified by a geometric shape, containing all the points that should match, and is called a range. Range reporting is a special case of [[range search]]ing, in which queries may return other kinds of aggregate information about points in a range.

Range reporting queries are often handled by building a [[data structure]] from a collection of points that can answer queries efficiently. Because the worst case output size for a range reporting query, measured as a function of the data set size {{mvar|n}}, can be {{mvar|n}} itself, much of the research on range reporting data structures has investigated [[output-sensitive algorithm]]s, where the query time is analyzed in terms of both {{mvar|n}} and the number of reported points (often denoted {{mvar|k}}).

For example, for one-dimensional (numeric) data with query ranges that are [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], range reporting queries can be handled by storing the data in a sorted array. With this structure, one can use [[binary search]] to find the point closest to the start of a query interval, and then scan the array from that point forwards to list all of the points in the interval. Storing this data structure uses {{math|''O''(''n'')}} (linear) space, and it handles queries in time {{math|''O''(log ''n'' + ''k'')}} per query.

'''Reflexiveness''' is one of [[Charles Hockett]]'s 16 [[Design features of language]] which states that in a language the speaker can use his/her language to talk about language. Speakers of a language are able to have knowledge about their language and be able to reflect upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Matthew. "Child Language: acquisition and development". Sage Publications, 2010, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russell Sage Foundation''' is an American philanthropic [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] that primarily funds research relating to income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Callahan|first1=David|title=Inside the Russell Sage Foundation's Epic Dig Into Why Inequality Matters|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2015/4/14/inside-the-russell-sage-foundations-epic-dig-into-why-inequa.html|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=Inside Philanthropy|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in New York City, it is a research center and a funding source for studies by scholars at other academic and research institutions. The foundation also publishes, under its own imprint, the books that derive from the work of its grantees and visiting scholars. The foundation focuses on [[Labour economics|labor markets]], [[immigration]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], and [[social inequality]] in the United States, as well as [[behavioral economics]].

The Russell Sage Foundation was established in 1907 for "the improvement of social and living conditions in the United States" by a gift of $10 million from [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage]] (1828–1918), widow of railroad magnate and financier [[Russell Sage]].&lt;ref name="Olivia Sage"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/collections/sage/essays.html | title=Margaret Olivia Slocum (Mrs. Russell) Sage (1828-1918): Founder of the Russell Sage Foundation | last= | first= | date= | website=Auburn University Libraries | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Sage directed the foundation to pursue its mission through a broad set of activities, including "research, publication, education, the establishment and maintenance of charitable or benevolent activities, agencies and institutions, and the aid of any such activities, agencies, or institutions already in existence."&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/about/history | title=History of the Russell Sage Foundation | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Glenn et al. (1947), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
Soon after its establishment, the Foundation played a pioneering role in dealing with problems of the poor and the elderly, in efforts to improve hospital and prison conditions, and in the development of social work as a profession.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wenocur and Michael Reisch, From Charity to Enterprise: The Development of American Social Work in a Market Economy  (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation was also responsible for early reforms in [[health care]], [[city planning]], [[consumer]] [[Credit (finance)|credit]], [[labor law]], the training of nurses, and [[social security]] programs.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/u4/Brief%20History%20of%20RSF.pdf | title=Celebrating 100 Years | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=June 2016}}
 
In 1907, the foundation funded the [[Pittsburgh Survey]],&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Survey"&gt;"The Pittsburgh Survey," by Paul Kellogg in "Charities and the Commons" 1909&lt;/ref&gt; the first systematic effort to survey working class conditions in a large U.S. city. Considered a major [[Progressive Era]] achievement, the findings inspired labor reforms and helped end twelve-hour days and seven-day weeks for steel workers.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1909 and 1922, the Foundation spent nearly a sixth of its capital to build [[Forest Hills Gardens]], a model suburban community for working families designed by architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. The aim was to demonstrate the economic and social viability of an intelligently planned suburban community.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn et al. (1947), p.49&lt;/ref&gt; The first lots sold for $800, and a new suburb began thriving by 1917, but housing prices soon soared beyond the range of the families they were intended for.&lt;ref name="A Brief History" /&gt;

In 1922, the Foundation helped launch the [[Regional Plan Association]] to research, write and publish a plan to guide the future development of the New York metropolitan region.  In its first 40 years, the Foundation spent more than $1 million on the Regional Survey and Plan. Researchers completed 12 massive volumes as part of the effort, with the first being published in 1928-29.&lt;ref name="Regional Plan"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Harold |editor1-last=Keele |others=Joseph C. Kiger |title=Foundations |edition=1984 |year=1984 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |page=376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RPA was not opposed to the growth of the area and its population, but believed that for the development to be efficient and orderly, it had to be properly managed; only in this way could businesses continue to grow and the city maintain its global impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite unbound|pages=187-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation also provided support for [[social feminist]]s such as [[Mary van Kleeck]], founder of the [[International Institute of Industrial Relations]].&lt;ref name=Alvon&gt;{{cite book|first1=Guy|author1=Alvon|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Daniel|title=A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management since Taylor|date=1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus Ohio|url=https://ohiostatepress.org/Books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945–1980===
Since [[World War II]], the Foundation has devoted its efforts to strengthening the social sciences as a means of achieving more informed and rational social policy. It launched a variety of programs to draw the social sciences closer to decision-makers in other professions, from policymakers to health care providers. This initiative included funds for research on "social indicators", a collection of data that measure the quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Indicators Research|"Social indicators"]] on the Russell Sage Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt;

([[Mary Van Kleek]], who headed the foundation in the late 1940s, was a member of the [[American Labor Party]] and served on a committee for the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=Withering&gt;

In the 1950s, the Foundation supported research on the practice and aims of [[philanthropy]]. It established the [[Foundation Center]], a non-profit that maintains data on organized philanthropy. It was also the first to publish ''The Foundation Directory'', a comprehensive listing of the nation’s several thousand largest foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fconline.foundationcenter.org/ | title=90% of U.S. Foundations don't have websites | last= | first= | date= | website=Foundation Directory Online | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this decade, the foundation also received money from the Ford Foundation ($554,000) for the "practical utilization of the behavioral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ford Foundation Annual Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Ford Foundation|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Foundation turned to [[medical ethics]], including [[patients' rights]], extreme measures to sustain life, and the use of human subjects in research. Foundation-supported books from this period include Bernard Barber’s ''Drugs and Society'' (1967) and ''The Dying Patient'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russellsage.org/publications/dying-patient|title=The Dying Patient {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s – present===
The Foundation was an early force in the development of [[behavioral economics]],&lt;ref name="B.E. paper"&gt;{{Citation

In 1993, the Foundation also established the Behavioral Economics Roundtable,&lt;ref name=BE /&gt; a group of behavioral economists elected by grantees in the program and charged to design initiatives to advance the field. Three charter members of the Roundtable subsequently received the Noble Prize in economics: [[George Akerlof]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], and [[Thomas Schelling]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The Foundation launched new programs to study immigration, the rise of economic inequality and contact among cultures within the American population. Between 1992 and 2000, the Foundation worked with the [[Ford Foundation]] to conduct a Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/multi-city-study-urban-inequality | title=Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Foundation partnered with the [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB) to produce ''The American People: Census 2000'', edited by Reynolds Farley of the University of Michigan and John Haaga of PRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/publications/american-people | title=The American People | last=Farley | first=Reynolds | date= September 2005 | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Foundation partnered with the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] on an initiative exploring the social, economic and political effects of the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/co-funded-projects|title=Co-Funded Research {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, the Foundation launched ''RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences'', a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], [[Open access|open-access]] journal of social science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsfjournal.org/|title=RSF Journal|website=www.rsfjournal.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==

===Research===
The Foundation currently pursues four principal programs:
* A program of research on the Future of Work concerned principally with the causes and consequences of changes in the quality of [[low-wage work]] in the United States and other advanced economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/future-work | title=Future of Work | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program of research on Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration concerned with the social, economic, and political effects of the changing racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population, including the transformation of communities and ideas about what it means to be American. This program was formed to replace two prior programs, Immigration and Cultural Contact, in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/race-ethnicity-immigration | title=Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program on Social Inequality, focused on the social effects of rising economic inequality, with particular attention to the ways in which the U.S. political and educational systems have responded to growing economic disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/social-inequality | title=Social Inequality | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program of research on Behavioral Economics which incorporates the insights of psychology and other social sciences into the study of economic behavior.&lt;ref name=BE /&gt;

The principal programs feature a number of working groups:
*The Biology and Social Science Working Group examines how the incorporation of biological concepts, processes and measures in social science research might improve our understanding of a range of social and economic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/working-groups/biology-and-social-science | title=Biology and Social Science (BioSS) Working Group | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Racial Bias in Policing Working Group examines the impact of racial, ethnic, and gender-based attitudes on law enforcement. The group is working with metropolitan police departments across the U.S. to develop policies to reduce racial bias in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/working-groups/rsf-working-group-racial-bias-policing | title=Racial Bias in Policing Working Group | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Cultural Contact and Immigration Working Group examines immigrant life outside of customary gateway cities such as New York, Miami, or Los Angeles, with an emphasis on the cultural frictions resulting from the rapid growth of the foreign-born population in the United States at a time of high economic uncertainty and political polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/awarded-project/working-group-cultural-contact-and-immigration | title=Working Group on Cultural Contact and Immigration | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the activities sponsored under its main programs, the Foundation also currently supports a special initiative on the social, economic and political effects of the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/special-initiatives/affordable-care-act | title=The Social, Economic and Political Effects of the Affordable Care Act | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ASA conference 2008 - 07.JPG|thumb|267px|2008 conference booth]]

===Books===
The Foundation publishes books on a variety of subjects, with particular emphasis on work related to its programs. Notable recent publications include ''Punishment and Inequality in America'' by [[Bruce Western]], winner of the 2007 Albert J. Reiss, Jr. Distinguished Scholarship Award and the 2008 Michael J. Hindelang Book Award from the [[American Society of Criminology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russellsage.org/publications/punishment-and-inequality-america-0|title=Punishment and Inequality in America {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long Shadow: Family Background, Disadvantaged Urban Youth, and the Transition to Adulthood'', for which authors Karl Alexander, Doris Entwisle, and Linda Olson won the 2016 [[Grawemeyer Award]] in Education;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grawemeyer.org/alexander-olson-and-entwisle-win-education-award-for-the-long-shadow/|title=Grawemeyer Awards {{!}}   Alexander, Entwisle and Olson win education award for "The Long Shadow"|website=grawemeyer.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The American Non-Dilemma'' by Nancy DiTomaso, winner of the 2013 [[C.

The Foundation is also the publisher of the [[American Sociological Association]]’s distinguished Rose Series in Sociology.

The Foundation's publications are distributed by the [[Chicago Distribution Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Publishers served by the Chicago Distribution Center| work = University of Chicago Press| accessdate = 2017-09-12| url = http://press.uchicago.edu/cdc/publishers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visiting Scholars and Journalists programs===
The Russell Sage Foundation has established a center where Visiting Scholars can pursue their writing and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/about/what-we-do/visiting-scholars-program | title=Visiting Scholars Program | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the Foundation invites a number of scholars to its New York City headquarters to investigate topics in social and behavioral sciences. The Foundation particularly welcomes groups of scholars who wish to collaborate on a specific project during their residence at Russell Sage. Typically Visiting Scholars work on projects related to the Foundation’s current programs.

In 2015 the Foundation established a Visiting Journalists program to support journalists undertaking original research on social, political, and economic conditions in the United States. 

====Robert K. Merton Scholar====
* In 1990, [[Robert K. Merton]] became the first Foundation Scholar at Russell Sage, recognizing his long and invaluable service as an adviser to the administration and a mentor to other visiting scholars.
* In 2000, [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]]ist [[Robert M. Solow]] became the second Foundation Scholar, following Merton’s retirement. In 2003, the position was renamed the Merton Scholar.

===Archives===
The Foundation's archives are located in the Rockefeller Archive Center in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rockarch.org/ | title=“If we assist the highest forms of education – in whatever field – we secure the widest influence in enlarging the boundaries of human knowledge.” | last= | first= | date= | website=Rockefeller Archive Center | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Russell Sage Foundation Building}}[[File:Russell Sage Foundation Building.jpg|thumb|left|192px|The former headquarters of the Russell Sage Foundation on [[Lexington Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]]]

==Headquarters buildings==

When the Foundation was formed, it attempted to locate its offices in the [[United Charities Building]] on [[Park Avenue South]] and East 22nd Street in [[Manhattan]], but was unable to do so as the building was fully rented; instead, the new foundation spread out to a number of locations in the area. In 1912, Margaret Sage and [[Robert W. DeForest]] decided to construct a headquarters building for the Foundation which would also serve as a memorial to her late husband. They engaged [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[Grosvenor Atterbury]], who had designed the [[Forest Hills Gardens]] model housing project for the Foundation in 1908, to design the building, and purchased property at 120 [[22nd Street (Manhattan)|East 22nd Street]] at the corner of [[Lexington Avenue]], just down the street from both United Charities Building and the [[Church Missions House]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and a short block from [[Gramercy Park]]. The building, which was originally nine stories before a penthouse was added in the 1920s, was constructed between 1912 and 1913 and altered in 1922-1923.  A fifteen-story extension on East 22nd, which Atterbury also designed, connected to the original building with a five-story "hyphen", was added between 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref name=gna&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/ext/ension/122_130e22.htm | title=Proposed Historic District Extension | last= | first= | date=31 August 1998 | website=Preserve &amp; Protect | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 5-story connector building was necessitated by a covenant to the deed for the site, which was sold to the Foundation by the [[Gramercy Park Hotel]].  The intention was to preserve access to sunlight for the hotel's north-facing rooms.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russell Sage Foundation Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The Foundation's current headquarters]]

Atterbury's design took the form of a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance]] [[Florence|Florentine]] [[palazzo]]. Because it was both headquarters for the Foundation and a physical memorial for Sage, the building was more opulently constructed than would generally be the case for a charity.  Atterbury utilized expensive materials in the interior, such as rare Kingwood [[sandstone]] in the elevators.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt; The 1922-1923 alteration added second floor sculptural panels by [[Rene Paul Chambellan]] illustrating the foundation's ideals, goals and deeds.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

The Foundation made available space in the main building, at no charge, to other social-service organizations, such as the Family Welfare Association of America, the American Association of Social Workers and the Library of Social Work, which took up the top two floors of the main building. Space in the 22nd Street extension was rented out, and the New York School of Social Work was the primary tenant.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt;

The Foundation sold the building in 1949 to the [[Archdiocese of New York]] which used it as the headquarters of [[Catholic Charities]], and it was sold again in 1975, after which it was converted to apartments; it is now called '''Sage House'''.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt;  The building was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] in 2000,&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of a proposed extension to the [[Gramercy Park Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/ext/ension.htm | title=Proposed Gramercy Park Historic District Extension | last= | first= | date=31 August 1998 | website=Preserve &amp; Protect | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1981, the Foundation has been headquartered in a [[Philip Johnson]]-designed [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] building at 112 [[64th Street (Manhattan)|East 64th Street]] between [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington]] Avenues, built in 1958-1960 for the [[Asia Society]] and [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]]. The building is located in the [[Upper East Side Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p.391&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[algebra]] and [[theoretical computer science]], an '''action''' or '''act''' of a '''[[semigroup]]''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a rule which associates to each element of the semigroup a [[transformation (geometry)|transformation]] of the set in such a way that the product of two elements of the semigroup (using the semigroup [[binary operation|operation]]) is associated with the [[function composition|composite]] of the two corresponding transformations. The terminology conveys the idea that the elements of the semigroup are ''acting'' as transformations of the set. From an [[algebraic structure|algebraic]] perspective, a semigroup action is a generalization of the notion of a [[group action]] in [[group (mathematics)|group theory]]. From the computer science point of view, semigroup actions are closely related to [[finite state machine|automata]]: the set models the state of the automaton and the action models transformations of that state in response to inputs.

An important special case is a '''monoid action''' or '''act''', in which the semigroup is a [[monoid]] and the [[identity element]] of the monoid acts as the [[identity transformation]] of a set. From a [[category theoretic]] point of view, a monoid is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with one object, and an act is a functor from that category to the [[category of sets]]. This immediately provides a generalization to monoid acts on objects in categories other than the category of sets.

Another important special case is a '''[[transformation semigroup]]'''. This is a semigroup of transformations of a set, and hence it has a tautological action on that set. This concept is linked to the more general notion of a semigroup by an analogue of [[Cayley's theorem]].

''(A note on terminology: the terminology used in this area varies, sometimes significantly, from one author to another. See the article for details.)''

==Formal definitions==

Let ''S'' be a semigroup. Then a (left) '''semigroup action''' (or '''act''') of ''S'' is a set ''X'' together with an operation {{nowrap|• : ''S'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} which is compatible with the semigroup [[binary operation|operation]] * as follows:
* for all ''s'', ''t'' in ''S'' and ''x'' in ''X'', {{nowrap|1=''s'' • (''t'' • ''x'') = (''s'' * ''t'') • ''x''}}.
This is the analogue in semigroup theory of a (left) [[group action]], and is equivalent to a [[semigroup#Semigroup homomorphisms|semigroup homomorphism]] into the set of functions on ''X''. Right semigroup actions are defined in a similar way using an operation {{nowrap|• : ''X'' × ''S'' → ''X''}} satisfying {{nowrap|1=(''x'' • ''a'') • ''b'' = ''x'' • (''a'' * ''b'')}}.

If ''M'' is a monoid, then a (left) '''monoid action''' (or '''act''') of ''M'' is a (left) semigroup action of ''M'' with the additional property that
* for all ''x'' in ''X'': ''e'' • ''x'' = ''x''
where ''e'' is the identity element of ''M''. This correspondingly gives a monoid homomorphism. Right monoid actions are defined in a similar way. A monoid ''M'' with an action on a set is also called an '''operator monoid'''.

A semigroup action of ''S'' on ''X'' can be made into monoid act by adjoining an identity to the semigroup and requiring that it acts as the identity transformation on ''X''. 

===Terminology and notation===

If ''S'' is a semigroup or monoid, then a set ''X'' on which ''S'' acts as above (on the left, say) is also known as a (left) '''''S''-act''', '''''S''-set''', '''''S''-action''', '''''S''-operand''', or '''left act over ''S'''''. Some authors do not distinguish between semigroup and monoid actions, by regarding the identity axiom ({{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''x'' = ''x''}}) as empty when there is no identity element, or by using the term '''unitary ''S''-act''' for an ''S''-act with an identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kilp, Knauer and Mikhalev, 2000, pages 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since a monoid is a semigroup, one can consider semigroup actions of monoids.

The defining property of an act is analogous to the [[associativity]] of the semigroup operation, and means that all parentheses can be omitted. It is common practice, especially in computer science, to omit the operations as well so that both the semigroup operation and the action are indicated by juxtaposition. In this way  [[string (computer science)|strings]] of letters from ''S'' act on ''X'', as in the expression ''stx'' for ''s'', ''t'' in ''S'' and ''x'' in ''X''.

It is also quite common to work with right acts rather than left acts.&lt;ref&gt;Kilp, Knauer and Mikhalev, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; However, every right S-act can be interpreted as a left act over the '''opposite semigroup''', which has the same elements as S, but where multiplication is defined by reversing the factors, {{nowrap|1=''s'' • ''t'' = ''t'' • ''s''}}, so the two notions are essentially equivalent. Here we primarily adopt the point of view of left acts.

===Acts and transformations===

It is often convenient (for instance if there is more than one act under consideration) to use a letter, such as &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, to denote the function
:&lt;math&gt; T\colon S\times X \to X&lt;/math&gt;
defining the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-action and hence write &lt;math&gt;T(s, x)&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;s\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we denote by
:&lt;math&gt; T_s\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;
the transformation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt; T_s(x) = T(s,x).&lt;/math&gt;
By the defining property of an &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-act, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; T_{s*t} = T_s\circ T_t.&lt;/math&gt;
Further, consider a function &lt;math&gt;s\mapsto T_s&lt;/math&gt;. It is the same as &lt;math&gt;curry(T):S\to(X\to X)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[currying]]). Because &lt;math&gt;curry&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection, semigroup actions can be defined as functions &lt;math&gt;S\to(X\to X)&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; curry(T)(s*t) = curry(T)(s)\circ curry(T)(t).&lt;/math&gt;
I.e. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a semigroup action of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[semigroup homomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to the full transformation monoid of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===''S''-homomorphisms===

Let ''X'' and ''X''′ be ''S''-acts. Then an ''S''-homomorphism from ''X'' to ''X''′ is a map
:&lt;math&gt;F\colon X\to X'&lt;/math&gt;
such that 
:&lt;math&gt;F(sx) =s F(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.
The set of all such ''S''-homomorphisms is commonly written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_S(X,X')&lt;/math&gt;.

''M''-homomorphisms of ''M''-acts, for ''M'' a monoid, are defined in exactly the same way.

===''S''-Act and ''M''-Act===

For a fixed semigroup ''S'', the left ''S''-acts are the objects of a category, denoted ''S''-Act, whose morphisms are the ''S''-homomorphisms. The corresponding category of right ''S''-acts is sometimes denoted by Act-''S''. (This is analogous to the categories ''R''-Mod and Mod-''R'' of left and right [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].)

For a monoid ''M'', the categories ''M''-Act and Act-''M'' are defined in the same way.

==Examples==
* Any semigroup &lt;math&gt;(S, *)&lt;/math&gt; has an action on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\cdot = *&lt;/math&gt;. The action property holds due to the associativity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally, for any semigroup homomorphism &lt;math&gt;F\colon (S, *) \rightarrow (T, \oplus)&lt;/math&gt;, the semigroup &lt;math&gt;(S, *)&lt;/math&gt; has an action on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;s \cdot t = F(s) \oplus t&lt;/math&gt;.
* For any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; be the set of sequences of elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The semigroup &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{N}, \times)&lt;/math&gt; has an action on &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;n \cdot s = s^n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;s^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; repeated &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times).

==Transformation semigroups==

{{main|Transformation semigroup}}

A correspondence between transformation semigroups and semigroup actions is described below. If we restrict it to [[Faithful action|faithful]] semigroup actions, it has nice properties.

Any transformation semigroup can be turned into a semigroup action by the following construction. For any transformation semigroup &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, define a semigroup action &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;T(s, x) = s(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; s\in S, x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. This action is faithful, which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; being [[injective]].

Conversely, for any semigroup action &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, define a transformation semigroup &lt;math&gt;S' = \{T_s | s\in S\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this construction we "forget" the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt;. Lets denote &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for brevity. If &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]], then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a semigroup [[isomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is faithful, then we forget nothing important. This claim is made precise by the following observation: if we turn &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; back into a semigroup action &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T'(f(s), x)=T(s, x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; s\in S, x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; are "isomorphic" via &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., we essentially recovered &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Thus some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| editor1-first = Michael A.
| editor1-last = Arbib
| year = 1968
| title = Algebraic Theory of Machines, Languages, and Semigroups
| publisher = Academic Press

| page = 83
}}&lt;/ref&gt; see no distinction between faithful semigroup actions and transformation semigroups.

==Applications to computer science==
===Semiautomata===

{{main|semiautomaton}}

Transformation semigroups are of essential importance for the structure theory of [[finite state machine]]s in [[automata theory]]. In particular, a ''semiautomaton'' is a triple (''Σ'',''X'',''T''), where ''Σ'' is a non-empty set called the ''input alphabet'', ''X'' is a non-empty set called the ''set of states'' and ''T'' is a function
:&lt;math&gt;T\colon \Sigma\times X \to X&lt;/math&gt;
called the ''transition function''. Semiautomata arise from [[deterministic finite automaton|deterministic automata]] by ignoring the initial state and the set of accept states.

Given a semiautomaton, let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''X'' → ''X'', for ''a'' ∈ ''Σ'', denote the transformation of ''X'' defined by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''T''(''a'',''x''). Then the semigroup of transformations of ''X'' generated by {''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''a'' ∈ ''Σ''} is called the ''[[characteristic semigroup]]'' or ''transition system'' of (''Σ'',''X'',''T''). This semigroup is a monoid, so this monoid is called the ''characteristic'' or ''[[transition monoid]]''. It is also sometimes viewed as an ''Σ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-act on ''X'', where ''Σ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[free monoid]] of strings generated by the alphabet ''Σ'' and the action of strings extends the action of ''Σ'' via the property
:&lt;math&gt;T_{vw} = T_w \circ T_v.&lt;/math&gt;

===Krohn–Rhodes theory===

{{main|Krohn–Rhodes theory}}

Krohn–Rhodes theory, sometimes also called ''algebraic automata theory'', gives powerful decomposition results for finite transformation semigroups by cascading simpler components.

Vertical classification of vegetation in a forest showing the tree, shrub and herbaceous layers and the forest floor]]
'''Stratification''' in the field of [[ecology]] refers to the vertical layering of a [[habitat]]; the arrangement of vegetation in layers.&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, Dictionary of Physical Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; It classifies the layers (sing. ''stratum'', pl. ''strata'') of [[vegetation]] largely according to the different heights to which their plants grow. The individual layers are inhabited by different animal and plant [[community (ecology)|communities]] (stratozones).

==Vertical structure in terrestrial plant habitats==
[[File:MUWO4193.JPG|thumb|250px|Forest with canopy, shrub and herbaceous plant layers]] 
The following layers are generally distinguished: [[forest floor]] ([[root]] and [[soil]] layers), [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], [[shrub]], [[understory]] and [[canopy (trees)|canopy]] layers. These vegetation layers are primarily determined by the height of their individual plants, the different elements may however have a range of heights. The actual layer is characterised by the height range in which the vast majority of [[photosynthetic]]  organs (predominantly [[leaves]]) are found. Taller species will have part of their shoot system in the underlying layers. In addition to the above-ground stratification there is also a “root layer”. In the broadest sense, the layering of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspores]] in the soil may be counted as part of the vertical structure.
The plants of a layer, especially with regard to their way of life and correspondingly similar root distribution interact closely and compete strongly for space, light, water and nutrients. The stratification of a [[plant community]] is the result of long [[selection (evolution)|selection]] and [[adaptation]] processes. Through the formation of different layers a given habitat is better utilized. Strongly vertically stratified habitats are very stable [[ecosystem]]s. The opposite is not true, because several less stratified vegetation types, such as [[reed bed]]s, can be very stable. The layers of a habitat are closely interrelated and at least partly interdependent. This is often the case as a result of the changes in microclimate of the top layers, the light factor being of particular importance.

[[File:Beechforest062005.jpg|thumb|250px|View of the canopy and understory beneath]] 
Besides the superposition of different plants growing on the same soil, there is a lateral impact of the higher layers on adjacent plant communities, for example, at the edges of forests and bushes. This particular vegetation structure results in the growth of certain vegetation types such as forest mantle and margin communities.

=== Tree layer ===
This layer of vegetation starts from a height of about five metres and comprises the top stratum, which consists of [[phanerophyte]]s. They can be about 45 metres high. The trees (and sometimes shrubs) are of various heights. One tree has its [[Crown (botany)|crown]] at the height of another’s trunk. At the top the crowns of the different species of trees form a more or less closed canopy. This layer creates special ecological conditions in the underlying layers of [[forest]]s. The density of the trees determines the amount of light inside the forest. The force of heavy rainfall is reduced by the canopy and the passage of rainwater is fed more slowly downwards. The tree layer can be further subdivided into the upper tree layer or canopy and the lower tree layer or understory.

==== Canopy ====
{{main|Canopy (biology)}}
The canopy refers to the highest layer of vegetation in a forest or woodland, made up of the crowns of its tallest trees. Individual trees growing above the general layer of the canopy may form an [[emergent layer]].

==== Understory ====
{{main|Understory}}
The understory refers to those trees above the shrub layer and below the canopy.

===Shrub layer===
The shrub layer is the stratum of vegetation within a habitat with heights of between one and a half to about five metres. Young trees are also part of this layer. It may be divided into the first and second shrub layers (low and high bushes). The shrub layer needs sun and only a little moisture, unlike the moss layer, which requires a lot of water. This stratum only receives light filtered by the canopy. i.e. it is preferred by semi-shade or shade-loving plants that would not tolerate bright sunlight. In the shrub layer, which consists of young trees and bushes, birds like the blackbird, song thrush, robin or blackcap are at home. They build their nests protected in the bushes and are therefore referred to as bush nesters. In addition to shrubs, such as elder, hazel, hawthorn, raspberry and blackberry, clematis may also occur. At the edge of a wood, the shrub layer acts as a windbreak close to the trees and protects the soil from drying out.

===Herbaceous layer===
[[File:Moos mit kleinem Baumstumpf.jpg|thumb|250px|Moss layer on the forest floor]]
The herbaceous stratum contains non-woody vegetation, or [[ground cover]], growing in the forest with heights of up to about one and a half metres. The herbaceous layer consists of various [[herbaceous plant]]s, [[grass]]es, dwarf shrubs ([[hemicryptophyte]]s, [[geophyte]]s, [[therophyte]]s and [[chamaephyte]]s) and young shrubs. In forests, early flowering plants appear first before the canopy fills out. Thereafter, the amount of light available to plants is significantly reduced and only those that are suited to such conditions can thrive. By contrast, grassland consists of moss and herbaceous layers. Sometimes, a shrub layer builds up as part of a process of reforestation ([[succession (ecology)|succession]]).

=== Forest floor ===
{{further|Forest floor}}

==== Moss layer====
Growing on the surface of the forest floor is vegetation of up to about 0.15 metres in height in what is variously described as a moss, soil or [[cryptogam]] layer. The ground itself is covered by a layer of dead plant and animal material. In this layer and the underlying few centimetres of the [[topsoil]] live innumerable small soil organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[algae]] and [[microorganism]]s, which break down the dead organic substances and work them into the soil. In places the ground is covered by [[lichen]]s and [[moss]]es.

====Root layer====
Also known as the [[rhizosphere]], the underground area of a plant habitat is the root layer. It consists of the plants' roots and related elements such as [[rhizome]]s, [[bulb]]s and [[tuber]]s.

'''Tunnel warfare''' is a general name for [[war]] being conducted in [[tunnels]] and other underground cavities.  It often includes the construction of underground facilities ('''mining''' or '''undermining''') in order to attack or defend, and the use of existing natural caves and artificial [[Subterranea (geography)|underground facilities]] for military purposes. Tunnels can be used to undermine [[fortification]]s and slip into enemy territory for a [[surprise attack]], while it can strengthen a [[defence (military)|defence]] by creating the possibility of [[ambush]], [[counterattack]] and the ability to transfer troops from one portion of the battleground to another unseen and protected.  Also, tunnels can serve as shelter for [[combatants]] and [[non-combatants]] from enemy attack.

Since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], [[sapper]]s have used mining against a [[Defensive wall|walled city]], [[Fortification|fortress]], [[castle]] or other strongly held and [[fortification|fortified military position]].  Defenders have dug '''counter mines''' to attack miners or destroy a mine threatening their fortifications.  Since tunnels are commonplace in [[urban area]]s, tunnel warfare is often a feature, though usually a minor one, of [[urban warfare]].

Tunnels are narrow and restrict [[field of fire (weaponry)|fields of fire]]; thus troops in a tunnel usually have only a few areas exposed to fire or sight at any one time.  They can be part of an extensive [[labyrinth]] and have [[cul-de-sac]]s and reduced [[lighting]], typically creating a closed-in [[night combat]] environment.

==Early times==

===Ancient Greece===
The Greek historian [[Polybius]], in his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'', gives a graphic account of mining and counter mining at the Roman siege of [[Ambracia]]:

{{quote |The Aetolians [...] offered a gallant resistance to the assault of the [[siege artillery]] and [the Romans], therefore, in despair had recourse to mines and underground tunnels.  Having safely secured the central one of their three works, and carefully concealed the shaft with wattle screens, they erected in front of it a covered walk or stoa about two hundred feet long, parallel with the wall; and beginning digging from that, they carried it on unceasingly day and night, working in relays. For a considerable number of days the besieged did not discover them carrying the earth away through the shaft; but when the heap of earth thus brought out became too high to be concealed from those inside the city, the commanders of the besieged garrison set to work vigorously digging a trench inside, parallel to the wall and to the stoa which faced the towers. When the trench was made to the required depth, they next placed in a row along the side of the trench nearest the wall a number of brazen vessels made very thin; and, as they walked along the bottom of the trench past these, they listened for the noise of the digging outside. Having marked the spot indicated by any of these brazen vessels, which were extraordinarily sensitive and vibrated to the sound outside, they began digging from within, at right angles to the trench, another underground tunnel leading under the wall, so calculated as to exactly hit the enemy's tunnel. This was soon accomplished, for the Romans had not only brought their mine up to the wall, but had under-pinned a considerable length of it on either side of their mine; and thus the two parties found themselves face to face.&lt;ref name=hst2128&gt;[[Polybius]]. ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]''. 21.28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]] then countered the Roman mine with smoke from burning feathers with charcoal.&lt;ref name=hst2128 /&gt;

Another extraordinary use of siege-mining in ancient Greece was during [[Philip V of Macedon]]'s siege of the little town of [[Prinassos]], according to Polybius, "the ground around the town were extremely rocky and hard, making any siege-mining virtually impossible. However, Philip ordered his soldiers during the cover of night collect earth from elsewhere and throw it all down at the fake tunnel's entrance, making it look like the Macedonians were almost finished completing the tunnels.  Eventually, when Philip V announced that large parts of the town-walls were undermined, the citizens surrendered without delay."&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]]. ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]''. 16.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Polybius also describes the [[Seleucids]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] employing tunnels and counter-tunnels during the siege of Sirynx.&lt;ref&gt; Polyb. 10.31.6-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman===
The oldest known sources about employing tunnels and trenches for guerrilla-like warfare are [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]. After the uprising in [[Germania]] the insurgent tribes soon started to change defence from only local strongholds into utilising the advantage of wider terrain. Hidden trenches to assemble for surprise attacks were dug, connected via tunnels for secure fallback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/1*.html#3 Sextus Julius Frontinus; Strategemata: De Constituendo Statu Belli III./10]&lt;/ref&gt; In action often barriers were used to prevent the enemy from pursuing.

[[Roman legion]]s entering the country soon learned to fear this warfare, as the ambushing of marching columns caused high casualties. Therefore, they approached possibly fortified areas very carefully, giving time to evaluate, assemble troops and organize them. When the Romans were themselves on the defensive the large underground [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] system was utilised in the defence of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], as well as to evacuate fleeing leaders.

The use of tunnels as a means of guerrilla-like warfare against the Roman Empire was also a common practice of the Jewish rebels in Judea during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136 AD). With time the Romans understood that efforts should be made to expose these tunnels. Once an entrance was discovered fire was lit, either smoking out the rebels or suffocating them to death.

Well-preserved evidence of mining and [[counter-mine|counter-mining]] operations has been unearthed at the fortress of [[Dura-Europos]], which [[Siege of Dura Europos (256)|fell]] to the [[Sassanians]] in 256/7 AD during [[Roman–Persian wars]].

===China===
Mining was a siege method used in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] from at least the [[Warring States]] (481–221 BC) period forward. When enemies attempted to dig tunnels under walls for mining or entry into the city, the defenders used large [[bellows]] (the type the Chinese commonly used in heating up the [[blast furnace]] for smelting [[cast iron]]) to pump smoke into the tunnels in order to suffocate the intruders.&lt;ref name="ebrey 29"&gt;Ebrey, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval warfare ===
In warfare during the [[Middle Ages]], a "mine" was a tunnel dug to bring down castles and other [[fortification]]s. Attackers used this technique when the fortification was not built on solid rock, developing it as a response to [[Rock (geology)|stone]]-built castles that could not be burned like earlier-style wooden forts. A [[tunnel]] would be excavated under the outer defenses either to provide access into the fortification or to collapse the walls. These tunnels would normally be supported by temporary wooden props as the digging progressed. Once the excavation was complete, the attackers would collapse the wall or tower being undermined by filling the excavation with [[Early thermal weapons|combustible material]] that, when lit, would burn away the props leaving the structure above unsupported and thus liable to collapse. Later, [[explosive]]s like [[gunpowder]] were used for even greater effect.

A tactic related to mining is [[sapping]] the wall, where engineers would dig at the base of a wall with crowbars and picks. [[Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay]] recounts how at the battle of [[Carcassonne]], during the [[Albigensian Crusade]], "after the top of the wall had been somewhat weakened by bombardment from [[Petrary|petraries]], our engineers succeeded with great difficulty in bringing a four-wheeled wagon, covered in oxhides, close to the wall, from which they set to work to sap the wall"&lt;ref&gt;les Vaux-de-Cernay, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the siege of Carcassonne, defenders worked to prevent sapping by dumping anything they had down on attackers who tried to dig under the wall. Successful sapping usually ended the battle, since the defenders would no longer be able to defend their position and would surrender, or the attackers could enter the fortification and engage the defenders in close combat.

Several methods resisted or countered undermining. Often the siting of a castle could make mining difficult. The walls of a castle could be constructed either on solid rock or on sandy or water-logged land, making it difficult to dig mines.  A very deep ditch or moat could be constructed in front of the walls, as was done at [[Pembroke Castle]], or even artificial lakes, as was done at [[Kenilworth Castle]].  This makes it more difficult to dig a mine, and even if a breach is made, the ditch or moat makes exploiting the breach difficult.

{{anchor|Counter mine|Counter-mine}}Defenders could also dig counter mines.  From these they could then dig into the attackers' tunnels and [[sortie]] into them to either kill the miners or to set fire to the pit-props to collapse the attackers' tunnel. Alternatively they could under-mine the attackers' tunnels and create a [[camouflet]] to collapse the attackers' tunnels. Finally if the walls were breached, they could either place obstacles in the breach, for example a [[cheval de frise]] to hinder a [[forlorn hope]], or construct a [[coupure]].  The great concentric ringed fortresses, like [[Beaumaris Castle]] on [[Anglesey]], were designed so that the inner walls were ready-built coupures: if an attacker succeeded in breaching the outer walls, he would enter a [[killing field]] between the lower outer walls and the higher inner walls.

== Modern warfare ==
[[File:Mine at Leadfield.JPG|thumb|Example of a [[mine gallery]] with timber roof support]]
Increased firepower that came with the use of [[gunpowder]], [[cordite]] and [[dynamite]] made above ground fortifications very expensive if they should withstand any attack. Fortifications were covered with earth and finally they were built totally underground to protect crews and ammunition. For the purpose of firing, [[artillery]] and [[machine gun]] emplacements had [[Arrowslit|loopholes]].

Such a tunnel fortress was difficult to enter and inside there was no room for the attackers to hide from gunfire and explosives. On the other hand, [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] proved to have a devastating effect.

In [[trench warfare]] with heavily fortified [[stronghold]]s, the tactic of digging and [[Explosive mine|mining]] the enemy positions was used in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] during the [[Siege of Port Arthur]]. Extensive mining warfare was conducted by German, French, British and Australian troops on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]], where the largely static frontlines created favourable conditions for mining.

The largest mining operations were conducted in the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]], where specialist [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies]] placed 22 mines under [[German Empire|German]] lines. 19 were eventually exploded, killing about 10,000 German soldiers. Underground attacks especially broke the morale of the enemy if he was surprised in his secure positions. However, the huge craters that are the results of mining enemy positions could be obstacles during an advance, as was found at Petersburg [[Battle of the Crater]] and the Somme. Tunnels built to secure frontline supply were built in several places on the Western Front.

On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the successful [[Brusilov Offensive]] employed tunnel/trenches to allow the Russian troops to start the initial assault very close to the Austrian trenches. During [[World War II]], the [[rapid transit|rapid transit systems]] that existed in many cities became another military consideration.

The lessons of these battles led to the construction of even bigger systems of defence underground, like the [[Maginot line]] or the [[Westwall]] with their own infrastructures.

[[North Korea]], it has been claimed{{By whom|date=July 2013}}, has prepared several transport tunnels with a capacity 10,000 troops per hour for a possible invasion of [[South Korea]]. This melds the defensive tunnel warfare with [[Maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]].

The term '''tunnel war''' or '''tunnel warfare''' (地道战) was first used for the [[guerrilla]] tactic employed by the Chinese in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The tunnel systems were fast and easy to construct and enabled a small force to successfully fight superior enemies.

=== The coming of gunpowder ===
A major change took place in the art of tunnel warfare in the 15th century in Italy with the development of gunpowder to undermine enemy fortifications.

[[Ivan the Terrible]] took [[Kazan]] with the use of gunpowder explosions to undermine its walls.

Many fortresses built counter mine galleries, "hearing tunnels" which were used to listen for enemy mines being built. At a distance of about fifty yards they could be used to detect tunnelling.

The [[Moscow Kremlin]] had such tunnels.

Since the 16th century during assault on enemy positions saps, dug by [[sappers]], began to be used.

The Austrian general of Italian origin [[Raimondo Montecuccoli]] (1609-1680) in his classic work on military affairs described methods of destruction and countering of enemy saps. In his paper on "the assaulting of fortresses" [[Vauban]] (1633-1707) the creator of the French School of Fortification gave a theory of mine attack and how to calculate various saps and the amount of gunpowder needed for explosions.

===19th century===

====Crimean War====
As early as 1840 [[Eduard Totleben]] and [[Schilder-Schuldner]] had been engaged on questions of organisation and conduct of underground attacks. They began to use electric current to disrupt charges. Special boring instruments of complex design were developed.

In the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)]] underground fighting became immense. At first the allies began digging saps without any precautions. After a series of explosions caused by counter mine action the allies increased the depth of the tunnels but began to meet rocky ground and the underground war had to return to higher levels. During the siege Russian sappers dug 6.8 kilometres of saps and counter mines. During the same period the allies dug 1.3 kilometres. The Russians expended 12 tons of gunpowder in the underground war while the allies used 64 tons. These figures show that the Russians tried to create a more extensive network of tunnels and carried out better targeted attacks with only minimal use of gunpowder. The allies used outdated fuses so that many charges failed to go off. Conditions in the tunnels were severe: wax candles often went out, sappers fainted due to stale air, ground water flooded tunnels and counter mines. The Russians repulsed the siege and started to dig tunnels under the allies fortifications. The Russian success in the underground war was recognised by the allies. [[The Times]] noted that the laurels for this kind of warfare must go to the Russians.

====American Civil War====

The explosion blew a gap in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] defenses of [[Petersburg, Virginia]], creating a crater {{convert|170|ft|m}} long, {{convert|100|to|120|ft|m}} wide, and at least {{convert|30|ft|m|sigfig=1}} deep. The combat was accordingly known as the [[Battle of the Crater]]. From this propitious beginning, everything deteriorated rapidly for the Union attackers. Unit after unit charged into and around the crater, where soldiers milled in confusion. The Confederates quickly recovered and launched several counterattacks led by Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]]. The breach was sealed off, and Union forces were repulsed with severe casualties. The horror of this engagement was portrayed in the [[Charles Frazier]] novel, and subsequent [[Anthony Minghella]] movie, ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]''. 

During the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], in 1863, Union troops led by General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] tunnelled under the Confederate trenches and detonated a mine beneath the 3rd Louisiana Redan on June 25, 1863.  The subsequent assault, led by General [[John A. Logan]], gained a foothold in the Confederate trenches where the crater was formed, but the attackers were eventually forced to withdraw.

====World War I====
[[File:Mine-explosion-1916.jpg|thumb|left|Explosion of a mine seen from a French position. 1916]]
Mining saw a brief resurgence as a [[military tactic]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], when army engineers attempted to break the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] by tunneling under [[no man's land]] and laying large quantities of explosives beneath the enemy's trenches.  As in siege warfare, [[tunnel warfare]] was possible due to the static nature of the fighting. 

On the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western]] and [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] during the [[First World War]], the military employed specialist miners to dig tunnels.

On the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]], the high peaks of the Dolomites range were an area of fierce [[mountain warfare]] and [[Mines on the Italian Front (World War I)|mining operations]]. In order to protect their soldiers from enemy fire and the hostile alpine environment, both Austro-Hungarian and Italian military engineers constructed fighting tunnels which offered a degree of cover and allowed better [[Military logistics|logistics support]]. In addition to building [[Dugout (military)|underground shelters]] and covered supply routes for their soldiers, both sides also attempted to break the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] by tunneling under [[no man's land]] and placing explosive charges beneath the enemy's positions. Their efforts in high mountain peaks such as [[Col di Lana]], [[Lagazuoi]] and [[Marmolata]] were portrayed in fiction in [[Luis Trenker]]'s ''[[Mountains on Fire]]'' film of 1931.

On the Western Front, the main objective of tunnel warfare was to place large quantities of explosives beneath enemy defensive positions. When it was detonated, the explosion would destroy that section of the trench. The infantry would then advance towards the enemy front-line hoping to take advantage of the confusion that followed the explosion of an underground mine. It could take as long as a year to dig a tunnel and place a mine. As well as digging their own tunnels, the military engineers had to listen out for enemy tunnellers. On occasions miners accidentally dug into the opposing side's tunnel and an underground fight took place. When an enemy's tunnel was found it was usually destroyed by placing an explosive charge inside.

[[File:Butte de Vauquois.jpg|thumb|Mine craters - ''Butte de Vauquois'' memorial site, [[Vauquois]], France]]
During the height of the underground war on the Western Front in June 1916, [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers|British tunnellers]] fired 101 mines or camouflets, while German tunnellers fired 126 mines or camouflets. This amounts to a total of 227 mine explosions in one month - one detonation every three hours.&lt;ref name="durandgrouptunnelling"&gt;[http://www.durandgroup.org.uk/durand_group_tunnelling_information%20pt1.html online], access date 2016-08-03&lt;/ref&gt;  Large battles, like the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916 (see [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|mines on the Somme]]) and the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917, were also supported by mine explosions.

[[File:NLS Haig - Smashed up German trench on Messines Ridge with dead.jpg|thumb|right|240px|German trench destroyed by the explosion of a mine in the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. Approximately 10,000 German troops were killed when the mines were simultaneously detonated at 3.10 a.m. on 7 June 1917.]]
Well known examples are the [[Mines on the Italian Front (World War I)|mines on the Italian Front]] laid by Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners, where the largest individual mine contained a charge of {{convert|50,000|kg|lb|order=flip}} of [[Nitroglycerin|blasting gelatin]], and the activities of the [[Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers]] on the Western Front. At the [[First day on the Somme|beginning of the Somme offensive]], the British simultaneously detonated [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|19 mines of varying sizes]] beneath the German positions, including two mines that contained {{convert|40,000|lb|kg}} of explosives. 

In January 1917, [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|General Plumer]] gave orders for [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|over 20 mines]] to be placed under German lines at [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines]]. Over the next five months more than 8,000 metres of tunnel were dug and 450-600 tons of explosive were placed in position. Simultaneous explosion of the mines took place at 3.10 a.m. on 7 June 1917. The blast killed an estimated 10,000 soldiers and was so loud it was heard in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWtunnelling.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021092118/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWtunnelling.htm |archivedate=2011-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The near simultaneous explosions created {{nowrap|19}} large craters and ranks among the [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|largest non-nuclear explosions]] of all time. Two mines were not ignited in 1917 because they had been abandoned before the battle, and four were outside the area of the offensive. On 17 July 1955, a [[lightning]] strike set off one of these four latter mines. There were no human casualties, but one cow was killed. Another of the unused mines is believed to have been found in a location beneath a farmhouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Tweedie  | first = N. | title = Farmer who is sitting on a bomb | work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2004-01-12 | accessdate = 2010-05-17 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1451468/Farmer-who-is-sitting-on-a-bomb.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no attempt has been made to remove it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/messines.htm The Battle of Messines, 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; The last mine fired by the British in World War I was near [[Givenchy-en-Gohelle|Givenchy]] on 10 August 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510184955/http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm |archivedate=2015-05-10 |df= }} accessed 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; after which the [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers]] concentrated on constructing [[Dugout (shelter)#World War I|deep dugouts]] for troop accommodation.

====World War II====

=====Sino-Japanese war in World War II=====
The Ranzhuang tunnel evolved in the course of fighting back Japanese's mopping-up for the people in the central area of Mainland China, [[Hebei]] province. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]], the [[Chinese communists|Chinese Communist forces]] or local peasant resistance used tunnel war tactics against the Japanese (and later [[Kuomingtang]] during [[Chinese Civil War]]). The tunnels were dug beneath the earth to cover the battlefield with numerous hidden gun holes to make a surprise attack. The holes and entrance usually were hidden beneath a straw mat inside a house, or down a well. This allowed flexible manoeuver or exit.

However, the main disadvantages of tunnel war is that usually the Japanese could fill up the holes or pour water in to suffocate the resistance fighter inside the tunnels. This proved to be a major problem but was later solved by installing filters that would consume the water and poisonous gases. It is said that there were even women and children who voluntarily fought in the tunnels.

This is a famous military facility in China due to the movie ''[[Tunnel War]]'', which is based on the stories happened during fighting Japanese in the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;http://movie.douban.com/subject/3033864/&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of this war movie, more art pieces were produced and adapted in the same setting.&lt;ref&gt;http://movie.douban.com/subject/5343604/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Ranzhuang tunnel site ranked among key heritage preservation unit in China, [[Hebei]] province patriotism education base, national defense education base. Tens of thousands visitors were attracted each year. Most of the villagers were working in tourism service industry, an industry worth US$700,000 each year.

=====Japan-U.S. war in World War II=====
The first to copy tunnel warfare were the [[Japan]]ese themselves. In the battles of the Western Pacific, they would maximize their capabilities by establishing a strong point defense, utilizing cave warfare. The first encounter of the US Marines with this new tactic was the island of [[battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]]. The invading marines suffered twice as many casualties as on [[battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], where the old Japanese tactic of defending the beach had been employed. The pinnacle of this form of defense, however, can be found on [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], where the Japanese engineered the whole Mount Suribachi with many tunnels leading to defensive emplacements, or exits for quick counterattacks. Tunnel warfare by the Japanese forced the US Marines to adopt the "blowtorch and corkscrew" tactics to systematically flush out the Japanese defenders, one cave at a time.

====Korean War====
On the Korean Peninsula the underground war reached a massive scale.  From experience in the Second World War the US relied upon aviation.  North Korean forces suffered heavy losses from air strikes which obliged them to construct underground shelters. Initially underground fortifications were built independently by individual units and their placement was chaotic. Subsequently underground fortifications were united into a single system. The extent of the underground war is attested to by the following facts. The length of the front was 250 kilometres while the length of underground tunnels was 500 kilometres. So for every kilometre of front there were two kilometres of underground tunnels. A total of 2,000,000 cubic metres of rock were extracted.

North Korea developed a theory of underground warfare. Manpower, warehouses and small calibre guns were completely housed underground making them less vulnerable to air strikes and artillery.  On the surface the many false targets (bunkers, trenches and decoy entrances to the tunnel system) made it difficult to detect true targets forcing US forces to waste ammunition.  Directly under the surface spacious barracks were built, allowing whole units to be quickly brought to the surface for a short time and as quickly returned to shelter underground.

North Korea even created underground shelters for artillery.  During bombing artillery was rolled into bunkers located inside mountains. When a lull came the guns were rolled back out onto a firing area, fired some shells, and rolled back into the bunker again.  Unlike other examples of underground warfare North Korean troops did not just remain in the tunnels.  North Korean forces were sheltering in the tunnels from the bombing and shelling and awaiting US bayonet attack.  When US forces reached the ground in the area of the tunnels, chosen North Korean units would emerge to engage in hand-to-hand combat taking advantage of their numerical superiority.

Currently North Korean strategy is to construct as many underground facilities as possible for military use in the event of a US attack. The depth of underground facilities reaches 80 to 100 metres making them difficult to destroy even with the use of tactical nuclear weapons.

In the [[Korean War]] the tactic of tunnel warfare was employed by the Chinese forces themselves. "The Chinese resort to tunnel warfare, and the devastating losses to American soldiers, led to the sealing of tunnel entrances by United Nations Command. According to later [[prisoner of war]] interrogations, Chinese officers had killed a number of their own soldiers in the tunnels, because the latter had wished to dig their way out and surrender to the [[United Nations Command]]."&lt;ref&gt;Major Allen D.Reece&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam War====
To maintain a full scale guerrilla war in Southern Vietnam, camouflaged bases were used capable of supplying the guerillas for a long period of time. Throughout Southern Vietnam there were secret underground bases that operated successfully. There are reports that every villager was obliged to dig 90 centimetres of tunnel a day. The largest underground base was the tunnels of [[Cu Chi]] with overall length of 200 miles. To combat the guerillas in the tunnels the US used special forces-[[tunnel rats]].

Part of the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] was based in caves made of [[karst]].

When Vietnam became a French colony again after the Second World War, the Communistic Vietminh started to dig tunnels close to Saigon. After the French army left (they were defeated at [[Dien Bien Phu]]) the tunnels were maintained in case the plausible war with South-Vietnam would start. Ho Chi Minh, leader of North-Vietnam, ordered to expand the tunnels after the Americans entered the war between the North and the South; the tunnels would be used by the [[Viet Cong]]. Systems of tunnels were not occupied temporarily for military purpose, but began to contain whole villages of people living permanently underground. The tunnels were a complete underworld, it was all there; kitchens, hospitals, workshops, sleeping areas, communications, ammunition storage, even some entertainment. The tunnels eventually became a target for American forces because the enemy could hide in it and strike everywhere in the range of the tunnel complex (hundreds of miles) without a single warning and then disappear again.

These tactics were also applied against the Chinese during the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]].

====Afghan War====
An underground war was actively pursued in the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan War]]. Water pipes extend under the entire Afghan territory. In wartime, Afghans have used these tunnels to hide and also to appear suddenly in the enemies rear. To clear these tunnels Soviet troops used explosives and gasoline. The most famous underground base of the [[Mujahideen]] and then the [[Taliban]] was [[Tora Bora]] - this tunnel system went to a depth of 400 meters and had a length of 25 kilometers. To combat guerillas in tunnels both the Soviet Union and the United States have created special forces.

====Bosnian War====
Between May 1992 and November 1995, during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian War the Bosnian Army]] built the [[Sarajevo Tunnel]] in order to link the city of Sarajevo, which was entirely cut off by Serbian forces, with the Bosnian-held territory on the other side of the Sarajevo Airport, an area controlled by the United Nations.  The tunnel linked the Sarajevo neighbourhoods of Dobrinja and Butmir, allowing food, war supplies, and humanitarian aid to come into the city, and people to get out. The tunnel was one of the major ways of bypassing the international arms embargo and providing the city defenders with weaponry.

===21st century===

==== Palestine-Israel war ====

[[File:US Ambassador to Israel Shapiro Visit to Attack Tunnel.webm|thumb|US Ambassador to Israel [[Daniel B. Shapiro|Shapiro]]'s Visit to a Palestinian attack tunnel in 2013.]]
Sometimes the ongoing conflict between [[Israeli Army]] and [[Palestinians]] under the border of Gaza is called tunnel war.

In 2017 the [[Barrier against tunnels along the Israel-Gaza Strip border]] began to be built.  On October 30 an attack tunnel was located within Israeli borders and was detonated. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Islamic-Jihad-threatens-to-build-more-terror-tunnels-reports-12-dead-in-recent-blast-513321&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon-Israeli War====
In July 2006, a group of [[Hezbollah]] fighters crossed from southern Lebanon into northern Israel [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|killing three Israeli soldiers and abducting two]], which started the [[2006 Lebanon War|Lebanon-Israeli war]]. Faced with Israeli's air attacks, Hezbollah needed to create a defensive system that would enable these rocket attacks to continue uninterrupted throughout any conflict with Israel. To do so they created an intricate system of tunnels and underground bunkers, anti-tank units, and explosive-ridden areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepicaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/hezbollah-a-decade-of-empowerment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezbollah built a sophisticated underground network of tunnels with North Korean assistance, with close resemblance to [[North Korea]]'s own network of tunnels in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.&lt;ref name="IranianInfluence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/183391#.U9kXAeOSw8k North Korea, Iran Held Responsible for Hezbollah Rocket Fire], 7/27/2014&lt;/ref&gt; The underground network included twenty five kilometer underground tunnels, bunkers, fiber optics communication systems, and storerooms to hold missiles and ammunition.&lt;ref name="IranianInfluence"&gt;[https://understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/20080215_IranianInfluence.pdf Iranian influence in the Levant, Iraq, and Afghanistan], 2008, by Frederick w.

===Syrian civil war===
During the [[Syrian civil war]], rebel groups like the [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]], [[Al-Nusra]] and [[ISIS]] have dug tunnels and used explosives to attack fixed military positions of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] and allied militias. A notable example is the attack on the Air Force Intelligence Building in Aleppo where on 4 March 2015, rebel forces detonated a large quantity of explosives in a tunnel dug close to or under the building. The building suffered a partial collapse as a result of the explosion which was immediately followed by an armed rebel assault.&lt;ref name="nytimesSyria"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explosion Levels Hotel Housing Government Troops in Syria|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/world/middleeast/syria.html?_r=0|author=Hwaida Saad and Alan Cowell|publisher=New York Times|date=8 May 2014|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lwjSyria"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Front kills scores in bombing of Aleppo hotel|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2014/05/islamic_front_kills_over_50_in.php

== Famous tunnel war victories ==
*[[Jiaozhuanghu]] (焦庄户) tunnel war in Ranzhuang, [[Hebei]] province, that defeated the Japanese Army in the year 1942, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It was later made into the movie [[Tunnel War|Didao Zhan]] by the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]].
*[[Củ Chi tunnels]] a complex of over {{convert|200|km}} of tunnel systems that allowed [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|NLF guerrillas]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to keep a large presence relatively close to [[Saigon]].

==Tunnels after war==
Many of the famous war tunnels were later turned into tourist site due to their historic significance in wars. For example, [[Sarajevo Tunnel]] is now converted into a war museum, with 20 meters of the original tunnel open for tourists visit. [[Hebei]] Ranzhuang tunnel is also a famous [[war tourism]] site in China.

'''uBiome''' is a [[biotechnology]] company based in [[San Francisco]] that has developed key technology to sequence the human [[Microbiota|microbiomes]].  

==History==
The company was founded by Jessica Richman, Zachary Apte, and Will Ludington who were scientists in the [[California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Teresa|title=Swabbing for Science|url=http://berkeleysciencereview.com/article/swabbing-for-science/|work=The Berkeley Science Review|date=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vachelard|first1=J|last2=Gambarra-Soares|first2=T|last3=Augustini|first3=G|last4=Riul|first4=P|last5=Maracaja-Coutinho|first5=V|title=A Guide to Scientific Crowdfunding.|journal=PLOS Biology|date=17 February 2016|volume=14|issue=2|pages=e1002373|pmid=26886064|pmc=4757556|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founders received mentoring and funding from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] and further funding from [[ Andreessen Horowitz]] and 8VC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/18/ubiome-raises-4-5m-from-angel-investors-andreessen-horowitz-to-crowdsource-microbiome-research/ |publisher = TechCrunch |last = Chokkattu |first = Julian |title = uBiome Raises $4.5M From Angel Investors, Andreessen Horowitz To Crowdsource Microbiome Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Dillet |first= Romain |title = Andreessen Horowitz Raises Massive New $1.5 Billion Fund |publisher = TechCrunch |url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/27/andreessen-horowitz-raises-massive-new-1-5-billion-fund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/gut-health-startup-ubiome-raised-22-million-and-is-launching-a-dna-test-for-your-poop/ | publisher = TechCrunch |last = Buhr| first = Sarah |title = Gut health startup uBiome has raised $15.5 million and is launching a DNA test for your poop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, uBiome offered a $1 million grant program to researchers and citizen scientists for microbiome sampling and related analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/OSTP%20National%20Microbiome%20Initiative%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title=FACT SHEET: Announcing the National Microbiome Initiative|last=|first=|date=May 13, 2016|website=obamawhitehouse.archives.gov|publisher=The White House|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One winner of the first round of such grants was the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref name=Wired2015&gt;Zhang, Sarah.

Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set.&lt;ref name=FastCo&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3039891/gut-check |last=Gertner |first=Jon |title=What's Lurking In Your Microbiome?

== Controversies ==
Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by [[bioethicists]] about the company's [[citizen science]] business model - namely whether it had actually obtained [[informed consent]] from its customers, and whether [[Genetic_testing#Direct-to-consumer_genetic_testing|direct to consumer genetic testing]] initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of [[Institutional review board]] (IRB) approval.&lt;ref name="WSJ2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ethics-of-experimenting-on-yourself-1414170041|title=The Ethics of Experimenting on Yourself|date=24 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|last1=Marcus|first1=Amy Dockser}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/urban-scientist/on-ethics-and-self-policing-in-citizen-science/|title=On Ethics and Self-Policing in (Citizen) Science|date=February 22, 2013|work=Scientific American Blog Network|last1=DNLee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Crowdsourced-Research-Delves/141795/|title=Crowdsourced Research Delves, Uncertainly, Into the Human Microbiome|date=23 September 2013|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues.&lt;ref name=WSJ2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/meet-your-microbes-ubiome-offers-new-service/|title=Meet Your Microbes: uBiome Offers New Service|date=June 25, 2013|work=Science-Based Medicine|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In domains of [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], the '''Universal Dielectric Response''', or '''UDR''', refers to the observed emergent behaviour  of the [[dielectric]] properties exhibited by diverse solid state systems. In particular this widely observed response involves power law scaling of dielectric properties with [[frequency]] under conditions of [[alternating current]], AC. First defined in a landmark article by [[A. K. Jonscher]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The 'universal'dielectric response| journal= Nature| year=1977| volume=267| issue=5613| page=673| bibcode=1977Natur.267..673J| doi=10.1038/267673a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of the UDR were attributed to the dominance many-body interactions in systems, and their analogous RC network equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The universal dielectric response and its physical significance| journal= ." IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation| year=1992| volume=27| issue=3| page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Dielectric Response manifests in the variation of AC Conductivity with frequency and is most often observed in complex systems consisting of multiple phases of similar or dissimilar materials. Such systems, which can be called heterogenous or composite materials, can be described from a dielectric perspective as a large network consisting of resistor and capacitor elements, known also as an [[RC circuit|RC network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCullen | first1= Nicholas J. | title= The robustness of the emergent scaling property of random RC network models of complex materials | journal= . Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics  | year=2009 | volume=42 | issue=6
| page=064001| bibcode= 2009JPhD...42f4001M | doi= 10.1088/0022-3727/42/6/064001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At low and high frequencies, the dielectric response of heterogeneous materials is governed by percolation pathways. If a heterogeneous material is represented by a network in which more than 50% of the elements are capacitors, [[percolation]] through capacitor elements will occur. This percolation results in conductivity at high and low frequencies that is directly proportional to frequency. Conversely, if the fraction of capacitor elements in the representative RC network (P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is lower than 0.5, dielectric behavior at low and high frequency regimes is independent of frequency. At intermediate frequencies, a very broad range of heterogeneous materials show a well-defined emergent region, in which power law correlation of [[admittance]] to frequency is observed. The power law emergent region is they key feature of the UDR. In materials or systems exhibiting UDR, the overall dielectric response from high to low frequencies is symmetrical, being centered at the middle point of the emergent region, which occurs in equivalent RC networks at a frequency of :&lt;math&gt;\omega = (RC)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. In the power law emergent region, the  admittance of the overall system follows the general power law proportionality &lt;math&gt; Y\propto\omega^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;, where the power law exponent α can be approximated to the fraction of capacitors in the equivalent RC network of the system α≅P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Universality of the emergent scaling in finite random binary percolation networks| journal= PLOS One | year=2017 | volume=12 |issue=2 | pages= e0172298| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0172298| pmid= 28207872 | pmc= 5312937 | last1= Zhai | first1= C | last2= et al | bibcode= 2017PLoSO..1272298Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of the UDR ==
The power law scaling of dielectric properties with frequency is valuable in interpreting [[impedance spectroscopy]] data towards the characterisation of responses in emerging [[ferroelectric]] and [[multiferroic]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=MacDonald | first1= J.R.| title= Generalizations of ''universal dielectric response''and a general distribution‐of‐activation‐energies model for dielectric and conducting systems| journal= Journal of Applied Physics| year=1985| volume=58| issue=5| page=1971| bibcode=1985JAP....58.1971M| doi=10.1063/1.336004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Pattanayak | first1= Samita| title= Generalizations of ''Effect of Dy-substitution on structural, electrical and magnetic properties of multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramics| journal= Ceramics International | year=2014| volume=40| issue=6| page=7983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban archaeology''' is a sub discipline of [[archaeology]] specialising in the material past of [[town]]s and [[cities]] where long-term human habitation has often left a rich record of the past.

Humans produce waste: Large concentrations of humans produce large concentrations of waste. Kitchen waste, broken objects, and similar material all need to be disposed of. Small numbers of people can dispose of their waste locally without encouraging [[vermin]] or endangering their health. Once people began to live together in large numbers, around five thousand years ago, such methods began to become impractical. Material would be brought into these new settlements but would rarely be taken out again. {{clarify|date=November 2014}}

Up until the nineteenth century when organised rubbish disposal became widespread in urban areas people invariably threw their waste from their windows or buried it in their gardens. If their houses fell down, a common enough occurrence when planning laws were non-existent, owners would pick out what they could reuse, stamp down the remains and rebuild on the old site.

The effect of this is that even a moderately sized settlement of any antiquity is built on top of a heap of refuse and demolished buildings and is therefore raised up from its original height on a plateau of archaeology. This is most apparent in the [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] sites of the [[Near East]] where towns that have been occupied for thousands of years are raised up many metres above the surrounding landscape.

In walled towns such as those in [[medieval]] [[Europe]] the effect of the encircling defences was to hold in the waste so that it could not slip outwards, magnifying the effect.

==Historic development==

Archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] within historic cities therefore often produces a thick [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]] dating back to the original foundation and telling the story of its history.

The [[City of London]] serves as an example, for urban excavations have been performed there since the late 1900s. These excavations, performed in populated areas of the city, revealed historical evidence of events unforeseen previously by historians. London sits on a tel, which preserves a layer of dark material, attributed to the burning of the city by [[Boudica]] in 60 AD. It was only by excavation of the urban areas that these revelations could be made, as the city has long since outgrown its borders after its rebuild, some years after the Boudican revolt.

The dense stratigraphy of such cities posed problems for the archaeologists who first excavated them. Earlier excavations were generally limited to rural areas, or towns which had been long abandoned. [[Open area excavation]] was feasible as there was plenty of space and the archaeology could often be exposed just in plan. In working cities however, space for excavation is usually limited to the size of the open plot and one layer of archaeology needs to be excavated before the next one can be exposed.

Issues such as this had appeared before, at [[Pompeii]] or at multiphase rural sites but the move towards the investigation of cities, which began in Europe following the [[Second World War]]. The trend of urban excavation in areas such as Europe, the East Coast of the United States, and other western world cities, has grown since the war. Due to the bombing of landscapes during the war, the possibility of losing evidence connected to early civilizations became realized. The idea of settlement follows a principle, that settlement is made where resources are conveniently accessed. Prosperous cities, such as Boston and London, began as settlements, and grew quickly due to the convenient access of resources. However, the fact that these cities still exist today does not dismiss the fact that, at some point in history, some other civilization had once settled there.

==Methods==

The resulting solution revolved around the method of [[single context recording]]. The practice involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid rather than planning large areas at once. Each drawing is made on a square piece of translucent film representing a 5-metre x 5 metre grid square. The site is excavated down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features excavated and recorded as normal but also planned as single contexts. The site is then reduced to the next layer of archaeology and the process begins again. The excavation and recording can continue until natural deposits are reached. A small, deep trench known as a [[sondage]] is often excavated at first to provide a view of the entire stratigraphy at once and give an indication of the quantity of material to be excavated.

Once the work is finished, the square sheets can be overlaid onto one another to provide a picture of the site. By identifying which features cut others and using information from dateable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s and [[ecofact]]s an archaeologist can isolate various phases of activity and show how the use of the site developed of periods of hundreds or even thousands of years. Context record sheets produced by the individual excavators provide further information on each context's nature and relationship with its neighbours. Such interpretation would be impossible using open area excavation where numerous overall site plans would soon seem inflexible.
