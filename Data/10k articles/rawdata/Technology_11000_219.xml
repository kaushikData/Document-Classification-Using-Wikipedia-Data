'''Additive manufacturing file format''' ('''AMF''') is an [[open standard]] for describing objects for [[additive manufacturing]] processes such as [[3D printing]]. The official [[ISO]]/[[ASTM]] 52915:2016&lt;ref name="ASTM F2915" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO 52915" /&gt; [[International standard|standard]] is an [[XML]]-based format designed to allow any [[computer-aided design]] software to describe the shape and composition of any [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] object to be fabricated on any [[3D printer]]. Unlike its predecessor [[STL (file format)|STL format]], AMF has native support for color, materials, lattices, and constellations.

==Structure==
An AMF can represent one object, or multiple objects arranged in a constellation. Each object is described as a set of non-overlapping volumes. Each volume is described by a triangular mesh that references a set of points (vertices). These vertices can be shared among volumes belonging to the same object. An AMF file can also specify the material and the color of each volume, as well as the color of each triangle in the mesh. The AMF file is compressed using the zip compression format, but the ".amf" file extension is retained. A minimal AMF reader implementation must be able to decompress an AMF file and import at least geometry information (ignoring curvature).

===Basic file structure===
The AMF file begins with the XML declaration line specifying the XML version and encoding. The remainder of the file is enclosed between an opening {{tag|amf|o}} element and a closing {{tag|amf|c}} element. The unit system can also be specified (millimeter, inch, feet, meter or micrometer). In absence of a units specification, millimeters are assumed.

Within the AMF brackets, there are five top level elements. Only a single object element is required for a fully functional AMF file.

# '''{{tag|object|o}}''' The object element defines a volume or volumes of material, each of which are associated with a material ID for printing. At least one object element must be present in the file. Additional objects are optional.
# '''{{tag|material|o}}''' The optional material element defines one or more materials for printing with an associated material ID. If no material element is included, a single default material is assumed.
# '''{{tag|texture|o}}''' The optional texture element defines one or more images or textures for color or texture mapping, each with an associated texture ID.
# '''{{tag|constellation|o}}''' The optional constellation element hierarchically combines objects and other constellations into a relative pattern for printing.
# '''{{tag|metadata|o}}''' The optional metadata element specifies additional information about the object(s) and elements contained in the file.

===Geometry specification===
The format uses a [[Polygon mesh#Face-vertex meshes|Face-vertex]] polygon mesh layout. Each top-level {{tag|object|o}} element specifies a unique &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt;. The {{tag|object|o}} element can also optionally specify a material. The entire mesh geometry is contained in a single &lt;tt&gt;mesh&lt;/tt&gt; element. The mesh is defined using one {{tag|vertices|o}} element and one or more {{tag|volume|o}} elements. The required {{tag|vertices|o}} element lists all vertices that are used in this object. Each vertex is implicitly assigned a number in the order in which it was declared, starting at zero. The required child element {{tag|coordinates|o}} gives the position of the point in 3D space using the {{tag|x|o}}, {{tag|y|o}} and {{tag|z|o}} elements.
After the vertex information, at least one {{tag|volume|o}} element must be included. Each volume encapsulates a closed volume of the object, Multiple volumes can be specified in a single object. Volumes may share vertices at interfaces but may not have any overlapping volume.
Within each volume, the child element {{tag|triangle|o}} is used to define triangles that tessellate the surface of the volume. Each {{tag|triangle|o}} element will list three vertices from the set of indices of the previously defined vertices given in the {{tag|vertices|o}} element. The indices of the three vertices of the triangles are specified using the {{tag|v1|o}}, {{tag|v2|o}} and {{tag|v3|o}} elements. The order of the vertices must be according to the right-hand rule, such that vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order as viewed from the outside. Each triangle is implicitly assigned a number in the order in which it was declared, starting at zero.

===Color specification===
Colors are introduced using the {{tag|color|o}} element by specifying the red, green, blue and alpha ([[RGBA color space|transparency]]) channels in the [[sRGB]] [[color space]] as numbers in the range of 0 to 1. The {{tag|color|o}} element can be inserted at the material, object, volume, vertex, or triangle levels, and takes priority in reverse order (triangle color is highest priority). The transparency channel specifies to what degree the color from the lower level is blended in. By default, all values are set to zero.

A color can also be specified by referring to a formula that can use a variety of coordinate-dependent functions.

====Texture maps====
Texture maps allow assigning color or material to a surface or a volume, borrowing from the idea of [[Texture mapping]] in graphics. The {{tag|texture|o}} element is first used to associate a &lt;tt&gt;texture-id&lt;/tt&gt; with particular texture data. The data can be represented as either a 2D or a 3D array, depending on whether the color or material need to be mapped to a surface or a volume. The data is represented as a string of bytes in [[Base64]] encoding, one byte per pixel specifying the grayscale level in the 0-255 range.

Once the texture-id is assigned, the texture data can be referenced in a color formula, such as in the example below.

Usually, however, the coordinated will not be used directly as shown above, but transformed first to bring them from object coordinates to texture coordinates. For example, &lt;tt&gt;tex(1,f1(x,y,z),f2(x,y,z),f3(x,y,z))&lt;/tt&gt; where &lt;tt&gt;f1(), f2(), f3()&lt;/tt&gt; are some functions, typically linear.

===Material specification===
Materials are introduced using the &lt;material&gt; element. Each material is assigned a unique id. 
Geometric volumes are associated with materials by specifying a material-id within the &lt;volume&gt; element.

====Mixed, graded, lattice, and random materials====
New materials can be defined as compositions of other materials. The element {{tag|composite|o}} is used to specify the proportions of the composition, as a constant or as a formula dependent of the x, y, and z coordinates. A constant mixing proportion will lead to a homogenous material. A coordinate-dependent composition can lead to a graded material. More complex coordinate-dependent proportions can lead to nonlinear material gradients as well as periodic and non-periodic substructure. The proportion formula can also refer to a texture map using the &lt;tt&gt;tex(textureid,x,y,z)&lt;/tt&gt; function. Reference to material-id "0" (void) is reserved and may be used to specify porous structures. Reference to the &lt;tt&gt;rand(x,y,z)&lt;/tt&gt; function can be used to specify pseudo-random materials. The &lt;tt&gt;rand(x,y,z)&lt;/tt&gt; function returns a random number between 0 and 1 that is persistent for that coordinate.

===Print constellations===
Multiple objects can be arranged together using the {{tag|constellation|o}} element. A constellation can specify the position and orientation of objects to increase packing efficiency and to describe large arrays of identical objects. The {{tag|instance|o}} element specifies the displacement and rotation an existing object needs to undergo to arrive into its position in the constellation. The displacement and rotation are always defined relatively to the original position and orientation in which the object was defined. A constellation can refer to another constellation as long as cyclic references are avoided.

If multiple top-level constellations are specified, or if multplie objects without constellations are specified, each of them will be imported with no relative position data. The importing program can then freely determine the relative positioning.

===Meta-data===
The {{tag|metadata|o}} element can optionally be used to specify additional information about the objects, geometries and materials being defined. For example, this information can specify a name, textual description, authorship, copyright information and special instructions. The {{tag|metadata|o}} element can be included at the top level to specify attributes of the entire file, or within objects, volumes and materials to specify attributes local to that entity.

=== Optional curved triangles ===
[[File:curved triangle.jpg|thumb|A curved triangle patch. Normals at vertices are used to recursively subdivide the triangle into four sub-triangles]]

In order to improve geometric fidelity, the format allows curving the triangle patches. By default, all triangles are assumed to be flat and all triangle edges are assumed to be straight lines connecting their two vertices. However, curved triangles and curved edges can optionally be specified in order to reduce the number of mesh elements required to describe a curved surface. The curvature information has been shown to reduce the error of a spherical surface by a factor of 1000 as compared to a surface described by the same number of planar triangles.&lt;ref name="ASTM F2915" /&gt; Curvature should not create a deviation from the plane of the flat triangle that exceeds 50% of the largest dimension of the triangle.

To specify curvature, a vertex can optionally contain a child element {{tag|normal|o}} to specify desired surface normal at the location of the vertex. The normal should be unit length and pointing outwards. If this normal is specified, all triangle edges meeting at that vertex are curved so that they are perpendicular to that normal and in the plane defined by the normal and the original straight edge. When the curvature of a surface at a vertex is undefined (for example at a cusp, corner or edge), an {{tag|edge|o}} element can be used to specify the curvature of a single non-linear edge joining two vertices. The curvature is specified using the tangent direction vectors at the beginning and end of that edge. The {{tag|edge|o}} element will take precedence in case of a conflict with the curvature implied by a {{tag|normal|o}} element.

When curvature is specified, the triangle is decomposed recursively into four sub-triangles. The recursion must be executed five levels deep, so that the original curved triangle is ultimately replaced by 1024 flat triangles. These 1024 triangles are generated "on the fly" and stored temporarily only while layers intersecting that triangle are being processed for manufacturing.

===Formulas===
In both the {{tag|color|o}} and {{tag|composite|o}} elements, coordinate-dependent formulas can be used instead of constants. These formulas can use various standard algebraic and mathematical operators and expressions.

===Compression===
An AMF can be stored either as plain text or as compressed text. If compressed, the compression is in [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP archive]] format. A compressed AMF file is typically about half the size of an equivalent compressed binary STL file.{{dubious|date=April 2016}} The compression can be done manually using compression software such as WinZip, 7-Zip, or automatically by the exporting software during write. Both the compressed and uncompressed files have the AMF extension and it is the responsibility of the parsing program to determine whether or not the file is compressed, and if so to perform decompression during import.

==Design considerations==
When the ASTM Design subcommittee began developing the AMF specifications{{when|date=November 2018}}, a survey of stakeholders&lt;ref name="Rapid Today"/&gt; revealed that the key priority for the new standard was the requirement for a [[Proprietary software|non-proprietary]] format. Units and buildability issues were a concern lingering from problems with the STL format. Other key requirements were the ability to specify geometry with high fidelity and small file sizes, multiple materials, color, and microstructures. In order to be successful across the field of additive manufacturing, this file format was designed to address the following concerns

# '''Technology independence''': The file format must describe an object in a general way such that any machine can build it to the best of its ability. It is resolution and layer-thickness independent, and does not contain information specific to any one manufacturing process or technique. This does not negate the inclusion of properties that only certain advanced machines support (for example, color, multiple materials, etc.), but these are defined in such a way as to avoid exclusivity.
# '''Simplicity''': The file format must be easy to implement and understand. The format should be readable and editable in a simple text viewer, in order to encourage understanding and adoption. No identical information should be stored in multiple places.
# '''Scalability''': The file format should scale well with increase in part complexity and size, and with the improving resolution and accuracy of manufacturing equipment. This includes being able to handle large arrays of identical objects, complex repeated internal features (e.g. meshes), smooth curved surfaces with fine printing resolution, and multiple components arranged in an optimal packing for printing.
# '''Performance''': The file format must enable reasonable duration (interactive time) for read and write operations and reasonable file sizes for a typical large object.
# '''Backwards compatibility''': Any existing STL file should be convertible directly into a valid AMF file without any loss of information and without requiring any additional information. AMF files are also easily convertible back to STL for use on legacy systems, although advanced features will be lost.
# '''Future compatibility''': In order to remain useful in a rapidly changing industry, this file format must be easily extensible while remaining compatible with earlier versions and technologies. This allows new features to be added as advances in technology warrant, while still working flawlessly for simple homogenous geometries on the oldest hardware.

==History==
Since the mid-1980s, the [[STL (file format)|STL]] file format has been the ''de facto'' industry standard for transferring information between design programs and additive manufacturing equipment. The STL format only contained information about a surface mesh, and had no provisions for representing color, texture, material, substructure, and other properties of the fabricated target object. As additive manufacturing technology evolved from producing primarily single-material, homogenous shapes to producing multi-material geometries in full color with functionally graded materials and microstructures, there was a growing need for a standard interchange file format that could support these features. A second factor that ushered the development of the standard was the improving resolution of additive manufacturing technologies. As the fidelity of printing processes approached micron scale resolution, the number of triangles required to describe smooth curved surfaces resulted in unacceptably large file sizes.

During the 1990s and 2000s, a number of proprietary file formats have been in use by various companies to support specific features of their manufacturing equipment, but the lack of an industry-wide agreement prevented widespread adoption of any single format. In January 2009, a new [[ASTM International|ASTM]] Committee F42 on Additive Manufacturing Technologies was established, and a design subcommittee was formed to develop a new standard. A survey was conducted in late 2009&lt;ref name="Rapid Today"/&gt; leading to over a year of deliberations on the new standard. The resulting first revision of the AMF standard became official on May 2, 2011&lt;ref name="ASTM Release" /&gt;

During the July 2013 meetings of ASTM’s F42 and ISO’s TC261 in Nottingham (UK), the Joint Plan for Additive Manufacturing Standards Development was approved. Since then, the AMF standard is managed jointly by ISO and ASTM.

[[Image:Etna TAS2002209.jpg|thumb|right|230px|ASTER image draped over terrain model of [[Mount Etna]]]]
The '''Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer''' ('''ASTER''') is a Japanese sensor which is one of five [[remote sensing|remote sensory devices]] on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] satellite launched into [[Earth orbit]] by [[NASA]] in 1999. The instrument has been collecting data since February 2000.
[[Image:Rub' al Khali (Arabian Empty Quarter) sand dunes imaged by Terra (EOS AM-1).jpg|thumb|ASTER image of [[Rub' al Khali]] (Arabia's Empty Quarter)]]
ASTER provides high-resolution images of the planet [[Earth]] in 14 different [[spectral bands|band]]s of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], ranging from [[visible light|visible]] to thermal [[infrared]] light. The [[Angular resolution|resolution]] of images ranges between 15 and 90 meters. ASTER data are used to create detailed maps of surface temperature of land, [[emissivity]], [[reflectance]], and elevation.

In April 2008, the SWIR detectors of ASTER began malfunctioning and were publicly declared non-operational by NASA in January 2009. All SWIR data collected after 1 April 2008 has been marked as unusable.&lt;ref&gt;https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/about/news_archive/aster_user_advisory_updated_january_14_2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint operation between [[NASA]] and Japan's [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] (METI), the Global Digital Elevation Model is the most complete mapping of the earth ever made, covering 99% of its surface.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |title=Most complete earth map published |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=30 June 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8126197.stm |accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nasa satellite map reveals 99% of Earth's land surface for first time |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=1 July 2009 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1196475/Nasas-Aster-satellite-map-reveals-99-Earths-land-surface-time.html |accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDEM covers the planet from 83 degrees North to 83 degrees South (surpassing [[SRTM]]'s coverage of 56&amp;nbsp;°S to 60&amp;nbsp;°N), becoming the first earth mapping system that provides comprehensive coverage of the polar regions.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; It was created by compiling 1.3&amp;nbsp;million [[VNIR]] images taken by ASTER using single-pass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikolakopoulos |first1=K.

Despite the high nominal resolution, however, some reviewers have commented that the true resolution is considerably lower, and not as good as that of SRTM data, and serious artifacts are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/reviews.html#aster|title=Virtual Earth Products Reviews|accessdate=2009-07-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090531011246/http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/reviews.html| archivedate= 31 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=C.|last2=Filmer|first2=M.S. |last3=Featherstone|first3=W.E.|date=2010|title=Comparison and validation of recent freely-available ASTER-GDEM ver1, SRTM ver4.1 and GEODATA DEM-9S ver3 digital elevation models over Australia.|journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=57|issue=3|pages=337–347|url=http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;local_base=gen01-era02&amp;object_id=137777|accessdate=5 May 2012|bibcode = 2010AuJES..57..337H |doi = 10.1080/08120091003677553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these limitations have been confirmed by METI and NASA, who point out that the current version of the GDEM product is "research grade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/4.html|title=METI and NASA Release ASTER Global DEM|accessdate=2009-07-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529050255/http://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/4.html|archivedate=29 May 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 2011, version 2 of Global Digital Elevation Model was publicly released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/4.html|title=Release of ASTER GDEM Version 2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529050255/http://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/4.html|archivedate=29 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered an improvement upon version 1. These improvements include increased horizontal and vertical accuracy,&lt;ref name="geodesy.curtin.edu.au"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rexer|first1=M.|last2=Hirt|first2=C.|date=2014|title=Comparison of free high-resolution digital elevation data sets (ASTER GDEM2, SRTM v2.1/v4.1) and validation against accurate heights from the Australian National Gravity Database|journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=61|issue=2|pages=213|url=http://geodesy.curtin.edu.au/local/docs/Rexer_Hirt_2014_DEM_AJES_av.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1080/08120099.2014.884983|bibcode=2014AuJES..61..213R|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607102637/http://geodesy.curtin.edu.au/local/docs/Rexer_Hirt_2014_DEM_AJES_av.pdf|archivedate=7 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; better horizontal resolution, reduced presence of artifacts, and more realistic values over water bodies.&lt;ref name="lpdaac.usgs.gov"/&gt; However, one reviewer still regards the Aster version 2 dataset, although showing 'a considerable improvement in the effective level of detail', to still be regarded as 'experimental or research grade' due to presence of artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Ferranti|first=Jonathan|title=ASTER Digital Elevation Data|url=http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/reviews.html#aster|publisher=Viewfinder Panoramas, UK|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2014 study&lt;ref name="geodesy.curtin.edu.au"/&gt; showed that over rugged mountainous terrain the ASTER version 2 data set can be a more accurate representation of the ground than the SRTM elevation model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1282">The '''Belfast Operative Bakers' Union''' was a [[trade union]] representing bakery workers in [[Northern Ireland]].

The union described itself as having been founded in 1817 as the '''Belfast Bakers' Society'''.  By 1892, it was known as the '''Belfast Operative Bakers' Friendly and Allied Trades' Society''', with 400 members.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marsh |first1=Arthur |last2=Smethurst |first2=John B. |title=Historical Directory of Trade Unions |volume=5 |date=2006 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Aldershot |isbn=085967990X |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The union became part of the [[Irish National Federal Union of Bakers]] in 1900, but it left again in 1905, with a slightly increased membership, which peaked at 693 in 1909.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

The union merged into the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

A '''builder's photo''', also called an '''official photo''', is a specific type of [[photograph]] that is typically made by [[rail transport]] [[rolling stock]] manufacturers to show a vehicle that has been newly built or rebuilt. The builder's photo is meant to show an overview of the basic exterior form of a unit of rolling stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Railroad Model Craftsman| volume=56| publisher=Carstens Publishing| year=1987| page=102| title=(untitled)| url=https://books.google.com/?id=OgIoAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=railroad+%22builders+photo%22&amp;dq=railroad+%22builders+photo%22| via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs made by [[railfan]]s that show similar features to builder's photos are sometimes informally referred to as '''roster shots'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://akronrrclub.wordpress.com/tag/railroad-locomotive-roster-shots/| title=On Photography: Taking A Fresh Look at the Practice of Locomotive Roster Shooting, Part 1| date=January 6, 2016| website=Akron Railroad Club| first=Craig| last=Sanders| accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Builder's photos were also made by some automobile manufacturers to show a representative sample of new models they produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.berlinaregister.com/Nl37.htm| title=Berlina Register Newsletter No. 37 (April 2014)| accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prints of builder's photos were also often made for executives of the manufacturers and railroad companies to hang in their offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Long Island Railroad in Early Photographs| first=Ron| last=Ziel| year=1990| publisher=Dover Publications| location=New York| page=Image 4| isbn=9780486157603| url=https://books.google.com/?id=yTbDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=railroad+%22builders+photo%22#v=onepage&amp;q=railroad%20%22builders%20photo%22&amp;f=false| via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Builder's photos were also reproduced as [[post card]]s as well as reprinted in advertisements to promote the railroad companies or manufacturers depicted therein. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[steam locomotive]]s were often temporarily painted in [[photographic grey]] color schemes so they would photograph well in black and white images. Some details in darker-colored areas of the subject were also sometimes painted in a high-contrast bright color to ensure that they would be visible in the photograph. Historians and preservationists use builder's photos as official references to show the equipment as-built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://focus.nps.gov/GetAsset?assetID=0ded17e7-446c-457e-beef-b724b8b7fc71| page=6| title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form - Rio Grande Southern Railroad Engine No. 20| publisher=United States National Park Service| date=November 14, 2000| accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Builder's photos are commonly shot from an angle that shows one end, often the designated front end, and a full side of the car or locomotive. The rolling stock is normally positioned on a section of track with no other rolling stock coupled to it for the photograph. Sometimes the photograph was further processed to reduce the contrast of or even entirely remove the background to further highlight the rolling stock that was photographed.

'''Business (or commercial and industrial) waste''' – cover the commercial waste and industrial [[waste types]] . Generally, businesses are expected to make their own arrangements for the collection, treatment and disposal of their wastes. Waste from smaller shops and trading estates where local authority waste collection agreements are in place will generally be treated as [[municipal waste]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1993">The '''carpuject''' is a syringe device for the administration of injectable fluid medication. It was patented by the [[Sterling Drug Company]], which became the [[Sterling Winthrop]], after World War II. It is designed with a luer-lock device to accept a sterile hypodermic needle or to be linked directly to intravenous tubing line.  The product can deliver an intravenous or intramuscular injection by means of a holder which attaches to the barrel and plunger to the barrel plug.  Medication is prefilled into the syringe barrel. When the plug at the end of the barrel is advanced to the head of the barrel it discharges and releases the contents through the needle or into the lumen of the tubing.

The carpuject competed with the [[tubex (syringe cartridge)|tubex]] injection system developed by [[Wyeth]]. It has been redesigned several times to comply with sterility and infection controls standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Salvatore Turco |author2=Robert E King | title =Sterile Dosage Forms, Their Preparation and Clinical Application  | publisher = Lea &amp; Febiger  | year =1987  | location =Philadelphia  | pages =267–269  | url = | doi = | id =   | isbn = 0-8121-1067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Sterling opened a manufacturing plant in McPherson, Kansas. 	In 1988 [[Kodak]] purchased Winthrop Labs and in 1994 sold the injectable drug division and all intellectual property rights to [[Sanofi]], a French pharmaceutical company, now [[Sanofi Aventis]]. In 1997 Sanofi sold the injectable carpuject line of business to [[Abbott Laboratories]] of Abbott Park, IL for US$200 million.  They added generic injectable drugs to the injectable line. In  about 2004  Abbott separated its hospital supply line into a separate hospital supply company, Hospira from its drug division. The split placed all of Abbott's hospital products in a separate division. In 2015, Hospira, including the carpuject device, was purchased by [[Pfizer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3859">'''[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] Express Forwarding''' (CEF) is an advanced [[Network_layer|layer 3]] switching technology used mainly in large [[core network]]s or the [[Internet]] to enhance the overall network performance. Although CEF is a Cisco [[proprietary protocol]] other vendors of [[Multilayer switch|multi-layer switch]]es or high-capacity routers offer a similar functionality where layer-3 switching or [[routing]] is done in hardware (in an [[ASIC]]) instead of by software and the (central) [[CPU]].

==Function==
CEF is mainly used to increase [[packet switching]] speed by reducing the overhead and delays introduced by other routing techniques. CEF consists of two key components: The [[Forwarding Information Base|Forwarding Information Base (FIB)]] and '''adjacencies'''.

The '''FIB''' is similar to the routing table generated by multiple [[routing protocols]], maintaining only the next-hop address for a particular IP-route.

The '''adjacency table''' maintains layer 2 or switching information linked to a particular FIB entry, avoiding the need for an [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) request for each table lookup. There are several types of adjacencies. Some are listed below:

* '''Cache adjacency''': This type of entry contains the correct outbound interface and the correct [[Medium Access Control]] (MAC) address for its FIB entry. The MAC address is the IP address's MAC address if the destination's subnet is directly connected to the router, or is the MAC address of the router that the packet needs to be sent to if the destination's subnet is not directly connected to the router currently processing the packet.
* '''Receive adjacency''': This type of entry handles packets whose final destinations include the router itself. This includes packets whose IP addresses are assigned to the router itself, broadcast packets, and multicasts that have set up the router itself as one of the destinations.
* '''Null adjacency''': Handles packets destined to a NULL interface. Packets with FIB entries pointing to NULL adjacencies will normally be dropped.
* '''Punt adjacency''': Deals with packets that require special handling or can not be switched by CEF. Such packets are forwarded to the next switching layer (generally fast switching) where they can be forwarded correctly.
* '''Glean adjacency''': This adjacency is created when the router knows that either the destination IP's subnet is directly connected to the router itself and it does not know that destination device's MAC address, or the router knows the IP address of the router to forward a packet to for a destination, but it does not know that router's MAC address. Packets that trigger this entry will generate an ARP request.
* '''Discard adjacency''': FIB entries pointing to this type of adjacency will be discarded.
* '''Drop adjacency''': Packets pointing to this entry are dropped, but the prefix will be checked.

In order to take full advantage of CEF, it is recommended to use '''distributed CEF''' (dCEF), where there is a FIB table on each of the line cards. This avoids the need for querying the main processor or routing table in order to get the next-hop information. Instead, fast switching will be performed on the line card itself.

CEF currently supports [[Ethernet]], [[Frame Relay]], [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]], [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]], [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]], [[IP tunnel|tunnels]], and [[Cisco HDLC]].

A '''climbing harness''' is an item of [[climbing equipment]] for [[climbing|rock-climbing]], [[abseiling]], or other activities requiring the use of ropes to provide access or safety such as industrial rope access, working at heights, etc.  A harness secures a person to a [[rope]] or an anchor point.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book | edition = 7 | editor = Cox, Steven M. |editor2=Kris Fulsaas | title = [[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] | publisher = The Mountaineers | isbn = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | year = 2003-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its simplest form, a harness can be made from a length of rope or a nylon webbing tied round the waist. However this is extremely uncomfortable unless the wearer is very light. It can also ride up to the abdomen or even the diaphragm under load and cause serious injury. Looping the rope between the legs will prevent this, though care should be taken to avoid sensitive areas. More sophisticated harnesses exist in many patterns, designed to give greater comfort and security, and more options for carrying equipment.

While harnesses can be improvised, it is more common to use commercially produced harnesses, which often include padding and amenities such as gear loops.  Most commercial climbing harnesses meet the guidelines and manufacturing standards of organizations such as the [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] (UiAA) or [[European Committee for Standardization]].

Harnesses should be attached to dynamic (stretchy) rope, except possibly when abseiling where the rope is always taut. Falling onto a system consisting entirely of static components e.g. slings over even a very short distance e.g. a metre or two is enough to deliver large forces to the body and possibly cause the equipment to fail altogether. For [[via ferrata]], the harness is attached to lines [[Via ferrata#Via ferrata set|via a shock absorber]] that can absorb some of the impact in the event of a fall.

Attachment of the rope to the harness is done using a knot called a [[figure-eight follow through]], and often backed up with a stopper knot. Other knots are possible for the purpose, primarily a variation of the [[double bowline]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxuaCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA26|title=Climbing: Knots|last=Fitch|first=Nate|last2=Funderburke|first2=Ron|date=2015-10-15|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=|isbn=9781493015061|location=|pages=30|language=en|quote=the double bowline with a Yosemite finish is a less common way to attach the climbing rope to a climber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6hiCwAAQBAJ|title=Rock Climbing: Technique {{!}} Equipment {{!}} Safety – With an Introduction to Indoor Climbing|last=Heise-Flecken|first=Detlef|last2=Flecken|first2=Gabi|date=2016-03-28|publisher=Meyer &amp; Meyer Verlag|year=|isbn=9781782550358|location=|pages=20|language=en|quote=double bowline is more complicated than the Figure Eight and partner checks are harder to verify. ... single bowline is not safe while the double bowline is difficult to tie but is easier to undo after taking strain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/112122298/incident-climbers-bowline-came-untied-while-climbing-at-rifle|title=Incident: Climber's Bowline Came Untied While Climbing at Rifle|last=|first=|date=|website=Mountain Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-14|quote=there are many versions of the bowline, some of which are unsafe for climbing ...

In addition to the weight bearing parts of the harness, there are parts of the harness that are not designed to be part of the safety system. These include the gear loops, used for carrying equipment e.g. protection devices, carabiners, etc., and the elastic cords which pass behind the buttocks for the purpose of keeping the leg loops from slipping down while not under load. Any attempt to tie the safety system into these components could lead to failure and an unprotected fall. It is acceptable to attach the rope to a leg loop via a Prusik knot and carabiner, but this should only be done with the brake end of the rope in an abseil system in order to keep the Prusik clear of the belay plate. This end of the rope experiences considerably lower forces than the "live" end, due to the action of the belay device.

== History ==
The invention of the climbing harness has been attributed to [[Jeanne Immink]], a Dutch climber in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=fembio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/feature/jeanne-immink/europaeische-juedinnen|title=Jeanne Immink|author=Harry Muré|year=2008|work=FemBio.org|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first climbing harnesses were devised in the U.K. in the early 1960s by Alan Waterhouse, Paul Seddon and Tony Howard who went on to form the [[Troll (company)|Troll]] climbing equipment manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;http://ktml.freeservers.com/Misc/Troll.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A harness designed by British climber [[Don Whillans]] was made by Troll for the 1970 Annapurna South Face Expedition. It went into mass production shortly afterwards and soon became popular worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://emj.bmj.com/letters/?first-index=207&amp;hits=25&lt;/ref&gt;

The sit or seat harness was invented in the 1960s by Yosemite climbers.  The first innovation was the Swami Belt, which was multiple loops of webbing around the waist.  Then quickly came the Swami Seat, a sit harness tied from webbing, including leg loops and an integrated waist loop.  Once the seat/sit harness came to be, suppliers of climbing gear started making them with stitching replacing the knots.  The Swami Seat was revealed to the climbing world thru an article in Summit Magazine in the mid-60s.  Sewn harnesses came later.

== Types ==
[[File:Harness - 01.jpg|thumbnail]]
A '''sit harness''' consists of a waist belt and two leg loops which are normally connected in the front of the hips through a permanent webbing loop called a ''belay loop''. Belay loops are extremely strong, but nonetheless still a single point of failure that caused at least one notorious death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.climbing.com/news/loss-of-a-legend/|title=Todd Skinner: Loss of a Legend|last=Samet|first=Matt|date=2006-12-18|work=Climbing Magazine|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; For rock climbing, the rope typically goes through the two "tie-in loops" that are above and below the "belay loop". The [[figure-eight knot]] is mostly used for rock climbing. These are the most commonly used harnesses for recreational activities such as abseiling and rock climbing, as they afford a wide range of movement while still maintaining a high level of safety. Ensuring the harness fits correctly is key to avoiding pain in the upper thigh area caused by the leg loops being too tight around the upper legs and groin area, while at the same time ensuring that a climber flipped over in a fall does not slip out. The waist belt should be tightened snugly. Leg loops should not be particularly tight, but for obvious reasons neither should they have enough slack to allow extraneous parts of a male climber to get caught inside them.

A '''chest harness''' is worn around the shoulders, usually with a sit harness so as to provide an additional attachment point. This attachment point allows for better balance in some situations such as when carrying a heavy pack (as the [[centre of mass]] is below the connection to the rope) and when the person in the harness may be unable to maintain an upright position (due to injury or other influences).

A '''full-body harness''' is the combination of a sit harness and a chest harness which are permanently or semi-permanently connected to each other. This kind of harness normally offers a wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations, and also commonly used by small children instead of a sit harness which is easier to slip out of.

In a study conducted, researchers came to a conclusion that there was no statistically significant evidence revealing a pattern between harness type and severity of climbing accidents. Direct rock contact in rock climbing was the main reason for injury, not the type of climbing harness used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17447711 | volume=18 | title=Pattern of injury after rock-climbing falls is not determined by harness type | journal=Wilderness Environ Med | pages=30–5 | author=Hohlrieder M, Lutz M, Schubert H, Eschertzhuber S, Mair P | doi=10.1580/06-weme-or-020r.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
Most harnesses are generally made from [[webbing]]. This webbing is often nylon webbing as polyester webbing doesn't hold triglides{{clarify|date=March 2017|reason=The drug, the fish, or the Harley-Davidson?}} and [[d-ring]]s as well, and it's easier to untie nylon webbing. Specifically, [[Nylon 66]] is the most common type of nylon used for this webbing.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005149/http://www.mec.ca/AST/ContentPrimary/Learn/Climbing/HarnessesAndHelmets/ChoosingAHarness.jsp Nylon webbing popular choice for climbing gear]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scubaboard.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-448264.html Nylon vs polyester webbing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotrodders.com/forum/nylon-vs-polyester-thread-173165.html Breaking strength of nylon and polyester being about the same]&lt;/ref&gt; The webbing is often also tubular webbing, instead of flat webbing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countrybrookdesign.com/blog/why-climbers-use-tubular-webbing-instead-of-flat/ Tubular vs flat webbing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a single harness, there are many different weaves of nylon based on the intended function of the specific part of the harness. These weaves sometimes include polyester. The buckles are typically made of anodized aluminum. For the leg loops and waist belt, companies use various methods to make the harness comfortable. The most common method is cushioning the harness with foam and mesh. However, for more lightweight harnesses, some companies use wider waist belts and unidirectional fibers going along the waist belt to distribute the weight evenly and minimize pressure points. Harness designers use increasingly advanced materials such as [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene]] (UHMWPE), [[aramid fiber]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (Kevlar, Vectran, etc.), and [[sailcloth]] (e.g. the Black Diamond Vision harness) in order to make harnesses lighter and more comfortable. Different harnesses use different materials for these fibers across the leg loops and waist belt.

Current membership is more than 14,000, including individual CM/PM practitioners, corporate members, and construction owners in both public and private sectors, along with academic and associate members. CMAA has 29 regional chapters.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Website http://cmaanet.org/about-cmaa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards of Practice==
CMAA published the most recent revision of its ''Construction Management Standards of Practice'' in 2015. The SOP has been published and updated regularly by CMAA since the 1980s. It outlines standards for professional CM services in the areas of:
* Project Management
* Cost Management
* Time Management
* Quality Management
* Contract Administration
* Safety Management
* Program Management
* Sustainability
* Risk Management
* Building Information Modeling

==Certification==
According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, there is a growing movement toward [[certification]] of [[construction]] managers.&lt;ref&gt;''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition'', Department of Labor, Construction Managers http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos005.htm&lt;/ref&gt; CMAA established a voluntary certification program for construction managers, known as the Certified Construction Manager (CCM) program.The Construction Manager Certification Institute (CMCI)was established by CMAA to oversee the organization's certification program. In 2006, the CCM program was accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;"CMAA's Certification Program Wins Accreditation from ANSI" ''Engineering News-Record'' http://enr.ecnext.com/coms2/article_necoar060410b&lt;/ref&gt; under the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 17024, which recognizes certification programs for conformity assessment or a "demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;American National Standards Institute https://www.ansica.org/wwwversion2/outside/&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCM certification requires individuals to possess a requisite amount of experience and/or education. The eligibility requirements are:

1. Forty-eight months' experience as a CM in the qualifying areas as defined by the Qualifications Matrix and 2. One of the following:

*An undergraduate (4-year BA/BS level) or graduate degree in [[construction management]], [[architecture]], [[engineering]] or [[construction science]].
*A 2-year undergraduate degree (AA/AS level) or certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 4 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.)
*No degree/certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 8 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.)

In addition, two reference letters from a client or owner are required; they can be from any two projects that a candidate is documenting as part of their 48-month requirement. Finally, the candidate must pass the certification exam.

Most applicants are certified within 4 to 7 months of submitting their applications. The length of time it takes to become certified depends upon how quickly a candidate can submit a complete application including project documentation, how quickly the references respond, and how quickly a candidate can take and pass the CCM exam.

In 2013, the Construction Industry Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.construction-institute.org Construction Industry Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Texas adopted the CCM as "a value-adding credential" following a joint effort to compare and harmonize CII's Construction Best Practices with the CMAA SOP, and to assure that the CCM examination measured and recognized mastery of the Best Practices.

==Education==
In 2013, CMAA became a member society of ABET, formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering Technologies, the leading organization accrediting undergraduate and graduate education programs in engineering and related fields. ABET has introduced a new accreditation for undergraduate programs in Construction Management, with program-specific criteria adopted in 2015.

==Advocacy==
CMAA does host an advocacy program to represent the construction management industry before the United States Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, and industry stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Website: Government Affairs http://cmaanet.org/government-affairs&lt;/ref&gt; CMAA is active in several industry coalitions advocating investment in infrastructure and other industry interests.

==College of Fellows==

A designation CMAA awards to certain members who have proven to be industry leaders and "who have made significant contributions to their organizations, the industry and their profession," according to CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;Members of the CMAA [http://cmaanet.org/college-fellows College of Fellows] http://cmaanet.org/fellows&lt;/ref&gt; The College of Fellows meet consistently to discuss CM standards and issues facing the profession. The College also produces industry topic white papers and all members are particularly active in the association, often having served as past national presidents or in other leadership roles.

==Publications==
The association produces several publications, including the ''Construction Management Standards of Practice'' which defines the standards and practices of the construction management profession. Other CMAA publications include a bi-monthly newsletter, the ''CM Advisor''.

==Events==
CMAA hosts two industry events every year for the construction management profession.

CMAA's signature event is its '''National Conference &amp; Trade Show'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmaanet.org/nationalconference National Conference &amp; Trade Show]&lt;/ref&gt; held every fall.The national conference offers multiple seminars which count toward CCM certification or renewal, as well as Continuing Education Units for a variety of purposes. The conference also includes an awards ceremony known as the Project Achievement Awards. CMAA designates a panel of judges to evaluate and select entries of projects with the most significant contributions to the construction management industry.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Project Achievement Awards {{cite web |url=http://cmaanet.org/cmaaprojectachievementawards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026025619/http://cmaanet.org/cmaaprojectachievementawards |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMAA's '''Capital Projects Symposium''' is held every spring. The Symposium is designed for as a high level exploration of trends and issues affecting the delivery of capital projects and programs.

CMAA has also conducted regular surveys of owner attitudes, preferences, needs and expectations across the industry, along with research into CM/PM fees, adoption of technology, workforce concerns and other topics.

==Background==
When the series premiered in September 2005, it featured FBI agents [[Jason Gideon]], [[Aaron Hotchner]], [[Elle Greenaway]], [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]], [[Spencer Reid]], [[Jennifer Jareau|Jennifer "JJ" Jareau]], and [[Penelope Garcia]]. For season 1, Garcia was not a main cast member but rather had a recurring role, although she appeared in most episodes. In 2006, at the start of season 2, [[Lola Glaudini]] announced her departure from the show, as she wanted to return home to [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminalmindsfanatic.blogspot.com/2006/12/criminal-minds-lola-glaudini.html|title=Criminal Minds Fanatic's Favorite Things|author=Criminal Minds Fan|work=Criminal Minds Fanatic|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|location=[[Mountain View, California]]|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paget Brewster]] replaced her in the role of [[Emily Prentiss]].

At the start of season 3, [[Mandy Patinkin]] announced his departure from the show because he was deeply disturbed by the content of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Witchel|first1=Alex|title=Mandy Patinkin: 'I Behaved Abominably'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/magazine/mandy-patinkin-i-behaved-abominably.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left letters of apology for his fellow cast members, explaining his reasons and wishing them luck. [[Joe Mantegna]] replaced him as [[David Rossi]], a best-selling author and FBI agent who comes out of retirement. During season three, [[A. J. Cook]] became pregnant with her first child. Her pregnancy was written into the show. Cook's son, Mekhai Andersen, has been written into a recurring role as Jennifer's son Henry. Cook's void during [[maternity leave]] was filled by [[Meta Golding]], who played Jordan Todd, an FBI agent who works with the agency's Counter Terrorism Unit. In season 6, JJ is forced to accept a promotion at [[The Pentagon]], causing her to leave the BAU.

Later that season, Emily is seemingly killed off. Although she survives, she does not appear for the rest of the season. Cook and Brewster were both replaced by [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as [[Ashley Seaver]], an FBI cadet. CBS's decision to release Cook and Brewster from their contracts resulted in numerous fans writing angry letters to the studio and signing protest petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2010/06/fans-co-stars-back-minds-actresses-47466/|title=Fans And Co-Stars Back 'Minds' Actresses|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS rehired Cook and Brewster as Jennifer Jareau and Emily Prentiss, respectively; Nichols was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/jj-is-back-aj-cook-inks-2-year-deal-to-return-to-criminal-minds/|title=JJ Is Back!

===Main characters===
* [[Jason Gideon]] ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), senior supervisory special agent and former BAU unit chief (seasons 1–3)
: Gideon is widely known as the BAU's best profiler. After a series of emotionally troubling cases and the murder of his friend Sarah by fugitive serial killer Frank Breitkopf ([[Keith Carradine]]), he begins to feel burned out. The last straw occurs when Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner is suspended for two weeks by the team's boss—an action for which Jason feels responsible. He retreats to his cabin and leaves a letter for Dr. Spencer Reid, who he knows will be the one to look for him. When Spencer arrives at the cabin, it is empty except for the letter and Jason's badge and firearm. Jason is last seen remarking to a Nevada diner waitress that he does not know where he is going or how he will know when he gets there, leaving the diner and driving off. In season 10, he is killed (off-screen) by a suspect he had tracked down from one of his first cases.
* [[Aaron Hotchner]] ([[Thomas Gibson]]), Former BAU unit chief and senior supervisory special agent (seasons 1–12)
: Hotch is a former [[prosecutor]] and was originally assigned to the FBI field office in Seattle. He is one of the most experienced agents in the BAU. He struggles to balance the demands of his job with his family life, but his wife, Haley Brooks ([[Meredith Monroe]]), divorces him in season 3. In the episode "[[100 (Criminal Minds)|100]]" (season 5), Haley is killed by [[fugitive]] [[serial killer]] George Foyet ([[C. Thomas Howell]]), also known as "The Boston Reaper", whom Aaron fights and beats to death. He also has a son named Jack (Cade Owens) and a brother named Sean. After Haley is murdered, he has custody of Jack, and Haley's sister, Jessica Brooks (Molly Baker), helps him take care of Jack. When SSA Jennifer Jareau leaves the BAU, Aaron and technical analyst Penelope Garcia take over her job as communications liaison. Aaron dated a woman named Beth Clemmons ([[Bellamy Young]]), who first appeared in the episode "The Bittersweet Science" (season 7), before the couple separated after Clemmons accepted a job in Hong Kong. Following an on-set altercation, Thomas Gibson was removed from the main cast after season 12, episode 2, at which point it's claimed that Gibson's character took a consulting job off screen. In a later episode, it's revealed that the consulting job was a ruse and that Jack was being stalked by Peter "Mr. Scratch" Lewis, a serial killer from a previous BAU case. Therefore, Aaron and Jack went into the witness protection program. Following Lewis's death in the 13th season premiere, Prentiss reveals that Aaron has opted not to return to the BAU, but instead to retire to be a full-time parent to Jack.
* [[Elle Greenaway]] ([[Lola Glaudini]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|Supervisory Special Agent]] (seasons 1–2)
:Greenaway is assigned to the FBI field office in [[Seattle]] and assigned to the BAU as an expert in sexual offense crimes. Elle suffers extreme emotional trauma after being shot by an [[Person of interest|unsub]] in the season 1 finale ("The Fisher King (Part 1)"). In the season 2 premiere ("The Fisher King (Part 2)"), Elle survives and returns to duty sooner than SSA Jason Gideon and Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner would like. Several episodes later, while alone on stakeout of a suspected serial rapist, she murders the suspect by shooting in cold blood and planting her gun on the unarmed victim. The local police deem it self-defense, but Jason and Aaron question her ability as a profiler after this. Elle resigns, turning in her badge and gun to Aaron, declaring that it is "not an admission of guilt."
* [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]] ([[Shemar Moore]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|supervisory special Agent]] (seasons 1–11; guest star seasons 12–13)
: Morgan is a confident, assertive, and often hot-tempered character. He was raised by his mother, Fran, along with his two sisters, Sarah Morgan and Desiree Benita, after the death of his police officer father right in front of him. Derek was a troubled Chicago youth headed for [[juvenile delinquency]]. He was rescued and mentored by Carl Buford (Julius Tennon). Buford turned out to be a [[sexual predator]] who [[child molestation|molested]] Derek and other young boys; he was eventually arrested for murder. After developing an interest in football, Derek attended [[Northwestern University]] on a [[scholarship]]. After a football injury left him unable to play, he joined the [[Chicago Police Department]]'s [[bomb squad]] and later joined the FBI and the BAU. He has an emotionally intimate, but [[Platonic love|platonic]], relationship with technical analyst Penelope Garcia; the two have a unique shorthand and banter. In the season 7 premiere ("It Takes a Village"), Derek shows utter hatred toward Ian Doyle (Timothy V. Murphy) for killing SSA Emily Prentiss, but when Emily returns alive, he has mixed feelings. In season 11, Derek is kidnapped and tortured by the father of Giuseppe Montolo, a hitman whom Derek put away and who later died while in custody. Derek escapes and when he learns his girlfriend Savannah is pregnant, he realizes that he doesn't want to put his family through something like this again. Derek leaves the BAU in the episode "A Beautiful Disaster" to care for his now-wife and newborn son.
* [[Spencer Reid]], [[Ph.D.]], ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|supervisory special agent]] (seasons 1–present)
: Reid is a genius who graduated from [[Las Vegas High School]] at age 12 and holds Ph.D.s in [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], and [[engineering]] as well as [[bachelor of arts]] degrees in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] and, as of season 4, is working on a B.A. in [[philosophy]]. It has been revealed that he has an [[IQ]] of 187, can read a dizzying 20,000 words per minute, and has an [[eidetic memory]]. Most of the members on the team are intimidated by his profound knowledge. He is habitually introduced as "Dr. Spencer Reid" in contrast to the other agents, who are introduced as "supervisory special agent." The purpose of this, as explained by Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner in the pilot episode ("[[Extreme Aggressor (Criminal Minds Episode)|Extreme Aggressor]]"), is to create a respectable first impression of Spencer, deflecting judgments about his age. His mother, Diana Reid ([[Jane Lynch]]), suffers from [[schizophrenia]] and is currently committed to a mental institution. In season 6 Reid starts suffering from cluster headaches and when doctors can't diagnose why, Reid thinks he might be in the early stages of schizophrenia himself. Reid takes SSA Emily Prentiss' death very hard and, when it was revealed the death was faked, was distrustful of both Prentiss and SSA Jennifer Jareau (who helped in the cover-up). During season 8, Reid becomes involved with a woman who was being stalked. In the episode "Zugzwang", her stalker ultimately kidnaps her and kills her, devastating Reid. In season 11 he is deeply affected by Derek Morgan's decision to leave the BAU but understands and supports his reasons. Initially Reid had a crush on JJ, even going as far as taking her on a date to a football game. As the series progresses, their relationship becomes more of the brother–sister kind. Morgan and Reid maintained a brotherly relationship and Morgan refers to Reid as his "little brother" prior to his departure in season 11. Spencer is also the godfather of Jennifer's son, Henry, and Derek's son, Hank.
* [[Jennifer Jareau|Jennifer "JJ" Jareau]] ([[A. J. Cook]]), former BAU communications liaison and current supervisory special agent (seasons 1–5, 7–present; recurring season 6)
: JJ served as the communications liaison on the team to local police agencies in seasons 1–5. She dates and marries William LaMontagne ([[Josh Stewart]]), a [[New Orleans Police Department]] [[detective]]. They have two sons, Henry LaMontagne (Mekhai Andersen) and Michael LaMontagne (Phoenix Sky Andersen). Both boys are played by A.J. Cook's real-life sons. In the episode "JJ" (season 6), Jennifer is forced to accept a promotion at [[the Pentagon]], causing her departure from the team, although Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner expresses his hope that she will return to the BAU in the future. Jennifer returns in the episode "Lauren" (season 6) to assist the team in finding SSA Emily Prentiss ([[Paget Brewster]]). Jennifer returns as a series regular in the season 7 premiere as a legitimate profiler and admits to helping fake Prentiss' death, much to dismay of her colleagues. In the [[200 (Criminal Minds)|200th]] episode, JJ is kidnapped because of a secret mission she performed while at the Pentagon. At the end of season 10, JJ reveals she is pregnant with her second child and consults over the phone for the few episodes of season 11 before rejoining the team in the field in the episode "Target Rich." 
* [[Penelope Garcia]] ([[Kirsten Vangsness]]), BAU technical analyst and BAU communications liaison (seasons 2–present; recurring season 1). Garcia joined the BAU after bringing attention to herself by illegally accessing some of their equipment; she is offered a job in lieu of a jail sentence. She submitted her resume to Hotch on pink stationery. She usually supports the team from her computer lab at Quantico but occasionally joins them on location when her skills can be used in the field. She is a leader in a support group for those who have lost someone in their lives. Her parents were killed by a drunk driver when they were out looking for her when she was a teen and had missed her curfew. She enjoys a flirtatious relationship with SSA Derek Morgan, often engaging in comical banter of a sexually suggestive nature when he calls in for information. He calls her "Baby Girl." She was once shot and almost killed by Jason Clark Battle, who lured her on a date in the episode "Lucky" (season 3). When SSA Jennifer Jareau leaves the BAU, Penelope and Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner take over her job as communications liaison. She is kidnapped once again at the end of season 13. SSA Sam Cooper (''[[Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior]]'') often calls when his team needs her computer skills. Penelope is the godmother of Jennifer's son, Henry, and the godmother of Morgan's son, Hank.
* [[Emily Prentiss]] ([[Paget Brewster]]), supervisory special agent and BAU Unit Chief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starrymag.com/kirsten-vangness-diani-devine-meet-the-apocalypse/ |title=Kirsten Vangsness – Diani &amp; Devine Meet The Apocalypse|work=Starry Mag|last=Steinberg|first=Lisa|date=September 14, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (seasons 2–7, 12–present; guest seasons 9, 11)
: Prentiss is the daughter of Ambassador Elizabeth Prentiss ([[Kate Jackson]]). After SSA Elle Greenaway leaves the BAU, Section Chief Erin Strauss approves Emily to join the BAU. The plan was for Emily to report any problems within the BAU, but Emily remained loyal to the team and refused to report any problems, going so far as threatening resignation. Emily is also fluent in several languages, such as Spanish, French, Greek, and Arabic, has a working knowledge in Italian, and was fluent in Russian at one point but has lost comprehension. She is apparently killed while being held hostage by Ian Doyle in the episode "Lauren" (season 6), but in the last scene of the episode, it is revealed that she survived her encounter with Ian and is seen with SSA Jennifer Jareau in Paris passing her passports and bank accounts for protection. In the season 7 premiere ("It Takes a Village"), she returns alive and well, much to the team's surprise. In the season 7 finale ("Run"), Emily decides to leave the BAU after accepting a position running and returning to the [[Interpol]] office in [[London]]. She returns for the [[200 (Criminal Minds)|200th]] episode to help rescue a kidnapped SSA Jennifer Jareau and again in the episode "Tribute" (season 11), where she enlists the help of the BAU in catching a serial killer who had originally killed in Europe before killing in the United States. Paget Brewster was confirmed to return for a several episode arc in season 12. Following the dismissal of Thomas Gibson, Brewster was promoted to a series regular again starting from season 12, episode 3; later Prentiss is promoted to Hotch's position of unit chief.
* [[David Rossi]] ([[Joe Mantegna]]), senior supervisory special agent (seasons 3–present)
: Rossi is a highly experienced profiler who once worked the BAU in its origins, then took early retirement in 1997 to write books and go on lecture tours about criminal analysis, until volunteering to return shortly after SSA Jason Gideon's departure in 2007. He has been married three times and is quite wealthy because of his successful writing career. In the episode "From Childhood's Hour" (season 7), David reconnects with his first wife, Carolyn Baker, who has shocking news for him. It is revealed that she came to him because she was diagnosed with ALS ([[Lou Gehrig's disease]]) and wants David to assist in her suicide. In the next episode ("Epilogue"), Carolyn dies after taking a drug overdose. It is also revealed in this episode that David had a son who died at birth. In the season 8 episode "The Fallen", it is revealed that David was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] in Vietnam. The season 7 finale ("Hit") reveals SSA David Rossi may be having a secret relationship with Section Chief Erin Strauss; this was discovered when technical analyst Penelope Garcia and SSA Dr. Spencer Reid spot them both leaving a hotel. In the last season 8 episode ("The Replicator") we see their relationship has been known to the entire team. The episode is an emotional one for SSA David Rossi since Unit Chief Erin Strauss is murdered by The Replicator. She was taken from her hotel room, where he had planned to meet her that night, drugged and put on the streets of New York disoriented for Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner to find her. The episode's last scene is SSA David Rossi eulogizing her to the team after her funeral, at a gathering at his home. In season 10 we learn that David has a daughter by his second wife. Since then, he is shown to have a strong relationship with his daughter, son-in-law, and grandson, even approving of her husband's Italian heritage. In season 11 Rossi reunites with his second wife, and they give their relationship a second chance.
* [[Ashley Seaver]]  ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]), FBI cadet and special agent (season 6)
: Seaver replaces SSA Jennifer Jareau after she is forced to accept a promotion at the Pentagon. She was chosen for her unique background; her father, Charles Beauchamp, was a horrific serial killer known as the "Redmond Ripper", who murdered dozens of women before being caught by the BAU, incidentally. At first, Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner was going to make her a special one-time consultant to the BAU, but SSA David Rossi allowed her to finish her remedial training with the team, under the supervision of SSA Emily Prentiss. In the episode "... With Friends Like These" (season 6), she graduated from the Academy and had been added to the team as a "probationary agent." In the season 7 premiere ("It Takes a Village"), Jennifer reveals to Emily that Ashley transferred to the domestic trafficking task force, which is led by Andi Swann.
* [[Alex Blake (Criminal Minds)|Dr. Alex Blake]], [[Ph.D.]], ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]), FBI [[linguistics]] expert, supervisory special agent,  and professor at [[Georgetown University]] (seasons 8–9)
: Blake once worked for the BAU during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] but retired after a conflict with Chief [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Erin Strauss|Erin Strauss]] and rejoins the BAU after SSA Emily Prentiss transfers to the [[Interpol]] office in London. Alex first appears in the season 8 premiere ("The Silencer"). She makes a personal connection with Spencer Reid after he reveals to her that he has begun a romantic relationship with a woman whom he has never met. In the season 9 finale, after a difficult case in Texas in which the team is targeted by a group of corrupt sheriff deputies and Reid is shot, she escorts Reid to his apartment, explaining that the experience brought back memories of her son's death and that Reid reminds her of him. She leaves behind her credentials, which Reid finds in his bag before seeing Blake leave in a taxi, saddened but understanding. 
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Kate Callahan|Kate Callahan]]  ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]), Former FBI undercover agent and supervisory special agent (season 10)
: Callahan, as mentioned in the season 10 premiere, previously worked under Andi Swann's team, which is also Ashley Seaver's team since she left the BAU. She is a "seasoned undercover agent whose stellar work at the FBI has landed her a coveted position with the Behavioral Analysis Unit." She and her husband, Chris, have been the guardians of Kate's teenage niece, Meg, since Meg was a baby following her parents' deaths in the [[September 11, 2001]], attacks. Kate and Chris discover they are expecting a baby in the middle of season 10, coinciding with the actress's real-life pregnancy. At the end of season 10 she decides to take a year off and raise her baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harnick|first1=Chris|title=Jennifer Love Hewitt Joins Criminal Minds as Series Regular|url=http://au.eonline.com/news/556111/jennifer-love-hewitt-joins-criminal-minds-as-series-regular|work=[[E!#E!

* [[Tara Lewis (Criminal Minds)|Dr. Tara Lewis]] ([[Aisha Tyler]]), forensic psychologist and supervisory special agent (seasons 12–present; recurring season 11)
: Lewis is a psychologist with an eye on forensic psychology and its application toward the criminal-justice system. Her dream was to study psychopaths up close and personal—and her psychology background, combined with her experience in the FBI, brought her face to face with monsters. Her job was to stare them down and interview them, to determine if they were fit to stand trial. In the process, she made herself find the humanity inside these broken men (and, sometimes, women) in order to learn if there was a conscience behind their brutal crimes. Lewis replaced both JJ ([[A.J. Cook]]) and Kate ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) while they were on maternity leave in the 11th season.
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Luke Alvez|Luke Alvez]]  ([[Adam Rodriguez (actor)|Adam Rodriguez]]), fugitive task force agent and supervisory special agent (seasons 12–present)
: Alvez is a member of the FBI fugitive task force that partners with the BAU to catch the serial killers that escaped in the season 11 finale.&lt;ref name="Time Inc"/&gt; In the season 12 premiere, he works with the BAU to catch the "Crimson King", one of the escapees that attacked Alvez's old partner. The team discovers the real killer is "Mr. Scratch", who taunts the team by turning over the real "Crimson King", who was tortured to the point he no longer remembers who he was. After that, Alvez decides to join the BAU full time and was Hotch's last hire. Alvez has a dog, a Belgian Tervuren named Roxy (whom Garcia thought at first was his human girlfriend) and served in Iraq as an Army Ranger prior to joining the FBI.
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Stephen Walker|Stephen Walker]]  ([[Damon Gupton]]), supervisory special agent (season 12)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/criminal-minds-damon-gupton-exits-cbs-series-one-season-1202111448/|title='Criminal Minds': Damon Gupton Leaving CBS Series After One Season|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 11, 2017|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Walker is a supervisory special agent with the BAU. Walker was a member of the Behavioral Analysis Program. He was contacted by Emily Prentiss ([[Paget Brewster]]) about joining the BAU to assist in the manhunt for Peter Lewis, a k a "Mr. Scratch." Walker is an experienced profiler with about 20 years under his belt and a member of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Program before his transfer to the BAU. He is married to a woman named Monica and has two children with her, Maya and Eli. He met Emily Prentiss, then the chief of Interpol's London office, during his line of work. He was also mentored by David Rossi ([[Joe Mantegna]]). Stephen's first case concerned a terrorist cell in Belgium, and three agents were sent undercover to infiltrate it. However, Stephen's profile was wrong, and this resulted in the deaths of the undercover agents. He eventually moved on from the trauma and improved as he went along in his career. He and other BAP agents, including his longtime friend Sam Bower, were sent undercover to investigate corruption in the Russian government. Walker's skills include being fluent in Russian and playing the trombone. In the season 13 premiere, it is revealed he had died in the car crash Mr. Scratch had arranged as a trap for the team at the end of season 12.
* [[Matt Simmons (Criminal Minds)|Matt Simmons]] ([[Daniel Henney]]) (season 13-present; guest seasons 10, 12)  is a former member of the [[Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders|International Response Team]].&lt;ref name="danielhenneyCM" /&gt;
: Simmons is a special operations agent and formerly worked with the IRT. Simmons has a wife, Kristy, (Kelly Frye) and has a total of four children, including two boys (Jake and David) and twin daughters, all of them under the age of 3. He was a former member of a special ops unit, and his experience with the unit allowed him to hone his profiling skills.

===Recurring characters===
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Erin Strauss|Erin Strauss]] (portrayed by [[Jayne Atkinson]]; seasons 2–3, 5–9; 23 episodes), an assistant director and the BAU Unit Chief's direct superior. While her FBI experience was primarily in administration, SSA Derek Morgan remarked on her masterly marksmanship, after observing her at a firing range. In early episodes, Strauss appeared only concerned with herself and appearances within the Bureau, going so far as to force SSA Jennifer Jareau to accept a promotion to the Pentagon in the episode "JJ" (season 6). Further character development revealed her alcohol abuse. After being confronted by Morgan and Hotchner, Strauss accepts help and achieves sobriety. In the season 8 finale, [[List of Criminal Minds characters#John Curtis, "The Replicator"|the Replicator]] breaks into Strauss's hotel room in New York, drugs her, and forces her—at gunpoint—to drink alcohol from her room's minibar. Hotchner finds her on a bench near the hotel, where Strauss dies in his arms. Her death is avenged when Rossi traps the Replicator in an exploding house. Fittingly, Strauss's sobriety helps defeat the Replicator as Rossi uses her sobriety chip to escape the Replicator's trap and taunts him with it. After attending her funeral, the members of the BAU gather in a still-emotional Rossi's backyard, reminisce, and toast her memory. Showrunner [[Erica Messer]] chose to kill Strauss off because she felt that the character had come full circle since she was first introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eng|first=Joyce|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Criminal-Minds-Finale-Postmortem-Replicator-Revealed-Death-1065988.aspx|title=Criminal Minds Boss on The Replicator Reveal, the Finale Death and What's Next in Season 9|work=[[TV Guide]]|location=[[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], [[Pennsylvania]]|publisher=[[NTVB Media (magazine)|NTVB Media]] [[CBS Interactive]] ([[CBS Corporation]]) (digital assets)|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Haley Hotchner|Haley Hotchner]] (portrayed by [[Meredith Monroe]]; seasons 1–3, 5, 9; 14 episodes) is Agent Aaron Hotchner's wife and the mother of his only son, Jack Hotchner, born in late 2005. The couple's marriage was troubled, as clues were revealed in season 3 that she may have been having an affair and walked out on him. She later appeared with divorce papers, and he accepted reluctantly so as not to cause any trouble for his son with the divorce. In the episode "100" (season 5), Haley and Jack were captured by a killer known as "The Reaper"; though Jack was saved, Haley was shot and died before Aaron could save her. Aaron later beat The Reaper to death. In the episode "Route 66", Hotch collapses from internal bleeding and dreams about Haley. She tells him that he should stop blaming himself for her death and to make sure Jack knows that he can talk about his mother's death. Haley leaves Hotch by telling him that he and Beth have a good relationship and he shouldn't mess it up by not telling her how he feels.
* Jessica Brooks (portrayed by Molly Baker; seasons 1, 3, 5, 9–11), is Agent Aaron Hotchner's sister-in-law, Jack's aunt, and Haley's sister.
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Jordan Todd|Jordan Todd]] (portrayed by [[Meta Golding]]; season 4; 8 episodes) is SSA Jennifer Jareau's handpicked replacement to serve as the BAU's media director during Jennifer's maternity leave, from late 2008 through early 2009. Jordan had formerly served in the FBI counterterrorism division, but follows Jennifer for only day of shadowing before Jennifer goes into labor. Jordan seemed to get along well with most of the team, even flirting platonically with SSA [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]]. She is especially close with SSA David Rossi, who is seen to counsel her while they are on cases. However, Jordan has clashed several times with Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner. She eventually leaves when she decides she can't handle the stress that comes with her job.
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Diana Reid|Diana Reid]] (portrayed by [[Jane Lynch]]; seasons 1–2, 4, 12; 8 episodes) is the mother of BAU team member Dr. Spencer Reid. Like her son, she has a high IQ. She was once a university professor of literature, but suffers from schizophrenia and is hospitalized in a Las Vegas sanitarium, where Spencer committed her when he was 18. Her husband, William Reid, left prior to her diagnosis, because of his inability to cope with her illness, and he could not deal with protecting her after she witnessed a murder. She is functional when on her medication, but frequently lapses into regression to her university career. Diana spent much time reading aloud to Spencer while he was growing up, and he continues to write her a letter every day. She is proud of her son but disapproves of the FBI, as it is a government-run organization; she refers to his colleagues as "fascists." She seems to be showing signs of improvement in later episodes, when Reid states that she went on a supervised field trip to the Grand Canyon without feeling the need to notify Reid. However, she did not forget him, as Reid later receives a postcard and a gift from her.
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#William LaMontagne, Jr|William LaMontagne Jr.]] (portrayed by [[Josh Stewart]]; season 2–5, 7–9, 11–present) is SSA Jennifer Jareau's husband and the father of Jennifer's sons, Henry and Michael. Will and Jennifer met while she was working a case in his hometown. As of early season 4, Will had moved to Virginia and is a stay-at-home dad for Henry until he became a detective for the Metropolitan Police Department (Washington D.C.) as shown in the season 7 finale ("Run"). It is also stated that the couple had made a deal that in a life-threatening situation, they would do everything so that one of them could live to look after Henry. Jennifer accepted his marriage proposal and they were married officially; however, when their son was born, they exchanged rings with insets of Henry's birthstone, citrine. He is seen briefly in the 100th episode getting medicine for Henry with Jennifer, as well as the episode "The Slave of Duty" (season 5), accompanying Jennifer and the team at Haley Hotchner's funeral. In the season 7 finale, Will works alongside JJ to stop the bank robbers and is eventually taken hostage. Afterward, they agree to get married and unknowingly attend a surprise wedding ceremony thrown by Rossi and Will. 
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Kevin Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] (portrayed by [[Nicholas Brendon]]; season 3–10) first appears in the episode "Penelope" (season 3), in which he is required to search Penelope Garcia's computer to learn who shot her. Kevin sends the team live video alerting that the unsub (unknown subject) is in the BAU headquarters. He is intensely impressed by Penelope's computer skills, and the feeling is mutual. At the end of the episode, Penelope is introduced to Kevin, and the two become romantically involved. In the episode "I Love You, Tommy Brown" (season 7), Kevin proposes to Penelope, but she turns him down, saying that "things are going too fast", and ultimately the couple break up.
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Mateo Cruz|Mateo Cruz]] (portrayed by [[Esai Morales]]; season 9–10) takes over from the late Erin Strauss as the new BAU section chief in season 9. He has a past working relationship with JJ. It was revealed in "[[200 (Criminal Minds)|200]]" that the two had worked on a task force together in the Middle East. He was the only person to know of her pregnancy and miscarriage during her time on the task force. In the same episode, they are both kidnapped by Tivon Askari ([[Faran Tahir]]), who was a traitor within the task force. They are both physically and mentally tortured into giving the access codes given to them during the mission. He is shocked to discover that Michael Hastings ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), one of the men with whom they had worked on the task force, was the mastermind behind the plan and threatened to rape JJ to give him the access codes. He gives in and is later stabbed by Askari, who is quickly killed by Hotch. Cruz is taken to the hospital following the incident and is believed to be alive.&lt;ref name="chief"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/criminal-minds-exclusive-esai-morales-1068277/|title=Exclusive: Esai Morales Joins Criminal Minds as New Section Chief|work=[[TV Guide]]|location=[[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], [[Pennsylvania]]|publisher=[[NTVB Media (magazine)|NTVB Media]] [[CBS Interactive]] ([[CBS Corporation]]) (digital assets)|last=Eng|first=Joyce|date=July 25, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several episodes later, he reappears in the season 9 finale, "Angels" and "Demons", when he asks the team to investigate a case brought to him by his friend Peter Coleman, the sheriff of Briscoe County, Texas. They first arrive to investigate a series of murders involving prostitutes, but as they investigate, the team soon finds that they are caught in a ring of corrupt deputies—ironically the only officer not involved being Sheriff Coleman—and find their lives in danger. After a fatal shootout with the corrupt, drug-peddling Preacher Mills ([[Brett Cullen]]), Sheriff Coleman is killed, Morgan is wounded, and Reid is critically wounded and hospitalized as a result. Distraught by this turn of events, Cruz travels to Texas with Garcia to help the team investigate and apprehend the ring leader, Deputy Owen McGregor ([[Michael Trucco]]). He is not seen again until late in season 10 (episode 19, "Beyond Borders") when he needs the BAU to help the FBI's international team, led by [[Jack Garrett (Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders)|Jack Garrett]] ([[Gary Sinise]]), to catch an unsub who has kidnapped a family while on vacation in Barbados. The case is especially critical because this unsub has eluded both the domestic and international BAU teams by killing a family in Aruba, then in Florida one year later. This episode was the backdoor pilot for the upcoming spinoff, titled ''Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders''.&lt;ref name="beyondborders1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beyondborders2" /&gt;
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Dr. Savannah Morgan|Dr. Savannah Hayes]] (portrayed by [[Rochelle Aytes]]; season 9–11; 10 episodes) Savannah Morgan (née Hayes) is [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]]'s wife. She works as a doctor at Bethesda General Hospital. Savannah first appeared in Season 9's "The Return", and it is presumed Morgan and Savannah started dating prior to Season 9, and first met after she approached him when he was depressed over a case that ended badly. Before they started dating they used to be neighbors. She was introduced to the show because [[Shemar Moore]], the actor who portrays Morgan, had requested that his character should get a romantic partner.
* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Joy Struthers|Joy Struthers]] (portrayed by [[Amber Stevens]]; season 10–11) is Rossi's daughter from his short-lived second marriage to French diplomat Hayden Montgomery. When they divorced, Hayden didn't tell him she was pregnant, and Joy thought her father was her mother's second husband, who finally told her the truth before dying from cancer. In the episode "Fate" (10x09), Joy seeks Rossi out and they're getting to know each other. Joy is a reporter and true-crime writer and is married. She has a 2-year-old son called Kai.

Dorothy Rabinowitz said, in her review for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', "From the evidence of the first few episodes, ''Criminal Minds'' may be a hit, and deservedly" and gave particular praise to Gubler and Patinkin's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112864294888262284|title=Circle of Genius|first=Dorothy|last=Rabinowitz|date=October 7, 2005|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ned Martel in ''[[The New York Times]]'' was less positive, saying, "The problem with "Criminal Minds" is its many confusing maladies, applied to too many characters."

{{main|Criminal Minds (South Korean TV series)}}

In 2017, tvN launched their own Korean version of ''[[Criminal Minds (South Korean TV series)|Criminal Minds]]''. The episodes are based on the original American version after its third season. On the cast is [[Lee Joon-gi]] as Kim Hyun-joon ([[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]]), [[Moon Chae Won]] as Ha Sun-woo ([[Emily Prentiss]]), [[Son Hyun-joo]] as Kang Ki-hyung ([[Aaron Hotchner]]), [[Yoo Sun]] as Nana Hwang ([[Penelope Garcia]]), [[Lee Sun-bin (actress)|Lee Sun-bin]] as Yoo Min-young ([[Jennifer Jareau]]), and [[Go Yoon]] as Lee Han ([[Spencer Reid]]).
The episodes are 1 hour long.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Video game===
CBS announced in October 2009 that [[Legacy Interactive]] would develop [[Criminal Minds (video game)|a video game]] based on the show. The game would require players to examine crime scenes for clues to help solve murder mysteries. The interactive puzzle game was released in 2012, but the show's cast was not involved with the project so it did not feature any of their voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Criminal Minds Game Blog |url=http://www.criminalmindsgame.com |date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="products"&gt;{{cite press release |title=CBS Consumer Products Announces Eight New Video Games Based on Popular TV Shows |url=http://games.ign.com/articles/104/1041583p1.html |date=October 29, 2009 |publisher=CBS Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shavemagazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/Interview-Thomas-Gibson |title=Interview: Thomas Gibson |publisher= ShaveMagazine.com |accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cutaway''', in the industrial sense, refers to the display of a manufactured product, (an [[engine]], a [[pump]], a [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulator]], etc. . .) where a portion of the exterior housing has been removed to reveal the internal components, ([[piston]]s, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[seal (mechanical)|seal]]s, etc. . .) and their relationship to the functionality of the product.

Cutaways are typically used in product training, trade show environments, museum displays and for many additional applications. Cutaways are produced using a variety of methods by the manufacturer, by a cutaway service company, as mentioned above, or by an experienced machine shop. 

While [[3D modeling]] and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] (Computer Aided Drafting) programs continue to improve and bring us more features and benefits, the cutaway will continue to show the product as it appears in the real world, using actual parts and components to show relationships and functionality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10831">A '''digital textbook''' is a digital book or [[e-book]] intended to serve as the text for a class. Digital textbooks may also be known as '''e-textbooks''' or '''e-texts'''. Digital textbooks are a major component of technology-based education reform. They may serve as the texts for a traditional face-to-face class, an online course or degree, or [[Massive open online courses|massive open online courses (MOOCs)]].

==Implementation==
There are many potential advantages to digital textbooks. They may offer lower costs, make it easier to monitor student progress, and are easier and cheaper to update when needed. [[Open-source model|Open source]] e-textbooks may offer the opportunity to create free, modifiable textbooks for basic subjects, or give individual teachers the opportunity to create e-texts for their own classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Creno|first=Cathryn|title=Online e-books replace heavy school textbooks|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa/2014/03/17/math-science-textbooks-mobile/6512627/|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=AZ Central|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may offer better access to quality texts in the developing world. For this reason, many schools and colleges around the world have made the implementation of digital textbooks a central component of education policy. For example, in South Korea, reading materials in all public schools will be digitized by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haq|first=Husna|title=In South Korea, all textbooks will be e-books by 2015|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0706/In-South-Korea-all-textbooks-will-be-e-books-by-2015|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] aims for every student to be able to access e-texts by 2017.&lt;ref name=policy&gt;{{cite news|last=Toppo|first=Greg|title=Obama wants schools to speed digital transition|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-01-31/schools-e-textbooks/52907492/1|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the transition to e-textbooks is costly, complex and controversial. Students express a strong preference for printed materials in many surveys and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Sara|title=Students prefer print for serious academic reading|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-prefer-print-but-not-books-for-serious-academic-reading/44871|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|title=For many students, print is still king|url=http://chronicle.com/article/For-Many-Students-Print-Is/136829/|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many interconnected factors, from device access, to [[digital literacy]], to teaching methods affect the implementation of digital textbooks in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heussner|first=Ki Mae|title=In digital textbook transition, device availability is just the beginning|url=http://gigaom.com/2012/10/22/in-digital-textbook-transition-device-availability-is-just-the-beginning/|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=Gigaom|date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of overall value, book quality, privacy, and intellectual property have yet to be resolved.

==Devices==
Because digital textbooks must be accessed through an electronic device, such as a laptop or e-reader, schools and colleges must determine how to provide access to all students. Many school districts are now offering "[[One to one computing|one-to-one]]" technology programs, in which a tablet or laptop is issued to each student. This ensures that all of the devices meet the same requirements (such as memory or software) and that all the devices can be networked, monitored and upgraded together. However, the one-to-one model also imposes significant costs on school districts, and brings up issues of privacy and personal use.

An alternative to one-to-one is to ask students to use their own electronic devices in class. This is called [[Bring Your Own Device]] (BYOD) or, sometimes, Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT). BYOD allows students to choose their preferred device for studying. Compared to one-to-one, it decreases the technology and maintenance costs for institutions. But not all students' devices may be compatible with the digital textbooks require for a class, and the devices may not be able to network with each other. A BYOD approach may also count out students who cannot afford a computer, e-reader or smartphone.

==Interactivity==
A major selling point of digital textbooks is that they offer the opportunity for students to access multimedia content, such as embedded videos, interactive presentations and hyperlinks. Tests and other assessments can be included in the textbook, classmates can work together, and student progress can be tracked. Touchscreen technology offers students the chance to participate in projects, research or experiments. This may offer a different or better learning experience than printed textbooks. Digitization also promises to offer improved access to textbooks for student with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Courduff|first=Susan|title=Digital textbooks and students with special needs|url=http://teachinghistory.org/issues-and-research/roundtable-response/25092|work=TeachingHistory.org roundtable: digital textbooks: has their time come?|publisher=TeachingHistory.org|accessdate=23 March 2014|date=2011|quote="The inclusive nature of digital textbooks has the potential to powerfully meet the diverse learning needs of students who are exceptional."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, high-contrast displays, or text-to-speech programs can help visually impaired students use the same textbooks their classmates use. The creation of interactive and customizable content is an important part of digital textbook development. Interactive digital content is costly to produce, however, and research on learning outcomes is still in the preliminary stages.

==Open vs. closed==
The concepts of [[open access]] and [[Open-source model|open source]] support the idea of [[open textbooks]], digital textbooks that are free (gratis) and easy to distribute, modify and update (libre). Schools, teachers or professors may design their own open textbooks by gathering open access scholarly articles or other open access resources into one text or one curriculum. Open textbooks offer affordable access, especially to basic and common information, and pose a challenge to traditional models of textbook publishing. Modifiable or community edited textbooks may also be difficult to establish as credible or scholarly sources.

Other models for digital textbook publishing are more traditional. Textbook publishers may offer digital textbooks or digital curriculums that are standardized across classrooms, easier to update, and compliant with national standards, teaching methods or goals. This approach also offers pitfalls. License or renewal fees for digital textbooks may impose unexpected costs for institutions. For example, in 2013, the [[LA Unified School District]] announced that it would face an additional $60 million to license the curriculum for its one-to-one iPad program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blume|first=Howard|title=iPad software licenses expire in three years, L.A. Unified says|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-1120-lausd-ipads-20131120,0,429771.story#axzz2lIQOiTmA|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Though many governments and school districts are making large investments in digital textbooks, adoption is slow. According to data from Bowker Market Research, in the spring semester of 2013, only 3% of college students used a digital textbook as their primary course material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenfield|first=Jeremy|title=Students, [rofessors still not yet ready for digital textbooks|url=http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/students-professors-still-not-yet-ready-for-digital-textbooks/|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Digital Book World|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multiple studies, strong majorities of college students, teens, and children continue to express a preference for printed books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The reasons young people aren't buying ebooks|url=http://www.booktrade.info/index.php/showarticle/52878/|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Booktrade.info|date=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNeish |first=Joanne |author2=Mary Foster |author3=Anthony Francescucci |author4=Bettina West |title=The surprising foil to online education: why students won't give up paper textbooks |journal=Journal for the Advancement of Marketing Education |date=Fall 2012 |volume=20 |issue=3 |url=http://www.mmaglobal.org/JAME-Archive/JAME_Vol20_3/The%20Surprising%20Foil%20to%20Online%20Education%20Why%20Students%20won%27t%20give%20up%20Paper%20Textbooks.pdf |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228093059/http://www.mmaglobal.org/JAME-Archive/JAME_Vol20_3/The%20Surprising%20Foil%20to%20Online%20Education%20Why%20Students%20won%27t%20give%20up%20Paper%20Textbooks.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, there is conflicting information about how digital textbooks affect learning, cognition and retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|title=The reading brain in the digital age: the science of paper vs. screens|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Scientific American|date=11 April 2013|quote="Research suggests that reading on paper still boasts unique advantages."}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, students are growing more exposed to digital textbooks, and new research suggests that student performance is about the same whether students work from digital or printed texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student response to digital textbooks climbs, says new BISG research|url=http://www.bowker.com/en-US/aboutus/press_room/2013/pr_01252013.shtml|publisher=Bowker Market Research|accessdate=23 March 2014|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sicking|first=Jennifer|title=Research shows students perform well regardless of reading print or digital books|url=http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=3564|accessdate=18 March 2014|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EEWH''' is the [[green building]] certification system in [[Taiwan]]. EEWH comprises nine indicators that fall into four categories - [[ecology]], energy saving, waste reduction and health - hence the name EEWH. The system was launched in 1999.

Since 2003, the indicators have been foliage; water soil content (infiltration and retention); energy savings (for the [[building envelope]], lighting and [[HVAC]]); {{CO2}} emissions reduction; construction waste reduction; [[water conservation]]; garbage and sewage improvements; [[biodiversity]]; and indoor environmental quality.

EEWH has five levels: certified, bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. As of May 2008, one building ([[Beitou Public Library]]) had been rated diamond level, and one gold.

EEWH is not equivalent to LEED ([[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Green Building Rating System) in the [[United States]], [[CASBEE]] (Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency) in [[Japan]], and [[HQE]] in France.

'''eLearning Africa''' is a three-day annual international conference on [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]-enhanced [[education]], training and skills development in [[Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scidev.net/global/content/events_notice.5F3D9436-1307-401C-A34E41F3211EF322.html |title=eLearning Africa 2016 - 11th International Conference on ICT for Development, Education and Training |website=Scidev.net |date= |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which is organised by ICWE GmbH. Each year the event is hosted and co-organised by a different African government. It has been opened on previous occasions by Presidents, Vice Presidents and Prime Ministers of several African countries including [[Hage Geingob]], [[Abdoulaye Wade]], [[George Kunda]], [[Edward Ssekandi]], [[Pascal Koupaki]], [[Mohamed Gharib Bilal]] and [[Debretsion Gebremichael]]. This pan-African conference focuses on the use of ICT to support education, training, skills and knowledge sharing across all sectors of Africa, enhancing sustainable development goals across the continent and enabling participants to develop multinational and cross-industry contacts and partnerships, as well as to build up their expertise and abilities.  
[[File:Plenary (5).jpg|thumb|The audience enjoying the eLearning Africa 2014 Debate in Kampala, Uganda.]]
The conference series was inaugurated at the [[United Nations Conference Centre (Addis Ababa)|United Nations Conference Centre]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/nl/events-and-projects/events/elearning-africa |title=eLearning Africa &amp;#124; Cedefop |language=nl |website=Cedefop.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has since visited [[Kenya]], [[Ghana]], [[Senegal]], [[Zambia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Benin]], [[Namibia]], [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Mauritius]]. Some of the Keynote speakers at the 2016 conference included [[Ismail Serageldin]], [[Thierry Zomahoun]], [[Günter Nooke]], [[Toyosi Akerele-Ogunsiji]] and [[Toby Shapshak]]. '''eLearning Africa 2018''' will be held from 26 - 28 September at the Kigali Convention Centre located in Kigali, [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elearning-africa.com/conference_venue.php|title=eLearning Africa|website=www.elearning-africa.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
Delegates are decision-makers from the education, [[business]] and [[government]] sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Natricia Duncan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/26/elearning-africa-education-conference |title=Believe the hype: e-learning can revolutionise education in Africa &amp;#124; Global Development Professionals Network |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; eLearning Africa brings together experts and practitioners, as well as suppliers of education and training solutions.

Over 12 consecutive years, eLearning Africa has hosted 16,228 participants from more than 100 countries, with over '''85% coming from the African continent''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/events/elearning-africa-2015-10th-international-conference-ict-development-education-and-training|title=eLearning Africa 2015 - 10th International Conference on ICT for Development, Education and Training|date=|website=Educause.edu|accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 12 different locations (Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, Zambia, Tanzania, Benin, Namibia, Uganda, Ethiopia for the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary, Egypt, Mauritius and now Rwanda). More than 3,300 speakers have addressed the conference about every aspect of technology enhanced education and skills development. 

With a population of one billion people, 41 percent of which are under the age of 15&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/continents/africa-population/|title=Africa Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the African continent is the hub for development in using '''ICT to expand access to learning and skills acquisition,''' and to improve the quality of learning and teaching. ICT supported learning has a '''widespread impact across education, training and professional development''', with governments and ministries throughout the continent investing resources in support of IT development in schools and skills training.

'''Emily Warren Roebling''' (September 23, 1843 – February 28, 1903) is known for her contribution to the completion of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] after her husband [[Washington Roebling]] developed [[Decompression sickness|caisson disease]] (a.k.a. decompression disease). Her husband was a [[civil engineer]] and the chief engineer during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.

==Early life==
Emily was born to Sylvanus and Phebe Warren at [[Cold Spring, New York]], on September 23, 1843. She was the second youngest of twelve children.&lt;ref&gt;Roebling, Emily Warren: "Notes on the Warren Family" in the Appendix, Page 446, "The Journal of the Reverend Silas Comfort", Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Emily’s interest in pursuing education was supported by her older brother [[Gouverneur K. Warren]].  The two siblings always held a close relationship.&lt;ref name="Weingardt, Richard page 56"&gt;Weingardt, Richard: "Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers", page 56. ASCE Publications, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; She attended school at the Georgetown Visitation Academy in Washington DC.

In 1864, during the [[American Civil War]], Emily visited her brother, who was commanding the Fifth Army Corps (a.k.a. [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]]), at his headquarters.  At a solider's ball that she attended during the visit, she became acquainted with [[Washington Roebling]], the son of Brooklyn Bridge designer [[John A. Roebling]], who was a civil engineer serving on Gouverneur Warren's staff.&lt;ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 80"&gt;Petrash, Antonia: "More than Petticoats:  Remarkable New York Women", page 80. Globe Pequot, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Emily and Washington married in a dual wedding ceremony (alongside another Warren sibling) in Cold Spring on January 18, 1865.&lt;ref name="Logan, Mary page 297"&gt;Logan, Mary: "The Part Taken by Women in American History", page 297. The Perry-Nalle Publishing Co., 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

As John Roebling was starting his preliminary work on the Brooklyn Bridge, the newlyweds went to Europe to study the use of [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] for the bridge.&lt;ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 80"/&gt;  In November 1867, Emily gave birth to the couple's only child, [[John A. Roebling II]], while living in Germany.&lt;ref name="Logan, Mary page 297"/&gt;

==Brooklyn Bridge==
On their return from their European studies, Washington's father died of [[tetanus]] following an accident at the bridge site, and Washington took charge of the Brooklyn Bridge's construction as chief engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Petrash, Antonia: ''More than Petticoats: Remarkable New York Women'', page 82. Globe Pequot, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As he immersed himself in the project, Washington developed [[decompression sickness]], which was known at the time as "caisson disease".&lt;ref&gt;Petrash, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dcs&gt;{{cite journal |author=Butler WP |title=Caisson disease during the construction of the Eads and Brooklyn Bridges: A review |journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=445–59 |year=2004 |pmid=15686275 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4028 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asce.org/templates/person-bio-detail.aspx?id=11203|title=Emily Warren Roebling {{!}} ASCE|website=www.asce.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affected him so badly that he became bed-ridden. Emily stepped in as the "first woman field engineer" and saw out the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge.&lt;ref name="Logan, Mary page 297" /&gt;

As the only person to visit her husband during his sickness, Emily was to relay information from Washington to his assistants and report the progress of work on the bridge. She developed an extensive knowledge of [[strength of materials]], [[stress analysis]], [[wire rope|cable construction]], and calculating [[catenary]] curves through Washington's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Weingardt, Richard: ''Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers'', page 58. ASCE Publications, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Emily's knowledge was complemented by her prior interest in and study of the bridge's construction upon her husband's appointment to chief engineer. For the decade after Washington took to his sick bed, Emily's dedication to the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge was unyielding. She took over much of the chief engineer duties, including day-to-day supervision and project management. Emily and her husband jointly planned the bridge's continued construction. She dealt with politicians, competing engineers, and all those associated with the work on the bridge to the point where people believed she was behind the bridge's design.&lt;ref name="Logan, Mary page 297" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/Emily-Warren-Roebling/543608|title=Britannica Academic|website=academic.eb.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, Washington's title of chief engineer was in jeopardy because of his sickness. In order to allow him to retain his title, Emily went to gatherings of engineers and politicians to defend her husband. To the Roeblings' relief, the politicians responded well to Emily's speeches, and Washington was permitted to remain chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge.

The Brooklyn Bridge was completed in 1883. In advance of the official opening, carrying a rooster as a sign of victory, Emily Roebling was the first to cross the bridge by carriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[David McCullough]] |title=[[Brave Companions: Portraits in History]]| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992 |page=116 |isbn=0-671-79276-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the opening ceremony, Emily was honored in a speech by [[Abram Stevens Hewitt]], who said that the bridge was
{{quote|...an everlasting monument to the sacrificing devotion of a woman and of her capacity for that higher education from which she has been too long disbarred.&lt;ref name=ASCE&gt;{{cite web |title=ASCE Historic Civil Engineers: Emily Warren Roebling |url= 
http://www.asce.org/templates/person-bio-detail.aspx?id=11203 |publisher=asce.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later life==
Upon completion of her work on the Brooklyn Bridge, Emily invested her time in several women's causes including Committee on Statistics of the New Jersey [[Board of Lady Managers]] for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], Committee of Sorosis, [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], [[George Washington Memorial Association]], and [[Evelyn College for Women|Evelyn College]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-91932.html|title=American National Biography Online: Roebling, Emily Warren|website=www.anb.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred when the Roebling family moved to [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. Emily also participated in social organizations such as the [[Relief Society]] during the [[Spanish–American War]]. She traveled widely—in 1896 she was presented to [[Queen Victoria]], and she was in Russia for the coronation of [[Tsar Nicholas II]].&lt;ref name=ASCE /&gt; She also continued her education and received a law certificate from [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 88"&gt;Petrash, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Roebling is also known for an influential essay she authored, "A Wife's Disabilities," which won wide acclaim and awards. In the essay, she argued for greater women's rights and railed against discriminatory practices targeted at women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Until her death on February 28, 1903, she spent her remaining time with her family and kept socially and mentally active.&lt;ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 88" /&gt;

==Tributes==
Today the Brooklyn Bridge is marked with a plaque dedicated to the memory of Emily, her husband Washington Roebling, and her father-in-law John A. Roebling.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=68007 Historical Marker Database] Photo of Emily Warren Roebling plaque&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Petrash, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a belated obituary for Emily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-emily-warren-roebling.html|title=Emily Warren Roebling, the Woman Behind the Man Who Built the Brooklyn Bridge|first=Jessica|last=Bennett|date=8 March 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Gates Foundation]] awarded $100,000 to Hiroyuki Matsuoka of [[Jichi Medical University]] in [[Japan]] to do research on them, with a condition that any discoveries that were funded by the grant must be made available at affordable prices in the [[developing world]]. If Matsuoka proves that his idea has merit, he will be eligible for an additional $1 million of funding. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' referred to flying syringes as a "bold idea".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203083.html Flying Syringes and Other Bold Ideas], ''The Washington Post'', October 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FOBA AG''' is a Swiss company that makes [[photographic studio]] equipment.

==History==
[[File:Foba CEONO.jpg|thumb|left|FOBA movable light holder on a pipe]]
In 1939, just after [[World War II]] started in Europe, imports of [[photography]] products such as lights and [[dry press]]es from [[Nazi germany|Germany]] was reduced to a trickle. Walter Friedrich, a precisions engineer, together with his wife, began to manufacture commodities for professional photographers in their rented home's small basement.  He called his startup '''''Fotogeräte- und Elektroapparate-Bau''''' ("Manufacturing of photographic and electrical equipment"), or ''FOBA''. To save on shipping costs and to keep up the personal contact to his customers, Friedrich at first delivered products personally by [[bicycle]].

The company also supplied [[cooking plate]]s with integrated [[heating coil]]s. This was a first in Switzerland.

'''Grace D. Banker''' (October 25, 1892 – September 17, 1960){{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=54}} was a telephone operator who served during [[World War I]] (1917–1918) as chief operator of mobile for the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) in the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]]. She led thirty-three women telephone operators known popularly as [[Hello Girls]]. They were assigned in New York to travel to France to operate telephone switch boards at the war front in [[Paris]], and at [[Chaumont, Haute-Marne]]. They also operated the telephone switch boards at [[First United States Army|First Army]] headquarters at [[Ligny-en-Barrois]], about {{Convert|5|mi}} to the south of [[Saint-Mihiel]], and later during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]. After her return to civilian life, Banker and her team members were treated as citizen volunteers and initially not given recognition as members of the military. In 1919, Banker was honoured with the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for her services with the First Army headquarters during the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel]] and [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]s, with a commendation.

==Life== 
[[File:HelloGirls.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hello Girls]] operating switchboards in Chaumont, France during [[World War I]].]]
Banker was born at [[Passaic, New Jersey]] on 25 October 1892. After graduating from [[Barnard College]] she joined [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T) where she worked as a switchboards instructor.{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=55}}{{Sfn|Zeiger|2004|p=37}} During World War I Banker was chosen to head a team of thirty-three telephone operators of Telephone Unit No. 1, for telephone operations, assigned to war duty in France. This was the first group of women who were given the popular name [[Hello Girls]].{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=54}}

Banker sailed with her team members from [[New Jersey]] on 6 March 1918, to take up the assignment as chief operator for First Army headquarters in Paris.{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=54}} After arriving with her team in England, the group set sail by ferry across the [[English Channel]]. However, bad  weather, in the form of thick fog, prevented the ferry from reaching French shores, and it had to be anchored a few miles away to wait for the fog to lift. This location made the vessel an easy target for German bombing (at that time, one vessel out of four had suffered bombing), and the team members remained at full readiness to evacuate the vessel at short notice. The women's group stayed on deck in the open for forty-eight continuous hours. This situation did not dishearten Banker or her team members, and, as Banker later said: "What good sports girls were in that First Unit! They took everything in their stride. They were the pioneers." {{Sfn|Zeinert|2001|p=45}}

On arrival in Paris, Banker and her team were posted to the headquarters of the Advance Section in [[Chaumont, Haute-Marne|Chaumont sur Haute Marne]], which was then the headquarters of General [[John J. Pershing]]. Five months later, Baker was asked to move to the war front, to the First Army headquarters at [[Ligny-en-Barrois]], south of [[Saint-Mihiel]]. On 25 August 1918, she moved to the war front with only five operators helping her.{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=55}} For this operation at Saint-Mihiel, Banker had to make a choice of the best operators for the job, she selected: Suzanne Prevot, Esther Fresnel, Helen Hill, Berthe Hunt, and Marie Lange. Equipped with [[gas mask]]s and helmets, the women operated from trenches where the danger was real; despite this, those not chosen to go felt left out.{{Sfn|Zeinert|2001|p=45}}

During offensive operations at Saint-Mihiel, though artillery bombing was in force, Banker and her team of operators manned the switchboards. When the First Army headquarters moved to [[Bar-le-Duc]] in September, Banker and her operators had to work in a place which was damaged extensively.{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=54}} They operated even under heavy bombing by German planes, but no team members were injured. They worked under severe weather conditions without heating, and their barracks leaked, and were later gutted, making conditions even harsher.{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=54}}

[[File:US_Army_Signal_Corps_Female_Telephone_operators.jpg|right|thumb|

Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], fighting ceased. Banker and her team were then ordered to return to Paris. In Paris, Banker was deputed initially to work at the temporary residence of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. As she did not find this job exciting compared to the work at the war front, she accepted an offer to move to the Army of Occupation at [[Coblenz]], Germany; while there she was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]]. {{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=55}}

After working for twenty months at the war front, in September 1919 Banker and the rest of her team returned home. General Edgar Russel, chief signal officer of the AEF, extolled their service as "indispensable". Reminiscing about her wartime experience as chief operator, Banker humorously noted that "an afternoon in the switchboard office sometimes sounded like a scene from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', where only the initiated can make sense of the proceedings".{{Sfn|Zeiger|2004|p=95}} She also noted the confidentiality aspect of her assignment when she was tested by an intelligence officer about her ability to keep a secret, which was about her posting out of the unit.{{Sfn|Zeiger|2004|p=102}} About her work at the war front she said that "the secrecy surrounding their operations gave it an aura of romance and set it apart from the civilian work".{{Sfn|Zeiger|2004|p=95}} After returning from the war front with her team, she reflected: "We missed the First Army with its code of loyalty and hard work. We were back in the petty squabbles of civilian life where even chief operators had 'tantrums' and where the wives of civilians attached to the Peace Conference spilled all over Paris in Army cars."{{Sfn|Zeiger|2004|p=102}}

After the war, when they returned to civilian life, Banker and her team members were treated as citizen volunteers and not recognized as members of the military. They were not given a "formal discharge or even a certificate of service". Banker died on 17 September 1960, in [[Scarsdale]], New York. In 1977 [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted legislation that gave due recognition to Banker and her team, and treated them as "veterans".{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=55}}

==Awards==
On 26 May 1919 with Government order no. 70,{{Sfn|Series|1996|p=209}}{{Sfn|Army|2012|p=674}} Banker was honoured with the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for her services with the First Army headquarters during the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel]] and [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]s, with the commendation which read: "For exceptional ability... [and] untiring devotion to her exacting duties under trying conditions....to assure the success of the telephone service during the operations of the [[First Army (France)|First Army]] against the Saint Michel salient and the exertions to the north of [[Verdun]]."{{Sfn|Sterling|2008|p=54}}

'''Groupe F''' is a production company specialised in the design and performance of live shows and pyrotechnic events. It operates on five continents.

== History ==
Founded in 1990 in [[Bessèges]] (Gard, F) by François Montel, Alain Burkhalter and Didier Mandin, Groupe F takes off internationally in 1992 with the arrival of Éric Noel, Nicolas Mousques, Caroline and Christophe Berthonneau, designing the pyrotechnic effects of the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Summer Olympics closing ceremony]]. In 1993, Groupe F goes on a world tour with its show "Oiseaux de Feu" (Birds of Fire), followed by "Un peu plus de Lumière" and also performs the closing fireworks of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].

On 31 December 1999, Groupe F stages the pyrotechnic show on the [[Eiffel Tower]] celebrating the transition to the year 2000. Building on the worldwide success of the event, the group recruits a multidisciplinary team for the artistic and technical implementation of its major projects. Jonas Bidaut, Cédric Moreau, Eric Travers and Jeff Yelnik have supported the international development of Groupe F ever since.

In 2000, Groupe F starts exploring new scenographic territories and creates tools for monumental shows, combining light, video mapping, music, fire and human performers. The [[Palace of Versailles]], the [[Pont du Gard]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]] host these new creations on several occasions.

In November 2017, the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] entrust the company with the opening show of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]].

'''Carrying on the head''' is a common practice in many parts of the world, as an alternative to carrying a burden on the back, shoulders and so on. People have carried burdens balanced on top of the head since ancient times, usually to do daily work, but sometimes in religious ceremonies or as a feat of skill, such as in certain dances.

==Origins==
The practice of carrying a burden on top of the head has existed since ancient times. Evidence of this is in the [[Book of Proverbs]], which makes a reference to it in verses 25:21-22, "If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=New International Version (1984) |title=Holy Bible |url=http://bible.cc/proverbs/25-22.htm |publisher=Biblos |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is using the metaphor of an ancient Egyptian ritual of repentance which involved carrying a basin of burning coals on top of the head. The verse in the Book of Proverbs is estimated to originate from the period of the third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snell |first=Daniel C. |title=Twice-Told Proverbs and the Composition of the Book of Proverbs |year=1993 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |isbn=9780931464669 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12400-proverbs-book-of |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an account by the ancient Egyptian writer [[Cha-em-wese]], a thief returned a book stolen from a grave carrying such a pan of hot coals on top of his head, to show "his consciousness and attitudes of shame, remorse, repentance, and ultimately correction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltke |first=Bruce K. |title=The Book of Proverbs: Chapters 15-31 |year=2005 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=9780802827760 |pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working==
[[File:Carrying loads on Mt Kilimanjaro.JPG|thumb|Porters for an expedition climbing [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], [[Tanzania]], carrying large loads on their heads along a wide path.]]
[[File:DakarHeadcarrying2.JPG|thumb|Headcarrying in Dakar (2016)]]
Carrying on the head is common in many parts of the developing world, as only a simple length of cloth shaped into a ring or ball is needed to carry loads approaching the person's own weight. The practice is efficient, in a place or at a time when there are no vehicles available for carrying burdens.

African-American women, such as Alaiya, continued the practice during the 19th century, which they learned from their elders who had been enslaved from Africa.  One observer during the American Civil War noted seeing the impressive sense of balance and dexterity that the practice gave women in South Carolina: "I have seen a woman, with a brimming water-pail balanced on her head, or perhaps a cup, saucer, and spoon, stop suddenly, turn round, stoop to pick up a missile, rise again, fling it, light a pipe, and go through many revolutions with either hand or both, without spilling a drop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Higginson |first=Thomas Wentworth |title=Army Life in a Black Regiment |year=1969 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=9781606208687 |pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the turn of the 20th century, African-American women in the Southern states continued carrying baskets and bundles of folded clothes on top of their heads, when they found work as [[washerwomen]], doing laundry for white employers. This practice ended when the automobile became common in affluent communities, and employers began delivering the clothing to the homes of the washwomen, rather than the washwomen walking to the employers' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Susan |title=Telling Memories Among Southern Women: Domestic Workers and Their Employers in the Segregated South |year=2002 |publisher=Louisiana State University |isbn=9780807127995 |pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, women and men may be seen carrying burdens on top of their heads where there is no less expensive, or more efficient, way of transporting workloads. In India, women carry baskets of bricks to workmen on construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bohm |first=Robert |title=Notes on India |year=1982 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=9780896081253 |pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used by the lowest caste to carry away [[human waste]] that they scoop out of [[pit latrine]]s, the practice of [[manual scavenging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nhrc.nic.in/Documents/Publications/KYR%20Scavenging%20English.pdf|title = Human rights and manual scavenging|accessdate = 28 April 2018|publisher = National Human Rights Commission|page = 1|series = Know Your Rights Series|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In East Africa, [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]] women may carry loads of up to 70% of their own body weight balanced on top of their heads. Women of the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] tribe carry similar heavy loads, but using a leather strap wrapped around their forehead and the load to secure it while it is carried. (see [[tumpline]]) This results in a permanent groove in the forehead of the women. However, there is no evidence of other harmful effects on the health of women who carry heavy loads on top of their heads. Researchers speculate that training from a young age may explain this. Up to 20% of the person's body weight can be carried with no extra exertion of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Heglund |first2=NC |last3=Prager |first3=LM |last4=Cavagna |first4=GA |last5=Taylor |first5=CR |title=Energetic cost of carrying loads: have African women discovered an economic way? |journal=Nature |date=20 February 1986|issue=319(6055) |pages=668–9. |pmid=3951538 |last1=Maloiy |first1=GM |volume=319 |doi=10.1038/319668a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have shown that African and European women carrying 70% of their body weight in controlled studies used more oxygen while head-carrying, in contrast to carrying a load on their backs. The research did not support the notion that head-loading is less exerting than carrying on the back, "although there is some evidence of energy saving mechanisms for back-loading at low speed/load combinations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Parr |first2=B |last3=Davies |first3=S |last4=Partridge |first4=T |last5=Cooke |first5=C |title=A comparison of the physiological consequences of head-loading and back-loading for African and European women |journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology |date=July 2010 |volume= 109|pages=607–16 |pmid=20186424 |last1=Lloyd |first1=R |issue=4 |doi=10.1007/s00421-010-1395-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in particular may have practical reasons for carrying on the head, as for many African women it is "well-suited to the rough, rural terrain and the particular objects they carry—like buckets of water and bundles of firewood", then abandoning the practice when they migrate to urban areas where their daily routines, and socially accepted practices, are different. In Ghana, affluent residents of the southern cities employ young women who migrate from the poorer northern region to work as "head porters", called ''[[kayayei]]'', for $2 a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dweck |first=Jessica |title=Head case: The art and science of carrying on your head |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/08/head_case.html |publisher=Slate Magazine |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |date=Aug 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==
[[File:Spinning fire dancers of Udaipur.jpg|thumb|Spinning dancers balance flaming bowls on their heads, [[Udaipur]], India.]]
There are several traditional dances of West African cultures that include balancing an object on the head as a skillful feat. Ritual dancing among worshippers of the thunder [[deity]], [[Shango]], sometimes balance a container of fire on their heads while dancing. The [[Egbado]] [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] have dances that include balancing "delicate terracotta figures" on the head while the arms and torso are moving.&lt;ref name="WelshAsante1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsh-Asante |first=Kariamu |title=African Dance: An Artistic, Historical, and Philosophical Inquiry |year=1996 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=9780865431973 |pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This tradition continued among Africans taken to America during the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. African-Americans in the 19th century had a popular type of dance competition called "set the floor" ("[[set de flo']]"), during which individual dancers would take turns dancing. Competing dancers would try to perform complicated steps given to them by a caller (usually a fiddler), without stepping outside the bounds of a circle drawn on the ground. To add to the challenge, some dancers would compete while balancing a glass full of water on top of their heads, trying not to spill the water while they danced.&lt;ref name="WelshAsante1996" /&gt;

==Comportment==
During the Victorian era, when [[finishing school]]s for young women were at their peak and manners and [[comportment]] were more rigid, young women were sometimes instructed to improve their posture by balancing books or a teacup and saucer on their heads while walking and getting up or down from a chair.  They were told to model themselves after "the Egyptian water-carrier, with the jug of water poised so prettily on her head, and her figure so straight and beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beard, Lina and Adelia Belle Beard |title=American Girls Handy Book |year=1887 |publisher=David R. Godine |isbn=9780879236663 |pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''heading indicator''' (also called an '''HI''') is a [[flight instrument]] used in an [[aircraft]] to inform the [[aviator|pilot]] of the aircraft's [[aircraft heading|heading]]. It is sometimes referred to by its older names, the '''directional gyro''' or '''DG''', and also (UK usage) '''direction indicator''' or '''DI'''.&lt;ref name="Bowditch" /&gt;

== Use ==
The primary means of establishing the [[Course (navigation)#Determining the true course of a vessel|heading]] in most small aircraft is the magnetic [[compass]], which, however, suffers from several types of errors, including that created by the "dip" or downward slope of the Earth's magnetic field.  Dip error causes the magnetic compass to read incorrectly whenever the aircraft is in a bank, or during acceleration or deceleration, making it difficult to use in any flight condition other than unaccelerated, perfectly straight and level.  To remedy this, the pilot will typically manoeuvre the airplane with reference to the heading indicator, as the gyroscopic heading indicator is unaffected by dip and acceleration errors. The pilot will periodically reset the heading indicator to the heading shown on the magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="Bowditch"&gt;Bowditch, Nathaniel. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M54M8qjxLQMC&amp;pg=PA93 American Practical Navigator], Paradise Cay Publications, 2002, pp.93-94, {{ISBN|978-0-939837-54-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;NASA [http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/callback/cb_304.htm NASA Callback: Heading for Trouble], NASA Callback Safety Bulletin website, December 2005, No. 305.

== Operation ==
The heading indicator works using a [[gyroscope]], tied by an erection mechanism to the aircraft yawing plane, i. e. the plane defined by the longitudinal and the transverse axis of the aircraft. As such, any configuration of the aircraft yawing plane that does not match the local Earth horizontal results in an indication error. The heading indicator is arranged such that the gyro axis is used to drive the display, which consists of a circular compass card calibrated in degrees. The gyroscope is spun either electrically, or using filtered air flow from a [[suction pump]] (sometimes a pressure pump in high altitude aircraft) driven from the aircraft's [[engine]]. Because the Earth rotates (ω, 15° per hour, apparent drift), and because of small accumulated errors caused by imperfect balancing of the gyro, the heading indicator will drift over time (real drift), and must be reset using a magnetic compass periodically.&lt;ref name="Bowditch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As a heading indicator ages and its ball bearings become worn and noisy, thus increasing friction, the tendency to drift will increase.&lt;/ref&gt;  The apparent drift is predicted by '''ω sin Latitude''' and will thus be greatest over the poles. To counter for the effect of Earth rate drift a latitude nut can be set (on the ground only) which induces a (hopefully equal and opposite) real wander in the gyroscope. Otherwise it would be necessary to manually realign the direction indicator once each ten to fifteen minutes during routine in-flight checks. Failure to do this is a common source of navigation errors among new pilots. Another sort of apparent drift exists in the form of transport wander, caused by the aircraft movement and the convergence of the meridian lines towards the poles. It equals the course change along a [[great circle]] (orthodrome) flight path. 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Popular+Science+The+lads+who+fly+Britain%27s+1944&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UHyfT6aEIYOs9ATwh8C1AQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "How Aircraft Instruments Work."] ''Popular Science'', March 1944, pp. 119, bottom half of page.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
Some more expensive heading indicators are "slaved" to a magnetic sensor, called a "[[flux gate]]".  The flux gate continuously senses the Earth's magnetic field, and a servo mechanism constantly corrects the heading indicator.&lt;ref name="Bowditch" /&gt;  These "slaved gyros" reduce pilot workload by eliminating the need for manual realignment every ten to fifteen minutes.

The prediction of drift in degrees per hour, is as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! SOURCE
! Drift Rate (Degrees per Hour) 
! Sign (Northern Hemisphere)
! Sign (Southern Hemisphere)
|-
| Earth Rate
| 15 * sin Operating Latitude
| - (causing an under-read)
| + (causing an over-read)
|-
| Latitude Nut
| 15 * sin Latitude of Setting
| +

|-
| Transport Wander EAST
| (East Ground Speed Component (or sine track angle x ground speed or change in longitude/flight time in hours) * tan Operating Latitude)/60

| +
| -
|-
| Real/Random Wander
| As given in the Aircraft Operating Manual
| As given
| As given
|}

Although it is possible to predict the drift, there will be minor variations from this basic model, accounted for by gimbal error (operating the aircraft away from the local horizontal), among others. A common source of error here is the improper setting of the latitude nut (to the opposite hemisphere for example). The table however allows one to gauge whether an indicator is behaving as expected, and as such, is compared with the realignment corrections made with reference to the magnetic compass. Transport wander is an undesirable consequence of apparent drift.

Many of these sources also suggest that modifications to the engine's [[air-fuel ratio]], [[ignition timing]], [[vehicle emissions control|emissions control systems]], [[Engine control unit|electronic control systems]] and possibly other design elements, might be required in order to obtain any significant results. A modified vehicle in this way may not pass mandatory [[anti-smog]] controls.&lt;ref name="pm_mpg"&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a3499/4276846/ Water-Powered Cars: Hydrogen Electrolyzer Mod Can't Up MPGs], Mike Allen, August 7, 2008, Popularmechanics.com&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inherent complexity of these [[subsystems]], a necessity of modern engine design and [[emissions standards]], such claims made by proponents of hydrogen fuel enhancement are difficult to substantiate and always disputed.

To date, hydrogen fuel enhancement products have not been specifically addressed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], as no research devices or commercial products have reports available as per the "Motor Vehicle Aftermarket Retrofit Device Evaluation Program."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/reports.htm See list of devices tested under EPA Gas Saving and Emission Reduction Devices Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; They do, however, point out that installation of such devices often involves illegally tampering with an automobile's emissions control system, which could result in significant fines.&lt;ref&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/420f11036.pdf "Devices and Additives to Improve Fuel Economy and Reduce Pollution - Do They Really Work?"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Environment Canada does have a research paper on the subject. In tests done in their laboratory in 2004 they found no improvement in engine efficiency or fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;[Barton, P.J. 2004. Study of Heavy Duty Vehicle Exhaust Emissions and Fuel Consumption with the use of a JetStar™ Hydrogen Gas Generator. Environment Canada, ERMD Report No. 2004-32v2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrolysis==
Hydrogen fuel enhancement from [[electrolysis]] (utilizing automotive [[alternator]]s) has been promoted for use with gasoline-powered and diesel trucks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etvcanada.com/F/data/PDF_CHEC.pdf Business Name&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,69529-0.html Wired magazine: Truckers Choose Hydrogen Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenchektech.com/|title=GreenChek Technology corporate website|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; although electrolysis-based designs have repeatedly failed efficiency tests and contradict widely accepted laws of thermodynamics (i.e. conservation of energy). Proponents, who sell the units (often called "HHO devices"), claim that the dynamics are often misconstrued, and due to the chemical properties of the resulting mixture, it is possible to gain efficiency increases in a manner that does not violate any scientific laws. Many tests by consumer watch groups have shown negative results. This technique may seem appealing to some at first because it is easy to overlook energy losses in the system as a whole. Those unfamiliar with electrodynamics may not realize that the electrolytic cell drains current from a car's electrical system causing an increase in mechanical resistance in the alternator that will always result in a net power reduction.&lt;ref name="pm_mpg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyff4.com/news/17036761/detail.html Greenville News Looking Out 4 You: Water 4 Gas Fails to Boost Mileage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924012155/http://www.wyff4.com/news/17036761/detail.html |date=2008-09-24 }}

==Catalysis==

[[Arvin Meritor]], a Tier 1 supplier of automotive technology, at one time, was experimenting with a plasma reformer technology which would use hydrogen produced from the fuel to enhance engine combustion efficiency and reduce emissions of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/11/hydrogenenhance.html/ Hydrogen-Enhanced Combustion Engine Could Improve Gasoline Fuel Economy by 20% to 30%]&lt;/ref&gt; This reference states that a 20% to 30% increase in engine thermal efficiency is possible.  However, this requires that the engine should be modified to operate in the ultra-lean region of the plot of compression ratio vs. air/fuel equivalence ratio (lambda), along with other modifications. This technology would not work well as a retrofit to unmodified engine technology. This research was conducted in conjunction with the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at [[MIT]]. Eventually, the division conducting this research was sold off to an equity investment firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/02/arvinmeritor_to.html/ ArvinMeritor to Sell its Emissions Technologies Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

First launched in the 2011 model year, Kia’s UVO entertainment system included the [[HD Radio|HD radio]], [[CD player]], and a built-in [[Jukebox|digital jukebox]]. The system also interfaces with Bluetooth-enabled phones and utilizes touchscreen and voice command technology.

The UVO system is driven by vehicle communications with a [[smartphone application]]. Data transfers from the vehicle to the smartphone application utilize the customer’s mobile carrier resulting in a subscription-free telematics service. Users of the system are able to interact with their vehicle to retrieve [[Diagnostic Trouble Code]]s. Users can also load a [[Point of interest]] to the vehicle's [[head unit]]. Other technologies like [[GPS]] and [[IVR]] are also integrated into the system.

Users are able to access the vehicle data on the smartphone application and through a customer web portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.myuvo.com | title= MyUVO.com |date=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 model year, select vehicles launched with an Android-based &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kia.com/worldwide/about-kia/company/corporate-news-view.aspx?idx=660\ | title= Kia unveils all-new Soul at New York Auto Show |date=2013-03-28 |work=Kia Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating platform to allow flexibility to integrate 3rd-party [[Application software|applications]].

==Media coverage==
[[TechCrunch]] identified that, compared to other markets, the fees charged by legal practitioners are traditionally non transparent, and considered Lexoo “a classic example of how markets can be made more efficient and transparent by moving them online”.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/16/lexoo/|title=Lexoo Scores $400K For Its Lawyer-Matching Service For Small Businesses|last1=O’Hear|first1=Steve|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forbes]] described Lexoo as “the democratisation of legal services”, noting that “the participating solicitors know they are quoting in a competitive environment, so they will offer their best price up front, without businesses having to ask for it. All the ingredients of a classic disruptive start-up.”&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

In June 2015, the [[Financial Times]] selected Lexoo as its "Innovation to Watch"&lt;ref name="FinancialTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://on.ft.com/1LdSgjP|title=Lexoo: a digital marketplace for legal services|last1=Newton|first1=Richard|date=16 June 2015|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Startups.co.uk listed Lexoo among the top 100 startups in the UK in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Henry|title=Lexoo: The Forward-backed website that compares pre-screened, specialist lawyers|url=http://startups.co.uk/startups-100/2015/97-lexoo/|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=Startups.co.uk|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Group Captain]] '''Lionel Wilmot Brabazon Rees''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|VC|OBE|MC|AFC}} (31 July 1884 – 28 September 1955) was a Welsh aviator, [[flying ace]], and a recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. He was credited with eight confirmed aerial victories, comprising one enemy aircraft captured, one destroyed, one "forced to land" and five "driven down".&lt;ref name=Above316&gt;''Above the Trenches'', p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; Rees and his gunner, Flight Sergeant [[James McKinley Hargreaves]], were the only two airmen to become aces flying the earliest purpose-built British fighter airplane, the [[Vickers Gunbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pusher Aces of World War 1. |page= 91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rees also had a keen interest in archaeology. While flying from [[Cairo]] to [[Baghdad]] in the 1920s, he took some of the earliest archaeological aerial photographs of sites in eastern [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] (now Jordan), and published several articles in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' and the journal of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]. He is considered a father of the archaeological studies of this remote area, and a pioneer of aerial archaeology.&lt;ref name="Jordan pages 69-81"&gt;"Aerial Archaeology in Jordan", David Kennedy and Robert Bewley, ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' 83, no 319, pp. 69–81&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an accomplished sailor.

==Early life==
Rees was born at 5 Castle Street, [[Caernarfon]], on 31 July 1884, the son of Charles Herbert Rees, a solicitor and honorary colonel in the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], and his wife Leonara.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; Rees attended [[Eastbourne College]] before entering the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]] at Woolwich in 1902.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/wales/rees.php |title=Lionel Rees |work=The Aerodrome |accessdate= 20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned in on 23 December 1903 into the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] and was posted to Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pusher Aces of World War 1 |page= 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant]] in 1906 he moved to Sierra Leone in 1908 and in May 1913 was seconded to the [[Southern Nigeria Regiment]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

==First World War==
In 1912, Rees learned to fly at his own expense, receiving his [[List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1913|Aviator's Certificate (no. 392)]] in January 1913. By 1913–14, Rees was attached to the [[West African Frontier Force]] when he was seconded to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in August 1914, initially as an instructor at [[Upavon]], he was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] in October 1914.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; In early 1915 he took command of the newly formed [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron]] at Netheravon and in July they moved to France.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Gp. Capt. L.W.B. Rees V.C. |author= |section=Obituaries |day_of_week=Thursday |date=29 September 1955 |page_number=12|issue=53338 |column=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first saw action flying the Vickers Gunbus with No. 11 Squadron in the mid-1915, earning a reputation as an aggressive pilot and an above average marksman.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome.com"/&gt;

===Military Cross===
Rees was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his actions in 1915, gazetted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29344 |supp= y |page=10731 |date=29 October 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For conspicuous gallantry and skill on several occasions, notably the following: —

On 21st&amp;nbsp;September, 1915, when flying a machine with one machine gun, accompanied by [[Flight Sergeant|Flight-Sergeant]] Hargreaves, he sighted a large German biplane with two machine guns 2,000&amp;nbsp;feet below him. He spiralled down and dived at the enemy, who, having the faster machine, manoeuvred to get him broadside on and then opened heavy fire. Despite this, Captain Rees pressed his attack and apparently succeeded in hitting the enemy's engine, for the machine made a quick turn, glided some distance and finally fell just inside the German lines near Herbecourt.

On 28 July he attacked and drove down a hostile monoplane despite the main spar of his machine having been shot through and the rear spar shattered. On 31 August, accompanied by Flight-Sergeant Hargreaves, he fought a German machine more powerful than his own for three-quarters of an hour, then returned for more ammunition and went out to the attack again, finally bringing the enemy's machine down apparently wrecked.|''The London Gazette'', 29 October 1915}}

By this time he had claimed one aircraft captured, one destroyed, one "forced to land" and five "driven down".&lt;ref name=Above316/&gt;

Rees returned to England at the end of 1915 where he took command of the Central Flying School Flight at Upavon.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; In June 1916 he took [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron]] to France.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

===Victoria Cross===
Rees was 31&amp;nbsp;years old and a temporary [[major]] in No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.&lt;ref name="times-vc"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=Court Circular|author=|section=Court and Social|day_of_week=Monday|date=18 December 1916|page_number=11|issue=41353|column=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first hours of the [[Somme Offensive]], Rees was on patrol, taking off in [[Airco DH.2]] No. 6015 at 0555 hours. His attempt to join a formation of "British" machines brought an attack from one of the Germans. He shot up the attacker, hitting its fuselage between the two aircrew. As it dived away, Rees attacked a [[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft|Roland]]. Long range fire from three other Germans did not discourage Rees from closing on it; it emitted a hazy cloud of smoke from its engine from the 30 rounds Rees fired into it and it fled. Rees then single-handedly went after five more Germans. A bullet in the thigh paralysed his leg, forcing him to temporarily break off his assault. As the shock of the wound wore off, he was able to pursue the German formation leader, which was leaving after dropping its bomb. He fired his [[Lewis machine gun]] empty. In frustration, he drew his pistol but dropped it into his DH.2's nacelle. Meanwhile, the German two-seater pulled away above him. The German formation was shattered and scattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The War in the Air|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pusher Aces of World War 1 |pages= 34–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rees gave up the futile chase, and returned to base. Once landed, he calmly asked for steps so he could deplane. Once seated on the aerodrome grass, he had a tender fetched to take him to hospital. The valour of his actions earned him the Victoria Cross. Its citation reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pusher Aces of World War 1 |pages= 35–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|On 1&amp;nbsp;July 1916 at [[Double Crassieurs]], France, Major Rees, whilst on flying duties, sighted what he thought was a bombing party of our machines returning home, but were in fact enemy aircraft. Major Rees was attacked by one of them, but after a short encounter it disappeared, damaged. The others then attacked him at long range, but he dispersed them, seriously damaging two of the machines. He chased two others but was wounded in the thigh, temporarily losing control of his aircraft. He righted it and closed with the enemy, using up all his ammunition, firing at very close range. He then returned home, landing his aircraft safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29695|date=4 August 1916  |page=7744|supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He convalesced for a while due to his injuries from the 1 July action, and went on a War Office mission to the United States, becoming a temporary [[lieutenant colonel]] in May 1917.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; For the remainder of hostilities Rees commanded a [[School of Aerial Fighting]] based at [[RAF Turnberry]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pusher Aces of World War 1"&gt;{{cite book |title= Pusher Aces of World War 1 |page= 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
On 2 November 1918 Rees was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in recognition of valuable flying services.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30989 |supp= y |page=12958 |date=1 November 1918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Rees was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref name="obe"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31378 |supp= y |page=7028 |date=29 May 1919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 1919 he resigned his commission with the Royal Garrison Artillery and took a permanent commission in the newly formed Royal Air Force as a lieutenant-colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31486 |page=9865 |date=1 August 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 Rees was presented with a sword and the freedom of Caernarfon.&lt;ref name="times-freedom"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Airman's Bravery Honoured |author= |section=Official Appointments and Notices |day_of_week=Friday |date=16 January 1920 |page_number=9 |issue=42309 |column= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Caernarfon Brabazon Rees VC plaque.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Plaque honouring Rees in Caernarfon&lt;/center&gt;]]

In June 1920, he took command of the flying wing at [[RAF College Cranwell]], becoming the assistant commandant in March 1923.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; Promoted to [[group captain]] after the RAF moved away from the Army rank structure, Rees became deputy director in the Air Ministry directorate of training and in January 1925 he became an additional air aide-de-camp to the King.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

Rees was posted to [[RAF Amman]] in May 1926 and given command of the RAF Transjordan and Palestine in October 1926.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; He had a keen interest in archaeology, and while flying on the [[Cairo]] to [[Baghdad]] route during this period, he took some of the earliest archaeological aerial photographs of sites in eastern [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] (now Jordan), and published several articles in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' and the journal of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].  He is considered a father of the archaeological studies of this remote area, and a pioneer of aerial archaeology.&lt;ref name="Jordan pages 69-81"/&gt;

Rees returned to England in October 1926 to take command of the RAF Depot at [[RAF Uxbridge|Uxbridge]] before he retired  
from the RAF in 1931 with the rank of group captain.&lt;ref name="Pusher Aces of World War 1"/&gt; In 1933, he sailed single-handedly across the Atlantic from Wales to Nassau in the Bahamas in a [[ketch]].  For this achievement he was awarded the prestigious Blue Water Medal by the [[Cruising Club of America]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cruisingclub.org/pdfs/bluewater.pdf |title=The Blue Water Medal Awards 1923–2004 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Second World War broke out, Rees returned to the United Kingdom from the Bahamas and once again joined the RAF. He relinquished his rank of group captain in January 1941 at his own request and was granted the rank of [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]].&lt;ref name="times35076"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35076 |page=902 |date=14 February 1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in Africa.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Sweetman, John, ‘Rees, Lionel Wilmot Brabazon (1884–1955)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/71860, accessed 8 June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 1942 Rees reverted to the rank of group captain on the retired list.&lt;ref name="times "&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35940 |supp= y |page=1247 |date=12 March 1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rees returned home to the Bahamas and on 12 August 1947, aged 62, he married Sylvia Williams, a young local woman. They had three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caernarfononline.co.uk/wyddech_chi/vc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213030018/http://www.caernarfononline.co.uk/wyddech_chi/vc.html |archivedate=13 February 2008 |accessdate=7 June 2014|title=Caernarfon's One and Only VC |work=Caernarfon – Did You Know }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rees died at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau on 28 September 1955&lt;ref name="Pusher Aces of World War 1"/&gt; from [[leukemia|leukaemia]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; He was buried at Nassau war cemetery.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; Described as a real gentleman, during his time in Transjordan and possibly during other parts of his career, Rees was known to give his pay to service charities.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

'''Modular additions''' are usually side and second-story additions to homes that are pre-fabricated at the facilities. General characteristics of a [[modular home]] apply. For a second-story modular addition the existing house should have a sound structure as modular rooms are 30%+ heavier than the same stick-built. Modular additions are built in the facility, brought to the site and “dropped” by crane on the new location. It is necessary to have a general contractor to supervise the project as there is always some work to tie new rooms into an existing house.

Even though it is assumed that modular additions are less expensive than traditional stick built this is rarely true when compared by square footage. The buyer would generally get more wood and better insulation plus benefits of controlled environment but total cost of the contract would be about the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">'''Mononitrotoluene''', or '''methylnitrobenzene''' or '''nitrotoluene''' ('''MNT''' or '''NT'''), is a group of three [[organic compound]]s, a [[nitro compound|nitro]] derivative of [[toluene]] (or alternatively a methyl derivative of [[nitrobenzene]]). Its [[chemical formula]] is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Mononitrotoluene comes in three [[isomer]]s, differing by the relative position of the [[methyl]] and [[nitro compound|nitro]] groups:
* '''''ortho''-nitrotoluene''' ('''ONT'''), '''''o''-nitrotoluene''', or '''[[2-nitrotoluene]]'''. It is a pale yellow liquid with a subtle, characteristic smell, reminiscent of [[bitter almonds]]. It is non-[[hygroscopic]] and non-corrosive.
* '''''meta''-nitrotoluene''' ('''MNT'''), '''''m''-nitrotoluene''', or '''[[3-nitrotoluene]]'''. It is a yellowish-greenish to yellow liquid with weak fragrance.
* '''''para''-nitrotoluene''' ('''PNT'''), '''''p''-nitrotoluene''', or '''[[4-nitrotoluene]]'''. It is a pale yellow material forming [[rhombus|rhombic]] crystals and has a somewhat pleasant, characteristic smell of [[bitter almonds]]. It is almost insoluble in water.

Typical use of nitrotoluene is in production of [[pigment]]s, [[antioxidant]]s, agricultural chemicals, and photographic chemicals.

''Ortho''-mononitrotoluene and ''para''-mononitrotoluene can be also used as [[detection taggant]]s for [[explosive detection]].

'''Nad's''' is an Australian [[trademark]] of internationally sold [[waxing]] [[hair removal]] products, although [[chemical depilatory]], skin-care and other products are also sold under the name.

==Background and history==
Nad's was developed and founded in 1992 by Australian businesswoman Sue Ismie.&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/how-a-fight-changed-sue/story-e6frezb9-1111118181991|title=How a fight changed Sue|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=2008-11-30|accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original product is a tub of natural, green-coloured gel consisting of honey, molasses, sugar and lemon juice. Inspiration for the product came from her daughter's desire to remove the hair from her arms.&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"/&gt; A "concept" used by her mother and grandmother was "improved" by Ismiel herself, in order to reduce the pain of the waxing process on her daughter.&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"/&gt; The product took twelve months to develop.&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"/&gt; Ismiel notified her colleagues at her employment of the result, in which "people wanted me [Ismiel] to bring it in for them to take unwanted hair from their eyebrows and upper lips -- and everybody loved it".&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"/&gt;

The process of developing the gel was completed in a large pot, later to be undertaken in Ismiel's garage which she made into a factory.&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"/&gt; She received her own stall at a market in [[Flemington, New South Wales]], New South Wales, and soon got stalls in local shopping centres throughout Australia. The product's commercial success came from an investment in a television [[advertising campaign]], in which a call centre was developed to take the orders of the product.&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"/&gt;

==Laser clinics==
Nad's has six laser hair removal clinics across Sydney. On 6 July 2015, You by Sia has acquired all 6 Nad's Laser Clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You by Sia acquires Nad's Laser Clinic|url=http://nadsclinic.com.au/press|website=Nad's Clinic|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial reception==
In 1997, Ismiel received a cheque from [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]] for $1 million.&lt;ref name="daily telegraph"/&gt; Five years following its release, British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed that Nad's was the best-selling personal care product in Australia with a turnover of $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barron|first=Susannah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/apr/21/fashion1|title=Nad's – Fashion – The Guardian|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''. [[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2000-04-21|accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' named it as Australia's best-known hair remover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/03/01/1141191732974.html|title=Advertisers recognise that very little can be too much - Stay in Touch|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=2006-03-02|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Space Agency''' ({{lang-ms|Agensi Angkasa Negara}}), abbreviated '''ANGKASA''', is the national [[space agency]] of [[Malaysia]]. It was established in 2002 and its charter includes aims to upgrade, stimulate and foster the country's space programme through integrated and coordinated efforts by developing and applying space technologies.

==Angkasawan program==
===Manned programs===
The [[Angkasawan program]] was an initiative by the Malaysian government to send a Malaysian to the [[International Space Station]] on board [[Soyuz TMA-11]]. The program was named after the Malay word for astronaut, [[Angkasawan]]. It resulted in [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] becoming the first Malaysian in space on 10 October 2007.

The program was officially announced by the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], as a joint programme with the Russian Federation. It was a project under the government-to-government offset agreement through the purchase of Sukhoi SU-30MKM fighter jets for the Royal Malaysian Air Force.

Under this agreement the [[Russian Federation]] bore the cost of training two Malaysians for [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] and for sending one to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in October 2007. It resulted in Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor becoming the first Malaysian in space on 10 October 2007.

The evidence suggests that the main objectives of the program are to uplift the national image and to instill in the younger generation greater interest in mathematics and science. At the launch, the Malaysian Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Datuk Seri Dr [[Jamaluddin Jarjis]] said: "It is not merely a project to send a Malaysian into space. After 50 years of independence, we need a new shift and a new advantage to be more successful as a nation. "We want to awe and inspire, and spur Malaysians to attain greater success by embracing science and technology." &lt;ref&gt;Bernama. [http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=289520 First Malaysian Goes Into Space, Nation Sets History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 10 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Dr [[Jamaluddin Jarjis]] was more specific as to the objective of the program when he said that it "was to create awareness among Malaysians the importance of science, technology and the space industry, which could help develop the economy further."&lt;ref name="Space Programme A Boon For Malaysia"&gt;Bernama. [http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=292700 Space Programme A Boon For Malaysia]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 28 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] himself said that "I am not seeking fame or looking forward to be welcomed like a celebrity, but my quest is to inspire Malaysians, especially school children to like learning the subject of science and the space industry."&lt;ref name="Space Programme A Boon For Malaysia"/&gt;

====Muslims in space====
In April 2006, ANGKASA sponsored a conference&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2006-04/19/article04.shtml Malaysian Conf. Probes How Muslim Astronauts Pray] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525005148/http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2006-04/19/article04.shtml |date=25 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of scientists and religious authorities, addressing the issue of how the circumstances of space travel would affect the obligations faced by [[Muslim]] astronauts (for instance, how can one face the [[qibla]] while [[orbit]]ing the Earth).

The Malaysian National Space Agency, in co-operation with other Malaysian agencies, developed the "Guidelines for Performing Islamic Rites at the International Space Station" with the help of 150 scientists and clerics. The handbook details how Muslim astronauts may observe Islamic rites while in orbit. Daily prayer times are aligned with those at the point of departure and if Mecca cannot be located, the astronauts may pray toward the Earth itself. Female Muslim astronauts are required to cover everything but the palms of their hands and their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|title=Interstellar Ramadan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/magazine/09interstellar.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=27 September 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite programs==
Malaysia uses both satellites purchased abroad and developed in country by [[Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.atsb-malaysia.com.my/main.html | title = Astronautic Technology (M) Sdn. Bhd. | publisher = ATSB}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Malaysia's satellites are launched abroad.

===Tiung SAT===

[[Tiung SAT]] is the first Malaysian [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]]. The satellite was developed through the technology transfer and training programme between Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd (ATSB) Malaysia and [[Surrey Satellite Technology]] of the United Kingdom. TiungSAT-1 was launched aboard the [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]] from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan on 26 September 2000. The satellite was developed for experiments in Earth imaging, observation of meteorology, detection of [[cosmic ray]]s, data storage and communications.

===MEASAT===

MEASAT (Malaysia East Asia Satellite) is the name of a family of [[communications satellites]] owned and operated by [[MEASAT Satellite Systems]] Sdn. Bhd. (MYX: 3875, formerly Binariang Satellite Systems Sdn. Bhd.), a Malaysian communications satellite operator.

As of 2006, the MEASAT satellite network consisted of three [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellites designed and built by [[Boeing Satellite Development Center|Boeing Satellite Systems]]. MEASAT-1 and MEASAT-2 were launched in 1996 and MEASAT-3 in 2006.

The MEASAT-1 and 2 satellites were designed to provide 12 years of both direct-to-user television service in Malaysia and general communications services in the region from Malaysia to the [[Philippines]] and from [[Beijing]] to [[Indonesia]]. With the launch of MEASAT-3, the coverage has extended to an area encompassing 70% of the world's population.

===RazakSAT===

[[RazakSAT]] is a high-resolution Malaysian Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite that was launched on board a Falcon 1 on 14 July 2009.&lt;ref name="ASM1"&gt;
{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; It was placed into a unique [[near equatorial orbit]] that presents many imaging opportunities for the equatorial region.
'''RazakSAT''' is an Earth-observing satellite developed in Malaysia and launched in 2009. Its primary instrument is a medium-aperture camera. Images from the camera are relayed to an Image Receiving and Processing ground station in Malaysia.  It failed barely more than 1 year after launch, according to an audit report from October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/rm142m-razaksat-faulty-after-just-one-year-says-federal-auditor/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014203711/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/rm142m-razaksat-faulty-after-just-one-year-says-federal-auditor/ |archivedate=14 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space launcher plans==
In Summer 2001 MNSA started reviewing plans for a small indigenous space launcher that would be developed in collaboration with Japan and would allow Malaysia to join the [[Asian space race|Asian space power]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/211/38.shtml |title=Журнал "Новости космонавтики" |publisher=Novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru |date= |accessdate=27 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513125627/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/211/38.shtml |archivedate=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
MNSA has few satellite-linked ground stations and main Malaysia Space Centre including acting multi-laboratorial Mission Operation Centre, Optical Calibration Laboratory and currently building multi-facilitated Assembly, Integration and Test Centre.

For performing of starts of future indigenous space launchers and foreign operators of space launch services (usual launch pads or air-space systems like Russian [[air launch]] etc.), Malaysia is planning to found energy-advantageous near-[[Equator]]ial [[spaceport]] in [[Tawau]] in Sabah in Malaysian part of [[Borneo]] island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlimen.gov.my/opindexbi/pdf/OPDR%2027%20Mei%202008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224211851/http://www.parlimen.gov.my/opindexbi/pdf/OPDR%2027%20Mei%202008.pdf |archivedate=24 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''organic movement''' broadly refers to the organizations and individuals involved worldwide in the promotion of [[organic farming]] and other organic products. It started around the first half of the 20th century, when modern large-scale agricultural practices began to appear.

==Overview and origin==
The term “organic” can be broadly described as food that is not genetically engineered and grown without the assistance of toxic chemicals, including many synthetic pesticides, the use of arsenic, and fertilization using biosolids, which are often found to contain flame retardants and drugs among other things, even though they are processed. The term "organic farming" was coined by Lord Northbourne in 1940.&lt;ref name=N1940&gt;Paull, John [https://www.academia.edu/9254016/Lord_Northbourne_the_man_who_invented_organic_farming_a_biography Lord Northbourne, the man who invented organic farming, a biography.] Journal of Organic Systems, 2014, 9(1), 31-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of the organic movement can be traced back to the beginning of the 1800s. In 1840 [[Justus Von Liebig]] developed a theory of mineral plant nutrition. Liebig believed that [[manure]] could be directly substituted by certain mineral salts. Many years later in 1910, preceding the First World War, chemists [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] developed an ammonia synthesis process, making use of nitrogen from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fritz Haber|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/fritz-haber|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of ammonia had already been used to manufacture explosives, so after the war, it was implemented into the fertilization of agriculture.

The organic movement began in the early 1900s in response to the shift towards synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides in the early days of [[industrial agriculture]]. A relatively small group of farmers  came together in various associations: [[Demeter International]] of Germany, which encouraged [[biodynamic farming]] and began the first certification program, the [[Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society]],&lt;ref name="Paull2008"&gt;Paull, John [http://www.orgprints.org/15089/1/15089new.pdf "The Lost History of Organic Farming in Australia"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2008, 3(2):2-17.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soil Association]] of the United Kingdom, and [[Rodale Press]] in the United States, along with others. In 1972 these organizations joined to form the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM). In recent years, environmental awareness has driven demand and conversion to organic farming. Some governments, including the European Union, have begun to support organic farming through [[agricultural subsidy]] reform. Organic production and marketing have grown at a fast pace.

Today, organic foods stores have captured a significant share of the grocery shopping market, specifically, [[Whole Foods Market]], [[Wild Oats Markets|Wild Oats]], [[Trader Joe's|Trader joe's]] and others.

== History ==
{{Main|History of organic farming}}
* In the summer of 1924 [[Rudolf Steiner]] presented what has been called the first organic agriculture course to a group of over one hundred farmers and others at Koberwitz, now [[Kobierzyce]], [[Poland]].&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9149070/Attending_the_first_organic_agriculture_course_Rudolf_Steiner_s_Agriculture_Course_at_Koberwitz_1924  "Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner’s Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924"], European Journal of Social Sciences, 21(1):64-70.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s Spiritual Foundations for the Renewal of Agriculture, published in 1924, led to the popularization of [[biodynamic agriculture]], probably the first comprehensive organic farming system, that was based on Steiner's [[Anthroposophy|spiritual and philosophical teachings]].
* The first use of the term "organic farming" is by Lord Northbourne (aka [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne]]). The term derives from his concept of "the farm as organism", which he expounded in his book, Look to the Land (1940), and in which he described a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming. Northbourne wrote of "chemical farming versus organic farming". http://www.orgprints.org/10138.
* In 1939, strongly influenced by Sir Howard's work, [[Lady Eve Balfour]] launched the [[Haughley Experiment]] on farmland in England. It was the first, side-by-side comparison of organic and conventional farming. Four years later, she published ''[[The Living Soil]]'', based on the initial findings of the Haughley Experiment. It was widely read, and lead to the formation of a key international organic advocacy group, the [[Soil Association]].
* [[Sir Albert Howard]]'s 1940 book, ''[[An Agricultural Testament]]'', was influential in promoting organic techniques, and his 1947 book "The Soil and Health, A Study of Organic Agriculture" adopted Northbourne's terminology and was the first book to include "organic" agriculture or farming in its title.
* During the 1950s, sustainable agriculture was a research topic of interest. The science tended to concentrate on the new chemical approaches. In the [[United States|U.S.]], [[J.I. Rodale]] began to popularize the term and methods of organic growing. In addition to agricultural research, Rodale's publications through the [[Rodale Press]] helped to promote [[organic gardening]] to the general public.
* In 1962, [[Rachel Carson]], a prominent scientist and [[Natural history|naturalist]], published ''[[Silent Spring]]'', chronicling the effects of [[DDT]] and other pesticides on the environment drawing on the research of [[biodynamic agriculture]] advocates [[Marjorie Spock]], Mary T. Richards and [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]].&lt;ref name=RCarson&gt;Paull, John (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/9149162/The_Rachel_Carson_letters_and_the_making_of_Silent_Spring  "The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring"],   SAGE Open, 3 (July), pp. 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; A bestseller in many countries, including the US, and widely read around the world, ''Silent Spring'' was instrumental in the US government's 1972 banning of DDT. The book and its author are often credited with launching the environmental movement.&lt;ref name=RCarson/&gt;
* In the 1970s, worldwide movements concerned with environmental pollution caused by persistent agrichemical increased attention on organic farming. One goal of the ''organic movement'' was to promote consumption of [[Local food|locally grown food]], which was promoted through slogans such as ''"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food"''.
* In 1972, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ([[IFOAM]]), was founded in Versailles, France. IFOAM was dedicated to the diffusion of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and linguistic boundaries. In the same year, [[John Battendieri]] founded Santa Cruz Organics, which marketed some of the first packaged organic products.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In the 1980s, around the world, various farming and consumer groups began seriously pressuring for government regulation of organic production to ensure standards of production. This led to various legislation and certification standards being enacted through the 1990s and to date. Currently, most aspects of organic food production are government-regulated in the US and the European Union.
* In the 2000s, the worldwide market for organic products (including food, beauty, health, bodycare, and household products, and fabrics) has grown rapidly. More countries are establishing formal, government-regulated [[Organic certification]]. Monitoring and challenging certification rules and decisions have become a regular, high profile aspect of activists in the organic movement.

==Organic food==
{{Main|Organic food}}
Specifications for what may be classified as organic food may vary by location. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), organic food is produced by farmers who emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance the quality of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Introduction to Organic Practices.” Introduction to Organic Practices | Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA, www.ams.usda.gov/publications/content/introduction-organic-practices.
&lt;/ref&gt; Organic poultry and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is produced without the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, bioengineering, and ionizing radiation. Before a product can be labeled "organic", a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards. Companies that handle or process organic food before it reaches supermarkets and restaurants must be certified as well.

==Organic companies==
The recent interest in the organic industry has sparked the interest of many businesses from small local distributors to large companies that distribute many products nationally. The organic market is now a 14 billion dollar a year industry, that continues to grow especially from large corporations such as Wal-Mart that are now offering organic choices to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnas.tamu.edu/The%20New%20Horizon%20for%20Organics.pdf Clark, Georgia. "The New Horizon for Organics: A Market Outlook of the Effects of Wal-Mart on the International Organic Market". June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies that offer organic options include General Mills and Kraft. Some large companies have bought smaller already established organic companies such as Earth’s Best, Rice Dream soy milk, Garden of Eatin', Celestial Seasonings and Health Valley. When larger companies buy smaller companies it is called [[stealth ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Emergent-Agriculture-Farming-Sustainability-Economy/dp/0865717737/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461723770&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=emergent+agriculture|title=The Emergent Agriculture: Farming, Sustainability and the Return of the Local Economy|last=Kleppel|first=Gary|last2=Ikerd|first2=John|date=2014-07-22|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=9780865717732|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic cosmetics==
Organic cosmetics are products that are made with organic ingredients that were produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers.

The [http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/Claims/ucm203078.htm FDA] does not have a definition of “Organic” in terms of organic cosmetics. FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]  (FD&amp;C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA).

The USDA (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) requirements for the use of the term “organic” are separate from the laws and regulations that FDA applies for cosmetics. For more information on "organic" labeling for cosmetics, see the NOP publication, "[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5068442 Cosmetics, Body Care Products, and Personal Care Products]." Cosmetic products labeled with “organic” must follow both USDA regulations and FDA regulations of organic claims for labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics.

The Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA supervises the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP). The NOP regulations have the definition of “organic” and provide certification for agricultural ingredients if they have been produced under conditions that would meet the definition. Moreover, the regulations also include labeling standards based on the percentage of organic ingredients in every product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_10/7cfr205_10.html Gpo.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cosmos (standard)|COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard]] (COSMOS) sets certification requirements for organic and natural cosmetics products in Europe.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic farming==
Organic farming is a form of agriculture that relies on techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, compost, and biological pest control.
{{Main|Organic farming}}

==Criticisms==
There have been multiple criticisms regarding organic food and organic marketing practices. Scientists at the University of Washington did a test of the urine of children who are on organic food diets and children who are on conventional food diets. The result was children on organic food diets ‘ urine had a median level of pesticide byproducts only one-sixth of children on conventional food diets. However, at the same time French, British and Swedish government food agencies have all concluded that there was no scientific proof that organic food is safer or has more nutrition than conventional foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FOOD|last=Jan|first=Grover|last2=Singer|first2=Peter|last3=Mason|first3=Jim|publisher=Greenhaven Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0737737943|location=Detroit|pages=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study by a non-profit academic think tank alleged consumers are "routinely deceived" by intentional and endemic misleading health claims in organic marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brownfieldagnews.com/2014/05/02/organics-exposed/ Organics Exposed (Academics Review Organic Marketing Report 2014)], by Steve Kopperud, Brownfield News, May 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Organic products typically cost 10% to 40% more than similar conventionally produced products.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, CK and SF Davis, 2006 "Organic Foods" Journal of Food Science 71(9):R117–R124.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UK's [[Food Standards Agency]], "Consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food. However, the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view."&lt;ref&gt;[http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf The Food Standards Agency’s Current Stance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331234955/http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf |date=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 12-month systematic review commissioned by the FSA in 2009 and conducted at the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] based on 50 years' worth of collected evidence concluded that "there is no good evidence that consumption of organic food is beneficial to health in relation to nutrient content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23725592-details/article.do |title=Organic food 'no healthier' blow |author=Sophie Goodchild |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2009-07-29 |publisher=[[London Evening Standard]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801124722/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23725592-details/article.do |archivedate=August 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the source of the organic movement was small family farms, large corporations have started distributing more organic products and certain categories of organic foods, such as milk, have been reported by [[Michael Pollan]] to be highly concentrated and predominantly sourced to mega-farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/naturally/ Naturally], by Michael Pollan, The New York Times Magazine, May 13, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Friedrich Otto Schott''' (17 December 1851 &amp;ndash; 27 August 1935) was a [[German people|German]] [[chemist]], glass technologist, and the inventor of [[borosilicate glass]]. He was the son of a window glass maker, Simon Schott. From 1870 to 1873 Schott studied chemical technology at the technical college in [[Aachen]] and at the universities of [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]].  He attained a doctorate in glass chemistry at [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena]] for his thesis “Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Glass Fabrication”.&lt;ref&gt;Schott, Otto. [http://www.schott.com/english/news/press.html?NID=1190 “Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Glass Fabrication”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Schott developed a new [[lithium]]-based glass that possessed novel [[optics|optical]] properties.  Schott shared this discovery with [[Ernst Karl Abbe|Dr Ernst Abbe]], which was the catalyst for a long professional relationship between the two. 

In 1884, in association with Dr [[Ernst Abbe]] and [[Carl Zeiss]], Otto founded ''[[Glastechnische Laboratorium Schott &amp; Genossen]]'' (Schott &amp; Associates Glass Technology Laboratory) in Jena.  It was here, during the period 1887 through to 1893, that Schott developed borosilicate glass.  Borosilicate glass is distinguished for its high tolerance to heat and a substantial resistance to thermal shock (sudden temperature changes) and resistance to degradation when exposed to chemicals.

In 1926, Otto Schott retired from active work at Schott &amp; Gen.

Among other things it sent a sample on [[Ernst Abbe]].  These samples had a for the first time reached [[Homogen]]itaet, which it made possible to accomplish spectrometric measurements.  From this developed it up to [[1884]] glasses, which completely new optical characteristics exhibited.  At the same time it began at the tafelglasfabrik in Witten cover glasses for microscopic to manufacture [[Praeparat]]e.  It broke through thereby so far of [[England|Englishmen]] held [[monopoly]] on this area, by manufacturing these cover glasses of approximately 20% more favorably.

A specialized scientific exchange of letters with the physicist Abbe led it finally 1882 to Jena.  There it based together with Ernst Abbe as well as Roderich Zeiss|Roderich and Carl Zeiss in the year 1884 a glass-technical laboratory, the later Schott AG|Jenaer glass work Schott &amp; comrade.  First limited to the melt by optical glaesern and thermometer glass, the enterprise expanded its product range owing to the invention of the heatproof Borosilikatglases 1887 (Jenaer glass) rapidly.  Despite growth the enterprise became only in this year profitable.  The massive production of heatproof glasses for lighting purposes (gas glow light cylinders for gas and petroleum lamps) justified the economic success of the company.  Of this glaesern up to 1909 more than 30 million pieces were sold.

The improvements of optical glasses reached by it, among other things it succeeded to manufacture it glasses of also finely gradated optical constants, made the development possible of efficient microscopes and telescopes.  The moreover one developed it new glass sorts.  Due to its outstanding achievements he got 1905 by the technical university at that time Dresden was lent.  1909 had the successful work of 1,090 coworkers and 1919|later also he retired ten years its portions of the work to the Carl Zeiss donation.  He still worked until 1926 in the work as a "civil servant" of the glass work and member of the management.

'''Photofermentation''' is the [[Fermentative hydrogen production|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrate to [[biohydrogen]] manifested by a diverse group of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]] by a series of [[biochemical]] reactions involving three steps similar to [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]. Photofermentation differs from [[dark fermentation]] because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]].

[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|Basic principles of a bioreactor. The photofermentation bioreactor would not include an air pathway.]]

=== Mechanism ===
The bacteria and their energy source are held in a [[bioreactor]] chamber that is impermeable to air and oxygen free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proper temperature for the bacterial species is maintained in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria are sustained with a carbohydrate diet consisting of simple [[Carbohydrate|saccharide]] molecules.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Q, Wang Y, Zhang Z, Lee DJ, Zhou X, Jing Y, Ge X, Jiang D, Hu J, He C | title = Photo-fermentative hydrogen production from crop residue: A mini review | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 229 | pages = 222–230 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28108074 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2017.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are typically sourced from agricultural or forestry waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Variations ===
[[File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|thumb|Depiction of algae (species not specified) in a bioreactor suitable for bioethanol production.]]
In addition to wild type forms of ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]], s''cientists have used [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] forms to produce hydrogen as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other explorations include expanding the bioreactor system to hold a combination of bacteria, [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ethanol production is performed by the algae [[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii|''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'']], among other species, in cycling light and dark environments.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The cycling of light and dark environments has also been explored with bacteria for hydrogen production, increasing hydrogen yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chen CY, Yang MH, Yeh KL, Liu CH, Chang JS |date= September 2008 |title=Biohydrogen production using sequential two-stage dark and photo fermentation processes |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=33|issue=18|pages=4755–4762|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
The bacteria are typically fed with broken down agricultural waste or undesired crops, such as water lettuce or sugar beet molasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keskin T, Hallenbeck PC | title = Hydrogen production from sugar industry wastes using single-stage photofermentation | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 112 | pages = 131–6 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22420990 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The high abundance of such waste ensures the stable food source for the bacteria and productively uses human-produced waste.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In comparison with [[dark fermentation]], photofermentation produces more hydrogen per reaction and avoids the acidic end products of dark fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrasekhar K, Lee YJ, Lee DW | title = Biohydrogen production: strategies to improve process efficiency through microbial routes | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 8266–93 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25874756 | pmc = 4425080 | doi = 10.3390/ijms16048266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
The primary limitations of photofermentation as a sustainable energy source stem from the precise requirements of maintaining the bacteria in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers have found it difficult to maintain a constant temperature for the bacteria within the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, the growth media for the bacteria must be rotated and refreshed without introducing air to the bioreactor system, complicating the already expensive bioreactor set up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">'''Planetary-surface construction''' is the construction of artificial habitats and other structures on [[planetary surface]]s. Planetary surface construction can be divided into three phases or classes, coinciding with a phased schedule for habitation (Kennedy 2002, Smith 1993):

• Class I: Pre-integrated hard shell modules ready to use immediately upon delivery.

• Class II: Prefabricated [[kit-of-parts]] that is surface assembled after delivery.

• Class III: [[in-situ resource utilization]] (ISRU) derived structure with integrated Earth components.

Class I structures are prepared and tested on Earth, and are designed to be fully self-contained habitats that can be delivered to the surface of other planets. In an initial mission to put human explorers on Mars, a Class I habitat would provide the bare minimum habitable facilities when continued support from Earth is not possible.

The Class II structures call for a pre-manufactured kit-of-parts system that has flexible capacity for demountability and reuse. Class II structures can be used to expand the facilities established by the initial Class I habitat, and can allow for the assembly of additional structures either before the crew arrives, or after their occupancy of the pre-integrated habitat.

The purpose of Class III structures is to allow for the construction of additional facilities that would support a larger population, and to develop the capacity for the local production of building materials and structures without the need for resupply from Earth.

To facilitate the development of technology required to implement the three phases, Cohen and Kennedy (1997) stress the need to explore robust robotic system concepts that can be used to assist in the construction process, or perform the tasks autonomously. Among other things, they suggest a roadmap that stresses the need for adapting structural components for robotic assembly, and determining appropriate levels of modularity, assembly, and component packaging. The roadmap also sets the development of experimental construction systems in parallel with components as an important milestone.

== History ==
Pong Research was incorporated in 2011 and in 2014 relocated from [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]], Virginia to [[Encinitas, California|Encinitas]], California. The company was financially backed by [[Catterton Partners]], the leading consumer-focused private equity fund with over $4.5 billion under management.
In 2014, the company changed its name to Antenna79, Inc. In 2016 Antenna79 merged with Invisible Gadget Guard, Inc. (a cell phone accessories company specializing in [[Screen protector|screen protection]]) to become Penumbra Brands, LLC.

== Technology ==
The Pong Case antenna technology was created by PhD scientists educated at Harvard, MIT, UCLA and the [[University of Manchester]]. Using their knowledge of manipulating [[Radio frequency|radiofrequency]] (RF) electromagnetic fields, Pong invented a coupling and re-radiating antenna that redistributes cell phone near-field radiation. Pong’s first product was for the [[iPhone 3G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PR Newswire|title=Pong™ Research Corporation Introduces New Cell Phone and iPad Cases to Protect Against Potentially-Harmful Wireless Device Radiation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/17/idUS222791+17-Nov-2011+PRN20111117|website=Reuters.com|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases were made of a hard polycarbonate called Lexan and contain a micro-thin, gold-plated coupled antenna system (CAS) that redirects wireless energy away from the user, thus reducing exposure to mobile device radiation well below the FCC [[Specific absorption rate|Specific Absorption Rate]] (SAR) limit—without compromising the device’s ability to communicate.

The cases use a passive antenna coupling technology works via a micro-thin gold-plated antenna embedded inside the Pong Case that redistributes the [[RF signal]] emitted from a mobile device away from the user’s head and body without compromising the device’s ability to communicate.  Pong has 8 patents granted and 20 filings pending.

In 2017 the Pong Case was renamed ''alara'', which stands for "[[ALARP|as low as reasonably achievable]]", in reference to the technology significantly reducing RF exposure without compromising the device’s ability to communicate. 

== Lab Test Results ==
In October 2009, [[Wired Magazine]] tested the product at Cetecom, an FCC-certified lab in Milpitas, California that tests cell phone radiation levels for handset manufacturers. Using a Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin head filled with a brain tissue simulating fluid.  After a phone call simulation with and without the Pong case, it was found that the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) was reduced by 64.7% to 0.42 watts per kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=German|first1=Kent|title=A cell phone case for reducing cell phone radiation|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/a-cell-phone-case-for-reducing-cell-phone-radiation/|website=cnet.com/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RDF-PowerStation''' is a peripheral [[Waste heat recovery unit|thermal recovery]] plant, which is based on [[renewable energy]] (especially on [[Refuse derived fuel]] (RDF)).

==Concept==
[[File:Processdiagram RDFPowerstation.jpg|thumb|Process diagram of the RDF-Powerstation]][[File:Processdiagram RDFPowerstation Fluegas.jpg|thumb|Process diagram of the fluegas purification unit]]
The RDF-Powerstation is directly integrated in a building like a business centre and is used as a [[cogeneration]] or [[trigeneration]] plant. Due to that the incineration unit and all additional components, which are necessary for the operation of the plant and the utilization of the energy, are located in the consumers’ area. So the energy is produced and used at the same place. The technical realization of this concept is based on the configuration of the process diagram.

Before the crude materials (e.g. municipal or commercial waste) are introduced into the incineration unit, these resources are mechanically treated at an external station. The treatment intensity is significantly linked to the quality and composition of the primary material. So the treatment process can be very different – from an ordinary crushing and a rough sortation to a multistep milling process with various product streams and a finishing briquetting. The final product of this step – the Refuse derived fuel – is used in the “RDF- Powerstation”.

The combustion unit is equipped with a water-cooled reciprocating grate, a post- combustion chamber, where the [[selective non-catalytic reduction]] of the nitrogen oxides is included and a steam boiler with the heat exchangers. The main part of the heat energy, which is captured in the live steam, is used for the electricity production. Another portion is applied for a heating grid or an absorption refrigerator.

Following the steam boiler the [[flue gas]] enters the 4-stage dry scrubber. There the pollutants of the flue gas are extracted by different additives, which separated at the baghouse filters. Additionally a catalyzer is included to enable an extra stage for the removal of the nitrogen oxides ([[Selective catalytic reduction|SCR]]- process). At the end of flue gas purification process an algae reactor is mounted, where algae is converting carbon dioxide to biomass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8888">'''Repowering''' is the process of replacing older [[power stations]] with newer ones that either have a greater [[nameplate capacity]] or more [[Capacity factor|efficiency]] which results in a net increase of power generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uspowerpartners.org/Topics/SECTION1Topic-Repowering.htm|title=Repowering|author=|publisher=Power Partners|date=2009-12-11|accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repowering can happen in several different ways. It can be as small as switching out and replacing a boiler, to as large as replacing the entire system to create a more powerful system entirely.  There are many upsides to repowering. The simple act of refurbishing the old with the new is in itself beneficial alongside the cost reduction for keeping the plant running. With less costs and a higher energy output, the process is excessively beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/06/repowering-gives-new-life-to-old-wind-sites|author=Lawson,James|date=2013-06-07|accessdate=2014-11-14|title=Repowering Gives New Life to Old Wind Sites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Wind power===

Countries like [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]] that have a large number of [[wind turbines]] installed relative to their total land size have resorted to repowering older turbines in order to increase wind power capacity and generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/wind/europe-replaces-old-wind-farms|title=Europe Replaces Old Wind Farms: More power from fewer, bigger turbines|author=Fairley, Peter|publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]]|date=January 2009|accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power as well as use of wind farms has grown since the 1990s.  

With new innovations to improve existing Wind power technology, the Repowering process is to upgrade these old wind turbines. By Repowering these old wind turbine with new upgrades this will greatly improve the efficiency of energy these new Wind turbine can generate. The new technology will greatly increase the amount of energy these Wind turbine can output. In California, the wind turbines are aging it would be effective to Repower the wind turbines but there seems to be a lack of economic incentive across legislature to put money forth for such processes. The inefficient turbines In California were implemented in the 1980s; they run at 1320 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-300-2008-004/CEC-300-2008-004.PDF|title=A Scoping Level Study of the Economics of Wind-Project Repowering Decisions in California|publisher=KEMA, Inc.|date=August 2008|accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential benefits that run along with repowering these California turbines are as follows: 
*Avian mortality may be reduced due to the installation of a smaller number of larger wind turbines. 
*Reduced aesthetic concerns to the extent that modern wind projects are deemed more visually appealing, even if they are taller. 
*“Increased renewable energy production due to the higher average capacity factors typical of new wind facilities.” 
*Use of existing infrastructure (for example, roads, substations), resulting in lower installation costs relative to new “greenfield” wind power projects.  
*“Use of newer wind turbine technology that can better support the state’s electrical grid with better power quality.” 
*Increased local and state tax base, plus positive construction employment opportunities.&lt;ref name="CAEC"&gt;California Energy Commission. (2006). Application for certification, Humboldt Bay Repowering Project. San Francisco, Calif.]: CH2M Hill. http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-300-2008-004/CEC-300-2008-004.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many barriers continue to hinder rapid wind‐project repowering, a primary barrier is simply that many existing, aging wind facilities are more profitable, in the near term, in continued operations than they might be if they pursue repowering with new wind turbines.&lt;ref name="CAEC"/&gt; Therefore, it can be difficult to repower wind turbine facilities based on early numbers.

In 2005, a large majority of [[United States]] wind turbines were of the size range between 51&amp;nbsp;kW to 100&amp;nbsp;kW. In 2002 there was first put in a Megawatt-class turbine (KEMA, Inc.). By 2007, California was only able to repower 20% of the potential power that being 365 MW of the 1,640MW maximum.

===Coal-fired Power Plant to Gas===
With new environmental regulation in the [[United States]], coal-fired power plants are becoming obsolete. As many as three-fourths of coal-fired power plants are being shut down.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Short-term options include retiring the plant or quick conversion to direct firing of the boiler with natural gas. Repowering these old coal burning power plants into gas burning boilers. It's estimated that as much as 30 gigawatts (GW) of existing U.S. power generation capacity could be lost through plant closings due to new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.  There could be a saving of 20 percent of the capital cost instead of building brand new power plants founded by EPRI studied.

The configuration of these plants involves replacing the old coal boiler with gas-fired turbine (GT). The gas-fired outputs exhaust heat to a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). From the output of the heat recovery steam generator it is run into a steam turbine which increases electricity production and the overall efficiency of the plant. 
The gas-fired turbine (GT) and the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) technology has been in utilize in many repowering projects over the past 20 years in the United States alone. With increasing environmental regulations of the United States Government and the lower fuel prices made the usage of GT/HRSG an option in utilizing to renew many old coal heating power plants. This modern gas turbines operate with higher efficiencies and adding a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) raises overall plant efficiency to 40 percent to 50 percent (HHV) above the range of most coal-fired plants, reducing fuel consumption and lowering plant emissions. 
Siemens Corporation are also using this technology by combining the gas turbine (GT) in conjunction with the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) with the steam turbine (ST) and the combined cycle power plants to produce the most efficient power generation facilities. Existing direct-fired plants can utilize this advanced cycle concept by adding a GT and a HRSG. This so-called repowering scheme makes the existing power generation facility equally efficient as modern combined cycle power plant.

Siemens Corporation developed two ways in powering these old coal plants. The first one is called a Full Powering and the second is called Parallel Powering. Full Powering is only used with old plants because the boilers has reached the life of its usage. Full powering replaces the original boiler and gas-turbine (GT) and heat recovery steam generator are added (HRSG). While compared to the full repowering concept, this repowering scheme achieves slightly lower efficiency. Due to the two independent steam sources for the steam turbine, this concept provides a higher fuel flexibility and also greater flexibility in respect to load variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.power-eng.com/articles/print/volume-118/issue-2/departments1/gas-generation/repowering-with-gas.html|title=Repowering with Gas|author= Jeff Brehm, Electric Power Research Institute|publisher=[[Pennwell Power Site-Power Engineering]]|date=February 2014|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a repowering project is of Fluor updating the Seward plant.The plant was a 521-MW coal-fired power plant. The plant burns waste coal. The project was to take three existing pulverized coal-fired boilers out and install two new Clean Coal Technology CFB boilers with major changes such as installing two Alstom CFB boilers along with an Alstom steam turbine generator. This plant is now the largest waste coal generator in the world with a capacity of 521-MW of capacity. It runs on 11,000 tons of waste coal per day.

'''SAS''' (previously "'''Statistical Analysis System'''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sas.com/en_us/company-information.html#history|title=About SAS|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a software suite developed by [[SAS Institute]] for advanced analytics, [[multivariate analyses]], [[business intelligence]], [[data management]], and [[predictive analytics]].

SAS was developed at [[North Carolina State University]] from 1966 until 1976, when SAS Institute was incorporated. SAS was further developed in the 1980s and 1990s with the addition of new statistical procedures, additional components and the introduction of [[JMP (statistical software)|JMP]]. A point-and-click interface was added in version 9 in 2004. A [[social media analytics]] product was added in 2010.

==Technical overview and terminology==
SAS is a software suite that can mine, alter, manage and retrieve data from a variety of sources and perform statistical analysis on it.&lt;ref name="encycl"/&gt; SAS provides a graphical point-and-click user interface for non-technical users and more advanced options through the [[SAS language]].&lt;ref name="encycl"&gt;
{{Cite journal | title = Encyclopedia of Research Design Encyclopedia of research design | doi = 10.4135/9781412961288 | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781412961271 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAS programs have DATA steps, which retrieve and manipulate data, and PROC steps, which analyze the data.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt; Each step consists of a series of statements.&lt;ref name="DelwicheSlaughter2012"&gt;

| pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DATA step has executable statements that result in the software taking an action, and declarative statements that provide instructions to read a data set or alter the data's appearance.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt; The DATA step has two phases: compilation and execution. In the compilation phase, declarative statements are processed and syntax errors are identified. Afterwards, the execution phase processes each executable statement sequentially.&lt;ref name="Li2013"&gt;

The PROC step consists of PROC statements that call upon named procedures. Procedures perform analysis and reporting on data sets to produce statistics, analyses, and graphics. There are more than 300 procedures and each one contains a substantial body of programming and statistical work.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt; PROC statements can also display results, sort data or perform other operations.&lt;ref name="DelwicheSlaughter2012"/&gt;

SAS macros are pieces of code or variables that are coded once and referenced to perform repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name="BassSolutions2007"&gt;

Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS' early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS' first documentation.&lt;ref name="Attr76"/&gt;

===Development===
SAS was re-designed in SAS 76 with an [[open architecture]] that allowed for [[compilers]] and procedures. The INPUT and INFILE statements were improved so they could read most data formats used by IBM mainframes. Generating reports was also added through the PUT and FILE statements. The ability to analyze [[general linear model]]s was also added&lt;ref&gt;

Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the APPEND procedure.&lt;ref name="expert"/&gt;

SAS version 4 had limited features, but made SAS more accessible. Version 5 introduced a complete macro language, array subscripts, and a full-screen interactive user interface called Display Manager.&lt;ref name="expert"/&gt; In 1985, SAS was rewritten in the [[C programming language]]. This allowed for the SAS' Multivendor Architecture that allows the software to run on [[UNIX]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[Windows]]. It was previously written in [[PL/I]], [[Fortran]], and [[assembly language]].&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="expert"/&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, SAS released a number of components to complement Base SAS. SAS/GRAPH, which produces graphics, was released in 1980, as well as the SAS/ETS component, which supports econometric and time series analysis. A component intended for pharmaceutical users, SAS/PH-Clinical, was released in the 1990s. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] standardized on SAS/PH-Clinical for new drug applications in 2002.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;

SAS version 6 was used throughout the 1990s and was available on a wider range of operating systems, including [[Macintosh]], [[OS/2]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Primos]]. SAS introduced new features through dot-releases. From 6.06 to 6.09, a user interface based on the windows paradigm was introduced and support for SQL &lt;ref&gt;

SAS [[SAS Institute lawsuit with World Programming|sued World Programming]], the developers of a competing implementation, [[World Programming System]], alleging that they had infringed SAS's copyright in part by implementing the same functionality. This case was referred from the United Kingdom's [[High Court of Justice]] to the [[European Court of Justice]] on 11 August 2010.&lt;ref name="ecj reference"&gt;

===Comparison to other products===
{{See also|Comparison of statistical packages}}
In a 2005 article for the ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'' comparing statistical packages from SAS and its competitors [[Stata]] and [[SPSS]], Alan C. Acock wrote that SAS programs provide "extraordinary range of data analysis and data management tasks," but were [[Usability|difficult to use]] and learn.&lt;ref name="Acock"/&gt; SPSS and Stata, meanwhile, were both easier to learn (with better documentation) but had less capable analytic abilities, though these could be expanded with paid (in SPSS) or free (in Stata) add-ons. Acock concluded that SAS was best for [[power user]]s, while occasional users would benefit most from SPSS and Stata.&lt;ref name="Acock"&gt;{{cite journal|pages=1093–1095|title=SAS, Stata, SPSS: A Comparison |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00196.x|volume=67|issue=4 |date=November 2005 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00196.x/full | last=Acock |first=Alan C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], gave similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/compare_packages.htm |title=Compare Packages |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitors such as [[Revolution Analytics]] and [[Alpine Data Labs]] advertise their products as considerably cheaper than SAS'. In a 2011 comparison, Doug Henschen of ''[[InformationWeek]]'' found that start-up fees for the three are similar, though he admitted that the starting fees were not necessarily the best basis for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/low-cost-options-for-predictive-analytics-challenge-sas-ibm/d/d-id/1099191?page_number=1 |title=Low-Cost Options For Predictive Analytics Challenge SAS, IBM|first=Dough |last=Henschen |work=InformationWeek|date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAS' business model is not weighted as heavily on initial fees for its programs, instead focusing on revenue from annual subscription fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SAS' revenue up 12% in 2011|work=The News &amp; Observer, |location= Raleigh, North Carolina |date=January 20, 2012 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/01/20/1790587/sas-revenue-up-12-in-2011.html|last=Ranii|first=David |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoftBus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turchin|first=Brian|title=SAS Profile -- Going Its Own Way|url=http://www.cabnr.unr.edu/gf/apst650/sassoftbusiness.pdf|publisher=Software Business Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SMP - Symmetric Multiprocessor System.svg|thumb|upright=2|Diagram of a symmetric multiprocessing system]]
'''Symmetric multiprocessing''' ('''SMP''') involves a [[multiprocessor]] computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared [[main memory]], have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes. Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of [[multi-core processor]]s, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.

Professor John D. Kubiatowicz considers traditionally SMP systems to contain processors without caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://parlab.eecs.berkeley.edu/2013bootcampagenda|conference=2013 Short Course on Parallel Programming|author=John Kubiatowicz|title=Introduction to Parallel Architectures and Pthreads}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culler and Pal-Singh in their 1998 book "Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach" mention: "The term SMP is widely used but causes a bit of confusion. [...] The more precise description of what is intended by SMP is a shared memory multiprocessor where the cost of accessing a memory location is the same for all processors; that is, it has uniform access costs when the access actually is to memory. If the location is cached, the access will be faster. but cache access times and memory access times are the same on all processors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1558603431|author1=David Culler|authorlink1=David Culler|author2=Jaswinder Pal Singh|author3=Anoop Gupta|title=Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHfHC4Wf3K0C&amp;pg=PA32|page=47|year=1999|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMP systems are ''[[multiprocessing#Processor coupling|tightly coupled multiprocessor]] systems'' with a pool of homogeneous processors running independently of each other.  Each processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of data, has the capability of sharing common resources (memory, I/O device, interrupt system and so on) that are connected using a [[system bus]] or a [[crossbar switch|crossbar]].

SMP systems have centralized [[Shared memory architecture|shared memory]] called ''main memory'' (MM) operating under a single [[operating system]] with two or more homogeneous processors. Usually each processor has an associated private high-speed memory known as [[cache memory]] (or cache) to speed up the main memory data access and to reduce the system bus traffic.

Processors may be interconnected using buses, [[crossbar switch]]es or on-chip mesh networks. The bottleneck in the scalability of SMP using buses or crossbar switches is the bandwidth and power consumption of the interconnect among the various processors, the memory, and the disk arrays.  Mesh architectures avoid these bottlenecks, and provide nearly linear scalability to much higher processor counts at the sacrifice of programmability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Serious programming challenges remain with this kind of architecture because it requires two distinct modes of programming; one for the CPUs themselves and one for the interconnect between the CPUs. A single programming language would have to be able to not only partition the workload, but also comprehend the memory locality, which is severe in a mesh-based architecture.&lt;ref name="AutoMQ-1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

SMP systems allow any processor to work on any task no matter where the data for that task is located in memory, provided that each task in the system is not in execution on two or more processors at the same time. With proper [[operating system]] support, SMP systems can easily move tasks between processors to balance the workload efficiently.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=April 2013}}
The earliest production system with multiple identical processors was the Burroughs [[B5000]], which was functional around 1961. However at run-time this was [[Asymmetric multiprocessing#Burroughs B5000 and B5500|asymmetric]], with one processor restricted to application programs while the other processor mainly handled the operating system and hardware interrupts.  The Burroughs D825 first implemented SMP in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/Parallel.html|title=The History of the Development of Parallel Computing|author=Gregory V.

Other software developed at universities, notably the [[Michigan Terminal System]] (MTS), used both CPUs. Both processors could access data channels and initiate I/O.  In OS/360 M65MP, peripherals could generally be attached to either processor since the operating system kernel ran on both processors (though with a "big lock" around the I/O handler).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/os/R21.7_Apr73/plm/GY28-6616-9_OS_IO_Superv_PLM_R21.7_Apr73.pdf |title=Program Logic Manual, OS I/O Supervisor Logic, Release 21 (R21.7) |publisher=IBM |id=GY28-6616-9 |edition=Tenth |date=April 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MTS supervisor (UMMPS) has the ability to run on both CPUs of the IBM System/360 model 67-2.

Other mainframes that supported SMP included the [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series#1108|UNIVAC 1108 II]], released in 1965, which supported up to three CPUs, and the [[GE-600 series|GE-635 and GE-645]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ge/GE-6xx/CPB-371A_GE-635_System_Man_Jul64.pdf|title=GE-635 System Manual|date=July 1964|publisher=[[General Electric]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ge/GE-645/GE-645_SystemMan_Jan68.pdf|title=GE-645 System Manual|date=January 1968|publisher=General Electric}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[GECOS]] on multiprocessor GE-635 systems ran in a master-slave asymmetric fashion, unlike [[Multics]] on multiprocessor GE-645 systems, which ran in a symmetric fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.computers/v-hkdKaPTXc/MX7UI3DgOokJ|title=Fear of Multiprocessing?|author=Richard Shetron|date=May 5, 1998|newsgroup=alt.folklore.computers|message-id=354e95a9.0@news.wizvax.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with its version 7.0 (1972), [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s operating system [[TOPS-10]] implemented the SMP feature, the earliest system running SMP was the [[PDP-10|DECSystem 1077]] dual KI10 processor system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/10periphs DEC 1077 and SMP]&lt;/ref&gt; Later KL10 system could aggregate up to 8 CPUs in a SMP manner. In contrast, DECs first multi-processor [[VAX]] system, the VAX-11/782, was asymmetric,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/vax/EG-21731-18_VAX_Product_Sales_Guide_Apr82.pdf VAX Product Sales Guide, pages 1-23 and 1-24]: the VAX-11/782 is described as an asymmetric multiprocessing system in 1982&lt;/ref&gt; but later VAX multiprocessor systems were SMP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/vax/8800/EK-8840H-UG-001_88xx_System_Hardware_Users_Guide_Mar88.pdf VAX 8820/8830/8840 System Hardware User's Guide]: by 1988 the VAX operating system was SMP&lt;/ref&gt;

Early commercial Unix SMP implementations included the [[Sequent Computer Systems]] Balance 8000 (released in 1984) and Balance 21000 (released in 1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Hockney |first1 = R.W. |last2 = Jesshope |first2 = C.R. |title = Parallel Computers 2: Architecture, Programming and Algorithms |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis |year = 1988 | pages = 46 |isbn = 0-85274-811-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both models were based on 10&amp;nbsp;MHz [[National Semiconductor]] [[NS320xx|NS32032]] processors, each with a small write-through cache connected to a common memory to form a [[Shared memory architecture|shared memory]] system.  Another early commercial Unix SMP implementation was the NUMA based Honeywell Information Systems Italy XPS-100 designed by Dan Gielan of VAST Corporation in 1985. Its design supported up to 14 processors, but due to electrical limitations, the largest marketed version was a dual processor system.  The operating system was derived and ported by VAST Corporation from AT&amp;T 3B20 Unix SysVr3 code used internally within AT&amp;T.

Earlier non-commercial multiprocessing UNIX ports existed, including a port named MUNIX created at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] by 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36714194.pdf|title=MUNIX, A Multiprocessing Version Of UNIX|last=Hawley|first=John Alfred|date=June 1975|website=core.ac.uk|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Uses ==
[[Time-sharing]] and [[server (computing)|server]] systems can often use SMP without changes to applications, as they may have multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] running in parallel, and a system with more than one process running can run different processes on different processors.

On [[personal computer]]s, SMP is less useful for applications that have not been modified.  If the system rarely runs more than one process at a time, SMP is useful only for applications that have been modified for [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] (multitasked) processing.  Custom-programmed [[software]] can be written or modified to use multiple threads, so that it can make use of multiple processors.

Multithreaded programs can also be used in time-sharing and server systems that support multithreading, allowing them to make more use of multiple processors.

== Advantages/Disadvantages ==

In SMP, all of the processors are tightly coupled inside the same box with a bus or switch.  Some of the components that are shared are global memory, disks, and I/O devices.  Only one copy of an OS runs on all the processors, and the OS must be designed to take advantage of this architecture.  Some of the basic advantages involves cost-effective ways to increase throughput.  To solve different problems and tasks, SMP applies multiple processors to that one problem, known as [[parallel programming]].

However, there are a few limits on the scalability of SMP due to [[cache coherence]] and shared objects.

== Programming ==

Uniprocessor and SMP systems require different programming methods to achieve maximum performance. Programs running on SMP systems may experience an increase in performance even when they have been written for uniprocessor systems. This is because hardware [[interrupts]] usually suspends program execution while the [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] that handles them can execute on an idle processor instead. The effect in most applications (e.g. games) is not so much a performance increase as the appearance that the program is running much more smoothly. Some applications, particularly building software and some [[distributed computing]] projects, run faster by a factor of (nearly) the number of additional processors.  (Compilers by themselves are single threaded, but, when building a software project with multiple compilation units, if each compilation unit is handled independently, this creates an [[embarrassingly parallel]] situation across the entire multi-compilation-unit project, allowing near linear scaling of compilation time. Distributed computing projects are inherently parallel by design.)

Systems programmers must build support for SMP into the [[operating system]], otherwise, the additional processors remain idle and the system functions as a uniprocessor system.

SMP systems can also lead to more complexity regarding instruction sets. A homogeneous processor system typically requires extra registers for "special instructions" such as SIMD (MMX, SSE, etc.), while a heterogeneous system can implement different types of hardware for different instructions/uses.

== Performance ==

When more than one program executes at the same time, an SMP system has considerably better performance than a uni-processor, because different programs can run on different CPUs simultaneously.  Similarly, [[Asymmetric multiprocessing]] (AMP) usually allows only one processor to run a program or task at a time.  For example, AMP can be used in assigning specific tasks to CPU based to priority and importance of task completion.  AMP was created well before SMP in terms of handling multiple CPUs, which explains the lack of performance based on the example provided.

In cases where an SMP environment processes many jobs, administrators often experience a loss of hardware efficiency. Software programs have been developed to schedule jobs and other functions of the computer so that the processor utilization reaches its maximum potential. Good software packages can achieve this maximum potential by scheduling each CPU separately, as well as being able to integrate multiple SMP machines and clusters.

Access to RAM is serialized; this and [[cache coherency]] issues causes performance to lag slightly behind the number of additional processors in the system.

== Alternatives ==

[[Image:Shared memory.svg|right|350px|thumb|Diagram of a typical SMP system. Three processors are connected to the same memory module through a [[system bus]] or [[crossbar switch]] ]]

SMP uses a single shared [[system bus]] that represents one of the earliest styles of multiprocessor machine architectures, typically used for building smaller computers with up to 8 processors.

Larger computer systems might use newer architectures such as [[Non-Uniform Memory Access|NUMA]] (Non-Uniform Memory Access), which dedicates different memory banks to different processors.  In a NUMA architecture, processors may access local memory quickly and remote memory more slowly.  This can dramatically improve memory throughput as long as the data are localized to specific processes (and thus processors). On the downside, NUMA makes the cost of moving data from one processor to another, as in workload balancing, more expensive. The benefits of NUMA are limited to particular workloads, notably on [[Server (computing)|server]]s where the data are often associated strongly with certain tasks or users.

Finally, there is [[computer cluster]]ed multiprocessing (such as [[Beowulf (computing)|Beowulf]]), in which not all memory is available to all processors. Clustering techniques are used fairly extensively to build very large supercomputers.

== Variable SMP ==
{{POV section|talk=Undue weight on vSMP|date=August 2017}}

Variable Symmetric Multiprocessing (vSMP) is a specific mobile use case technology initiated by NVIDIA. This technology includes an extra fifth core in a quad-core device, called the Companion core, built specifically for executing tasks at a lower frequency during mobile active standby mode, video playback, and music playback.

Project Kal-El ([[Tegra 3]]),&lt;ref name="AutoMQ-4" /&gt; patented by NVIDIA, was the first SoC (System on Chip) to implement this new vSMP technology. This technology not only reduces mobile power consumption during active standby state, but also maximizes quad core performance during active usage for intensive mobile applications. Overall this technology addresses the need for increase in battery life performance during active and standby usage by reducing the power consumption in mobile processors.

Unlike current SMP architectures, the vSMP Companion core is OS transparent meaning that the operating system and the running applications are totally unaware of this extra core but are still able to take advantage of it. Some of the advantages of the vSMP architecture includes cache coherency, OS efficiency, and power optimization. The advantages for this architecture are explained below:

*Cache Coherency: There are no consequences for synchronizing caches between cores running at different frequencies since vSMP does not allow the Companion core and the main cores to run simultaneously.
*OS Efficiency: It is inefficient when multiple CPU cores are run at different asynchronous frequencies because this could lead to possible scheduling issues.{{How|date=August 2017}} With vSMP, the active CPU cores will run at similar frequencies to optimize OS scheduling.
*Power Optimization: In asynchronous clocking based architecture, each core is on a different power plane to handle voltage adjustments for different operating frequencies. The result of this could impact performance.{{How|date=August 2017}} vSMP technology is able to dynamically enable and disable certain cores for active and standby usage, reducing overall power consumption.

These advantages lead the vSMP architecture to considerably benefit{{Peacock inline|date=August 2017}} over other architectures using asynchronous clocking technologies.

The '''Systems Nuclear Auxiliary POWER''' ('''SNAP''') program was a program of experimental [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs) and space [[nuclear reactor]]s flown during the 1960s by [[NASA]].

[[File:SNAP-27 on the Moon.jpg|thumb|SNAP-27 on the Moon.]]
Five SNAP-27 units provided electric power for the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package]]s (ALSEP) left on the Moon by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 14|14]], [[Apollo 15|15]], [[Apollo 16|16]], and [[Apollo 17|17]]. The fuel capsule, containing {{convert|3.8|kg|lb}} of [[plutonium-238]] in oxide form (44,500&amp;nbsp;[[curie|Ci]] or 1.65&amp;nbsp;[[petabecquerel|PBq]]), was carried to the Moon in a separate fuel cask attached to the side of the [[Lunar Module]]. The fuel cask provided thermal insulation and added structural support to the fuel capsule. On the Moon, the Lunar Module pilot removed the fuel capsule from the cask and inserted it in the RTG.

These stations transmitted information about [[moonquake]]s and meteor impacts, lunar magnetic and gravitational fields, the Moon's internal temperature, and the Moon's atmosphere for several years after the missions. After ten years, a SNAP-27 still produced more than 90% of its initial output of 70&amp;nbsp;watts.

The fuel cask from the SNAP-27 unit carried by the [[Apollo 13]] mission currently lies in {{convert|20000|ft|m}} of water at the bottom of the [[Tonga Trench]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This mission failed to land on the moon, and the [[lunar module]] carrying its generator burnt up during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, with the trajectory arranged so that the cask would land in the trench. The cask survived re-entry, as it was designed to do,&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.alsepoff.html Apollo 12 ALSEP Off-load transcript], containing comment about re-entry survivability of fuel cask&lt;/ref&gt; and no release of plutonium has been detected.

==Even-numbered SNAPs: compact nuclear reactors==
[[Image:SNAP 8DR core asembly.jpg|thumb|250px|right| Assembly of the SNAP 8 DR nuclear reactor core.]]
A series of compact nuclear reactors primarily developed for the U.S. government by the [[Atomics International]] division of [[North American Aviation]].

===SNAP Experimental Reactor (SER)===

The SNAP Experimental Reactor (SER) was the first reactor to be built by the specifications established for space satellite applications. The SER used uranium zirconium hydride as the fuel and [[eutectic]] sodium-potassium alloy ([[NaK]]) as the coolant and operated at approximately 50&amp;nbsp;kW thermal. The system did not have a power conversion but used a secondary heat air blast system to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. The SER used a similar reactor reflector moderator device as the [[SNAP-10A]] but with only one reflector. Criticality was achieved in September 1959 with final shutdown completed in December 1961. The project was considered a success. It gave continued confidence in the development of the SNAP Program and it also led to in depth research and component development.

===SNAP-2===

The SNAP-2 Developmental Reactor was the second SNAP reactor built. This device used Uranium-zirconium hydride fuel and had a design reactor power of 55&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. It was the first model to use a flight control assembly and was tested from April 1961 to December 1962. The basic concept was that nuclear power would be a long term source of energy for manned space capsules. However, the crew capsule had to be shielded from deadly radiation streaming from the nuclear reactor. Surrounding the reactor with a radiation shield was out of the question. It would be far too heavy to launch with the rockets available at that time. To protect the "crew" and "payload", the SNAP-2 system used a "shadow shield". The shield was a truncated cone containing lithium hydride. The reactor was at the small end and the crew capsule/payload was in the shadow of the large end. 

Studies were performed on the reactor, individual components and the support system. Atomics International, a division of North American Aviation did the development and testing work. The SNAP-2 Shield Development unit was responsible for developing the radiation shield. Creating the shield meant melting lithium hydride and casting it into the form required. The form was a big truncated cone. Molten lithium hydride had to be poured into the casting mold a little at a time otherwise it would crack as it cooled and solidified. Cracks in the shield material would be fatal to any space crew or payload depending on it because it would allow radiation to stream through to the crew/payload compartment. As the material cooled, it would form kind of a hollowed vortex in the middle. The development engineers had to create ways to fill the vortex while maintaining the shield’s integrity. And, in doing all this they had to keep in mind that they were working with a material that could be explosively unstable in a moist oxygen rich environment. Analysis also revealed that under thermal and radiation gradients, the lithium hydride could disassociate and hydrogen ions could migrate through the shield. This would produce variations of shielding efficacy and could subject the payloads to intense radiation. Efforts were made to mitigate these effects.

The SNAP 2DR used a similar reactor reflector moderator device as the [[SNAP-10A]] but with two movable and internal fixed reflectors. The system was designed so that the reactor could be integrated with a mercury Rankine cycle to generate 3.5&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity.

===SNAP-8===

The SNAP-8 reactors were designed, constructed and operated by Atomics International under contract with the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Two SNAP-8 reactors were produced: The SNAP 8 Experimental Reactor and the SNAP 8 Developmental Reactor. Both SNAP 8 reactors used the same highly enriched uranium zirconium hydride fuel as the SNAP 2 and SNAP 10A reactors. The SNAP 8 design included primary and secondary NaK loops to transfer heat to the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[Rankine cycle|rankine]] power conversion system. The electrical generating system for the SNAP 8 reactors was supplied by [[Aerojet General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Aerojet General Corporation | title = SNAP-8 Electrical generating system development program | publisher = NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio | date = November 1971 | id = NASA CR-1907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SNAP 8 Experimental Reactor was a 600&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; reactor that was tested from 1963 to 1965.
 
The SNAP 8 Developmental Reactor had a reactor core measuring {{convert|9.5|by|33|in|cm}}, contained a total of {{convert|18|lb|kg}} of fuel, had a power rating of 1&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. The reactor was tested in 1969 at the [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Voss"&gt;{{cite book | last = Voss | first = Susan | title = SNAP Reactor Overview |url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a146831.pdf | publisher = U.S. Air Force Weapons Laboratory |place= Kirtland AFB, New Mexico | date = August 1984 | id = AFWL-TN-84-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SNAP-10A===

The [[SNAP-10A]] was a space-qualified nuclear reactor power system. It was built as a research project for the Air Force, to demonstrate the capability to generate higher power than RTGs. The reactor employed two moveable beryllium reflectors for control, and generated 35&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; at beginning of life.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The system generated electricity by circulating NaK around lead tellurium thermocouples. To mitigate launch hazards, the reactor was never started until it reached a safe orbit. It was launched into earth orbit in April, 1965, and used to power an [[RM-81 Agena#Agena-D|Agena-D]] research satellite, built by Lockheed/Martin. The system produced 500W of electrical power during an abbreviated 43-day flight test. The reactor was prematurely shut down by a faulty command receiver. It is predicted to remain in orbit for 4,000 years.&lt;ref name="Voss"/&gt;

{{Wide image|TabStopLibreOff.png|1241px|A ruler depicting tab stops in a word processor|400px|right}}
A '''tab stop''' on a [[typewriter]] is a location where the carriage movement is halted by an adjustable end stop. Tab stops are set manually, and pressing the [[tab key]] causes the carriage to go to the next tab stop. In [[text editor]]s on a computer, the same concept is implemented simplistically with automatic, fixed tab stops.

Modern [[word processor]]s generalize this concept by offering tab stops that have an alignment attribute and cause the text to be automatically aligned at left, at right or center of the tab stop itself. Such tab stops are [[paragraph]]-specific properties and can be moved to a different location in any moment, or even removed.

== Types of tab stops ==
A tab stop is a horizontal position which is set for placing and aligning text on a page. There are at least five kinds of tab stops in general usage in word processing or in MS Word.

;Left: text extends to the right from the tab stop.
;Center:  text is centered at the tab stop.
;Right: text extends to the left from the tab stop until the tab's space is filled, and then  the text extends to the right.
;Decimal: text before the decimal point extends to the left, and text after the decimal point extends to the right.
;Bar: a vertical line at the specified position on each line in a document.

== Elastic tab stops ==
{{anchor|Elastic tab stops}}
[[File:Elastictabstops animation.gif|thumb|Elastic tab stops in action|This animation shows how elastic tab stops keep several lines of text aligned when one line is edited. Text between tabs is shown as different colored blocks.]]

Elastic tab stops were invented by Nick Gravgaard in 2006 as an alternative way to handle tab stops in digital text files with a primary focus on editing [[source code]].&lt;ref name="elastic"&gt;[http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/ Elastic tabstops]&lt;/ref&gt; This means users need just one tab character between columns rather than inserting the exact number of spaces or fixed tabs on each line to make text line up. Unlike fixed tab stops, they automatically keep columns aligned, making them useful for viewing or editing tab-delimited text. When text is edited, tab stops on adjacent lines above and below the "cell" that is being changed are automatically moved to fit the widest cell of text in that column.

Elastic tab stops have been implemented in places such as [[Visual Studio]] as an extension,&lt;ref name="alwaysaligned"&gt;[https://www.alwaysaligned.net Always Aligned] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005141155/http://www.alwaysaligned.net/ |date=2017-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Go (programming language)|Go]]'s tabwriter package&lt;ref name="tabwriter"&gt;[[Go (programming language)]] [http://golang.org/pkg/tabwriter/ tabwriter package]&lt;/ref&gt; used by the &lt;code&gt;go fmt&lt;/code&gt; command.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25229">'''Unified English Braille Code''' ('''UEBC''', formerly '''UBC''', now usually simply '''UEB''') is an [[English language]] [[Braille|Braille code]] standard, developed to permit representing the wide variety of literary and technical material in use in the [[English-speaking world]] today, in uniform fashion.

==Background on why the new encoding standard was developed==
Standard [[Braille cell|6-dot braille]] only [[Provides material support to further terrorist activity|provides]] 63 distinct characters (not including the [[space character]]), and thus, over the years a number of distinct rule-sets have been developed to represent literary text, mathematics, scientific material, computer software, the [[@]] symbol used in email addresses, and other varieties of written material.  Different countries also used differing encodings at various times:  during the 1800s [[American Braille]] competed with [[English Braille]], in the [[New York Point|War of the Dots]].  As a result of the expanding need to represent technical symbolism, and divergence during the past 100 years across countries, braille users who desired to read or write a large range of material have needed to learn different sets of rules, depending on what kind of material they were reading at a given time.  Rules for a particular type of material were often not compatible from one system to the next (the rule-sets for literary/mathematical/computerized encoding-areas were sometimes conflicting—and of course differing approaches to encoding mathematics were not compatible with each other), so the reader would need to be notified as the text in a book moved from computer braille code for programming to [[Nemeth Braille|Nemeth Code]] for mathematics to standard literary braille.  Moreover, the braille rule-set used for math and computer science topics, and even to an extent braille for literary purposes, differed among various English-speaking countries.

==Overview of the goals of UEB==
Unified English Braille is intended to develop one set of rules, the same everywhere in the world, which could be applied across various types of English-language material.  The notable exception to this unification is [[Music Braille]], which UEB specifically does not encompass, because it is already well-standardized internationally.  Unified English Braille is designed to be readily understood by people familiar with the literary braille (used in standard prose writing), while also including support for specialized math and science symbols, computer-related symbols (the @ sign&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brailleauthority.org/ueb/overview_changes_ebae_ueb.html|title=Overview of Changes|website=BrailleAuthority.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more specialised programming-language syntax), foreign alphabets, and visual effects (bullets, bold type, accent marks, and so on).

According to the original&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brailleauthority.org/ueb/index.html|title=Untitled Document|website=BrailleAuthority.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1991 specification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iceb.org/cranem.html|title=A Uniform Braille Code|last1=Cranmer|last2=Nemeth)|website=ICEB.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; for UEB, the goals were:

: 1.  simplify and unify the system of braille used for encoding [[English language|English]], reducing community-fragmentation
: 2.  reduce the overall number of official coding systems, which currently include:
::	a.  literary code (since 1933, [[English Braille]] Grade 2 has been the main component)
:::		i.  [[BANA]] flavor used in North America, et cetera
:::		ii. [[BAUK]] flavor used in United Kingdom, etc.
::	b.  [[Textbook Formats and Techniques]] code
::	c.  math-notation and science-notation codes
:::		i. [[Nemeth Code]] (since 1952, in North America and several other countries)
:::		ii.  modern variants of Taylor Code, a subset of literary code (since 18xx, standard elsewhere, alternative in North America)
:::		iii. Extended Nemeth Code With [[Chemistry]] Module
:::		iv.  Extended Nemeth Code With Ancient [[Numeration]] Module
:::		v. Mathematical [[Diagrams]] Module (not actually associated with any particular coding-system)
::	d.  [[Computer Braille Code]] (since the 1980s{{When|date=July 2013}}, for special characters)
:::		i. the basic CBC
:::		ii.  CBC With [[Flowchart]] Module
::	e.  [[Braille music|Braille Music Code]] (since [[1829 braille|1829]], last upgraded/unified [[Braille music#Variations in Braille music|1997]], used for vocals and [[instrumentals]]—this one explicitly ''not'' to be unified nor eliminated)
::	f.  [added later{{When|date=July 2013}}] [[IPA Braille]] code (used for [[phonetic]] transcriptions—this one did not yet exist in 1991)
: 3.  if possible, unify the literary-code used across English-speaking countries
: 4.  where it is not possible to reduce the number of coding systems, reduce conflicts
::	a.  most especially, rule-conflicts (which make the codes incompatible at a "software" level—in human brains and computer algorithms)
::	b.  symbol conflicts, for example, the characters "$", "%", "]", and "[" are all represented differently in the various code systems
::	c.  sometimes the official coding-systems themselves are not explicitly in conflict, but [[ambiguity]] in their rules can lead to accidental conflicts
: 5.  the overall goal of steps 1 to 4 above is to make acquisition of reading, writing, and teaching skill in the use of braille quicker, easier, and more efficient
: 6.  this in turn will help reverse the trend of steadily eroding usage of Braille itself (which is being replaced by electronics and/or illiteracy)
: 7.  besides those practical goals, it is also desired that braille—as a writing system—have the properties required for long-term success:
::	a.  universal, with no special code-system for particular subject-matter, no special-purpose "modules", and no serious disagreements about how to encode English
::	b.  coherent, with no internal conflicts, and thus no need for authoritative fiat to "resolve" such conflicts by picking winners and losers
::	c.  ease of use, with dramatically less need for braille-coding-specific lessons, certifications, workshops, literature, etc.
::	d.  uniform yet extensible, with symbol-assignment giving an unvarying identity-relationship, and new symbols possible without conflicts or overhauls
: 8.  philosophically, an additional goal is to upgrade the braille system to be practical for employment in a [[workplace]], not just for reading recreational and religious texts
::	a.  computer-friendly (braille-production on modern [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] and braille-consumption via computerized [[file formats]]—see also [[Braille e-book]] which did not really exist back in 1990)
::	b.  tech-writing-friendly (straightforward handling of [[notations]] used in [[math]]/[[science]]/[[medical]]/[[Computer programming|programming]]/[[engineering]]/similar)
:: 	c.  precise bidirectional representation (both #8a and #8b can be largely satisfied by a precision [[writing system]]…but the existing braille systems as of 1990 were ''not'' fully precise, replacing symbols with words, converting unit-systems, altering punctuation, and so on)
: 9.  upgrades to existing braille-codes are required, and then these modified codes can be merged into a unified code (preferably singular plus the music-code)

Some goals were specially and explicitly called out as key objectives, not all of which are mentioned above:
*	objective#A = precise bidirectional representation of printed-text (see #8c)
*	objective#B = maximizing the usefulness of braille's limited formatting mechanisms in systematic fashion (so that readers can quickly and easily locate the information they are seeking)
*	objective#C = unifying the rule-systems and symbol-assignments for all subject-matters except musical notation, to eliminate 'unlearning' (#9 / #2 / #3)
*	objective#D = [[Context-dependence|context-independent]] encoding (symbols must be transcribable in straightforward fashion—without regard to their English meaning)
*	objective#E = [[Markup language|markup]] or mode-switching ability (to clearly distinguish between information from the printed version, versus [[transcriber]] commentary)
*	objective#F = easy-to-memorize symbol-assignments (to make learning the coding system easier—and also facilitate reading of relatively rare symbols) (see #7c / #5 / #1)
*	objective#G = [[extensible]] coding-system (with the possibility of introducing new symbols in a non-conflicting and systematic manner) (see #7d)
*	objective#H = [[algorithm]]ic representation and deterministic rule-set (texts are amenable to automatic computerized [[translation]] from braille to print—and vice versa) (see #8a)
*	objective#I = [[backward compatibility]] with English Braille Grade 2 (someone reading regular words and sentences will hardly notice any modifications)
*	objective#J = reverse the steadily declining trend of braille-usage (as a statistical percentage of the blind-community), as soon as possible (see #6)

Goals which were specifically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of the UEB upgrade process were the ability to handle languages outside the [[Roman alphabet]] (cf. the various national variants of ASCII in the [[ISO 8859]] series versus the modern pan-universal [[Unicode]] standard, which governs how writing systems are encoded for computerized use).

==History of specification and adoption of UEB==
Work on UEB formally began in 1991,&lt;ref name="acb.org"&gt;http://www.acb.org/magazine/2001/bf092001.html#bf06 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030053019/http://www.acb.org/magazine/2001/bf092001.html#bf06 |date=2012-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and preliminary draft standard was published in March 1995 (as UBC),&lt;ref&gt;http://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs_ubc.html&lt;/ref&gt; then upgraded several times thereafter. Unified English Braille (UEB) was originally known as Unified Braille Code (UBC), with the English-specific nature being implied, but later{{When|date=July 2013}} the word "English" was formally incorporated into its name—Unified English Braille Code (UEBC)—and still more recently{{When|date=July 2013}} it has come to be called Unified English Braille (UEB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Braille Code for All English-Speaking Peoples of the World|url=http://www.iceb.org/ubc.html|publisher=International Council on English Braille|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2004, the [[International Council on English Braille]] (ICEB) gave the go-ahead for the unification of various English braille codes. This decision was reached following 13 years of analysis, research, and debate. ICEB said that Unified English Braille was sufficiently complete for recognition as an international standard for English braille, which the seven ICEB member-countries could consider for adoption as their national code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Light for Unified English Braille|url=http://www.iceb.org/ganew04.html|publisher=International Council on English Braille|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unified English Braille (UEB)|url=http://www.e-bility.com/roundtable/aba/ueb.php|publisher=Australian Braille Authority|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa adopted the UEB almost immediately (in May 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEB in South Africa|url=http://www.e-bility.com/roundtable/downloads/aba/abaUEBsouthafrica.doc|publisher=Australian Braille Authority|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). During the following year, the standard was adopted by Nigeria (February 5, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Braille Council of Nigeria votes to accept the Unified English Braille Code (UEB) for future implementation in Nigeria|url=http://www.e-bility.com/roundtable/downloads/aba/abaUEBnigeria.doc|publisher=Australian Braille Authority|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Australia (May 14, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution regarding Unified English Braille passed by the Australian Braille Authority May 2005|url=http://www.e-bility.com/roundtable/downloads/aba/abaUEBresolutionMay2005.doc|publisher=Australian Braille Authority|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and New Zealand (November 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Trust|url=http://www.banzat.org.nz/AboutTheTrust.htm|publisher=The Braille Authority of New Zealand Aotearoa Trust|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On April 24, 2010, the Canadian Braille Authority (CBA) voted to adopt UEB, making Canada the fifth nation to adopt UEB officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=News |url=http://www.canadianbrailleauthority.ca/en/index.php |publisher=Canadian Braille Authority|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 2011, the UK Association for Accessible Formats voted to adopt UEB as the preferred{{Clarify|date=July 2013}} code in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Association for Accessible Formats adopts UEB as the braille code for the UK |url=http://spevi.net/spevi/files/UKAAFPressRelease.doc |publisher=UK Association for Accessible Formats |accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 2, 2012 the [[Braille Authority of North America]] (BANA) became the sixth of the seven member-countries of the ICEB to officially adopt the UEB.&lt;ref name="bana-adopts-ueb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brailleauthority.org/pressreleases/pr-2012november.html |title=BANA Adopts UEB |date=November 2012 |publisher=[[Braille Authority of North America]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over math-notation in UEB==
The major criticism against UEB is that it fails to handle [[mathematics]] or computer science as compactly as codes designed to be optimal for those disciplines.  Besides requiring more space to represent and more time to read and write, the verbosity of UEB can make learning mathematics more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unifiedbrailleforall.com/presentation-by-maylene-bird/|title=unifiedbrailleforall.com - unifiedbrailleforall Resources and Information.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nemeth Braille]], officially used in the United States since 1952,&lt;ref name="nfb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/fr/fr28/fr280110.htm|title=The History of the Nemeth Code: An Interview with Dr. Abraham Nemeth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2002 the de facto standard&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/notices/200210/comm-morin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for teaching and doing mathematics in braille in the USA, was specifically invented&lt;ref name="nfb.org"/&gt; to correct the cumbersomeness of doing mathematics in braille.  However, although the Nemeth encoding standard was officially adopted by the JUTC of the USA and the UK in the 1950s, in practice only the USA switched their mathematical braille to the Nemeth system, whereas the UK continued to use the traditional [[Henry Martyn Taylor]] coding (not to be confused with [[Hudson Taylor]] who was involved with the use of [[Moon type|Moon Type]] for the blind in China during the 1800s) for their braille mathematics.  Programmers in the United States who write their programming codefiles in braille—as opposed to in ASCII text with use of a screenreader for example—tend to use Nemeth-syntax numerals, whereas programmers in the UK use yet another system (not Taylor-numerals and not literary-numerals).&lt;ref&gt;http://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs_seb.html&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dotlessbraille.org/ueb.htm|title=Unified English Braille|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Nemeth Braille]] compared to Taylor (and UEB which uses an upgraded version of the Taylor encoding for math) is that Nemeth uses [[Nemeth Braille#Number Signs|"down-shifted" numerals]] from the [[Braille#Derivation|fifth decade]] of the Braille alphabet (overwriting various [[Braille#Punctuation|punctuation characters]]), whereas UEB/Taylor uses the traditional 1800s approach with [[English Braille#Formatting marks|"up-shifted" numerals]] from the first decade of the (English) Braille alphabet (overwriting [[English Braille#System|the first ten letters]], namely ABCDEFGHIJ).  Traditional 1800s Braille, and also UEB, require insertion of numeral-prefixes when speaking of numerals, which makes representing some mathematical equations 42% more verbose.&lt;ref name="acb.org"/&gt;  As an alternative to UEB, there were proposals in 2001&lt;ref name="acb.org"/&gt; and 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braille2000.com/brl2000/nubs.htm|title=NUBS Documents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently these were the subject of various technical workshops during 2012.&lt;ref name="unifiedbrailleforall.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unifiedbrailleforall.com/presentation-by-christopher-gray/|title=unifiedbrailleforall.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although UEB adopts some features of Nemeth, the final version of UEB mandates up-shifted numerals,&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org"/&gt; which are the heart of the controversy.  According to [[BANA]], which adopted UEB in 2012, the official braille codes for the USA will be UEB and [[Nemeth Braille]] (as well as Music Braille for vocals and instrumentals plus IPA Braille for phonetic linguistics),&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brailleauthority.org/pressreleases/pr-2012november.html|title=BANA Adopts UEB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the use of contradictory representation of numerals and arithmetical symbols in the UEB and Nemeth encodings.  Thus, although UEB has officially been adopted in most English-speaking ICEB member-countries, in the USA (and possibly the UK where UEB is only the "preferred" system) the new encoding is not to be the sole encoding.

Another proposed braille-notation for encoding math is GS8/GS6, which was specifically invented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/TECH/9511/new_braille/index.html|title=CNN - Blind physicist creates better Braille - Nov 9, 1995|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1990s as an attempt to get rid of the "up-shifted" numerals used in UEB—see [[Gardner–Salinas Braille]].  GS6 implements "extra-dot" numerals&lt;ref&gt;http://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs_numbers.html&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[English Braille#System|fourth decade]] of the English Braille alphabet (overwriting various [[English Braille#System|two-letter ligatures]]).  GS8 expands the braille-cell from 2×3 dots to 2×4 dots, quadrupling the available codepoints from the traditional 64 up to 256, but in GS8 the numerals are still represented in the same way as in GS6 (albeit with a couple unused dot-positions at the bottom).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner–Salinas Braille#Digits]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to give the numerals their own distinct position in Braille are not new: the original 1829 specification by Louis Braille [[1829 braille|gave the numerals their own distinct symbols]], with the modern digraph-based literary-braille approach mentioned as an optional fallback.  However, after trying the system out in the classroom, the dashes used in the numerals—as well as several other rows of special characters—were found to be too difficult to distinguish from dot-pairs, and thus the typical digraph-based numerals became the official standard in 1837.

==Implementation of UEB in English-speaking countries==
As of 2013, with the majority of English-speaking ICEB member-countries having officially adopted UEB, there remain barriers&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brailleauthority.org/ueb/considerations.html|title=Considerations and Impact|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to implementation&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brailleauthority.org/ueb/actions_and_opportunities.html|title=Planning the Transition to UEB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deployment.  Besides ICEB member-nations, there are also many other countries with blind citizens that [[List of countries by English-speaking population|teach and use English]]: India, Hong Kong/China, Pakistan, the Philippines, [[List of countries where English is an official language|and so on]].  Many of these countries use non-UEB math notation, for English-speaking countries specifically, versions of the Nemeth Code were widespread by 1990 (in the United States, Western Samoa, Canada including Quebec, New Zealand, Israel, Greece, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Lebanon) in contrast to the similar-to-UEB-but-not-identical Taylor notation in 1990 (used by the UK, Ireland, Australia, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Jordan, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Singapore, and Zimbabwe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chezdom.net/mathematicalbraillecodes/|title=chezdom.net » Braille Mathematical Notations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some countries in the Middle East used Nemeth and Taylor math-notations as of 1990, i.e. Iran and Saudi Arabia.  As of 2013, it is unclear whether the English-using blind populations of various ICEB and non-ICEB nations will move to adopt the UEB, and if so, at what rate. Beyond official adoption rates in schools and by individuals, there are other difficulties.  The vast majority{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} of existing Braille materials, both printed and electronic, are in non-UEB encodings.  Furthermore, other technologies that compete with braille are now ever-more-widely affordable ([[screen readers]] for electronic-text-to-speech, plus [[Optical character recognition|physical-pages-to-electronic-text]] software combined with high-resolution [[digital cameras]] and high-speed [[Automatic document feeder|document scanners]], and the increasing ubiquity of tablets/smartphones/PDAs/PCs). The percentage of blind children who are [[Braille literacy#Statistics|literate in braille]] is already declining—and even those who know some system tend not to know UEB, since that system is still very new. Still, as of 2012 many of the original goals for UEB have already been fully or partially accomplished:
* A unified literary code across most English-speaking countries (see separate section of this article on the adoption of UEB)
* Number of coding-subsystems reduced from five major and one minor (banaLiterary/baukLiteraryAndTaylor/textbook/nemeth/cbc + music/etc.) down to two major and two minor (uebLiterary/nemeth using formal codeswitching&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org3" /&gt; + music/ipa),&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org1"/&gt; plus the generality of the basic uebLiterary was increased to fully cover parentheses, math-symbols, emails, and websites.&lt;ref name=UEB-FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brailleauthority.org/ueb/ueb-faq.html|title=BANA file|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reasonable level of backward compatibility with the American style of English Braille (more time is required before the exact level of transitional pain can be pinpointed, but studies in Australia and the UK indicate&lt;ref name="brailleauthority.org2" /&gt; that braille users in the United States will also likely cope quite easily)
* Making braille more computer-friendly, especially in terms of translation and backtranslation of the encoding system&lt;ref name=UEB-FAQ /&gt;
* Fully extensible encoding system, where new symbols can be added without causing conflicts or requiring coding-overhauls&lt;ref name="unifiedbrailleforall.com" /&gt; Not all the symbol-duplications were eliminated (there are still at least two representations of the $ symbol for instance&lt;ref&gt;Contrast [http://brailleauthority.org/ueb/Guidelines_for_Technical_Material_2008-10.pdf page 12 definition versus page 13 example] and compare with [http://www.brailleauthority.org/mathscience/nemeth1972.pdf page 236] which follows the second style&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2016}}). Since there are still two major coding-systems for math-notation and other technical or scientific writing (Nemeth as an option in the United States versus the Taylor-style math-notation recently added&lt;ref name=UEB-FAQ /&gt; to uebLiterary that will likely be used in other countries), some rule conflicts remain, and braille users will be required to "unlearn" certain rules when switching. In the long run, whether these accomplishments will translate into broader goals, of reducing community fragmentation among English-speaking braille users, boosting the acquisition speed of reading/writing/teaching skill in the use of braille, and thereby preserving braille's status as a useful writing-system for the blind, as of 2013 remains to be seen.
