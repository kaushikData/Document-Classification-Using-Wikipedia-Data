[[File:Skolt mother.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[Skolts|Skolt Sámi mother]] with her child in a ''ǩiõtkâm'']]

'''Cradleboards''' ({{Lang-chy|pâhoešestôtse}}, {{lang-se|gietkka}}, {{lang-sms|ǩiõtkâm}}) are traditional protective baby-carriers used by many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in [[North America]] and throughout [[Sápmi|northern Scandinavia]] amongst the Sámi. There are a variety of styles of cradleboard, reflecting the diverse artisan practises of indigenous cultures. Some indigenous communities in North America still use cradleboards.

==''Structure''==
[[File:Tikinakan.jpg|thumb|Atikamekw cradleboard]]
Cradleboards are used for the first few months of an infant's life, when a portable carrier for the baby is a necessity. Some cradleboards are woven, as with the [[Apache]]. Woven cradleboards are made of willow, dogwood, tule, or cattail fibres. Wooden cradleboards are made by the [[Iroquois]] and [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]]. [[Navajo people|Navajo]] cradleboards are made with a [[Pinus ponderosa|Ponderosa pine]] frame with buckskin laces looped through the frame.&lt;ref name="Kavasch14"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kavasch, E. Barrie and Karen Baar|title=American Indian Healing Arts|year=1999|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0-553-37881-3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever materials are used to make cradleboards, they share certain structural elements. Cradleboards are built with a broad, firm protective frame for the infant's spine. A footrest is incorporated into the bottom of the cradleboard, as well as a rounded cover over the infant's head that arcs out from the cradleboard, similar to a canopy or a modern-day baby carriage hood. The purpose of this headpiece is to provide shade for the infant, since it could be covered with an animal skin, or a blanket in winter to protect against the elements in colder climates. The headpiece also provides extra head protection in case anything bumps against the cradleboard. Ornaments and sacred amulets are often attached to the headpiece as well, for example "beaded umbilical cord cases, and dream catchers or medicine wheels", to amuse and help the infant develop his or her eyesight.&lt;ref name="Kavasch15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kavasch, E. Barrie and Karen Baar|title=American Indian Healing Arts|year=1999|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0-553-37881-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inside of the cradleboard is padded with a lining of fresh plant fibres, such as [[sphagnum moss]], [[cattail]] down, or shredded bark from [[juniper]] or [[cliffrose]]. The lining serves as a [[disposable diaper]], although the Navajo could clean and reuse the lining made of shredded juniper or cliffrose bark. These plant fibres have antiseptic properties, and thus nurture healthy skin in the infant.&lt;ref name="Kavasch15"/&gt; The [[Ojibwe people|Chippewa]] tradition was to make a lining for the cradleboard usually from moss growing in [[cranberry]] marshes, which is smoked over a fire to kill insects, then rubbed and pulled to soften it. In cold weather, the infant's feet may be wrapped in rabbit skin with the fur facing inward. The moss lining is surrounded by a [[birch bark]] tray insert placed into the cradleboard, which could be removed for cleaning.&lt;ref name="Densmore 1929 49"&gt;{{cite book|last=Densmore|first=Frances| authorlink = Frances Densmore|title=Chippewa Customs|year=1929|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society Press]]|isbn=978-0-87351-142-1|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cradleboards have been used in cultures ranging from the sub-Arctic regions of present-day Canada, down to Mexico and Central America. In Arctic regions, cold weather does not make a cradleboard feasible for the infant's survival, and infants are carried by being placed in a sling worn under the mother's parka.&lt;ref name="Whiting, John Wesley Mayhew and Eleanor Hollenberg Chasdi 1994 114"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whiting, John Wesley Mayhew and Eleanor Hollenberg Chasdi|title=Culture and human development: the selected papers of John Whiting: Volume 6 of Publications of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43515-4|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cradleboards were widely used by indigenous people across present-day North America. Cradleboards are used by the [[Kickapoo people]] in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latorre, Felipe A. and Dolores L. Latorre Contributor Dolores L. Latorre|title=The Mexican Kickapoo Indians |year=1991|publisher=Dover Books|isbn=978-0-486-26742-5|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were used by [[Aztec]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aztec Cradleboard Figurine and Drawing (Object), in Children and Youth in History, Item #432|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/primary-sources/432|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Seri people]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandiegohistory.org/collection/davis/2010501132-t/|title=2010.50.1.132-t - San Diego History Center - San Diego, CA - Our City, Our Story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] communities as far south as [[Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Norman|title=Cuello: An Early Maya Community in Belize|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-11767-8|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In present-day South America, most indigenous cultures used slings or pouches, sometimes called a ''rebozo'', for carrying infants rather than cradleboards. Cradleboards were used in the southernmost part of the continent, however, in the [[Patagonia]] region.&lt;ref name="Whiting, John Wesley Mayhew and Eleanor Hollenberg Chasdi 1994 114"/&gt;

Cradleboards were used during periods when the infant's mother had to travel or otherwise be mobile for work, and needed to protect the infant. The cradleboard could be carried on the mother's back, using support from "tumplines", or "burden straps" that would wrap around her forehead, chest or shoulders; if she carried a pack as well as the cradleboard, the pack strap would go around her chest and the cradleboard strap would go around her forehead.&lt;ref name="Densmore 1929 49"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kavasch, E. Barrie and Karen Baar|title=American Indian Healing Arts|year=1999|publisher=Bantom Books|isbn=0-553-37881-3|pages=14–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cradleboard can also be stood up against a large tree or rock if the infant is small, or hung from a pole (as inside an Iroquois longhouse), or even hung from a sturdy tree branch. They were also used when longer travel was required, as the cradleboard could be attached to a horse for transportation.

In the southwest United States and northern Mexico, among cultures such as the [[Hopi people|Hopi]] and Apache, infants would spend most of their day and night in the cradleboard, being taken out of it for progressively longer periods, for up to five times per day. When the infant reaches the age when it can sit up unsupported, it is then gradually weaned from the use of the cradleboard, and spends progressively less time in it. At this time, the infant may use a second, larger cradleboard that replaces the first. By the time the infant is a year old and begins to walk, they are generally finished with cradleboard use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hrdlicka|first=Ales|title=Physiological and Medical Observations Among the Indians of Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-3837-7|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cradleboard use and its effect on mother-infant interaction has been studied in Navajo communities. It has been shown that cradleboard use has no significant negative effect on this development. In the first few months of infancy, cradleboards have a soothing effect on babies. After 6 months of age or more, infants begin to resist being placed in cradleboards more vigorously as they become more mobile, and they are often placed in the cradleboard with their arms and hands free, so that they can play with objects hung from the cradleboard for their amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chisholm, James S. and Cary Michael Carney|title=Navajo Infancy: An Ethological Study of Child Development|year=2009|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-202-36251-9|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental dysplasia of the hips==
Cradleboard use has been associated with increased incidence of [[developmental dysplasia of the hip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=5652776 |year=1968 |author1=Coleman |first1=S. S. |title=Congenital dysplasia of the hip in the Navajo infant |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research |volume=56 |pages=179–93 |doi=10.1097/00003086-196801000-00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-1618 |pmid=18166571 |title=Does Swaddling Influence Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=177–8 |year=2008 |last1=Mahan |first1=S.

This article is about the '''[[demographics|demographic]]''' features of the [[population]] '''of [[Liechtenstein]]''', including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Liechtenstein]] is the fourth smallest country of Europe, after the [[Vatican City]], [[Monaco]], and [[San Marino]]. Its population is primarily ethnic [[Alamanni|Alemannic]], although a third of its resident population are foreign nationals,&lt;ref name="llv.li"&gt;https://www.llv.li/files/as/bevolkerungsstatistik-30-juni-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[German language|German]] speakers from the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], [[Austria]], and the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]], other [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[Italians]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. Nationals are referred to by the plural: Liechtensteiners.

The official language is [[German language|German]]; most speak [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]], a [[German dialect]] highly divergent from [[Standard German]], but closely related to those dialects spoken in neighbouring regions. 
In [[Triesenberg]] a quite distinct dialect promoted by the municipality, is spoken. According to the 2000 census, 87.9% of the population is [[Christian]], of which 76% adhere to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, while about 7% are [[Protestant]]. The religious affiliation for most of the remainder is [[Islam]] - 4.8%, undeclared - 4.1%, and [[Irreligion|no religion]] - 2.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llv.li/llv-avw-statistik-volkszaehlung-auswertungen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229041515/http://www.llv.li/llv-avw-statistik-volkszaehlung-auswertungen |archivedate=2008-02-29 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy Types ==

=== Information Privacy ===
''Main article: [[Information privacy|Information Privacy]]''

In the context of digital privacy, [[information privacy]] is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to determine how their digital information, mainly that pertaining to [[personally identifiable information]], is collected and used. The [[European Union|EU]] has various [[Privacy law|laws]] that dictate how information may be collected and used by companies. Some of those laws are written to give agency to the preferences of individuals/consumers in how their data is used. In other places, like in the United States, [[privacy law]] is argued by some to be less developed in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uoltj2&amp;div=18&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Privacy Law in the United States, the EU and Canada: The Allure of the Middle Ground 2 University of Ottawa Law &amp; Technology Journal 2005|last=|first=|date=|website=heinonline.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By example, some legislation, or lack of, allows companies to self-regulate their collection and dissemination practices of consumer information. 

=== Communication Privacy ===
In the context of digital privacy, communication privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to communicate information digitally with the expectation that their communications are secure; meaning that messages and communications will only be accessible to the sender's original intended recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hung|first=Humphry|last2=Wong|first2=Y.H.|date=2009-05-22|title=Information transparency and digital privacy protection: are they mutually exclusive in the provision of e‐services?|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/08876040910955161|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1108/08876040910955161|issn=0887-6045}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, communications can be [[Secure communication|intercepted]] or delivered to other recipients without the sender's knowledge, in a multitude of ways. Communications can be intercepted directly through various hacking methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sushmitha|first=R.|date=|title=HACKING METHODS, TECHNIQUES AND THEIR PREVENTION|url=http://www.researchpublish.com/download.php?file=HACKING%20METHODS%20TECHNIQUES%20AND%20THEIR%20PREVENTION-256.pdf&amp;act=book|journal=International Journal of Computer SCience and INformation Technology Research|volume=Vol. 2, Issue 2|pages=183-189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications can also be delivered to recipients unbeknownst to the sender because of false assumptions made regarding the platform or medium which was used to send information. An example of this is failure to read a company's privacy policy regarding communications on their platform could lead one to assume their communication is protected when it is in fact not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/94-of-australians-do-not-read-all-privacy-policies-that-apply-to-them-and-thats-rational-behaviour-96353|title=94% of Australians do not read all privacy policies that apply to them – and that’s rational behaviour|last=Kemp|first=Katharine|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, companies frequently have been known to lack transparency in how they use information, this can be both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meijer|first=Ronald|last2=Conradie|first2=Peter|last3=Choenni|first3=Sunil|date=2014|title=Reconciling Contradictions of Open Data Regarding Transparency, Privacy, Security and Trust|url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-18762014000300004&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Journal of theoretical and applied electronic commerce research|volume=9|issue=3|pages=32–44|doi=10.4067/S0718-18762014000300004|issn=0718-1876|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of communication privacy necessarily requires consideration of technological methods of protecting information/communication in digital mediums, the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of such methods/systems, and the development/advancement of new and current technologies.

=== Individual Privacy ===
In the context of digital privacy, individual privacy is the notion that individuals have a right to exist freely on the internet, in that they can choose what types of information they are exposed to, and more importantly that unwanted information should not interrupt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hung|first=Humphry|last2=Wong|first2=Y.H.|date=2009-05-22|title=Information transparency and digital privacy protection: are they mutually exclusive in the provision of e‐services?|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/08876040910955161|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1108/08876040910955161|issn=0887-6045}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a digital breach of individual privacy would be an internet user receiving unwanted ads and emails/spam, or a computer virus that forces the user to take actions they otherwise wouldn't. In such cases the individual, during that moment, doesn't exist digitally without interruption from unwanted information; thus their individual privacy has been infringed upon.  

== Anonymity  ==

=== Information Anonymity ===
The following examples are systems that allow a user to remain anonymous when accessing the web, and by extension the use of which better ensures the protection of their [[personally identifiable information]].  

[[Onion routing|Onion Routing]] was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab and was intended to anonymize web traffic. The system created a path to any TCP/IP server by creating a pathway of onion routers. Once a pathway has been established, all information that is sent through it is anonymously delivered. When the user has finished utilizing the pathway it was essentially deleted which freed the resources to be used for a new pathway within Onion Routing. The [[The Onion Routing Project|Onion Routing project]] developed into what is today known as [[Tor (anonymity network)|TOR]], a completely open-sourced and free software. Unlike its predecessor, Onion Routing, Tor is able to protect both the anonymity of individuals as well as web providers.This allows people to set up anonymous web servers which in effect provides a censorship-resistant publishing service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ye11dQQ5CbcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=digital+privacy+study&amp;ots=CXxNO9M5Ke&amp;sig=hxB3kxTMyiCjs_F8dPQeNYlIMiw#v=onepage&amp;q=communication%20privacy&amp;f=false|title=Digital Privacy: Theory, Technologies, and Practices|last=Acquisti|first=Alessandro|last2=Gritzalis|first2=Stefanos|last3=Lambrinoudakis|first3=Costos|last4=Vimercati|first4=Sabrina di|date=2007-12-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420052183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Communication Anonymity ===
The previously mentioned information anonymity systems can also potentially protect the contents of communications between two people, but there are other systems that directly function to guarantee a communication remains between only two people; they function to accomplish that only the intended recipient of a communication will receive it.&lt;ref&gt;Edman, M. and Yener, B. 2009. On anonymity in an electronic society: A survey of anonymous communication systems. ACM Comput. Surv. 42, 1, Article 5 (December 2009), 35 pages. DOI = 10.1145/1592451.1592456,  &lt;nowiki&gt;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1592451.1592456&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these systems, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] (which is an acronym for ''Pretty Good Privacy''), has existed in various forms for many years. It functions to protect email messages by encrypting and decrypting them. It originally existed as a command-line-only program, but in recent years it has evolved to have its own full interface and a multitude of email providers offer built-in PGP support. Users can also install PGP-compatible software and manually configure it to encrypt emails on nearly any platform.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, Philip R. (1999). "Why I Wrote PGP". Essays on PGP. Philip Zimmermann.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] (acronym for Secure Sockets Layer) and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] (acronym for Transport Layer Security) are measures to secure payments online. While these systems are not immune from breaches or failure, many users benefit greatly from their use as every major browser program has support for it built in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Hacking  ==

=== Phishing ===
''Main article: [[Phishing]]''

[[Phishing]] is a common method of obtaining someone's private information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-09-15|title=A survey of phishing attacks: Their types, vectors and technical approaches|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417418302070|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|language=en|volume=106|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2018.03.050|issn=0957-4174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generally consists of an individual (often referred in this context as a [[hacker]]), developing a website that looks similar to other major websites that a target person commonly uses. The target person can be directed to the site through a link in a 'fake' email that is designed to look like it came from the website he/she commonly uses. The user then clicks on the URL, proceeds to sign in, or provide other personal information, and as opposed to the information being submitted to the website that the user thought they were on, it is actually sent directly to the hacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Taking the Bait: A Systems Analysis of Phishing Attacks|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915001869|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=1109–1116|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.185|issn=2351-9789}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Societal Implications  ==
Digital privacy is a trending social concern. For example, the [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] by [[Eric Berlow]] and Sean Gourley subsequent to the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] cast a shadow over the privacy of [[cloud storage]] and [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gourley|first=Eric Berlow and Sean|title=Mapping ideas worth spreading|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_berlow_and_sean_gourley_mapping_ideas_worth_spreading|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While digital privacy is concerned with the [[privacy]] of digital information in general, in many contexts it specifically refers to information concerning [[personal identity]] shared over public networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/es/issues/privacy|title=Privacy|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-11-27|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the [[Edward Snowden]] disclosures concerning the extent of the [[NSA]] [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program were revealed in 2013, the public debate on digital privacy mainly centered on [[privacy concerns with social networking services]], as viewed from within these services.

As the secrecy of the American [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] becomes widely disclosed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2013/08/22/google-and-microsofts-plea-on-nsa-requests-moves-slowly-in-secret-court/|title=Google and Microsoft’s plea on NSA requests moves slowly in secret court|last=Roberts|first=Jeff|date=2013-08-22|website=gigaom.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, digital privacy is increasingly recognized as an issue in the context of [[mass surveillance]].

The use of [[cryptographic software]] to evade [[prosecution]] and [[harassment]] while sending and receiving information over computer networks is associated with [[crypto-anarchism]], a movement intending to protect individuals from mass surveillance by the government.

A '''fishbowl''' [[conversation]] is a form of [[dialogue|dialog]] that can be used when discussing topics within large groups. Fishbowl conversations are sometimes also used in participatory events such as [[unconference]]s. The advantage of fishbowl is that it allows the entire group to participate in a conversation. Several people can join the discussion.

== Method(s) ==
[[File:Fishbowl diagram 172.png|thumb|The arrangement of chairs in a fish bowl session. Four concentric rings of chairs surround a smaller group of five chairs. An arrow indicates how any member of the audience may enter the middle section.]]
Four to five chairs are arranged in an inner circle. This is the fishbowl. The remaining chairs are arranged in [[concentric circles]] outside the fishbowl. A few participants are selected to fill the fishbowl, while the rest of the group sit on the chairs outside the fishbowl. In an '''open fishbowl''', one chair is left empty. In a '''closed fishbowl''', all chairs are filled. The [[Discussion moderator|moderator]] introduces the topic and the participants start discussing the topic. The audience outside the fishbowl listen in on the discussion.

In an open fishbowl, any member of the audience can, at any time, occupy the empty chair and join the fishbowl. When this happens, an existing member of the fishbowl must voluntarily leave the fishbowl and free a chair. The discussion continues with participants frequently entering and leaving the fishbowl. Depending on how large your [[audience]] is you can have many audience members spend some time in the fishbowl and take part in the discussion. When time runs out, the fishbowl is closed and the moderator summarizes the discussion.

An immediate variation of this is to have only two chairs in the central group. When someone in the audience wants to join the two-way conversation, they come forward and tap the shoulder of the person they want to replace, at some point when they are not talking. The tapped speaker must then return to the outer circles, being replaced by the new speaker, who carries on the conversation in their place.

In a closed fishbowl, the initial participants speak for some time. When time runs out, they leave the fishbowl and a new group from the audience enters the fishbowl. This continues until many audience members have spent some time in the fishbowl. Once the final group has concluded, the moderator closes the fishbowl and summarizes the discussion.

== Advantages ==
An advantage of a fishbowl conversation is that it is suitable for large groups. It also lessens distinctions between the speakers and the audience. This has made fishbowls popular in participatory group meetings and conferences.

== Issues ==
This is not a forum where [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] or shy people will be inclined to contribute. To include them, it is possible to break the dialog down into much smaller groups to make them feel comfortable to discuss a topic. Their [[Opinion|opinions]] can be garnered upfront through a post-it gathering exercise or with live-voting on whose opinion they value/want replaced (via non-technical show of arms/clapping or a digital live-voting app).

==Variations==
The group can be split into two smaller and distinct subgroups (such as men and women, or older and younger participants), who convene separately and come up with three to four questions for the other group, which are written on cards. The participants reconvene and exchange cards, and form two circles, one subgroup inside the other, both of them facing inwards. The inside group read a question and discuss it, while those in the outside circle listen but do not speak. Each question is discussed in this way, making sure everyone in the inner circle has a chance to speak. The circles are then reversed. The questions that the groups generate can be on the same subject or not, at the discretion of the organizer. This version is a good party game for groups of thirty to sixty people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/leaders/leaderslibrary/leaderslibrary/108236.shtml|title=A Unitarian Universalist Approach to Youth Ministry|last=Taddeo|first=Jan E.|date=June 9, 2006|publisher=uua.org|accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another derivative is to have the fishbowl run for a certain period of time - e.g., half an hour. The moderator stops the discussion in the fishbowl circle and invites those not in the inner circle to offer their thoughts and comments on what they are hearing in the inner circle.

Another variation is to use technology, such as [[CoverItLive]], &lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bq5mc3qIr3dRvi0I94C7YRZTroqB6GVgu1uxMWMcNKE/edit&lt;/ref&gt; to increase participation.  This allows all the participants in the Outer Circle the opportunity to share their thinking in the public online forum without needing to wait turns. The online forum is also projected in the room for the Inner Circle to use as additional talking points or building ideas from.  This variation allows for an environment that supports extroverts and introverts. ( Extroverts - speaking in front of the group, Introverts - sharing their thinking in the online public forum ).  In this variation, a hot seat ( or open seat ) is also available for Outer Circle participants so they can at any time join the Fishbowl (Inner Circle) and share their thinking verbally if needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16541">'''Geography of disability''' is a branch of [[Human geography|Human Geography]] focusing on the disabled or impairs and their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0064.xml|title=Geography of Disability - Geography - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disability refers to individuals with physical and intellectual impairments. (Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=World Report on Disability.|last=World Health Organisation|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio-economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as “a set of discursive and performative practice”, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment.

According to the World report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer, cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319908376|title=The geography of disability and economic disadvantage in Australian capital cities|last=Louise.|first=O'Rance,|date=2009|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|others=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.|isbn=9781740249102|location=Canberra|oclc=319908376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlation could also be seen in the United State. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia Tennesse, Louisiana and Arkansas etc, which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state. For examples, in Memphis, Tennesse, a city with 26.2% poverty rate is also one of the cities with the densest disabled population, 12.6%-17.8% of its working population (aged from 18-64) live with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/21/economic-blight-50-worst-american-cities-live/415609001/|title=These are America's worst cities for crime, employment, housing costs|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://disabilitycompendium.org/sites/default/files/user-uploads/2017_AnnualReport_2017_FINAL.pdf|title=2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report|last=Kraus, L., Lauer, E., Coleman, R., and Houtenville, A.|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures also indicated that female is riskier of being disability than male regardless of their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe, according to the Eurostat, women are 3% more prone to suffering from a longstanding health problem, daily activity difficulties or both than men in Europe in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Disability_statistics_-_health|title=Disability statistics - health - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Recent development of Geography of Disability: [https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf] ===
Geography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants.

Imrie, explained the recent development in ''The Geographies of Disability'' as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

“An opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990’s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline.

However, up to the early 1990’s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.’’

The narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The socio-economic of disability ==

The disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.

=== The models of disability ===
(link to an external article: Social Model of disability [[Social model of disability|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability]] )

The medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‘normal’ as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled’s daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand,  the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude.

In the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled’s need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‘the normal’ population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. . Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What’s more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‘mainstream’ society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15–24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imrie(2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people.

“Hall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‘traditional’ research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‘can fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people’ (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people’s experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.“&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Environmental politics of Disability  ==

=== The environmental politics of Disability ===
A disabled person’s origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‘extra’, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to  highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.

=== Accessible Tourism ===
The concept of the Accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajadacz|first=Alina|date=2015-01-01|title=The Contribution Of The Geography Of Disability To The Development Of ‘Accessible Tourism’|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/tour/25/1/article-p19.xml|journal=Turyzm|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.2478/tour-2014-0016|issn=0867-5856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‘tourism without barriers’ has gradually drawn people’s attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation’s publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism UNWTO] has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism|title=Accessible Tourism {{!}} Ethics, Culture and Social Responsibility|website=ethics.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Zajadacz, he stated that: “In recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which “provide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards Disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled’s daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Discrimination Law and Policy ==
In WHO’s report about the disabling barriers, it said:

“Beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation. For example, the attitudes of teachers, school administrators, other children, and even family members affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Misconceptions by employers that people with disabilities are less productive than their non-disabled counterparts, and ignorance about available adjustments to work arrangements limits employment opportunities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Australia, The ''Disability Discrimination Act 1992(DDA)'' illegitimate any direct or indirect discriminating actions towards a person, either temporarily or permanently disabled, or with the future potential of being disabled, in areas including employment, education, access to services and public places and rights to purchase premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/disability-discrimination|title=Disability discrimination|last=connie.kwan|date=2015-02-18|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gernikako Arbola''''' is the title of a song in ''[[bertso]]'' form presented both in Madrid (1853) and by the shrine of Saint Anthony at [[Urkiola]] (1854) by the Basque [[bard]] [[Jose Maria Iparragirre]] (Spanish spelling Iparraguirre), celebrating the [[Gernikako Arbola|Tree of Gernika]] and the [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|Basque liberties]]. The song is an unofficial anthem of the Basques, besides the [[Eusko Abendaren Ereserkia]], a largely instrumental version used for official purposes in the [[Basque Autonomous Community]]. In 2007, as set out by the 4/2007 Chartered Decision, the [[Juntas Generales|General Assembly of Biscay]] declared it the district's official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=15|url=http://www.bizkaia.net/lehendakaritza/bao_bob/2007/03/20070328a062.pdf|title=Martiaren 20ko 5/2007 Foru-Araua,Bizkaiko Udal Mugarteei buruzko uztailaren 7ko 8/1993 Foru-Arauaren II. kapitulua,Toki-Erakundeen armarri, bandera, zutoihal eta gidoinen gainekoa, aldatzeari buruzkoa|publisher=General Assembly of Biscay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the song quickly expanded (sung by the bard in Madrid venues) on the heat of the pro-fueros movement in the run-up to their definite suppression (1876) and the political unrest following it. Its echo quickly spread to the [[French Basque Country]], where it took hold spurred by the ''Lore Jokoak'' festivals, the "[[Floral Games]]".

The song was chosen for the solemn end to the demonstration held at Pamplona in 1893, and sang along by the crowds, after widespread indignation sparked at the Spanish government's breach of fiscal terms concerning Navarre&amp;mdash;protests known as the ''Gamazada''.

The local newspaper ''La Voz de [[Fitero]]'' (southern fringes of Navarre) reported on the cheerful official reception in honour of the district MP Ramon Lasanta held on 30 April 1913, where an enthusiast audience sang the '''''Gernikako Arbola''''' along, and demanded an encore from the music band.

The anthem was often rendered in performances by [[Pablo de Sarasate]] and [[Julian Gayarre]]. It has been called the "[[Marseillaise]] of the Basques". The tree has also inspired a passage of ''[[La prudencia en la mujer]]''&lt;ref name="Tirso"&gt;''[[La prudencia en la mujer]]'', [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12149419729037162098435/p0000001.htm#2 Acto 1], [[Tirso de Molina]]. Referred as the ''Arbol de Garnica'' [sic].&lt;/ref&gt; by the Spanish playwright [[Tirso de Molina]] and a sonnet of [[William Wordsworth]].&lt;ref name="Wordsworth"&gt;[http://www.everypoet.com/Archive/Poetry/William_Wordsworth/william_wordsworth_365.htm The Oak of Guernica], [[William Wordsworth]], 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are versions with four, eight or twelve stanzas.

The '''Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission''' ({{lang-el|Εθνική Επιτροπή Τηλεπικοινωνιών και Ταχυδρομείων}}, ''Ethniki Epitropi Tilepikoinonion kai Tachydromeion'') or '''EETT''' is the [[Greece|Greek]] national regulatory authority for of the telecommunication and postal markets.

The EETT is responsible for managing numbering resources, controlling and licensing the electromagnetic spectrum in Greece as well as regulating the telecom markets having exclusive rights over the competition in the telecoms market. Thus, all issues concerning competition in the Greek telecom market are resolved by the EETT and not by the Competition Committee which is responsible for ensuring competition in the Greek market (with the exception of telecommunications market).

The EETT is an independent authority of the Republic and as such has specific rights laid out in the Hellenic Constitution. Its members are elected by the Council of Presidents of the Hellenic Parliament. Nevertheless, under a new proposed law the EETT's board members will be appointed directly by the minister of transport and communications. This is feasible because the EETT is not exclusively named in the Hellenic Constitution as an independent authority of the Republic and thus the regulations concerning its board's election can be altered by law.

Some of EETT's notable achievements are the new national numbering plan of the Hellenic Republic, the liberalisation of the fixed phone and data markets as well as the issue of the fourth GSM license to [[Q-telecom]] in 2001. It has also issued licenses in the fixed wireless band.
For the [[2004 Olympic Games]] the EETT has developed a hi-tech spectrum control system that has managed to cope with the high spectral control needs of the Games.

==EETT's logo==
[[Image:Oldereettlogos.jpg|frame|right|Older logos of the EETT]]
The EETT logo is a white network map on a red background symbolizing "the tree of communication". The older logos featured stylished versions of the EETT lettering combined with a globe or a satellite pointing upwards. The new "tree" logo was introduced in the first quarter of 2005.

'''Home ownership in Australia''' is considered a key cultural icon,&lt;ref name=winter/&gt; and part of the Australian tradition known as the [[Australian Dream|Great Australian Dream]] of "owning a detached house on a fenced block of land."&lt;ref name=winter&gt;Winter, Ian and Wendy Stone. [http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/pubs/WP13.pdf Social Polarisation and Housing Careers: Exploring the Interrelationship of Labour and Housing Markets in Australia]. Australian Institute of Family Studies. March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dav/&gt; [[Owner-occupancy|Home ownership]] has been seen as creating a responsible citizenry; according to a former [[Premier of Victoria]]: "The home owner feels that he has a stake in the country, and that he has something worth working for, living for, fighting for."&lt;ref name=kem256&gt;Kemeny, Jim. "The Ideology of Home Ownership."  Urban Planning in Australia: Critical Readings, ed. J. Brian McLoughlin and Margo Huxley.  Melbourne: Longman Cheshire Pty Limited, 1986. p256-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 there were about 9.0 million private dwellings in Australia, each with, on average, 2.6 occupants.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/fact-file-housing-in-australia/6442650 |title=Fact file: 9 million homes with 2.6 occupants - this is the Australian housing market - Fact Check - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 about 70% of dwellings were [[owner-occupancy|owner-occupied]]&lt;ref name=ABS1301&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics ''[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Home%20Owners%20and%20Renters~129 HOME OWNERS AND RENTERS]''&lt;/ref&gt; – one of the largest proportions of any country. The remainder were rented dwellings. About half of the owner-occupied dwellings were under mortgage.&lt;ref name=ABS1301 /&gt;

Australian governments have encouraged broad-scale home ownership through [[tax incentive]]s,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} although mortgage interest is not tax deductible as, for example, in the United States. The owner-occupied residential home is not subject to the [[capital gains tax in Australia|capital gains tax]] on sale and is not counted in the assets test for [[Centrelink]] pension purposes. It is also not taxed for [[land tax]] or other [[property tax]].

In the past, home ownership has been a sort of equalising factor; in postwar Australia, immigrant Australians could often buy homes as quickly as native-born Australians.&lt;ref name=dav&gt;Davison, Graeme. "The Past &amp; Future of the Australian Suburb."  Australian Planner (Dec. 1994): 63–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Australian suburbs have been more [[income segregation|socio-economically mixed]] than those in America and to a lesser extent Britain. In Melbourne, for instance, one early observer noted that "a poor house stands side by side with a good house."&lt;ref name=dav/&gt;

There are significant regional differences in rates of homeownership around Australia, reflecting average age differences (e.g., older age people tend to own houses more than younger people), as well as socio-economic differences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Statistics==
{{Updatesection|date=March 2018}}
In the 2009–10 Survey of Income and Housing, it was found that an estimated 33% of households owned their homes outright (i.e. without a mortgage) and 36% were owners with a mortgage. A further 24% were renting from a private landlord and 4% were renting from a state or territory housing authority.&lt;ref name=ABS1301 /&gt;

Between June 1996 and June 2010, the proportion of households without a mortgage declined from 43% to 33%, while the proportion with a mortgage rose from 28% to 36%.&lt;ref name=ABS1301 /&gt; Since 1995–96, the proportion of households renting from state/territory housing authorities has declined slightly while the proportion renting privately increased from 19% to 24% in 2009–10. While a greater proportion of all renting households are renting from private landlords, there is an increased number of private renters receiving [[Commonwealth rent assistance]].&lt;ref name=ABS1301 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1301.0Main+Features1332012 |title=Housing Assistance |publisher=Abs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home ownership in Australia decreased to 67% in 2011, the lowest level in over 50 years. Tasmania has the highest home-ownership rate at 70%, and the Northern Territory the lowest at 46%.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

On the 2016 Census Home ownership in Australia decreased Even Further to 65% in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=• |url=https://theconversation.com/home-ownership-remains-strong-in-australia-but-it-masks-other-problems-census-data-80068 |title=Home ownership remains strong in Australia but it masks other problems: Census data |publisher=Theconversation.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property as an investment==
The 24% of dwellings which are rented by private landlords may be considered income-producing or investment properties, and the private landlords as investors, though some owner-occupiers may also view their dwellings as investments. The main difference is that the rent paid by a tenant is income of the landlord-investor, while an owner-occupier does not generally derive any income from the property. Similarly, the investor can claim expenses relating to the property, including property taxes, interest and depreciation,  which the owner-occupier cannot. The rent paid by a tenant for private or domestic purposes is not generally an allowable deduction of the tenant, as are any expenses relating to the property.

The owner-occupied dwelling is not subject to the [[capital gains tax in Australia|capital gains tax]] on sale, while the investment property is, though entitled to a CGT discount of 50%.

== Affordability ==

Home ownership in Australia is becoming more exclusive. The ratio of the price of the average home to Australians' average income was at an all-time high in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Badcock, Blair and Andrew Beer. Home Truths: Property Ownership and Housing Wealth in Australia.  Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2000, p128.&lt;/ref&gt; Young people are buying homes at the lowest rates ever, and changes in work patterns are reducing many households' ability to retain their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Badcock, Blair and Andrew Beer.

===Immigration to Australia===
A number of economists, such as [[Macquarie Bank]] analyst Rory Robertson, assert that high immigration and the propensity of new arrivals to cluster in the capital cities is exacerbating the nation's housing affordability problem.&lt;ref name="lo"&gt;Klan, A. (17 March 2007) [http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21376192-25658,00.html Locked out]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robertson, Federal Government policies that fuel demand for housing, such as the currently high levels of immigration, as well as capital gains tax discounts and subsidies to boost fertility, have had a greater impact on housing affordability than land release on urban fringes.&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;Wade, M. (9 September 2006) [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pm-wrong-on-house-prices/2006/09/08/1157222334155.html PM told he's wrong on house prices]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Productivity Commission Inquiry Report No. 28 First Home Ownership (2004) also stated, in relation to housing, "that Growth in immigration since the mid-1990s has been an important contributor to underlying demand, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne."&lt;ref name="Microsoft Word - prelims.doc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/56302/housing.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - prelims.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603013605/http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/56302/housing.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been exacerbated by Australian lenders relaxing credit guidelines for temporary residents, allowing them to buy a home with a 10 percent deposit.

The RBA in its submission to the same PC Report also stated "rapid growth in overseas visitors such as students may have boosted demand for rental housing".&lt;ref name="Microsoft Word - prelims.doc"/&gt; However, in question in the report was the statistical coverage of resident population. The "ABS population growth figures omit certain household formation groups – namely, overseas students and business migrants who do not continuously stay for 12 months in Australia."&lt;ref name="Microsoft Word - prelims.doc"/&gt; This statistical omission lead to the admission: "The Commission recognises that the ABS resident population estimates have limitations when used for assessing housing demand. Given the significant influx of foreigners coming to work or study in Australia in recent years, it seems highly likely that short-stay visitor movements may have added to the demand for housing. However, the Commissions are unaware of any research that quantifies the effects." &lt;ref name="Microsoft Word - prelims.doc"/&gt;

Some individuals and interest groups have also argued that immigration causes overburdened infrastructure.&lt;ref name="er3"&gt;Claus, E (2005) [http://www.pc.gov.au/study/migrationandpopulation/subs/sub012.rtf Submission to the Productivity Commission on Population and Migration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003342/http://www.pc.gov.au/study/migrationandpopulation/subs/sub012.rtf |date=27 September 2007 }} (submission 12 to the Productivity Commission's position paper on Economic Impacts of Migration and Population Growth). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003342/http://www.pc.gov.au/study/migrationandpopulation/subs/sub012.rtf|date=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="er4"&gt;Nilsson (2005)  [http://www.pc.gov.au/study/migrationandpopulation/subs/sub009.rtf Negative Economic Impacts of Immigration and Population Growth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003114/http://www.pc.gov.au/study/migrationandpopulation/subs/sub009.rtf |date=27 September 2007 }} (submission 9 to the Productivity Commission's position paper on Economic Impacts of Migration and Population Growth). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003114/http://www.pc.gov.au/study/migrationandpopulation/subs/sub009.rtf|date=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign investment in residential property===
In December 2008, the federal government introduced legislation relaxing rules for foreign buyers of Australian property. According to FIRB (Foreign Investment Review Board) data released in August 2009, foreign investment in Australian real estate had increased by more than 30% year to date. One agent said that "overseas investors buy them to [[land banking|land bank]], not to rent them out. The houses just sit vacant because they are after [[capital growth]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/09/21/the-role-of-foreign-buyers-in-the-ever-inflating-housing-bubble/ |title=Foreign buyers blow out the housing bubble |website=Crikey.com.au |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner-city apartment boom===
To cope with the high demand of housing, the desirability in renting, and most significantly an influx of immigration, major Australian cities have seen a boom in high-rise apartment construction. According to [[ABC (Australia)|ABC News]] and [[UBS]], the number of cranes on Australian high-rise sites levelled out at a peak of 548, having surged 323% since late-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Housing market 'top' called by investment bank UBS|work=[[ABC (Australia)|ABC]]|date=24 April 2017|accessdate=24 April 2017|url=http://abc.net.au/news/2017-04-24/housing-market-top-called-by-investment-bank-ubs/8466198?pfmredir=sm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

In June 2011, The CEO of [[ANZ Bank]], one of the [[Big Four (banks)|big 4 banks]] in Australia and New Zealand said housing should not be a vehicle for speculative price growth, but simply as shelter.&lt;ref name=SMH20110603/&gt; He also criticised the Federal Government's policy on [[Negative gearing (Australia)|negative gearing]] tax breaks which increases the focus on housing as an investment rather than shelter and decrease affordability.&lt;ref name=SMH20110603&gt;{{cite news |title=Negative gearing unhealthy, says ANZ boss |first= |last= |url= http://www.smh.com.au/business/negative-gearing-unhealthy-says-anz-boss-20110602-1fiz8.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homshetsi''' (Հոմշեցի ''Homshetsi lizu'' "the Hamshen language", {{lang-tr|Hemşince}}) is an archaic [[Western Armenian]] dialect spoken by the eastern and northern group of [[Hemshin peoples]] (''Hemşinli''), a people living in northeastern [[Turkey]], [[Abkhazia]], [[Russia]], and [[Central Asia]].

It is not fully intelligible with the rest of Armenian. It was not a written language until 1995, when linguist [[Bert Vaux]] designed an orthographic system for it based on the [[Turkish alphabet]]; the [[Armenian alphabet]] was used by Christian immigrants from Hamshen (Northern Hamshenis)—who refer to the language as '''Homshetsma''' (Հոմշեցմա) in [[Russia]] and [[Abkhazia]].

Homshetsi is a spoken language amongst the Eastern Hemshinli, also known as the Hopa Hemshinli, who live in a small number of villages in Turkey's [[Artvin Province]] and [[Central Asia]]. The Western or Rize Hamsheni are a related, geographically separate group living in [[Rize Province]], who spoke Homshetsi until sometime in the 19th century. They now speak only Turkish with many Homshetsi loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Blaesing, "Armenian in the Vocabulary and Culture of the Turkish Hemshinli", in {{cite book|ref=harv|author=Hovann Simonian|title=The Hemshin: History, Society and Identity in the Highlands of Northeast Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cl6QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-79830-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third group, the northern Homshentsik, who live in [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[Abkhazia]]), [[Armenia]], also speak Homshetsi.

Homshetsi has linguistic features that indicate it belongs to the Western Armenian dialect group; however, the two are generally not mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Vaux, "Homshetsma, The language of the Armenians of Hamshen", in {{cite book|ref=harv|author=Hovann Simonian|title=The Hemshin: History, Society and Identity in the Highlands of Northeast Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cl6QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-79830-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homshetsi has close ties to the Armenian dialects formerly found in northeastern Turkey, in particular in [[Sırakonak, İspir|Khodorchur]] and, to a lesser extent, in [[Trabzon]]. Because of its extended isolation, Homshetsi contains many archaisms that set it apart from all other Armenian dialects. The language preserves forms found only in Classical and Middle Armenian, and at the same time preserves foreign (especially Arab and Turkish) grammatical and lexical components that were stripped from modern Armenian during the twentieth century. "Homshetsma therefore gives us one of our only glimpses of Armenian in its 'pure' form", writes Bert Vaux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Hovann Simonian|title=The Hemshin: History, Society and Identity in the Highlands of Northeast Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cl6QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-79830-7}}, page 257&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] has categorised Homshetsi as a language that is "definitely endangered".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), "Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger", February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jebala''' ({{lang-ar|جبالة|Jbala|}}), is a group of -[[Berber]]&lt;ref name="Joseph Jacobs 1969"&gt;Joseph Jacobs, Alfred Trübner Nutt, Arthur Robinson Wright, William Crooke Folklore Society, 1969, Volume 16.&lt;/ref&gt; nomadic [[mountain people]], which inhabit North-West [[Morocco]]. The Jebala people inhabit the plains from the city of [[Targuist]] to the west, in contrast with the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Rifian people]] inhabiting the plains from [[Targuist]] to the east. The North-West of Morocco include cities such as [[Tangier]], [[Tetouan]], [[Chefchaouen]], and [[Larache]].

==Etymology==
The word ''Jbala'' comes from Arabic ({{lang-ar|جبالة}}''Jbel'') which means ''mountain''. Thus Jbala means ''mountain people''. A man or boy is called a ''Jebli'' while a woman or a girl is called a ''Jebliya''.

==Origins==
The Jebala speak an Arabic [[Beni Ḥassān|Hassani]]-dialect  influenced by Berbers and [[Andalucian]]s of Northern [[Morocco]] and [[Al-Andalus]]&lt;ref&gt;Actas Del Segundo Congreso Árabe Marroquí: Estudio, Enseñanza Y Apredizaje. Francisco Moscoso García, Luis Miguel Pérez Cañada, Nadi Hamdi Nouaouri. 2007. Universidad de Cadiz.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that their land lies on the route between these places.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{fr}} S. Levy, EDNA n°1 (1996), Reperes pour une histoire linguistique du Maroc, pp.127-137&lt;/ref&gt; The Jebala people should not be confused with the Berbers inhabiting the [[Rif|Rif mountains]]. They are different from them based on history, ethnicity and linguistically. 

The inhabitants of the North are divided in two broad traditional ethnolinguistic categories, the Arabic-speaking jebala in the west which trace their maleline to dynasties and tribes such as the [[Idrisid dynasty]] and the [[Maqil]] tribe. In the East you have the Tarifit-speaking Riffians, with the dividing line and watershed in [[Targuist]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Tribe and Society in Rural Morocco Door David M. Hart&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the arrival of the Arabian [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] tribes in the 12th century, the Jebala country was the only rural region where non-bedouinic Arabic was spoken, and it still remains the only significant rural region where a non-bedouin Arabic dialect is spoken. Most of the Jebala people are centered in North-West Morocco and the Southern Rif Mountains ([[Fès-Meknès|Fez-Meknes]] district), compared to the Berbers which are most centered in the Central and Eastern regions of the Riff Mountains.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Next to the Arabian Jebala people, the area is also inhabited by [[Sephardi Jews]] and native Jews. Since they were not accepted in the other regions in the mountains, these classes were only found in the Arab tribal lands of the plains to the North-West of the Mountains. Some Jewish people today still live in cities like [[Tangier]] and [[Chefchaouen]].&lt;ref&gt;Diedrich Westermann, Edwin William Smith, Cyril Daryll Forde Oxford University Press, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Very little is known about the prehistory of the region, but the history of the Jebala people seems to be well documented since early Islamic times. The early Islamic history of the Rif, through the [[Arab]]ian [[Salihid dynasty]] of the Nakur, whose members were from the Yemenite tribe [[Himyar]], and which lasted from pre-[[Idrisid]] until Almoravid times with the fall of the Madinat Al-Nakur (710-1108 CE). This part of the history seems to be well documented, but when the Berber [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] started ruling, the history of the Rif is almost total blank. The usual tradition is that almost every existing social group in the Rif mountains, whether Arabian or Berber in origin, originated from somewhere else, not too far away from the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Culture==

===Language===
[[Image:Une_belle_riffaine.jpg|200px|thumb|A portrait of a Jebli woman in Tangier - early 20th century]]
The Jebala speak a ''pre-[[Banu Hilal|hilalian]]'' Arabic dialect called [[Jebli Arabic]], which is influenced by the [[Spanish language]] due to proximity to Spain which also controlled areas of the region during the protectorate era (1912-1956) and has a [[Berber languages|Berber]] substratum.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;

===Clothing===
The traditional clothing for women includes shawls called "mendils" made from cotton or wool. These rectangular shawls are often woven in stripes of white and red in the region. They are wrapped around the waist to form skirts. They are also used as shawls and securing holding babies or goods on the back or front of the body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The  traditional man's outer garment is the [[djellaba]], a one piece cotton or woolen cloak with a pointed hood. In the Jebela region the wool is usually un-dyed so dark brown and off-white colours are common. White djellabas are worn for religious festivals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The Jelaba favour pointed toed leather slippers. Natural light brown, yellow and white are the most common colours. Reed hats are another traditional feature of Jebala dress for both men and women. Women's hats are often adorned with woven woollen tassels and roping of black, white and red in variations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Economical and cultural differences==
The Jebala people have a different culture compared to the Riff Berberians. The Jebala people use oxen yoked by their horns for ploughing, opposed to the riffian use of cows yoked by their neck. For the roofing of their houses, the Jebala people use roofs made of corrugated iron and thatch, when the Riff Berberians use dried clay. The Jebala inhabited areas amongst the Atlantic coast, tanger and western Riff have more rainfall, thus using peaking roofs compared to the flat roofs used in the Riff with less rainfall. The Jebala have real villages with houses clustered together, while the Riffians traditionalle have dispersed homesteads each located at least 300 metres from the next.

Music and dancing are also very different. The Jebala play the "Ghayta" (a form of clarinet), and the tbul (drum), and dancing is generally performed by boys. The Riff musicians, who belong to a socially and occupational inferior class calling themselves "Imdhyazen", generally come from one tribe, the "Ait Touzin". They play the "Addjun" (tambourine) and the "zammar" (a kind of clarinet) with unmarried girls and old women dancing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Jeseri''' (also known as '''Jesri''' or '''Dweep Bhasha''') is a [[dialect]] of [[Malayalam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lakshadweep Pradesikabhasha Nighandu (Translation: Lakshadweep Regional Language Dictionary), Editor: Dr. Koyammakoya M.|ISBN=978-81-922822-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken in the Union Territory of [[Lakshadweep]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sura's Year Book 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fz2WDD8sB0MC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=jeseri,+lakshadweep&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-hfqTPqzHImGvgON0OXCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=jeseri%2C%20lakshadweep&amp;f=false|year=2006|isbn=978-81-7254-124-8|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India, a reference annual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=jeseri,+lakshadweep&amp;dq=jeseri,+lakshadweep&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-hfqTPqzHImGvgON0OXCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw|year=2004|publisher=[[Government of India]]|isbn=978-81-230-1156-1|page=851}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It is spoken on the islands of [[Chetlat]], [[Bitra]], [[Kiltan]], [[Kadmat Island|Kadmat]], [[Amini Island|Amini]], [[Kavaratti]], [[Androth]], [[Agatti]], and [[Kalpeni]], in the archipelago of [[Lakshadweep]].  Each of these islands has its own slang. 

==Phonology==
The phonology is similar to the Mainland dialect of [[Malayalam]], but with certain notable differences.

The initial short vowels, especially 'u', may fall away.  For example: rangi (Mal. urangi) - slept, lakka (Mal. ulakka) - pestle.

As for the consonants, the following differences are notable:

1. Initial ch in Mainland Malayalam, becomes sh: sholli (Mal.(old) cholli) - said.
2. Initial p in Mainland Malayalam, becomes f: fenn (Mal. pennu) - girl.
3. Initial v in Mainland Malayalam, becomes b: bili (Mal. vili) - call.
4. The zh sound in Mainland Malayalam, becomes retroflex l (mostly), or y: mala (Mal. mazha) - rain, bayi (Mal. vazhi) - way.


==Grammar==

The grammar shows similarities to Mainland [[Malayalam]].

The case endings for nouns and pronouns are generally as follows:

Nominative: nil;
Accusative: a, na 
Genitive: aa, naa, thaa;
Dative: kk, n, oon;
Communicative: oda, aa kooda, naa kooda;
Instrumental: aa kond, naa kond;
Locative: nd, naa ul, l(only in traces);
Ablative: nd;
Vocative: e, aa;


Pronouns:

naan: I;
nee: you (sing);
on: he (remote);
ben: he (proximate);
ol: she (remote);
bel: she (proximate);
adh: it (remote);
idh: it (proximate);

nom, namma, laaba: we (inclusive);
nanga: we (exclusive);
ninga: you (plural);
aba: they (remote);
iba: they (proximate);
thaan: self;


Verbs:

The conjugations of verbs are similar to Mainland [[Malayalam]].

The verb 'kaanu' - meaning 'see', the same as in Mainland [[Malayalam]], is illustrated here.

There are three simple tenses.

1. Present: suffix added is nna (mostly nda); so kaanunna/kaanunda - sees, is seeing.
2. Past: the stem of the verb may change as in Mainland Malayalam. For 'kaanu', past is kanda - saw.
3. Future: the suffix added is 'um'.  So, kaanum - will see.


The negatives of these tenses show some differences:

1. For present tense, the negative is formed by adding vela (ppela for some verbs)to the stem.  Not only that, a present negative may also function as a future negative.  So, kaanuvela - is not seeing, does not see, will not see.
2. For past tense, the negative is formed by suffixing ela to the past stem.  So, kandela - did not see, has not seen.  
3. For the future tense, the old Malayalam poetic suffix 'aa' may be used (kaanaa).


The interrogative forms are made by suffixing 'aa' with some changes effected.
So, kaanundyaa (does/do ... see?) for kaanunda (sees), kandyaa (did ... see?) for kanda (saw), and kaanumaa/kaanunaa/kaanungaa (will ... see?) for kaanum (will see).

:''For the namesake and contemporaneous Scottish physician and social reformer, see [[John Roberton (1776)|John Roberton]].''
'''John Roberton''' (20 March 1797 – 24 August 1876) was a Scottish physician and [[social reform]]er. He was a pioneer of modern [[obstetrics]] and of [[evidence-based medicine]], and influential in the intellectual life of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Manchester]].

==Life==
Roberton was born near [[Hamilton, Lanarkshire]] and educated for the medical profession at [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. He was admitted a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] in 1817. He intended to be a ship's surgeon, and was on his way to the [[West Indies]] when he was wrecked on the Lancashire coast. While at [[Liverpool]] he was encouraged to take up his residence at [[Warrington]]. He became a [[Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries]] in 1822, and on 9 October 1823 married Mary (1794/5–1851), daughter of [[David Bellhouse]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Mottram (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The couple subsequently moved to Manchester. He soon had an extensive [[general practice]], and, on his appointment in 1827 to the post of surgeon to the [[Manchester Lying-in Hospital]], turned his special attention to [[midwifery]] and to the [[physiology]] and diseases of women and children. He was also a lecturer at the Marsden Street School of Medicine. His first publication was ''Observations on the Mortality and Physical Management of Children'' (1827). From 1830 onwards he wrote a series of [[scientific paper]]s for the ''Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal'' on the time of onset of female [[puberty]] in various countries, which led [[James Cowles Prichard]] to alter some of the conclusions which he had arrived at in the earlier editions of his ''Physical History of Mankind''. These, along with other similar papers, are reprinted in Roberton's most important work, ''Essays and Notes on the Physiology and Diseases of Women and on Practical Midwifery'' (London, 1851). He devoted much time to the subject of hospital construction and the provision of convalescent homes, on which he wrote a number of pamphlets between 1831 and 1861.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Sutton (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberton's advice was largely sought in the discipline in which he had specialised, [[obstetrics]], and he was aware of the broader social and medical context of his work. He helped much to extend the fame of the Manchester school of obstetrics founded by [[Charles White (physician)|Charles White]] and continued by [[John Hull (physician)|John Hull]] and [[Thomas Radford]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

He was an active social reformer, interesting himself in all local and national movements for improving the condition of working people and active in the [[Manchester Statistical Society]]. In religion he was a [[puritan]] and [[nonconformist]], and the intimate friend of the popular preachers [[Robert Stephen McAll]] and [[Robert Halley]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

He died at his residence at [[New Mills]], Derbyshire, where he had retired on relinquishing his practice. His wealth at death was under £40,000 (under £2.9 million at 2003 prices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Consumer Price Inflation since 1750 | author=O'Donoghue, J.| journal=Economic Trends | volume=604 | year=2004 | pages=38–46, March | url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/article.asp?ID=726 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

'''Joi Lansing''' (born '''Joy Rae Brown''', April 6, 1929&lt;ref&gt;1929 appears to be the most likely year of birth as per the 1940 United States census, which gives her age as 11 as of April 22, 1940, under the name '''Joy Loveland''', her stepfather's surname.&lt;/ref&gt; – August 7, 1972) was an American [[Model (person)|model]], [[film]] and [[television]] actress, and [[nightclub singer]]. She was noted for her [[pin-up]] photos and roles in [[B-movie]]s, as well as a prominent role in the famous opening "tracking shot" in [[Orson Welles]]' crime drama ''[[Touch of Evil]]''.

==Early life==
Lansing was born at Holy Cross Hospital, [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in 1929 to Jack Glen Brown (also known as Glen Jack Brown and Glenn Jack Brown; 1900–1960), a shoe salesman and orchestra musician, and Virginia Grace (née Shupe) Brown, a housewife (1908–1984).&lt;ref name=Doughterty&gt;{{cite book|last=Dougherty|first=Joseph|title=Comfort and Joi|year=2004|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0-595-33590-X|page=1}}
Other birth years given include 1928 (held by the Utah Historical Society records, per Dougherty, 2004), 1933, 1934, 1935, and 1936.&lt;!-- page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She would later be known by her stepfathers' surnames, i.e. Wassmansdorff and Loveland. In 1940, her family moved to Los Angeles, where her half-brother, Larry Vernon Loveland, was born the same year.&lt;ref name=Doughterty/&gt; She began modeling in her teens, and at age 14 was signed to a contract at [[MGM]]. She completed high school on the studio lot.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mormons and Popular Culture: The Global Influence of an American Phenomenon.

==Career==
A model and [[actor|actress]], Lansing was often cast in roles similar to those played by her contemporaries [[Jayne Mansfield]] and [[Mamie Van Doren]]. She was frequently clad in skimpy costumes and bikinis that accentuated her figure (34D bust), but she never posed nude. Lansing practiced [[yoga]] for relaxation, and as a devout [[Mormon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Films by Latter-day Saint Filmmakers: Jews, Catholics, Latter-day Saints and the AFI's 100 Greatest Films|url=http://www.ldsfilm.com/misc/lds_AFI100.html|accessdate=February 13, 2012|quote=#10. Singin' in the Rain - Mormon actress Joi Lansing had a small part.}}&lt;/ref&gt; she did not drink, smoke, or use drugs.

===Films===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Lansing's film career began in 1948, and in 1952, she played an uncredited role in MGM's ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''. She received top billing in ''[[Hot Cars]]'' (1956), a crime drama involving a stolen-car racket. In the opening sequence of [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), she appeared as Zita, the dancer who dies at the end of the famous first tracking shot, during which her character exclaims to a border guard, "I keep hearing this ticking noise inside my head!"

She had a brief role as an astronaut's girlfriend in the 1958 sci-fi classic ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]''. She had fourth billing in another sci-fi story, 1959's ''[[The Atomic Submarine]]''. During the 1960s, she starred in short musical films for the [[Scopitone]] video-jukebox system. Her songs included "The Web of Love" and "The Silencer".

In 1964, producer Stanley Todd discussed a film project with Lansing, tentatively titled ''Project 22'', with location shooting planned in [[Yugoslavia]], and [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Geraldine Chaplin]] named to the cast. The movie was never made.

Lansing played "Lola" in the romantic comedy ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'' (1965) with a cast that included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Deborah Kerr]], and [[Dean Martin]]. She previously had appeared in Sinatra's drama ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' and in Martin's comedy ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]''. She turned down the chance to replace Jayne Mansfield in  ''[[The Ice House (film)|The Ice House]]'' (a horror film), and instead appeared opposite [[Basil Rathbone]] (in his last film appearance) and [[John Carradine]] in ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'', as Mamie Van Doren's replacement. Her last film was ''[[Bigfoot (1970 film)|Bigfoot]]'' (1970).

===Recordings===
Lansing starting singing in nightclubs in the early 1960's, and her performances are documented in several trade magazines. She performed with the [[Xavier Cugat]] orchestra and briefly toured with [[Les Paul]], but little is known about songs she actually recorded. Apparently, while starring on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', she recorded a 45 r.p.m. single on the small REO record label in 1957: ''Love Me/What's It Gonna Be'' (REO #1007). In 1962, she recorded 6-8 sides at Que Recorders in Los Angeles. These turned up at auction and were acetates of 4 songs each (with two songs duplicated on the second acetate). It is unknown whether these tracks were ever released on an album.  Both acetates list the same identifying number of #4-8351. The songs recorded on 2/23/62 were "Masquerade Is Over", [[All of You (Cole Porter song)|"All of You" (Cole Porter)]], "The One I Love" (which was most likely "[[The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)]]", and "[[Who Cares? (Gershwin song)|"Who Cares?" (George and Ira Gershwin)]]". On 4/30/62, the songs recorded were Feel So Young (which was probably [[You Make Me Feel So Young]]), [[Dream (1944 song)]], Masquerade, and All Of You. It was reported in Cashbox magazine on 4/17/65 that Lansing was recording an album for RCA records with [[Jimmie Haskell]] (and suggested that it should be titled "Joi To The World Of Jazz"), but nothing further is known about this project.&lt;ref name="glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com"/&gt;

===Television===

Lansing appeared in ''[[The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok]]'', ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]'', ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[Where's Raymond?]]'', ''[[Noah's Ark (1956 TV series)|Noah's Ark]]'', ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]'', ''[[The People's Choice (TV series)|The People's Choice]]'', ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'', ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', ''[[Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[This Man Dawson]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', and had a recurring role in ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Eve Arden: A Chronicle of All Film, Television, Radio and Stage Performances|author=Tucker, D.C.|date=2011|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers|isbn=9780786488100|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R1ONAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166|page=166|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, she played Vera Payson in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode, "The Case of the Crimson Kiss". She is best known perhaps as Shirley Swanson in ''[[The Bob Cummings Show]]'' or ''[[Love That Bob]]'' (1956–59). She appeared in several episodes as a busty model who was the [[Comedic foil|foil]] for photographer Bob Collins, Cummings' series name. The series ran for 173 episodes. She achieved some distinction for beating out [[Lois Lane]] ([[Noel Neill]]) to marry [[Superman]] ([[George Reeves]]) as the title character in "Superman's Wife", a 1958 episode of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The Adventures of Superman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oY6i13E4fAC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Joi+Lansing+as+Superman's+Wife&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v2IjvlF0xa&amp;sig=7z-m5sLkyiOG8xT7xwmZ1hH_BYk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjngcHF8Z7RAhXLTSYKHVKGC3sQ6AEIpQEwGA#v=onepage&amp;q=Joi+Lansing+as+Superman's+Wife&amp;f=false|title=Comfort and Joi|first=Joseph|last=Dougherty|date=17 December 2004|publisher=iUniverse|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What was possibly Lansing's best role may have been her least-seen as the [[leading lady]] in ''[[The Fountain of Youth (film)|The Fountain of Youth]]'', a [[Peabody Award]]-winning unsold [[television pilot]] directed by Orson Welles for [[Desilu]] in 1956 and broadcast on the ''[[Colgate Theatre]]'' two years later. The half-hour film remains available for public viewing at the [[Paley Center for Media]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="paleycenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paleycenter.org/pp-orson-welles|publisher=paleycenter.org|title=NY Only: Orson Welles at 100: On Television &amp;#124; The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960–61 season of ''[[Klondike (TV series)|Klondike]]'', Lansing appeared as Goldie with [[Ralph Taeger]], [[James Coburn]], and [[Mari Blanchard]]. In 1960, she appeared as Evelyn in the "Election Bet" episode of the [[Mr. Lucky (TV series)|''Mr. Lucky'']] TV series (season 1, episode 34). In May 1963, Lansing appeared in ''Falcon Frolics '63''. The broadcast honored the men stationed at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. By 1956, she had appeared in more than 200 television shows. The real count according to IMDb is around 104 appearances.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0487103/?ref_=tt_cl_t3|publisher=imdb.com|title=Joi Lansing - IMDb|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared in five episodes of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' in the role of Gladys Flatt, the unlikely glamorous wife of bluegrass musician [[Lester Flatt]]. She named [[Ozzie Nelson]] as possessing the greatest [[sex appeal]] of any actor with whom she worked. The two played a love scene in a ''[[Fireside Theater]]'' drama.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Lansing has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in Los Angeles, for her contributions to television.

==Death==

The '''Kabyle people''' ([[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]: ''Iqbayliyen'', {{IPA|iqβæjlijən}}) are a [[Berber people|Berber]] [[ethnic group]] indigenous to [[Kabylia]] in the north of [[Algeria]], spread across the [[Atlas Mountains]], one hundred miles east of [[Algiers]].
They represent the largest Berber-speaking population of [[Algeria]] and the second largest in the continent of Africa.

Many of the Kabyle have emigrated from Algeria, influenced by factors such as the earlier [[French conquest of Algeria|French conquest]] of the area, [[Algerians of the Pacific|deportation]], and latterly industrial decline and unemployment. Their diaspora has resulted in Kabyle people living in numerous countries. Large populations of Kabyle people settled in [[France]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Canada]].

The Kabylians speak the [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] Berber language. Since the [[Berber Spring]] of 1980, they have been at the forefront of the fight for the [[Languages of Algeria|official recognition of Berber languages in Algeria]].

== History ==
[[File:Portrait-Fatma N'Soumer.jpg|thumb|[[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer]] of [[Tariqa]] led the resistance against French colonization 1851–57.]]

The Kabyle were relatively independent of outside control during the period of [[Ottoman Empire]] rule in North Africa. They lived primarily in three different kingdoms: the [[Kingdom of Kuku]], the [[Kingdom of Ait Abbas]], and the principality of Aït Jubar.&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7CP7fYghBFQC&amp;pg=PA600 ''E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936''], Volume 4, publié par M. Th. Houtsma, Page: 600&lt;/ref&gt; The area was gradually taken over by the French during their colonization beginning in 1857, despite vigorous resistance. Such leaders as [[Fatma n Soumer|Lalla Fatma n Soumer]] continued the resistance as late as [[Mokrani]]'s rebellion in 1871.

French officials confiscated much land from the more recalcitrant tribes and granted it to colonists, who became known as ''[[pieds-noirs]].'' During this period, the French carried out many arrests and [[deportation|deported]] resisters, mainly to [[New Caledonia]] (see: "[[Algerians of the Pacific]]"). Due to French colonization, many Kabyle emigrated into other areas inside and outside Algeria.&lt;ref name="Abane"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b4Vryk6jQhgC&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bélaïd Abane, ''L'Algérie en guerre: Abane Ramdane et les fusils de la rébellion'', p. 74]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, immigrant workers also went to France.

In the 1920s, Algerian immigrant workers in France organized the first party promoting independence. [[Messali Hadj]], [[Imache Amar]], [[Si Djilani]], and [[Belkacem Radjef]] rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s. They developed militants who became vital to the fighting for an independent Algeria. This became widespread after World War II.

Since Algeria gained independence in 1962, tensions have arisen between Kabylie and the central government on several occasions. In 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] party of [[Hocine Aït Ahmed]] contested the authority of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], which has promoted itself as the only party in the nation.

In 1980, protesters mounted several months of demonstrations in Kabylie demanding the recognition of Berber as an official language; this period has been called the [[Berber Spring]]. In 1994–1995, the Kabyle conducted a school boycott, termed the "strike of the school bag". In June and July 1998, they protested, in events that turned violent, after the assassination of singer [[Matoub Lounes]] and passage of the law requiring use of Arabic in all fields.

In the months following April 2001 (called the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]]), major riots among the Kabyle took place followed the killing of [[Masinissa Guermah]], a young Kabyle, by gendarmes. At the same time, organized activism produced the ''[[Arouch]]'', and neo-traditional local councils. The protests gradually decreased after the Kabyle won some concessions from President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]].

== Geography ==

[[File:Kabyle-speaking-map.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=2| Regions of Kabyle settlements in Algeria]]

The geography of the Kabyle region played an important role in the people's history. The difficult mountainous landscape of the [[Tizi Ouzou Province|Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Bejaia Province|Bejaia]] provinces served as a refuge, to which most of the Kabyle people retreated when under pressure or occupation. They were able to preserve their cultural heritage in such isolation from other cultural influences.

The area supported local dynasties (Numidia, Fatimids in the Kutama periods, Zirids, Hammadids, and Hafsids of Bejaïa) or Algerian modern nationalism, and the war of independence. The region was repeatedly occupied by various conquerors. Romans and Byzantines controlled the main road and valley during the period of antiquity and avoided the mountains (Mont ferratus).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmatheque.com/ebook/la-kabylie-orientale-dans-l-histoire-pays-des-kutuma-et-guerre-coloniale-39716|title=Ebook LA KABYLIE ORIENTALE DANS L'HISTOIRE - Pays des Kutuma et guerre coloniale de Hosni Kitouni|website=www.harmatheque.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spread of Islam|During the spread of Islam]], Arabs controlled plains but not all the countryside (they were called ''el aadua'' : enemy by the Kabyle).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdelfettah Lalmi|first=Nedjma|date=2004-01-01|title=Du mythe de l’isolat kabyle|url=http://etudesafricaines.revues.org/4710#text|journal=Cahiers d’études africaines|language=fr|volume=44|issue=175|pages=507–531|doi=10.4000/etudesafricaines.4710|issn=0008-0055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Regency of Algiers]], under Ottoman influence, tried to have indirect influence over the people (makhzen tribes of Amraoua, and marabout).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/kabyles/|title=KABYLES|last=Universalis|first=Encyclopædia|website=Encyclopædia Universalis|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French gradually and totally conquered the region and set up a direct administration. [[File:Djurdjura.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[Djurdjura]] chain]]
[[File:Kabylie topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|200px|upleft=2||Topographic map of Kabylia.]]
Algerian provinces with significant Kabyle-speaking populations include [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[Béjaïa]] and [[Bouira]], where they are a majority, as well as [[Boumerdes]], [[Setif]], [[Bordj Bou Arreridj]], and [[Jijel]]. [[Algiers]] also has a significant Kabyle population, where they make up more than half of the capital's population.

The Kabyle region is referred to as ''Al Qabayel'' ("tribes") by the Arabic-speaking population and as ''Kabylie'' in French. Its indigenous inhabitants call it ''Tamurt Idurar'' ("Land of Mountains") or ''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen''/''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen'' ("Land of the Kabyle"). It is part of the [[Atlas Mountains]] and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean.

== Culture and society ==

=== Language ===
The Kabyle speak [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], a [[Berber language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] family. As second and third languages, many people speak [[Algerian Arabic]], [[French language|French]] and, to a lesser degree [[English language|English]].

During the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used the [[Tifinagh]] writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the [[Latin script]]. It is the basis for the modern [[Berber Latin alphabet]].

After the [[History of Algeria|independence of Algeria]], some Kabyle activists tried to revive the old Tifinagh alphabet. This new version of Tifinagh has been called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], but its use remains limited to [[logo]]s. Kabyle literature has continued to be written in the Latin script.

=== Religion ===
The Kabyle people are mainly [[Muslim]], with a small [[Christian]] minority. Since the 19th century, there has been a large nominal Sunni Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelmadjid Hannoum, ''Violent Modernity: France in Algeria'', Page 124, 2010, Harvard Center for Middle Eastern studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Kabyle Muslims, the main tradition is [[Maraboutism]].&lt;ref&gt;Amar Boulifa, ''Le Djurdjura à travers l'histoire depuis l'Antiquité jusqu'en 1830 : organisation et indépendance des Zouaoua (Grande Kabylie)'', Page 197, 1925, Algiers.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Zaouia]] exist all over the region; the [[Rahmaniyya]] is the most prolific.

[[Catholic]]s of Kabyle background generally live in France and result from intermarriage with the French. Recently, the Protestant community has had significant growth, particularly among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Oulahbib, ''Le monde arabe existe-t-il ?'', page 12, 2005, Editions de Paris, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
The traditional economy of the area is based on [[arboriculture]] ([[orchard]]s and [[olive tree]]s) and on the craft industry ([[tapestry]] or [[pottery]]). Mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary). In the middle of the 20th century, with the influence and funding by the Kabyle diaspora, many industries were developed in this region. It has become the second most important industrial region in the country after Algiers.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Politics ==
The Kabyle have been fierce activists in promoting the cause of Berber (''Amazigh'') identity. The movement has three groups: those Kabyle who identify as part of a larger Berber nation ([[Berberism|Berberists]]); those who identify as part of the Algerian nation (known as "Algerianists", some view Algeria as an essentially Berber nation); and those who consider the Kabyle to be a distinct nation separate from (but akin to) other Berber peoples (known as [[Kabylism|Kabylists]]).
* Two political parties dominate in Kabylie and have their principal support base there: the [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS), led by [[Hocine Aït Ahmed]], and the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD), led by [[Saïd Sadi]]. Both parties are [[secularist]], [[Berberist]] and [[Algerianist]].
* The Arouch emerged during the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]] of 2001 as a revival of the village assembly, a traditional Kabyle form of democratic organization. The Arouch share roughly the same political views as the FFS and the RCD.
* The [[Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie|MAK (Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie)]] also emerged during the Black Spring, It works for the autonomy of Kabylie. On 21 April 2010, [[Ferhat Mehenni]], leader of the MAK, proclaimed a Provisional Government of Kabylie in exile (ANAVAD). It was established officially on 1 June 2010 at the [[Palais des congrès de Paris|Palais des Congrès]] in Paris. He was elected President by the National Council of the MAK, and he named nine Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabylia-gov.org www. kabylia-gov.org], Kabylia Government website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diaspora ==
For historical and economic reasons, many Kabyles have emigrated to France, both for work and to escape political persecution. They now number around 1 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Salem Chaker, [http://www.langues-de-france.org/chaker.html "Pour une histoire sociale du berbère en France"], Les Actes du Colloque Paris - Inalco, Octobre 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d2WcCIm6WaQC&amp;pg=PA863&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false James Minahan, ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: D-K]'', Good Publishing Group, 2002, p.863. Quote: "Outside North Africa, the largest Kabyle community, numbering around 1 million, is in France."&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable French people are of full or partial Kabyle descent.

A study by Arredi, et al. (2004) includes the frequencies of lineages among one Kabyle population from [[Tizi Ouzou]] province.

* [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-Dna haplogroups]], passed on exclusively through the paternal line, were found at the following frequencies in Kabylie: [[Haplogroup E3b (Y-DNA)#E1b1b1b (E-M81); formerly E3b1b, E3b2|E1b1b1b (E-M81)]] (47.36%), [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)#R1|R1*]](xR1a) (15.78%) (later tested as R1b3/R-M269 (now [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)#R1b1a2|R1b1a2]])&lt;ref&gt;Adams et al. 2008, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19061982 " The genetic legacy of religious diversity and intolerance: paternal lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula"]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA)|J1]] (15.78%), [[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|F*]](xH, I, J2,K) ( 10.52% ) and [[Haplogroup E3b (Y-DNA)#E1b1b1c (E-M123); formerly E3b1c, E3b3|E1b1b1c (E-M123)]] (10.52%).&lt;ref name="Arredi"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arredi B, Poloni ES, Paracchini S, Zerjal T, Fathallah DM, Makrelouf M, Pascali VL, Novelletto A, Tyler-Smith C | title=A Predominantly Neolithic Origin for Y-Chromosomal DNA Variation in North Africa| journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=2004 | pages=338–345 | volume=75 | issue=2| pmid=15202071| doi=10.1086/423147| pmc=1216069}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation of J haplogroup is largely of [[Neolithic]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Op3cC6_UNnQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;q=haplogroup%20j%20is%20found%20at%20highest%20frequencies%20in%20Middle%20eastern%20and%20north%20african&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=haplogroup%20j%20is%20found%20at%20highest%20frequencies%20in%20Middle%20eastern%20and%20north%20african&amp;f=false | title=When Scotland Was Jewish: DNA Evidence, Archeology, Analysis of Migrations ...

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in  '''Montenegro''' may face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in [[Montenegro]], but households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples.

Discrimination on the basis of both [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] is banned in employment, the provision of goods and services, education and health services. Montenegro also possesses hate crime and hate speech laws which include sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds of non-discrimination. The [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]] has ranked Montenegro 23rd out of 49 [[Europe]]an countries in terms of LGBT rights legislation.&lt;ref name="rainbow"&gt;[https://rainbow-europe.org/#8650/0/0 Rainbow Europe: Montenegro]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Montenegrin society has yet to reach a high level of acceptance, and discrimination against LGBT people often goes unreported.&lt;ref name="global"/&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
Montenegro decriminalised same-sex sexual activity in 1977. The [[age of consent]] (14) was also equalised in 1977.&lt;ref name="global"&gt;[https://www.globalgayz.com/gay-life-in-montenegro/ From the Ottoman Empire to Modern Gay Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
{{Same-sex marriage map Europe|align=right|size=265px}}
There is no legal recognition of same-sex couples. The [[Constitution of Montenegro]] bans [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,NATLEGBOD,,,47e11b0c2,0.html Constitution of Montenegro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008203959/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,NATLEGBOD,,,47e11b0c2,0.html |date=8 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2012, then Deputy Prime Minister [[Duško Marković]] stated that the Montenegrin Government would prepare a bill giving some form of legal recognition to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/montenegro-promises-gay-pride-and-some-marriage-rights131112 Montenegro promises gay pride and some marriage rights]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the Human and Minority Rights Ministry has drafted a bill to legalise registered partnerships. Under the bill, same-sex couples would be able to register their relationship and receive some of the rights, benefits and responsibilities of marriage. This would not include adoption and fostering rights. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] have come out in opposition to the proposal, claiming it would "wreck" Christian values and family life in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/recognition-of-same-sex-unions-causes-controversy-in-montenegro-04-25-2018 Plan for Same-Sex Unions Rouses Fury in Montenegro]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination protections==
On 27 July 2010, the [[Parliament of Montenegro|Montenegrin Parliament]] passed a non-discrimination law that includes [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] as prohibited grounds of [[discrimination]]. This was one of the requirements the country had to meet for [[European Union]] [[Accession of Montenegro to the European Union|membership]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/for_media/media_releases/montenegro_fulfils_eu_membership_requirement_and_protects_lgbt_people_from_discrimination Montenegro fulfils EU membership requirement and protects LGBT people from discrimination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924205223/http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/for_media/media_releases/montenegro_fulfils_eu_membership_requirement_and_protects_lgbt_people_from_discrimination |date=24 September 2010 }} 28 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Criminal Code was amended to prohibit hate speech on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity, and to provide penalty enhancements if a crime is committed based on the victim's LGBT status. These changes came into force on 3 June 2014.&lt;ref name="rainbow"/&gt;

Additionally, gays, lesbians and bisexuals are not banned from military service.

==Gender identity and expression==
Transgender people in Montenegro are allowed to change legal gender, but require undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], sterilization, divorce if married and receiving a medical diagnosis to do so.&lt;ref name="rainbow"/&gt;

==Social conditions==
[[Gay]]s and [[lesbians]] may face discrimination and [[harassment]] in Montenegro. [[Anti-gay]] attitudes are deeply ingrained in society and there is widespread [[opposition to LGBT rights]].&lt;ref name="global"/&gt;

===LGBT activism===
The gay scene is very small. The first Gay Pride event in Montenegro was held on 24 July 2013 in the coastal town of [[Budva]], organized by the NGO "LGBT Forum Progress", and it subsequnelty caused various reactions in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pobjeda.me/2013/07/23/budva-gradani-ne-odobravaju-paradu-ponosa-u-svom-gradu/ |title=Budva: Građani ne odobravaju paradu ponosa u svom gradu |publisher=Pobjeda.me |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2014-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801135706/http://www.pobjeda.me/2013/07/23/budva-gradani-ne-odobravaju-paradu-ponosa-u-svom-gradu/ |archivedate=1 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 2013, a Pride event took place in the capital city of [[Podgorica]], where violent anti-gay protesters were arrested by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/10/montenegro-gay-pride-march-sparks-violence-20131020132010789429.html|title= Montenegro's gay pride march sparks violence |date=20 October 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the fifth annual Podgorica Gay Pride parade took place without any recorded incident. It was organized by the NGO "[[Queer Montenegro]]", and was attended by about 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegrin-capital-set-for-gay-pride-parade-09-21-2017 Montenegrin Capital Set for Gay Pride Parade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lengue language''', also called '''''Molengue''', '''Balengue''', '''Molendji''''', is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of southern [[Equatorial Guinea]], spoken by the [[Lengue people]] between [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]] and the [[Gabon]] border near the coast. The speakers have come under increasing [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang]] influence. The [[Ethnologue]] describes it as a member of the B subgroup of Northwest Bantu, while Echegaray is more specific, saying that it is linguistically a member of the [[Sheke languages|Sheke group]] (B21 of [[Malcolm Guthrie|Guthrie]]'s Bantu subclassification):
: "The Balengues - linguistically at least - are related to the Sheke group in general, and especially to Itemus and Nvikos." (p. 51)

Echegaray lists their main settlements as being located south of Bata between [[Punta Nguba]] and the [[Benito River]], as well as three before the [[Ndote River]], and a few further south or inland.

This is a '''list of education practices''' which have been replaced by or abandoned in favor of newer (or older) practices. To maintain a balanced point of view, each example should provide a source showing that the practice was abandoned or replaced. A practice abandoned by one school, for example [[reform mathematics]], may still be in adoption by other schools, so opposing methods may both appear on this list at different times or locations.

* [[One-room school]]s: The advent of [[school bus]]es and better transportation led to consolidating schools into larger buildings in the early 20th century. Such schools are now rare in developed countries.

* [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]: this 1957 regularization of standard English spelling was intended to permit exception-free learning of the rules, yet was strongly reminiscent of traditional spelling, and was intended to allow easy transition to the latter. The extra letters in fact had the opposite effect of confusing young readers, and by the 1960s, the issue of distinguishing the multiple sounds assigned to one letter was addressed with other methods such as [[Words in Colour]] and [[diacritical mark]]s.

'''Malcolm Klein''' (born September 4, 1930) is a criminologist, researcher, theorist, retired professor of Sociology at the [[University of Southern California]], and the author of his book ''The American Street Gang''. In addition, he continued to publish eighteen other books and more than fifty articles that are based on his research on gangs.

Throughout the forty years of his research in gangs, he primarily focused on its structures, processes, and their intervention strategies. He was the founder of the Social Science Research Institute at the University of Southern California in 1972 and furthered his agenda in research of gangs.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Scott H. "Essay in Tribute to Malcolm Klein on his recognition as the August Vollmer Award Winner, An [comments]." Criminology And Public Policy no. 1 (2009): 13. HeinOnline, EBSCOhost (accessed November 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He also began developing gang prevention and intervention strategies, which are promoted by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] (Department of Justice) and the Youth Development and Delinquency Prevention Administration (Department of Health Education and Welfare).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Delbert S. "Malcolm W. Klein: August Vollmer Award Winner, 2008 [Article]." Criminology And Public Policy 1 (2009): 19.HeinOnline. Web. 24 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; But he took his research further than the city of [[Los Angeles]]. He introduced cross-national research, stretching all the way to Europe. He began this process his extension of comparative criminology by organizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Advanced Research Workshop and later the first Eurogang Workshop in [[Schmitten, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Delbert S. "Malcolm W. Klein: August Vollmer Award Winner, 2008 [Article]." Criminology And Public Policy 1 (2009): 19.HeinOnline. Web. 24 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein is best known for his research and understanding of how gangs function and its prevention. In his research, he looked at gangs in another point of view that past theorists and researchers did not look at before. He created the connections between different variables of gangs, thus allowing other researchers to look further into the issue of delinquency of gangs. Furthermore, he contributed to comparative criminology by bringing his research into a global perspective. His contributions allowed him to be honored with the August Vollmer Award not only for his research, but also for his "justice or to the treatment or prevention of criminal or delinquent behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Scott H. "An Essay In Tribute To Malcolm Klein On His Recognition As The August Vollmer Award Winner." Criminology &amp; Public Policy 8.1 (2009): 13-18. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 28 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Klein is a Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the [[University of Southern California]]. He was born on September 4, 1930. He took part in the faculty at the Sociology Department of the University of Southern California from 1962 to 1998. From 1971 to 1984, he took the position as the Chair of the University of Southern California Sociology Department.&lt;ref&gt;Past Chairs of the USC Sociology Department. Accessed November 19, 2016. http://dornsife.usc.edu/soci/past-chairs-of-the-usc-sociology-department/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and personal views ==
Klein was most notable for his many years of research on gangs. He defines it as "any durable, street-oriented youth group whose involvement in illegal activity is part of its group identity."

One of the main things that Klein emphasizes throughout his years of research is how our law enforcement strategies against street gangs are not working. In an audio interview on the show ''Which Way, L.A.?'', Klein and the host, Warren Olney, talk about two major gang-related arrests that occurred in 2007 (the arrest of Steve Garcia and the arrest of Mario Corona, who is a former gang member with a master's degree in social research from the University of Southern California). Furthermore, they debate the controversy of releasing a top ten most wanted gang member list. Throughout Klein's career, he emphasizes the problem with giving too much attention to gangs. He concluded that the major goal of a street gang is to obtain reputation all across their territory and recognition for their delinquencies. In the audio specifically, he disagreed with the approach of law enforcement to gang activity through arrests and release of a "list" because it would not slow down gang activity, but instead would help them instead.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back in LA's War on Gangs." Interview. KCRW (audio blog), March 6, 2007. Accessed November 1, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/which-way-la/two-steps-forward-two-steps-back-in-las-war-on-gangs#seg-two-steps-forward-two-steps-back-in-las-war-on-gangs&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his years of research, he arrived at the conclusion that the more attention society provides to gangs, the more active and upward rising gang activity becomes. His evaluation on The Group Guidance Project can illustrate his point. The Group Guidance Project was a program that began back in the 1940s by the Los Angeles Probation Department with a goal of reuniting gang members to their community through different group activities such as weekly club meetings, sports activities, tutoring, individual counseling, and advocacy with community agencies and organizations. However, Klein claims that "increased group programming leads to increased cohesiveness (in both gang growth and gang 'tightness'), and increased cohesiveness leads to increased gang crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/html/ojjdp/summary_2000_8/intervention.html|title=Intervention Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=National Criminal Justice Reference Service|publisher=|access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein believes that cohesion is one (if not the biggest) part of a street gang and with programs like these, it only serves to increase cohesion between gangs by giving them a more organized methods towards their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Scott H. "Essay in Tribute to Malcolm Klein on his recognition as the August Vollmer Award Winner, An [comments]." Criminology And Public Policy no. 1 (2009): 13. HeinOnline, EBSCOhost (accessed November 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's research also expanded to an international level, where he instituted "comparative criminology." In "comparative criminology," Klein examines many differences and similarities on how different cultures affect different gangs in different regions of the world, their behavioral regulations, structures and organizations of gangs, and also delinquencies and crimes of those areas. One big project that he embarked on for this global research on gangs was the Eurogang Project in 1998, where he went to Schmitten, Germany for a conference among American and European researchers to discuss the different aspects of criminology that pertain to their own regions.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Scott H. "Essay in Tribute to Malcolm Klein on his recognition as the August Vollmer Award Winner, An [comments]." Criminology And Public Policy no. 1 (2009): 13. HeinOnline, EBSCOhost (accessed November 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his gang control options, he demonstrates it in a table.

On the left hand side, there are prevention, intervention, and suppression. These are strategies for gang control policies. "Prevention" refers to stop people from being in a gang beforehand. "Intervention" refers to come in between the people who are already in gangs and attempting to disengage them from the group or reduce their association with the gang. "Suppression" refers to stopping the illicit activities of gangs. This concept usually points to law enforcement, arrests, police, courts, correction facilities, and many others. On the top are issues that are present in gang control policies and what it looks like in an ideal policy. "Targeting" is the correct identification of people who are in gangs, whether they are preparing to join or already joining. This principle heavily relies on a person's knowledge of what a gang really is, its structure, organization, activities, effects throughout the years, history, and much more. "Group Process" refers to the idea that "gangs are groups." Klein believes that policy makers must remember that membership of gangs is solidified through opposition from enforcement and society. Once membership solidifies, it prompts others to join and bring the gang group closer. "Gang Structures" refers to the organizations of gangs and the knowledge of how each gang functions, what type of gang they fit into, and their characteristics. Finally, "Community Context" refers to the environment where the gangs take place. Klein emphasizes this concept because the community itself describes how gangs behave and their foundation of the gang. Not all these boxes would be filled, but the table can tie together different issues of dealing with street gangs and assess which aspects a policy needs to utilize to make an effective gang control policy and scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Malcolm W., and Cheryl Lee Maxson.

== Publications ==

=== ''The American Street Gang'' (1992) ===
In Klein's publication of ''The American Street Gang'', he provides us with the basic definition of street gangs, their evolution throughout the past years, their drug involvement, and reasons to why society has not stopped their actions yet. Klein describes these gangs as an organization of loose bodies tied with multiple and more casual leaderships as compared to our modern day society (with their tightly-knit organization and formal leaderships). Klein also makes a clear distinction between the common street gang and drug gangs. On one hand, a drug gang produces strict discipline on its members, who are treated as if they were employees of a company. On the other hand, a street gang is structured in terms of "loyalty" and "similar rivalries," thus producing a less strict discipline on its members. Furthermore, Klein includes a variety of statistics, anecdotes, and personal experience to demonstrate that gang activity across America is on the rise, especially with gang homicides and the general spread of the gangs themselves. Another point that Klein explains is that the liberal method towards the solution of gang activity is not working and instead, is increasing "group cohesion." He believes that the more attention that society gives to gangs, the closer the gang will be, and the greater gang activity will become. From his own personal experience, he tells readers that the programs that will gradually break down the "group cohesion" will take lots of effort to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Street Gang: Its Nature, Prevalence, and Control|last=Klein|first=Malcolm|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Responding to Troubled Youth'' (1997) ===
Klein and Cheryl Maxson provides their insights (in a more philosophical approach) towards the "troubled" youth population. The three basic social and philosophical principles that they utilize to discuss the troubled youths are "treatment, deterrence, and normalization rationales." Treatment is the adjustment of emotional problems that are present in the behaviors of status offenses of the troubled youth. Deterrence is the act of control and punishment towards status offenses to prevent further delinquencies. Normalization rationales is the recognition that status offenses are normal behaviors present in the youth population. They examine these three principles in status offenders at seven different cities and their activities in the cities' youth service agencies based on their data from surveys and experiments. Additionally, the authors analyze the legislative aspect of status offenses, particularly in state laws, policies, approaches, and ideologies that are implanted in the legislation that deals with status offenses. Towards the end of the book, Klein and Maxson head into youth runaways by describing the patterns in characteristics, family histories, living conditions, and causes of runaway youths and also different services that are available to runaway youths.&lt;ref&gt;Maxson, Cheryl Lee., and Malcolm W. Klein. Responding to Troubled Youth. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Street Gang Patterns and Policies'' (2006) ===
Malcolm Klein and Cheryl Maxson examine the different patterns in characteristics of street gangs (specifically in America) and review many major gang-control programs seen around the world. In particular, he focuses on the distribution and expansion of gangs, patterns of gang crime, and how gangs are structured and organized. Going into a more individualized level, Klein and Maxson analyze risk factors and reasons why people want to join gangs (especially in the youth population) in five different realms: individual, family, peer, school, and neighborhood. He also brings in community influences to further understand how gang develops and functions inside those communities. Lastly, Klein and Maxson provide their insights on gang prevention and intervention programs in the United States. They claim that current existing gang control methods are not only ineffective, but also are confronting the wrong parts of a gang. To deal with this, they provide a list of guidelines and goals that gang prevention and intervention programs are recommended to follow in order to control gangs more successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Malcolm W., and Cheryl Lee Maxson. Street gang patterns and policies. n.p.: Oxford ; New York : Oxford University Press, 2006., 2006. Ignacio: USF Libraries Catalog, EBSCOhost (accessed November 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Gang Cop'' (2004) ===
Klein describes the experiences of a fictional police officer who specializes in gangs named Paco Domingo based on his own observations and research throughout his time in gang activity research. By using Paco Domingo as a character, the author explains the inner structures and organization of gangs and the dangerous effects of when police officers use violent and corrupt measures to deal with gangs. Additionally, Klein talks about one of the most important part of the journey of a gang cop, their training. Overall, this book highlights the main points that are useful for those interested in the spread of gangs in America, such as criminologists, lawyers, law enforcement, police officers, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Malcolm W.

== Activities ==

=== Eurogang Project (1998) ===
The European Research Group, led by Klein himself, was a conference that took place in Schmitten, Germany in 1998.(2) During this three-day time period, he attempted to produce comparative gang criminology into a global context by starting with Europe. Klein brought many different questions to hand, such as whether or not gangs exist in Europe, what the patterns and methods of gangs are, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Scott H. "Essay in Tribute to Malcolm Klein on his recognition as the August Vollmer Award Winner, An [comments]." Criminology And Public Policy no. 1 (2009): 13. HeinOnline, EBSCOhost (accessed November 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; From thereafter, many European and American researchers in the conference (with Klein being the lead author) edited and published the first volume of ''The Eurogang Paradox'' (2001), explaining the denials held by European criminology researchers that street gangs were nonexistent in Europe because of the big difference between the definition and patterns of an "American" gang versus a "European" gang in their prospective regions.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Delbert S. "Malcolm W. Klein: August Vollmer Award Winner, 2008 [article]." Criminology And Public Policy no. 1 (2009): 19. HeinOnline, EBSCOhost (accessed November 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ladino Hills Project (1967) ===
The Ladino Hills Project was a project designed by Klein in 1967 in Eastern Los Angeles to combat "group interventions." He began by implementing interventions that based more on the individual rather than the gang as a group. During this time, he included job training, tutoring, recreation in established agencies, and individual therapy in his interventions. From his evaluation, he found that while the sizes of gangs were reduced, the overall rate of delinquency as a gang decreased as well.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Scott H. "Essay in Tribute to Malcolm Klein on his recognition as the August Vollmer Award Winner, An [comments]." Criminology And Public Policy no. 1 (2009): 13. HeinOnline, EBSCOhost (accessed November 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, while gang cohesiveness dropped by 40 percent, the number of gang member arrests reduced by 35%. From the project, he states, "we had affected the [gang members] but not their community. The lesson is both obvious and important. Gangs are byproducts of their communities: They cannot long be controlled by attacks on symptoms alone; community structure and capacity must also be targeted."&lt;ref&gt;"Intervention Programs."

The '''Movement Against Illegal Immigration (DPNI)''' ({{lang-ru|Движение против нелегальной иммиграции — ДПНИ}}) is a Russian [[nationalist]] and anti-[[Illegal immigration]] organization. The organization is led by [[Alexander Potkin|Aleksandr Belov (Potkin)]] a former member of [[ultra-nationalist]] [[Pamyat]]. Belov was a press spokesman for Pamyat's leader, Dmitry Vasilyev. The DPNI was declared extremist by the High Court of Russian Federation and banned in 2011.&lt;ref name="Lenta090811"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2011/08/09/dpni/|date=9 August 2011|title=Верховный суд подтвердил запрет ДПНИ (High court confirmed MAII ban)|publisher=Lenta.ru|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65IEi0ZOD|archivedate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Movement Against Illegal Immigration was created on July 10, 2002, in reaction to ethnic violence between residents of a Moscow's suburb and immigrants from the [[South Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]]. The Movement Against Illegal Immigration have organized a number of rallies against illegal immigration throughout Russia. It also takes part in carrying out the annual [[Russian March]], a Russian ethnic pride display and protest event.  Aside from mass protests the movement is active in organizing public pressure to support ethnic [[Russians]] in number of high-profile court cases involving crimes committed by the immigrants.

The Movement Against Illegal Immigration is one of the more active political organizations in Russia with about 5000 members in 30 different regions.

=== Leadership ===
* 2002-2008: Vladimir Basmanov 
* 2008-2010: [[Alexander Potkin|Aleksandr Belov (Potkin)]]
* 2010–Present: Vladimir Yermolayev

== Critics ==
Some liberal rights activists have filed complaints with the Russian authorities and tried to ban the DPNI because they believe it is "pursuing a fascist agenda", exemplified by slogans such as "Russia is for Russians!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wps.ru/en/pp/politruk/2006/11/10.html|title=Politruk / PressPATROL / Media Monitoring Agency WPS|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activity ==
In April 2007, former [[Rodina (political party)|Rodina]] legislator [[Dmitry Rogozin]] announced the creation of a political party, the [[Great Russia Party]], from the membership of the [[Congress of Russian Communities]] and the DPNI.

The DPNI has said it would like to see [[Belarus]]ian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] become [[President of Russia]] in 2008. This is not possible under the Russian constitution, as Lukashenko is not a citizen of Russia. Regardless, Lukashenko rejected the offer in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Street protest and militia activity ==
During ethnic riots in the northern Russian city of [[Kondopoga]], in August–September 2006, the DPNI provided an up to the minute online coverage of the unfolding situation in response to what it saw as the media's [[Political correctness|politically correct]] silence about what was happening there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/14/eng20060914_302534.html Migrants flee town after racial violence]&lt;/ref&gt; DPNI representatives arrived in the town shortly after riots had commenced, and were able to largely control the flow of news and events in the absence of any reaction from local authorities or police. The DPNI, led by their leader [[Alexander Potkin|Aleksandr Belov (Potkin)]], organized an "assembly" and advocated the deportation of Chechen and other migrants within 24 hours. Belov was later indicted for disturbing the peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fontanka.ru/2006/09/11/174280/|title=Кондопога: кому это нужно?|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June, few DPNI members took part in inter-ethnic fighting in the center of Moscow, near the Kremlin, according to Moscow city authorities, resulting in 42 arrests. DPNI leader Belov defended the action as having been provoked by ethnic groups from the Caucasus region (Chechens, etc.) who were dancing and conducting themselves loudly when prayers were to be conducted at the Monument to the Heroes of [[Siege of Plevna|Plevna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/23jun2007/dpni.html|title=Власти Москвы: массовую драку в центре города спровоцировали националисты|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of participants in the fighting range from 50 to 200; other groups participating included the [[Slavic Union]], the [[Russian Public National Union]] (RONS), and the "St. George" youth group ("георгиевцы").&lt;ref&gt;SOVA Center website, http://xeno.sova-center.ru/45A29F2/9675D39&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2007, the DPNI announced the formation of armed "People's Self-Defense" groups to defend "indigenous citizens" against "the aggressive actions of criminal migrants." The groups will be trained in hand-to-hand fighting and are required to obtain "legal hunting weapons and handguns."&lt;ref&gt;DPNI website, www.dpni.org/articles/lenta_novo/2809/&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, the DPNI had announced creation of "mobile fighting groups", composed of cell networks of five persons each, whose members would have access to automobiles and legal weapons. The 2005 announcement cited a "possible worsening of the internal political situation in the Russian Federation and the likelihood of mass disorders and aggressive actions by foreign states."&lt;ref&gt;SOVA Center website, http://xeno.sova-center.ru/45A29F2/550BF9B&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DPNI website, www.dpni.org, accessed via Google cache&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ban ==
The Movement Against Illegal Immigration was banned by the Moscow City Court on April 18, 2011. According to prosecutors, DPNI leaders had repeatedly taken part in events aimed at igniting interethnic hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/politics/russia-court-movement-ban/|title=Court bans Russian anti-illegal immigration movement|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not enter into force across Russia because it was appealed. At the same time, the 18 February 2011 decree of Moscow Chief Prosecutor about the suspension of the activities of the organization is in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpni.org/articles/novosti__d/22206/|title=ДПНИ Лента новостей. Последние новости экономики, криминала, политики|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the High Court of Russian Federation has issued a federal ban of the organization.&lt;ref name="Lenta090811" /&gt;

'''Mozambican Sign Language''' ({{lang-pt|Língua de Sinais Moçambicana}}) is the principal language of the deaf community of [[Mozambique]]. It is reported to have "some dialectal variation", and to be spoken in at least the three largest cities of [[Maputo]], [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], and [[Nampula]]. As of 1999, there were efforts at standardization. MSL is not based on [[Portuguese Sign Language]]—or for that matter on [[American Sign Language]]—but other than that, its origin is not recorded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11564">'''Nakorotubu''' is a [[Tikina|district]] in [[Fiji]]'s [[Ra Province|Ra]] [[Local government in Fiji|Province]].  It is made up seven sub-districts or ''[[Tikina makawa]]'', namely,
[[Kavula]], [[Nakorotubu (sub-district)|Nakorotubu]], [[Navitilevu]], [[Bureiwai|Bure-i-wai]], [[Bureivanua|Bure-i-vanua]], [[Mataso]], and [[Nakuailava]].

==Geography==
The first four are coastal districts with extensive inland undulating and rugged terrain, while the rest are all inland. [[Fishing]], [[sugar cane]], [[coconut]], [[taro]], [[tapioca]] and a range of local vegetables are the main trading merchandise.

==Chiefly title==
In 1986, the 'Bose Vanua Cokovata Nakorotubu' held in Namarai village appointed as the traditional leader -the late [[Turaga na Gonesau]], [[Ratu]] Dr [[Wilisoni Malani|Wilisoni Tuiketei Malani]] OBE, younger brother of the late Ratu Meli Salabogi (3) MBE, from the chiefly village of [[Nabukadra]] in the district of [[Kavula]]. Their father, Ratu Kuliniyasi Roko Malani (1) held the British colonial title of chief administrator of Kavula District - 'Buli Kavula' from 1911- 1932. 

According to Sayes, Sally Annes, Ratu Meli Salabogi (1) (their Great Grandfather) declared Nakorotubu as an independent state in 1860 to protest of Cakobau declaring himself as a self-styled Tui Viti during the Deed of Cession negotiation with Great Britain. 

The cause of the protest must have been inspired from an ancestral feud and dislike which had trickled down from Raivalita, (Ratu Meli Salabogi's (1) Grandancestor) on a sex scandal by Niumataiwalu, high chief from the Vuanirewa clan in Lau with Raivalita's brother's wife (Nadurucoko 2's wife- Radini Levuka). This resulted in the birth of Banuve (Cakobau's grandfather). 

Nadurucoko 2 later sent a ''tabua'' (whales tooth) to Ono i Lau as a price for Niumataiwalu's head which resulted in his death when he was murdered by a Ono i Lau chief (Fergus Clunie, Fiji Museum, Julia Brooke-White - 1986).

According to historical records, both Raivalita and Nadurucoko 2 were sons of Nailatikau Nabuinivuaka (1) and grandsons of Nadurucoko 1, the ruler of Korolevu Fort near Dewala creek in the interior of Nakorotubu in the Ra province. Nailatikau (1) had murdered his brother Vurewa near the Dewala creek (refer to native reserve map marked as ''Laba'') and ran away to his half-brother, Nacamavuto (same mother in Senibuli) on the Ra coast of Kavula, who then gave him a ''tabua'' and advised him to spent time in exile in Bau with his relative, the Roko Tui Bau (Native Lands Commission (NLC), 'Tukutuku ni Yavusa Kubuna', Ratu Isoa Natuituba, 1918). 

While settling in Bau, the overall chief of Bau at that time - Roko Tui Bau observed Nailatikau (1) superior tactical confrontation in warfare (NLC Records 1918, 'Tukutuku ni Yavusa Kubuna' by Ratu Isoa Natuituba). Roko Tui Bau then bestowed him as the first Vunivalu (Warlord) of Kubuna, arranged for Adi Kulanawa from Verata as his wife and also named Nailatikau (1) eldest son as Raivalita or Raivolita.

Nailatikau's (1) loyal warriors that were guarding the top of Korolevu Fort (Delainakorolevu) along the Dewala creek (leading into the Wainibuka river) in the interior of Nakorotubu followed him to Bau (referred to as ''Yavusa Delai''). He later banished them to Levuka, Lakeba in Lau for eating a fish harvest without any prior traditional presentation to him. Nailatikau (1) named one of the two hills on Bau island as Uluinaceva in memory of the Yavusa Ratu hill fort near Nabukadra village and Delainakoro in short for Delainakorolevu in the interior of Nakorotubu along the Dewala creek. The two hills were partly leveled during the construction of the Vunivalu tomb in 1982.

A few years after Nailatikau (1) had passed on, Niumataiwalu (Vuanirewa) led a delegation of the Yavusa Delai from Levuka, Lakeba in Lau to Bau to seek forgiveness to his younger son, Nadurucoko 2 (who was away in Vuna, Taveuni at that time) on the unauthorized eating of the fish harvest that was meant for his late father. During the merry making/celebration after the forgiveness function (''matanigasau/ soro''), the adultery affair was committed by Nadurucoko 2's wife and Niumataiwalu that resulted in the birth of Banuve who begat Tanoa and who begat Cakobau. This was also how the Vunivalu's wife- title became known as ''Radini Levuka'' or the Queen of Levuka.  

Based on this earlier ancestral scandal, Ratu Meli Salabogi (1) together with other Nakorotubu and Viwa chiefs raised their concerns about Cakobau (being Niumataiwalu's descendant and not of the original Vunivalu) self-declaring himself as Tui Viti (Smythe Report to Queen Victoria). As a follow up from this protest, Ratu Meli Salabogi (1) declared Nakorotubu as an independent state from Fiji in 1860. (Haynes. S.A 1984). The deed of cession to Great Britain was put on hold for another fourteen (14) years until 1874 when Ratu Meli Salabogi had passed on.

To maintain traditional stability during post 'deed of cession' era, one of the descendants of Raivalita, eldest child of the 1st Vunivalu Nailatikau Nabuinivuaka will reside for one night at the Vatanitawake Chiefly house in Bau, guarded by Nakorotubu traditional warriors, i.e. 1959 installation (Ratu Kuliniyasi Roko Malani (2)) and the aborted June 8th 2018 installation (Ratu Meli Salabogi Malani (4)). A tabua (whales tooth) of request will be presented the next morning by Tunitoga (Chief Representative of the Vunivalu) to Raivalita's descendant at Vatanitawake requesting him to lead the delegation across to Mataiwelagi to handover the authority of 'Vunivalu  kei Kubuna' through a ritual handover speech, hand shake and 'yabo' i.e. breath-in kiss on the cheek. He will then lead the Vunivalu-elect only to the entrance of the installation shed before he retreats to Vatanitawake and will not be part of the second installation. The second installation for the Tui Kaba title, is performed by Roko Tui Bau, Tunitoga and the Tui Kaba clan. 

There is another NLC ex-file version (private interview of Rt Meli Salabogi-NLC records, 1918) that explains the Vatanitawake handover. This is by virtue of Dewala/Dauwala's wife having an affair with Vueti at Suva (near Bureiwai) upon his return from his victory over the twins in Nakauvadra en route to Moturiki and then later Bau. This resulted in the birth of Nadurucoko, Raivalita's grandfather. Hence when his son, Nailatikau Buinvuaka was chased by the Dewala warriors, he was advised and given a tabua by his half brother (Nacamavuto from Kavula) to flee to Bau and introduce himself to his great-grandfather (Vueti) the first original Roko Tui Bau. He was then installed as his Vunivalu. Therefore the handover ceremony is undertaken by a descendant from Nakorotubu with two (2) hats of authority, i.e original Vunivalu and Roko Tui Bau.  

Other chiefly lineages within Nakorotubu district differs according to their respective heritage.

==History==
In the centre of Nabukadra is the grave of Ratu [[Mara Kapaiwai]], a high chief of [[Bau Island]], who was killed as a result of intra-family rivalries involving his cousin, the then ruler of the kingdom of Bau, Ratu [[Seru Cakobau]] in the early 19th century (Deryck Scarr, 1980). 

The grave remains a prominent landmark in the centre of the village (Deryck Scarr, 1980), a showcase of victory over Bau. The Nakorotubu warriors snatched the body from Bau and had a proper burial in Nabukadra before Kapaiwai's heart could be eaten by Cakobau. This action prevented Kapaiwai's descendants (such as the late Fiji's statesman and first Fiji Legislative Council Speaker- Ratu Sir Vanayaliyali Sukuna) to be relegated as insignificant in status (bokola).

Other recorded significant victories by the Nakorotubu warriors include the Puakaloa or Vuakaloa campaign conquer of the old chiefly Kedekede fort of the Vuanirewa clan in Lakeba, Lau (Reid, A.C 1980) and the conquer of the whole of Vanua Levu (Cakaudrove, Bua and Macuata) in the ' Torotorosila campaign' (Sayes, S.A 1984), (see also Reid, A.C 1990).

Nakorotubu is also well known for its richness in culture and tradition. Some of Fiji's best traditional dances or meke such as 'raude' now turned into a song by the famous Black Rose band which originates from Nakorotubu. The Fiji Military Forces has adopted a number of these mekes as its own, as well as a number for leading public schools in Fiji such as Queen Victoria School and Ratu Kadavulevu School.

==Infrastructure and development==
Public infrastructure is not as well developed compared to other districts in Fiji which does not help with people living their daily lives, but there is an impressive degree of resilience and unity among the local people which is a hallmark of the people of Ra Province that enables them to create the best out of their beautiful natural environment.

The picturesque inland districts are joined to other provinces by the Kings Road, one of the country's main roads, which is struggling to receive sufficient fund to complete the tar-sealing work for the last remaining kilometers.

Development projects are generally carried out on a communal basis with finances coming from government, donors and the people themselves. Examples of projects are village pipe water system, power generation, village toilets and septic tanks, village meeting halls, nursing and health stations, schools and pre-school facilities etc.

Many landowning units are interested in developing their land commercially and whilst there are many options, growing organic produces for export will fetch a healthy return. Given the scarcity of capital, many people will be keen to discuss with prospective investors how they together can develop the land commercially on a joint venture and mutually beneficial basis.

{{Business administration}}

'''Organizational behavior''' ('''OB''') or '''organisational behaviour''' is "the study of [[human behavior]] in organizational settings, the interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself".&lt;ref name = "Moorhead"&gt;Moorhead, G., &amp; Griffin, R. W. (1995). ''Organizational behavior: Managing people and organizations'' (5th edition). Boston. Houghton Mifflin, (p.4)&lt;/ref&gt; OB research can be categorized{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} in at least three ways, including the study of:&lt;ref&gt; Management which is the process of stated Objectives, Planning, Organizing, Directing, Controlling, and Staffing to achieve stated (formalized) objectives.

&lt;/ref&gt;

* individuals in organizations (micro-level)
* work groups (meso-level)
* how organizations behave (macro-level)

==Overview==
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their organizational role than when acting separately from the organization.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Organizational behavior researchers study the behavior of individuals primarily in their organizational roles. One of the main goals of organizational behavior is "to revitalize organizational theory and develop a better conceptualization of organizational life".&lt;ref&gt;Simms, L.M., Price, S.A., &amp; Ervin, N.E. (1994). ''The professional practice of nursing administration''. Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers. (p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to industrial and organizational psychology==

Miner (2006) mentioned that "there is a certain arbitrariness" in identifying a "point at which organizational behavior became established as a distinct discipline" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), suggesting that it could have emerged in the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, J.B. (2006). ''Organizational behavior, Vol. 3: Historical origins, theoretical foundations, and the future''. Armonk, NY and London: M.E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt; He also underlined the fact that the industrial psychology division of the American Psychological Association did not add "organizational" to its name until 1970, "long after organizational behavior had clearly come into existence" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), noting that a similar situation arose in sociology. Although there are similarities and differences between the two disciplines, there is still confusion around differentiating organizational behavior and organizational psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S. &amp; Britt, T. (2008). ''Organizational psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach. 2nd ed''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As a multi-disciplinary , organizational behavior has been influenced by developments in a number of related disciplines including: [[Sociology]], [[industrial/organizational psychology]], and [[economics]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] is a period from the 1760s where new technologies resulted in the adoption of new manufacturing techniques and increased mechanization. In his famous [[iron cage]] metaphor, [[Max Weber]] raised concerns over the reduction in religious and vocational work experiences. Weber claimed that the Industrial Revolution's focus on efficiency constrained the worker to a kind of "prison" and "stripped a worker of their individuality".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, M. (1993). ''The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism'' (T. Parsons, Trans.). London, England: Routledge. (Original work published 1904–1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The significant social and cultural changes caused by the Industrial Revolution also gave rise to new forms of organization. Weber analyzed one of these organizations and came to the conclusion that bureaucracy was "an organization that rested on [[rational-legal]] principles and maximized technical efficiency."&lt;ref name="Weber1947"&gt;[[Weber, Max]]. The Theory of Social and Economic Organization. Translated by A.M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. London: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of OB practitioners documented their ideas about management and organisation. The best known theories today originate from [[Henri Fayol]], [[Chester Barnard]], and [[Mary Parker Follet]]. All three of them drew from their experience to develop a model of effective organizational management, and each of their theories independently shared a focus on human behavior and motivation.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938&gt;{{cite book |title= The Functions of the Executive |last= Barnard |first= Chester I. |authorlink= Chester Barnard |year= 1938 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA |oclc= 555075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fayol1917 &gt;{{citation | last=Fayol | first=Henri | year=1917 | title=Administration industrielle et générale; prévoyance, organisation, commandement, coordination, controle | publisher =Paris, H. Dunod et E. Pinat | language=French | oclc=40224931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamic Administration: The Collected Papers of Mary Parker Follett|last=Follett|first=Henry C.|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0415279852}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first [[management consulting|management consultants]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]], was a 19th-century engineer who applied an approach known as the [[scientific management]]. Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"&gt;{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = Frederick Winslow | authorlink = Frederick Winslow Taylor | year = 1911 | title = The Principles of Scientific Management | publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers | location = New York, NY, USA and London, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HoJMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;f=false | oclc = 233134 | doi =   | ref = harv | postscript =. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6435 Also available from Project Gutenberg].'' | lccn = 11010339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method was further refined by [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]], who utilized [[time and motion study]] to further improve worker efficiency.&lt;ref name="price1989"&gt;Price, B 1989, ‘Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and the Manufacture and Marketing of Motion Study, 1908-1924’, Business and Economic History, vol. 18, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the idea of [[Fordism]] emerged. Named after automobile mogul [[Henry Ford]], the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently. Sorenson later clarified that Fordism developed independently of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, C. E. (1956). ''My forty years with Ford''. New York, NY: Collier Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Fordism can be explained as the application of bureaucratic and scientific management principles to whole manufacturing process. The success of the scientific method and Fordism resulted in the widespread adoption of these methods.

In the 1920s, the [[Hawthorne Works]] [[Western Electric]] factory commissioned the first of what was to become known as the [[Hawthorne Studies]]. These studies initially adhered to the traditional scientific method, but also investigated whether workers would be more productive with higher or lower lighting levels. The results showed that regardless of lighting levels, when workers were being studied, productivity increased, but when the studies ended, worker productivity would return to normal. In following experiments, [[Elton Mayo]] concluded that [[job performance]] and the so-called [[Hawthorne Effect]] was strongly correlated to social relationships and job content.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"&gt;Cullen, David O'Donald. ''A new way of statecraft: The career of Elton Mayo and the development of the social sciences in America, 1920–1940.'' ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1992; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Hawthorne Studies [[motivation]] became a focal point in the OB community. A range of theories emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and include theories from notable OB researchers such as: [[Frederick Herzberg]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[David McClelland]], [[Victor Vroom]], and [[Douglas McGregor]]. These theories underline employee motivation, [[work performance]], and [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name = "Miner"/&gt;

[[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]]'s ''[[Administrative Behavior]]'' introduced a number of important OB concepts, most notably decision-making. Simon, along with [[Chester Barnard]], argued that people make decisions differently inside an organization when compared to their decisions outside of an organization. While classical economic theories assume that people are rational decision-makers, Simon argued a contrary point. He argued that cognition is limited because of [[bounded rationality]] For example, decision-makers often employ [[satisficing]], the process of utilizing the first marginally acceptable solution rather than the most optimal solution.&lt;ref name = "Simon1997"&gt;[[Simon, Herbert A.]] (1997) ''Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations, 4th ed., The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his work on organizational decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Studies of decision-making lead to prize in economics|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=16 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the field started to become more [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[resource dependence|resource dependent]]. This gave rise to [[contingency theory]], [[institutional theory]], and [[organizational ecology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Starting in the 1980s, cultural explanations of organizations and organizational change became areas of study, in concert with fields such as [[anthropology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

==Current state of the field==
Research in and the teaching of OB primarily takes place in university [[management]] departments in colleges of business. Sometimes OB topics are taught in [[industrial and organizational psychology]] graduate programs.

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
There have been additional developments in OB research and practice. [[Anthropology]] has become increasingly influential, and led to the idea that one can understand firms as communities, by introducing concepts such as [[organizational culture]], organizational rituals, and symbolic acts.&lt;ref name="Moorhead"/&gt; [[Leadership studies]] have also become part of OB.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} OB researchers have shown increased interest in ethics and its importance in an organization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some OB researchers have become interested in the aesthetic sphere of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = S. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Finding form: Looking at the field of organizational aesthetics drawing on theories and methods from the humanities, including theater, literature, music, and art. | url = | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 6| pages = 1211–1231 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00539.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods used==
A variety of methods are used in organizational behavior, many of which are found in other social sciences.

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main article|Quantitative research}}
Statistical methods used in OB research commonly include [[correlation]], [[analysis of variance]], [[meta-analysis]], [[multilevel model]]ing, [[multiple regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[time series analysis]]&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"&gt;Brewerton, P.M., &amp; Millward, L.J. (2010). ''Organizational research methods: A guide for students and researchers. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/organizational-research-methods/journal200894#description ''Organizational Research Methods'' (journal)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer simulation===
{{Main article|Computer simulation and organization studies}}

Computer simulation is a prominent method in organizational behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Lin, Carroll, &amp; Carley, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many uses for [[computer simulation]], most OB researchers have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. More recently, however, researchers have also started to apply computer simulation to understand individual behavior at a micro-level, focusing on individual and interpersonal [[cognition]] and [[behavior]]&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main article|Qualitative research}}
Qualitative research&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"/&gt; consists of a number of methods of inquiry that generally do not involve the quantification of variables. Qualitative methods can range from the [[content analysis]] of interviews or written material to written narratives of observations. Common methods include [[ethnography]], [[case study|case studies]], historical methods, and interviews.

==Topics==

=== Consulting ===
Consultants use principles developed in OB research to assess clients' organizational problems and provide high quality services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ob.blogsite.org/index.php/2018/02/06/how-to-work-with-a-demanding-client/|title=How to work with a demanding client – Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|date=2018-02-06|work=Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{Main article|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Counterproductive work behavior is employee behavior that harms or intends to harm an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P. E., &amp; Fox, S. (2005). The Stressor-Emotion Model of Counterproductive Work Behavior. In S. Fox, P. E. Spector (Eds.), ''Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets'' (pp. 151-174). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10893-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making===
{{Main article|Decision-making}}

Many OB researchers embrace the [[rational planning model]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Decision-making research often focuses on how decisions are ordinarily made (normative decision-making), how thinkers arrive at a particular judgement (descriptive decision-making), and how to improve this decision-making (prescriptive decision-making).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Employee mistreatment===

There are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations including: Abusive supervision, bullying, incivility, and sexual harassment.

====Abusive supervision====
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}

Abusive supervision is the extent to which a [[supervisor]] engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi = 10.2307/1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bullying====
{{Main article|Workplace bullying}}
Although definitions of workplace bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at Work: A Perspective From Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (Eds.), Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets. (pp. 271-296). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a behavior to be termed bullying, the individual or individuals doing the harm have to possesses (either singly or jointly) more power than the victim.

====Incivility====
{{Main article|Workplace incivility}}

Workplace incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and [[rude]] behavior and is characterized by an ambiguous intent to harm, and the violation of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] governing appropriate workplace behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | doi = 10.5465/amr.1999.2202131 | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 452–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual harassment====
{{Main article|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, often creating an offensive workplace that interferes with job performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rospenda, K. M., &amp; Richman, J. A. (2005). Harassment and discrimination. In J. Barling, E. K. Kelloway &amp; M. R. Frone (Eds.), Handbook of work stress (pp. 149-188). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams===
{{Main article|Team}}

===Job-related attitudes and emotions===
Organizational behavior deals with employee attitudes and feelings, including [[job satisfaction]], [[organizational commitment]], and [[emotional labor]]. Job satisfaction reflects the feelings an employee has about his or her job or facets of the job, such as pay or supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, W. K. &amp; Gillespie, J. Z. (2007). Job satisfaction. In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 1 (pp. 406-413). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational commitment represents the extent to which employees feel attached to their organization.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, N. J. Organizational commitment. In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 2 (pp. 548-551). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional labor concerns the requirement that an employee display certain emotions, such smiling at customers, even when the employee does not feel the emotion he or she is required to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashkanasy | first1 = N. M. | last2 = Härtel | first2 = C. E. J. | last3 = Daus | first3 = C. S. | year = 2002 | title = Diversity and emotion: The new frontiers in organizational behavior research | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 307–338 | doi=10.1177/014920630202800304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{Main article|Leadership}}
There have been a number of theories that concern leadership. Early theories focused on characteristics of leaders, while later theories focused on leader behavior, and conditions under which leaders can be effective. Among these approaches are [[contingency theory]], the [[consideration and initiating structure]] model, [[leader-member exchange theory|leader-member exchange or LMX theory]], [[path-goal theory]], and [[transformational leadership theory]].

Contingency theory indicates that good leadership depends on characteristics of the leader and the situation.&lt;ref name="Fielder1"&gt;Fiedler, F. E. (1978). The contingency model and the dynamics of the leadership process. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 59-112). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ohio State Leadership Studies identified dimensions of leadership known as consideration (showing concern and respect for subordinates) and initiating structure (assigning tasks and setting performance goals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleishman | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Harris | first2 = E. F. | year = 1962 | title = Patterns of leadership behavior related to employee grievances and turnover | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 43–56 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1962.tb01845.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy, P. E. (2006). Industrial/organizational psychology: Understanding the workplace.

===Managerial roles===

{{Main article|Mintzberg's managerial roles}}
In the late 1960s [[Henry Mintzberg]], a graduate student at MIT, carefully studied the activities of five executives. On the basis of his observations, Mintzberg arrived at three categories that subsume managerial roles: interpersonal roles, decisional roles, and informational roles.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, S. P. (2009). Organizational behaviour. Cape Town, Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
Baron and Greenberg (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Robert A., and Greenberg, Jerald. ''Behavior in organizations'' &amp;ndash; 9th edition. Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey: 2008. p.248&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that motivation involves "the set of processes that arouse, direct, and maintain human behavior toward attaining some goal." There are several different theories of motivation relevant to OB, including [[equity theory]],&lt;ref name="Adams1965"&gt;Adams, J. S. (1965). Inequity in social exchange. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 276-299). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[expectancy theory]],&lt;ref name="Vroom1964"&gt;Vroom, V. H. (1964).

M. (1960). The human side of enterprise. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National culture===

National culture is thought to affect the behavior of individuals in organizations. This idea is exemplified by [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory]]. Hofstede surveyed a large number of cultures and identified six dimensions of national cultures that influence the behavior of individuals in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, Geert, Gert Jan Hofstede and Michael Minkov.Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term orientation vs. short term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint.

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
{{Main article|Organizational citizenship behavior}}

Organizational citizenship behavior is behavior that goes beyond assigned tasks and contributes to the well-being of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Organ, D. W. (1988). Organizational citizenship behavior: The good soldier syndrome. Lexington, MA, England: Lexington Books/D C Heath and Com.f&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational culture===
{{Main article|Organizational culture}}

Organizational culture reflects the values and behaviors that are commonly observed in an organization. Investigators who pursue this line of research assume that organizations can be characterized by cultural dimensions such as beliefs, values, rituals, symbols, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Shein, Edgar (1992). Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have developed models for understanding an organization's culture or developed typologies of organizational culture. [[Edgar Schein]] developed a model for understanding organizational culture. He identified three levels of organizational culture: (a) artifacts and behaviors, (b) espoused values, and (c) shared basic assumptions. Specific cultures have been related to organizational performance&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, John and Heskett, James L. (1992) Corporate Culture and Performance, Free Press; {{ISBN|0-02-918467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Denison, Daniel R. (1990) Corporate culture and organizational effectiveness, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
{{Main article|Personality}}
Personality concerns consistent patterns of behavior, [[cognition]], and [[emotion]] in individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, W., Shoda, Y., &amp; Smith, R. E. (2004). ''Introduction to personality: Toward an integration''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The study of personality in organizations has generally focused on the relation of specific traits to employee performance. There has been a particular focus on the [[Big Five personality traits]], which refers to five overarching personality traits.

===Occupational stress===
{{Main article|Occupational stress}}

There are number of ways to characterize occupational stress. One way of characterizing it is to term it an imbalance between job demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help manage the demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demerouti | first1 = E. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A. B. | last3 = Nachreiner | first3 = F. | last4 = Schaufeli | first4 = W.

===Work-family===
{{Main article|Work-family conflict}}
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their work role than when acting in roles outside their work role.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Work-family conflict occurs when the demands of family and work roles are incompatible, and the demands of at least one role interfere with the discharge of the demands of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenhaus | first1 = J. H. | last2 = Beutell | first2 = N. J. | year = 1985 | title = Sources and conflict between work and family roles | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 76–88 | doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4277352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization theory==
{{Main article|Organizational theory}}
Organization theory is concerned with explaining the workings of an organization as a whole or of many organizations. The focus of organizational theory is to understand the structure and processes of organizations and how organizations interact with each other and the larger society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Bureaucracy===

{{Main article|Bureaucracy}}

[[Max Weber]] argued that bureaucracy involved the application of [[rational-legal]] authority to the organization of work, making bureaucracy the most technically efficient form of organization.&lt;ref name="Weber1947"/&gt; Weber enumerated a number of principles of bureaucratic organization including: a formal organizational hierarchy, management by rules, organization by functional specialty, selecting people based on their skills and technical qualifications, an "up-focused" (to organization's board or shareholders) or "in-focused" (to the organization itself) mission, and a purposefully impersonal environment (e.g., applying the same rules and structures to all members of the organization). These rules reflect Weberian "ideal types," and how they are enacted in organizations varies according to local conditions. [[Charles Perrow]] extended Weber's work, arguing that all organizations can be understood in terms of bureaucracy and that organizational failures are more often a result of insufficient application of bureaucratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1986). ''Complex organizations: A critical essay'' (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theories of organization===

At least three theories are relevant here, [[theory of the firm]], [[transaction cost economics]], and [[agency theory]].

===Theories pertaining to organizational structures===

Theories pertaining to organizational structures and dynamics include [[complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[French and Raven's five bases of power]],&lt;ref&gt;French, J. R. P., Jr., &amp; Raven, B. (1959). The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Studies in social power (pp. 150-167). Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybrid organization|hybrid organization theory]], [[informal organization|informal organizational theory]], [[resource dependence theory]], and [[Mintzberg]]'s [[organigraph]].

===Institutional theory===

{{Main article|Institutional theory}}

===Systems theory===

{{Main article|Systems theory}}
The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory. [[Organization]]s are complex, goal-oriented entities.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1978). ''The social psychology of organizations'' (2 ed.). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Bogdanov]], an early thinker in the field, developed his [[tectology]], a theory widely considered a precursor of [[Bertalanffy]]'s [[general systems theory]]. One of the aims of general systems theory was to model human organizations. [[Kurt Lewin]], a social psychologist, was influential in developing a systems perspective with regard to organizations. He coined the term "systems of ideology," partly based on his frustration with behaviorist psychology, which he believed to be an obstacle to sustainable work in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ash | first1 = M.G. | year = 1992 | title = Cultural contexts and scientific change in psychology: Kurt Lewin in Iowa | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 198–207 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.47.2.198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niklas Luhmann]], a sociologist, developed a sociological systems theory.

===Organizational ecology===

{{Main article|Organizational ecology}}
Organizational ecology models apply concepts from [[evolutionary theory]] to the study of populations of organisations, focusing on birth (founding), growth and change, and death (firm mortality). In this view, organizations are 'selected' based on their fit with their operating environment.

===Scientific management===
{{Main article|Scientific management}}

Scientific management refers to an approach to management based on principles of [[engineering]]. It focuses on incentives and other practices empirically shown to improve productivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6546">[[Image:ScarletLetter.svg|right|thumb|The scarlet 'A']]
The '''Out Campaign''' is a public awareness initiative for [[freethought]] and [[atheism]]. It was initiated by Robin Elisabeth Cornwell, and is endorsed by [[Richard Dawkins]], a prominent atheist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/887-the-amazing-meeting-8-2010-speakers-and-performers.html&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aims to create more openness about being an atheist by providing a means by which atheists can identify themselves to others by displaying the movement's [[Scarlet Letter (disambiguation)|scarlet letter]] ''A'', a scarlet colored capital "A" in the [[Zapfino]] typeface, and an [[allusion]] to the scarlet letter ''A'' worn by [[Hester Prynne]] after being convicted of [[adultery]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianity.com/11555977/ Religion Must Be Destroyed, Atheist Alliance Declares by Matt Purple]&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages those who wish to be part of the campaign to come out and re-appropriate, in a humorous way, the [[social stigma]] that in some places persists against atheism, by branding themselves with a [[The Scarlet Letter|scarlet letter]].
{{cquote|... there is a big closet population of atheists who need to come out.|20|20|[[Richard Dawkins]]|2007&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2180660,00.html

|date=2007-10-01
|accessdate=2007-12-30
|publisher=The Guardian

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cornwell has stated that the [[Gay Liberation|gay rights movement]] was a source of inspiration for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Dawkins to preach atheism to US
|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3087486.ece

|accessdate=2007-12-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The campaign, however, encourages one to "[[coming out|out]]" only oneself; it invites atheists to:
* ''Reach out'' and talk to others about atheism and help spread a positive view of atheism
* ''Speak out'' about their own beliefs and values without feeling intimidated, thus helping people realize that atheists don't fit stereotypes and are a very diverse group
* ''Keep out'', meaning to promote the idea that religion should be kept out of public schools and government, and that nobody's religious agenda should be allowed to intimidate
* ''Stand out'' and become visible in their communities and become involved. An offshoot of Stand out is the Non-Believers Giving Aid campaign, which has raised money to help out in the aftermath of disaster. The A+ symbol used in the campaign refers to Atheists Standing out for their activism in social and humanitarian efforts.

[[Image:Stand out.gif|right|thumb|Artwork from T-shirt sleeve]]
The campaign produces discreet attire that is centered on the scarlet "A", and the term "OUT" which is usually typographically isolated from the rest of the containing phrase. There is no overt mention of atheism other than the use of the symbols. The "A" is one of the most popular symbols for atheism in current usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Symbols_of_atheism| title=Symbols of atheism |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, American Christian organizations have begun to respond: the campaign has even been called "a wake-up call" for Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=2007-08-11
|accessdate=2018-05-18
|work=The Christian Post
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign produced T-shirts, hoodies, bumper stickers, stickers,  and lapel pins sold through Richard Dawkins's online store, with the proceeds going to the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Openly Secular==

In 2014, reflecting an approach similar to the "coming out" strategy of the gay rights movement, a group called Openly Secular was formed to encourage nonreligious and non-theistic Americans to be open about their personal secularity. The group states its mission "is to eliminate discrimination and increase acceptance by getting secular people – including atheists, freethinkers, agnostics, humanists and nonreligious people – to be open about their beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openlysecular.org/about|title=Openly Secular|work=openlysecular.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one video produced for the group, comedian and television personality [[Bill Maher]] urges atheists to be open about their religious skepticism, dismissing the [[Bible]] as a book "based on ancient myths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/bill-maher-urges-atheists-to-speak-up-knocks-the-bible-as-book-based-on-ancient-myths-in-new-ad-for-openly-secular-132831/|title=Bill Maher Urges Atheists to Speak Up; Knocks the Bible as Book Based on 'Ancient Myths' in New Ad for Openly Secular|work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public economics''' (or '''economics of the public sector''') is the study of government policy through the lens of [[economic efficiency]] and [[equity (economics)|equity]].

At its most basic level, public economics provides a framework for thinking about whether or not the government should participate in economic markets and to what extent it should do so. In order to do this, [[microeconomic theory]] is utilized to assess whether the private [[market (economics)|market]] is likely to provide efficient outcomes in the absence of governmental interference. Inherently, this study involves the analysis of government [[taxation]] and [[government spending|expenditures]]. This subject encompasses a host of topics including [[market failure]]s, [[externalities]], and the creation and implementation of government policy. Public economics builds on the theory of [[welfare economics]] and is ultimately used as a tool to improve social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge-Christophe Kolm]], 1987.

==Taxation==

===Diamond–Mirrlees efficiency theorem===
In 1971, [[Peter A. Diamond]] and [[James A. Mirrlees]] published a seminal paper which showed that even when [[lump-sum tax]]ation is not available, production efficiency is still desirable. This finding is known as the Diamond–Mirrlees efficiency theorem, and it is widely credited with having modernized [[Ramsey problem|Ramsey's analysis]] by considering the problem of income distribution with the problem of raising revenue. [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] and [[Partha Dasgupta]] (1971) have criticized this theorem as not being robust on the grounds that production efficiency will not necessarily be desirable if certain tax instruments cannot be used.

===Pigouvian taxes===
{{main|Pigouvian tax}}
[[File:A.C. Pigou.jpg|thumb|100px|[[A.C. Pigou]] (1877-1959).]]

One of the achievements for which the great English economist [[A.C. Pigou]] is known, was his work on the divergences between [[Marginal cost|marginal]] private costs and marginal [[social costs]] ([[externality|externalities]]). In his book, ''The Economics of Welfare'' (1932), Pigou describes how these divergences come about:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...one person A, in the course of rendering some service, for which payment is made, to a second person B, incidentally also renders services or disservices to other persons (not producers of like services), of such a sort that payment cannot be extracted from the benefited parties or compensation enforced on behalf of the injured parties (Pigou p. 183).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, Pigou is known for his advocacy of what are known as corrective taxes, or [[Pigouvian taxes]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is plain that divergences between private and social net product of the kinds we have so far been considering cannot, like divergences due to tenancy laws, be mitigated by a modification of the contractual relation between any two contracting parties, because the divergence arises out of a service or disservice to persons other than the contracting parties. It is, however, possible for the State, if it so chooses, to remove the divergence in any field by "extraordinary encouragements" or "extraordinary restraints" upon investments in that field. The most obvious forms which these encouragements and restraints may assume are, of course, those of bounties and taxes (Pigou p. 192).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Externalities arise when consumption by individuals or production by firms affect the utility or production function of other individuals or firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Sector Economics|last=Tresch|first=Richard. W.|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-52223-7|location=175 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10010|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive externalities are education, public health and others while examples of negative externalities are air pollution, [[noise pollution]], non-vaccination and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Sector Economics|last=Tresch|first=Richard W.|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-52223-7|location=175 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10010|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government can intervene in the market, using an emission tax for example to create a more efficient outcome; this Pigouvian tax is the optimal policy prescription for any aggregate, negative externality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Sector Economics|last=Tresch|first=Richard W.|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-52223-7|location=175 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10010|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pigou describes as [[positive externalities]], examples such as resources invested in private parks that improve the surrounding air, and scientific research from which discoveries of high practical utility often grow. Alternatively, he describes [[negative externalities]], such as the factory that destroys a great part of the amenities of neighboring sites.

In 1960, the economist [[Ronald H. Coase]] proposed an alternative scheme whereby negative externalities are dealt with through the appropriate assignment of [[property rights]]. This result is known as the [[Coase theorem]].

==Public goods==
{{main|Public goods}}

Public goods, or collective consumption goods, exhibit two properties; non-rivalry and non-excludability. Something is non-rivaled if one person's consumption of it does not deprive another person, (to a point) a firework display is non-rivaled - since one person watching a firework display does not prevent another person from doing so. Something is non-excludable if its use cannot be limited to a certain group of people. Again, since one cannot prevent people from viewing a firework display it is non-excludable.&lt;ref name="PublicGood" /&gt;  Conceptually, another example of public good is the service that is provided by law enforcement organizations, such as sheriffs and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Sumrall|first2=William|last3=McElreath|first3=David|last4=Jones|first4=Don|title=Economic and Financial Analysis for Criminal Justice Organizations|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1466592063|page=138|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, cities and towns are served by only one police department, and the police department serves all of the people within its jurisdiction.

==Cost–benefit analysis==
{{main|Cost benefit analysis}}
[[File:Julesdupuit.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Jules Dupuit]] (1804-1866).]]

While the origins of cost–benefit analysis can be traced back to Jules Dupuit's classic article "On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works" (1844), much of the subsequent scholarly development occurred in the United States and arose from the challenges of water-resource development. In 1950, the U.S. Federal Interagency River Basin Committee’s Subcommittee on Benefits and Costs published a report entitled, ''Proposed Practices for Economic Analysis of River Basin Projects'' (also known as the ''Green Book''), which became noteworthy for bringing in the language of welfare economics.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Prest and R. Turvey, 1965. "Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Survey" ''The Economic Journal'', 75(300) pp. 683-735.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, [[Otto Eckstein]] published ''Water-Resource Development: The Economics of Project Evaluation'',  and [[Roland McKean]] published his ''Efficiency in Government Through Systems Analysis: With Emphasis on Water Resources Development''. The latter book is also considered a classic in the field of [[operations research]]. In subsequent years, several other important works appeared: [[Jack Hirshleifer]], James DeHaven, and Jerome W. Milliman published a volume entitled ''Water Supply: Economics, Technology, and Policy'' (1960); and a group of Harvard scholars including [[Robert Dorfman]], [[Stephen Marglin]], and others published ''Design of Water-Resource Systems: New Techniques for Relating Economic Objectives, Engineering Analysis, and Governmental Planning'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/2602a2edfc22e38a8525766200639df0/a92f904ea01bd78f85257662007490b8!OpenDocument Introduction to Benefit-Cost Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Right of first refusal''' ('''ROFR''' or '''RFR''') is a [[contractual right]] that gives its holder the option to enter a business transaction with the owner of something, according to specified terms, before the owner is entitled to enter into that transaction with a third party. A first refusal right must have at least three parties: the owner, the third party or buyer and the option holder. In general, the owner must make the same offer to the option holder ''before'' making the offer to the buyer. The right of first refusal is similar in concept to a [[call option]].

An ROFR can cover almost any sort of [[asset]], including [[real estate]], personal [[property]], a [[patent]] license, a [[screenplay]], or an interest in a business. It might also cover [[Financial transaction|business transaction]]s that are not strictly assets, such as the right to enter a joint venture or distribution arrangement. In entertainment, a right of first refusal on a concept or a [[screenplay]] would give the holder the right to make that movie first.  Only if the holder turns it down may the owner then shop it around to other parties.

Because an ROFR is a contract right, the holder's remedies for breach are typically limited to recovery of [[damages]]. In other words, if the owner sells the asset to a third party without offering the holder the opportunity to purchase it first, the holder can then sue the owner for damages but may have a difficult time obtaining a court order to stop or reverse the sale.  However, in some cases the option becomes a [[property right]] that may be used to invalidate an improper sale.

ROFR also arises in visitation agreements/orders in divorce cases.  In such cases, an ROFR may require a custodial parent to offer parenting time to the non-custodial parent (rather than having a child supervised by a third party) any time that the custodial parent or his/her family is unable to exercise his/her right to parenting time (e.g., the custodial parent needs to travel out of town).  Under these circumstances a breach may result in a finding of contempt and any remedies for contempt.

An ROFR differs from a '''Right of First Offer''' (ROFO, also known as a Right of First Negotiation) in that the ROFO merely obliges the owner to undergo exclusive [[good faith]] negotiations with the rights holder before negotiating with other parties. A ROFR is an option to enter a transaction on exact or approximate transaction terms. A ROFO is merely an agreement to negotiate.

==Examples==
ROFR: Abe owns a house and Bo offers to buy that house for $1 million. However, Carl holds a right of first refusal to purchase the house. Therefore, before Abe can sell the house to Bo, he must first offer it to Carl for the $1 million that Bo is willing to buy it for. If Carl accepts, he buys the house instead of Bo. If Carl declines, Bo may now buy the house at the proposed $1 million price.

ROFO: Carl holds a ROFO instead of an ROFR. Before Abe can negotiate a deal with Bo, he must first try to sell the house to Carl on whatever terms Abe is willing to sell. If they reach an agreement, Abe sells the house to Carl. However, if they fail, then Abe is free to start fresh negotiations with Bo without any restriction as to price or terms.

==Variations==
The following are all variations on the basic ROFR:

*''[[Time|Duration]]: The ROFR is limited in time. For example, Abe must make the offer to Carl for any proposed sale only in the first five years. After that, the right expires and Abe has no further obligation to Carl.
*''Exceptions'' include certain transactions. Abe may sell or transfer the property to a holding company, a trust, family members, etc. without first offering it to Carl. However, the new owners remain subject to the right.
*''Transferability'': Carl may assign his ROFR to Bo. Abe must now offer Bo an option to purchase the property instead of Carl. Not every ROFR is transferable; some are personal to the original holder.
*''Extinguished on first sale'': if Abe sells the property to Bo because Carl declines the right, the property is no longer subject to the right. Bo may resell it free of the ROFR.
*''Extinguished on declined/failed exercise'': if Abe proposes to sell the property to Bo and Carl declines, or if Carl accepts but is unable to complete the transaction, the right is extinguished whether or not Abe ultimately sells the property.
*''Persistent'': in contrast to the above two, in this case, the right runs with the property and binds the new purchaser. If Abe sells the property to Bo, Bo must offer the property to Carl first, just like Abe if Bo wishes to re-sell it.
*''Offer and acceptance terms'': specific deadlines, procedures, and forms may be required. For example, Abe must give Carl a "notice of sale." Carl has 30 days to accept or reject, with failure to respond counting as rejection. Carl must then close the transaction within that time, or that counts as a failed attempt to exercise.
*''Limited time period to close transaction'': Abe offers the property to Carl under the ROFR, and Carl declines. Abe now has 60 days to close the transaction with Bo. If it cannot close within 60 days, Abe must offer it again to Carl before proceeding further with Bo.
*''Substitute purchaser allowed'': Abe offers the property to Carl, who declines. Abe is then free to sell it to Bo but fails to do so. Abe may sell the property under the same terms to Erin instead without reoffering it to Carl.
*''No pending transaction required'': Abe wishes to sell the house for $1 million but has not yet identified a purchaser. He prepares proposed sales terms and offers it to Carl on those terms. If Carl declines, he may then shop around for a purchaser.
*''Slight variations allowed in exercise'': Abe enters an agreement with Bo calling for Bo to put down a 30% down payment, conduct certain inspections, and close the transaction in 20 days. He offers it to Carl at those terms. Carl accepts but is entitled to insist on a 20% down payment and a 30-day closing period.
*''Slight variations allowed in sale'': Abe offers the house for $1 million to Carl, who declines. Abe then enters a transaction with Bo but during the [[escrow]], Bo discovers a flaw in title and several defects. Abe is entitled to discount the price by $20,000 to close the sale with Bo without having to reoffer the house to Carl at $980,000.
*''Continuous'': a continuous right of first refusal can be worded to continue to live, even upon infinite opportunities that are declined.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Many other variations are possible. A fully drafted ROFR addresses all of the types of issues and more, and in the case of valuable or complex transactions it is subject to negotiation and review by business transaction attorneys. However, many ROFR are not completely specified. Even the best drafted ROFR agreements suffer a high risk of dispute and litigation because they are anticipating future transactions and contingencies that are unknowable when the ROFR originates.

==In venture capital==
In venture capital deals, the '''right of first refusal''' is a [[term sheet]] provision permitting existing investors in a company to accept or refuse the purchase of equity shares offered by the company, before third parties have access to the deal. The main goal of the provision is to allow investors to prevent [[stock dilution|ownership dilution]] as the company raises additional capital. Typically, the provision will exempt certain types of shares, such as those in an employee pool, or shares issued to equipment loaners or lessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergingenterprisecenter.com/Resources/AskTheStartupLawyers/Investor%20Rights/What-is-a-right-of-first-refusal-on-Company-sales.aspx|title=What is a "right of first refusal" on Company sales?|date=Nov 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Term Sheet: Right of First Refusal|author=Brad Feld|url=http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/06/term-sheet-right-of-first-refusal.html|date=2005-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Startup company|Startup companies]] are advised to attempt negotiating out this right, because it enables existing investors to send stronger (potentially negative) signals to new investors, and consequently drive down the company's valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venturehacks.com/articles/options-open|title=Keep your Series A options open if you raise debt|author=Babak Nivi|date=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Russian oven''' or '''Russian stove''' ({{lang-ru|Русская печь}}) is a unique type of [[Masonry heater|masonry stove]] that first appeared in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Наука и техника | title = Русская печь XX века | author = А. Е. Школьник | url = http://n-t.ru/nj/nz/1988/0107.htm | date = 1988-01-07}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used both for cooking and domestic heating in traditional [[Russia]]n, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarus]]ian households.&lt;ref name=fedotov&gt;{{citation | first = ГЯ | last = Федотов | script-title=ru:Русская печь — Эксмо | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-5-699-23171-3| language = Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian oven burns [[firewood]] or wood manufacturing waste.&lt;ref name=fedotov/&gt;&lt;ref name=pechka&gt;{{cite web | title = Русская печь | publisher = pechka.su | url = http://pechka.su/ | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Construction==
A Russian oven is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the oven is constructed.&lt;ref name=fedotov/&gt;&lt;ref name=pechka/&gt;

A brick flue ({{lang-ru|борова}}) in the attic, sometimes with a chamber for [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking food]], is required to slow down the cooling of the oven.&lt;ref name=fedotov/&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Pech-v-izbe 1.jpg|thumb|Russian oven in ''izba'', photographed before 1917]]
The Russian oven is usually in the centre of the log hut ([[izba]]). The builders of Russian ovens are referred to as "stovemakers" (''pechniki''). Good stovemakers always had a high status among the population. A badly built Russian oven may be very difficult to repair, bake unevenly, smoke, or retain heat poorly.&lt;ref name=fedotov/&gt;&lt;ref name="mukhin.ru"&gt;http://www.mukhin.ru/stroysovet/stove&amp;heaters/5_5.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliotekar.ru/spravochnik-6/79.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many designs for the Russian oven. For example, there is a variant with two hearths (one of the hearths is used mainly for fast cooking, the other mainly for heating in winter).&lt;ref name=fedotov/&gt;&lt;ref name="mukhin.ru"/&gt; In addition, there also existed tiled oven in early Russian culture.

==Fuel==
Various types of firewood can be used, for example [[birch]] or [[pine]]. [[Aspen]] is the least efficient for heating a Russian oven because the amount needed is twice that of other woods.&lt;ref name=fedotov/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Atkinson Isba 1803 crop.jpg|thumb|Usage of the Russian oven etched by [[John Augustus Atkinson]] (1803)]]
[[File:Kizhi 06-2017 img04 Oshevnev House.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Russian oven in [[Republic of Karelia]], Russia]]
Besides its use for domestic heating, in winter people may sleep on top of the oven to keep warm: the large thermal mass (a proper Russian stove weighs about 2 tons) and layered design (in many variants the hot flue is separated from the outer brick shell with a layer of sand or pebbles) ensure that the outer surface of the stove is safe to touch.&lt;ref name="fedotov" /&gt; The oven was and is used  until today for cooking and had a strong influence on the taste of Russian cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rbth.com/russian_kitchen/2016/12/05/three-factors-in-traditional-russian-cooking_653759|title=Three factors in traditional Russian cooking|last=RBTH|first=special to|date=2016-12-05|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes where the oven is used are pancakes to bake or pies. The porridge or the pancakes prepared in such an oven may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range.  The process of cooking in the Russian oven can be called "languor" — holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature.  Foods that are believed to acquire a distinctive character from being prepared in a Russian oven include [[baked milk]], [[pastila]] candies, mushrooms cooked in [[Smetana (dairy product)|sour cream]], or even a simple potato.&lt;ref name="fedotov" /&gt;  Bread is put in and taken out from the oven using a special wooden paddle on a long shank. [[Cast iron]] pots with soup or milk are taken out with a two-pronged metal stick.&lt;ref name="fedotov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ethno" /&gt;

As well as warming and cooking, the Russian oven can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during [[World War II]] some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in ovens.&lt;ref name = fedotov /&gt;&lt;ref name=pechka/&gt;&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;{{cite web | title = Этнодвор "Музей Русской Печи" | publisher = Этномир | url = http://ethnomir.ru/etnodvory/muzey-russkoy-pechi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glenrich&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.glenrich.ru/159/ | title = Glenrich | place = RU | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921074749/http://www.glenrich.ru/159/ | archivedate = 2008-09-21 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In former times the oven was used to treat winter diseases by warming the sick person's body inside it.&lt;ref name = fedotov /&gt;&lt;ref name = pechka /&gt;&lt;ref name = ethno /&gt;&lt;ref name = glenrich /&gt;

==In Russian culture==
Especially because of the harsh winter the Russian oven was a major element of Russian life and consequently it often appears in folklore, in particular in [[Russian fairy tale]]s. The legendary hero [[Ilya Muromets]] was able to walk after 33 years of incapacity after being laid on a Russian oven. Emelya, according to the legend, was so reluctant to leave it that he simply flew and rode on it.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/folklorelegends07cjttiala/folklorelegends07cjttiala_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cqham.qrz.ru/skazka/skaz028.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baba Yaga]] according to the legend baked lost children in her oven. Often in those fairy tales the oven received human characteristics. For example, in "[[The Magic Swan Geese]]" a girl meets a Russian oven, and asks it for directions. The oven offers the girl rye buns, and subsequently, on the girl's return, hides her from the swan geese.&lt;ref&gt;Г. Н. Губанова. ''Золотая книга сказок''. Тула: «Родничок», 2001, с. 241. {{ISBN|5-89624-013-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Гуси-лебеди''. Донецк: Проф-пресс, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main features of the oven in [[Russian Fairy Tales|Russian fairy tales]] is that it serves as a means of transport, virtually the counterpart on the ground to the [[magic carpet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/844873080|title=What every Russian knows (and you don't)|last=Olga,|first=Fedina,|isbn=1901990125|location=London|oclc=844873080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tea]] is a part of [[Russian culture]]. Russian tea is brewed and can be served sweet, and hot or cold.

==History==
{{see also|Siberian Route}}
[[File:Чаепитие в Мытищах, близ Москвы.jpg|thumb|''A Tea Party in [[Mytishchi]]''. [[Vasily Perov]], 1862]]

Since 1638, [[tea]] has had a rich and varied history in [[Russia]].  Due in part to Russia's cold northern climate, it is today considered the ''de facto'' national beverage,&lt;ref name="[Food Culture]"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mack | first = Glenn | title = Food Culture in Russia and Central Asia | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-313-32773-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most popular beverages in the country,&lt;ref name="[Tea and coffee]"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=[Tea and coffee consumption among Russian population]|journal=Vopr Pitan|language=Russian|volume=74|issue=3|pages=42–6|pmid=16044841|vauthors=Martinchik AN, Baturin AK, Martinchik EA, Tutel'ian VA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely associated with traditional [[Russian culture]]. It was traditionally drunk at afternoon tea, but has since spread as an all day drink, especially at the end of meals served with dessert. An important aspect of the Russian tea culture is the ubiquitous Russian tea brewing device known as a [[samovar]], which has become a symbol of hospitality and comfort.

[[File:Russiantea1.jpg|thumb|200px|A brick of tea presented to Crown Prince Nicholas (future Tsar Nicholas II), 1891]] 
Tea in Russia was introduced in 1638, when a [[Mongolia]]n ruler donated to [[Tsar]] [[Michael of Russia|Michael I]] four [[pood]]s (65–70&amp;nbsp;kg) of tea.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] | publisher =Советская энциклопедия | year = 1978 | pages = vol. 29, p. 11 | month = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Jeremiah Curtin]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Curtin, A Journey to Southern Siberia, 1909, Chapter one&lt;/ref&gt; it was possibly in 1636&lt;ref&gt;Basil Dymytryshyn, Russia's Conquest of Siberia: A Documentary Record,1985,volume one, document 48 (he was an envoy that year, but the tea may have been given on a later visit to the Khan)&lt;/ref&gt; that Vassili Starkov was sent as envoy to the [[Altan Khan of the Khotgoid|Altyn Khan]]. As a gift to the Tsar, he was given 250 pounds of tea. Starkov at first refused, seeing no use for a load of dead leaves, but the Khan insisted. Thus was tea introduced to Russia. In 1679, Russia concluded a treaty on regular tea supplies from [[China]] via [[camel train|camel caravan]] in exchange for furs.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; The Chinese ambassador to [[Moscow]] made a gift of several chests of tea to [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexis I]].&lt;ref name="TE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rispubs.com/article.cfm?Number=193|title= Tea Time in Russia: Russian Life|accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the difficult trade route made the cost of tea extremely high, so that the beverage became available only to royalty and the very wealthy of Russia.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt; In 1689, the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] was signed that formalized Russia's sovereignty over Siberia, and also marked the creation of the [[Siberian Route|Tea Road]] that traders used between Russia and China.

Between the Treaty of Nerchinsk and the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)]], Russia would increase its caravans going to China for tea, but only through state dealers. In 1706, [[Peter the Great]] made it illegal for any merchants to trade in Beijing. In 1786, [[Catherine the Great]] established regular imports of tea. By the time of Catherine's death in 1796, Russia was importing more than 3 million pounds by camel caravan in the form of [[Tea#Loose tea|loose tea]] and [[tea brick]]s, enough tea to considerably lower the price so that middle and lower class Russians could afford the beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'connor | first = Sharon | title = Afternoon Tea Serenade | publisher = Menus &amp; Music Production | location = City | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-883914-18-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak year for the [[Kyakhta|Kiakhta]] tea trade was in 1824, and the peak year for the tea caravans was 1860. From then, they started to decline when the first leg of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was completed in 1880. Faster train service allowed for tea to be imported from nearly a year and a half to eventually just over a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weinberg | first = Bennett | title = The World of Caffeine | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-415-92722-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in Chinese tea in the mid 19th century in turn meant that Russia began to import more tea from [[Odessa]], and [[London]]. By 1905, horse drawn tea transport had ended, and by 1925 caravan as the sole means of transport for tea had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avery | first = Martha | title = The Tea Road | publisher = China Intercontinental Press | location = Beijing | year = 2003 | isbn = 7-5085-0380-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Russia imported some 162,000 metric tons of tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jolliffe | first = Lee | title = Tea and Tourism: Tourists, Traditions, and Transformations | publisher = Channel View Publications | location = Clevedon England | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-84541-057-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, [[Wissotzky Tea]] had become the largest tea firm in the [[Russian Empire]]. By the early 20th century, Wissotzky was the largest tea manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Merchants to Multinationals: British Trading Companies in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', Geoffrey Jones, Oxford University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Production===
[[File:Gorskii 03992u.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tea packaging in [[Batumi]], [[Russian Empire]], early 20th century.]]
By the end of the 18th century, tea prices had moderately declined.&lt;!--Why?--&gt; The first local tea plant was set in Nikitsk [[botanical gardens]] in 1814, while the first industrial tea plantation was established in 1885.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt;  The tea industry did not take off until [[World War I]], and greatly expanded following [[World War II]]. However, by the mid 1990s, tea production came to a standstill. Today, the main area in Russia for tea production is in the vicinity of [[Sochi]].

==Varieties==
Traditionally, black tea is the most common tea in Russia, but [[green tea]] is becoming more popular.

Traditional tea in Russia includes the traditional type known as [[Russian Caravan]] as it was originally imported from China via camel caravan. As the trip was very long, usually taking as long as 16 or 18 months, the tea acquired its distinctive smoky flavor from the caravan's campfires. Today, this tea is often given its smoky [[Tea blending and additives|flavor]] after fermentation or is a [[keemun]] or a "black or [[oolong]]  from China or Formosa ([[Taiwan]]) with a hint of smoky [[Lapsang Souchong]] or Tarry Souchong." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pettigrew | first = Jane | title = The Tea Companion | publisher = Viking Australia | location = City | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-670-88401-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brewing==
[[File:Samovar.silver.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Silver]] [[samovar]]]]
A notable feature of Russian tea culture is the two-step brewing process. Firstly, tea concentrate called [[zavarka]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: заварка) is prepared: a quantity of dry tea sufficient for several persons is brewed in a small teapot. Then, each person pours some quantity of this concentrate into the cup and mixes it with hot water; thus, one can make one's tea as strong as one wants, according to one's taste. [[Sugar]], [[lemon]], [[honey]] or [[jam]] can then be added freely.

==Tea culture==
[[File:Family portrait by T.Myagkov.jpg|thumb|right|Family portrait in Russia in 1844 by T. Myagkov, with the samovar ready for tea]]
According to [[William Pokhlyobkin]], tea in Russia was not regarded as a self-dependent beverage; thus, even the affluent classes adorned it with a jam, syrup, cakes, cookies, candies, lemon and other sweets. This is similar to the archaic [[idiom]] "чай да сахар" (tea and sugar). The [[Russian language]] utilizes some [[meme]]s pertaining to tea consumption, including "чайку-с?" ("some tea?" in an archaic manner), used by the pre-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] attendants. The others are "гонять чаи" (chase the teas, i.e. drinking the tea for overly prolonged periods) and "побаловаться чайком" (indulging in tea). Tea was made a significant element of cultural life by the literati of the [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzinian]] circle.&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;''Знание - сила'', 9/2006, p. 105; {{ISSN|0130-1640}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century tea had won over the town class, the merchants and the petty bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt; This is reflected in the dramas of [[Alexander Ostrovsky]]. Since Ostrovsky's time, duration and the amount of consumed tea are appreciated in the tea-drinking.&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt; [[Alexander Pushkin]] in ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' displayed the role of tea in establishing romantic relations:
&lt;small&gt;
:Of single boredom, right away
:They speak–but in a cunning way.
:They call him to their [[samovar]]–
:None but Dunya will pour the tea;
:They whisper to her: "Dunya, see!"
:And then produce her sweet guitar.
:O Christ! She then begins to cheep:
:"Come see me in my golden keep!"
&lt;/small&gt;
[[File:Podstakannik mit Gold.JPG|thumb|right|240px|A glass of tea inside a [[Podstakannik]], a [[gilded]] [[glass holder]].]] 
In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, tea-drinking was extremely popular in the daily life of office workers (female secretaries, laboratory assistants, etc.). Tea brands of the time were nicknamed "the brooms" (Georgian) and "the tea with an elephant" (Indian).&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt; Tea was an immutable element of kitchen life among the [[intelligentsia]] in 1960s-'70s.&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt;

In pre-Revolutionary Russia there was a joke "что после чаю следует?" ('what follows after tea?') with the correct answer being "the [[resurrection of the dead]]" from the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt; This is based on the word "чаю" (''chayu''), the [[homograph]] designating formerly "I expect" ("look for" in the creed) and the [[genitive case]] of the word "tea", still in use.

Within Russia, tea preparation differs, but usually includes lemon, and sugar or jam. Tea sachets are widely popular, but when a teapot is used it is very common to make a strong brew, then pour some into a cup and top it with hot or boiling water, adding milk and sugar afterwards.

In the 19th century, Russians drank their tea with a cube of sugar (from [[sugarloaf]]) held between their teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = Sara | title = The New Tea Book | publisher = Chronicle Books | location = San Francisco | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8118-3053-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition still exists. &lt;ref&gt;[http://vprikusku.ru/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea is very popular in [[List of prisons#.C2.A0Russia|Russian prisons]]. Traditional mind-altering substances such as alcohol are typically prohibited, and very high concentrations, called ''[[chifir]]'' are used as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://home.fazekas.hu/~nagydani/rth/Russian-tea-HOWTO-v3.pdf | title = Russian Tea HOWTO | publisher =  | date = 2002-04-01 | accessdate = 2008-04-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061127175621/http://home.fazekas.hu/~nagydani/rth/Russian-tea-HOWTO-v3.pdf | archivedate = 2006-11-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional forms of Russian tea ware include the Russian tea brewing urn called a [[samovar]], the [[Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg|Lomonosov]] tea sets adorned with a cobalt blue net design and 22 karat gold, and traditional Russian tea [[glass holder]]s.

=="Russian Tea" in the United States==

There is a beverage called "Russian Tea" which likely originated in America. This drink is especially popular in the [[Southeastern United States]] where is it traditionally served at social events during [[Advent]] and [[Christmastide]]. Recipes vary, but the most common ingredients are loose black tea, orange juice (or orange peel), cinnamon, and cloves; some recipes use instant tea powder. Other juices such as lemon and pineapple are sometimes called for. Cream may also be added when serving. A homemade 'instant' variety, often using [[Tang (drink)|Tang]], has become a popular [[Christmas stocking|stocking stuffer]] in recent decades.&lt;ref name="yesterdish"/&gt;

The drink is served hot and often an evening or after-meal beverage. However, iced versions are sometimes offered with meals at cafés.

Despite the name, "Russian Tea" probably has no link to its namesake. References to "Russian Tea" and instructions have been found in American newspapers and cookbooks dating as early as the 1880s.&lt;ref name="yesterdish"&gt;{{cite web |title=Russian Tea: America’s choice in outer space under a Soviet name |url=http://www.yesterdish.com/2013/11/22/russian-tea/ |website=Yesterdish: Rescuing America's Lost Recipes |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three panels are entitled, respectively "Packing Up", "On the Wharf", and "The Collision".]]

The '''Seattle riot of 1886''' occurred on February 6–9, 1886, in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], amidst rising [[Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States|anti-Chinese sentiment]] caused by intense labor competition and in the context of an ongoing struggle between labor and capital in the [[Western United States]]. The dispute arose when a mob affiliated with a local [[Knights of Labor]] chapter formed small committees to carry out a forcible expulsion of all [[Chinese people|Chinese]] from the city. Violence erupted between the Knights of Labor rioters and federal troops ordered in by President [[Grover Cleveland]]. The incident resulted in the removal of over 200 Chinese people from Seattle and left 2 militia men and 3 rioters seriously injured.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Many sources, like Laurie (cited), agree that around 200 Chinese left by ship on the morning of the 7th. Some sources, such as Crowley (cited), say that most of the remaining 150 also left later.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carlos/&gt;

==Background==
During the 1840s, the [[California Gold Rush]] brought many Chinese to the United States. Many had come in the hopes of improving their economic conditions, and their arrival was initially welcomed due to [[labor shortage]]s. According to information from the U.S. Census, the Chinese population increased at a dramatic pace until 1890, though they never accounted for more than 0.2 percent of the U.S. population through the 1800s.&lt;ref name=Laurie/&gt;

After the Gold Rush, many Chinese people moved into the northwest territories of Oregon, Washington, and Montana in search of work, especially with the new mining opportunities and railroad expansion.&lt;ref name="Clain"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles McClain|title=Chinese Immigrants and American Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnYwKmpjvCAC&amp;pg=PA449|accessdate=21 March 2013|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=978-0-8153-1849-1|pages=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workers developed a reputation for being efficient and willing to work long hours, but also for accepting less pay than white workers. This increased racial tensions in the West, as companies recruited Chinese workers in order to undercut higher-paid white workers.&lt;ref name="Laurie" /&gt;

Violent outbreaks against the Chinese occurred as early as the 1860s and continued to intensify in the 1870s, especially in California. As corporations continued to flood the labor market with Chinese workers, many Chinese were excluded from or refused to join [[Trade union|unions]] in the fight against capital, which angered and threatened the white European immigrants who constituted these organizations. Unions such as the Knights of Labor and the [[American Federation of Labor]] supported [[legislation]] that limited or excluded Chinese immigration. By the mid-1880s, a wave of anti-Chinese violence grew and spread into the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name="Laurie" /&gt;

==Rock Springs==
{{main article|Rock Springs massacre}}
Rock Springs was just the first outbreak of many in the West of anti-Chinese violence. It occurred in [[Rock Springs, Wyoming|Rock Springs]], in the [[Wyoming Territory]]. In the 1870s, the [[Union Pacific]] coal mines began firing white strikers and replacing its previously all-white work force with cheaper Chinese laborers. The incident occurred on September 2, 1885. Fighting broke out in the mines between white and Chinese laborers. A mob destroyed and set aflame many Chinese homes, causing an estimated $140,000 of damage, killing 28, injuring 14, and sending the remaining immigrants fleeing into the surrounding area. Later, Governor [[Francis Warren]] telegraphed President Cleveland requesting federal [[military]] assistance, due to a report that had surfaced that the Chinese, who had fled the town earlier, had now regrouped in nearby [[Evanston, Wyoming|Evanston]] and had armed themselves.

The Chinese and anti-Chinese mobs were set to meet, which prompted the commitment of federal troops to Rock Springs. The soldiers were not under orders to protect the Union Pacific Railroad or to protect the Chinese, as required by the [[Burlingame Treaty|Burlingame Treaty of 1868]] with China. Officially, troops were deployed to Rock Springs to "prevent any disruption to the [[United States Postal Service|United States mail]] or the routes over which they are received." This decision was likely made to avoid setting the precedent of committing federal troops to stamp out anti-Chinese violence, which the [[United States Army|Army]] lacked the resources, time, and numbers to achieve.

Eventually, diplomatic pressure from the Burlingame Treaty prompted President Cleveland to issue a new order to protect Chinese laborers "at points of threatened or actual violence" now that troops had been committed. The Chinese were then led by four companies of federal troops into the town without incident. This set a precedent for sending federal troops to protect the Chinese immigrants from frequent violence in the area, though the Cleveland administration evaded responsibility for the incident. It also set a precedent because not a single rioter was punished. They did pay a sum of $150,000 to the Chinese government, though never to the immigrants themselves.&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xiaoyan Zhou|title=Qing Perceptions of Anti-Chinese Violence in the United States: Case Studies from the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Naq3u_SffTIC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=21 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-93231-4|pages=61, 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal forces remained in the area for another 14 years after the massacre, and, for the most part, white and union influence disappeared in the wake of the riot.&lt;ref name="Laurie" /&gt;

==Seattle==
Tensions in Seattle continued to rise when the Chinese laborers shifted from mining and railroad construction to [[Urban area|urban]] labor. Many whites felt as though the Chinese were driving them from the labor force by agreeing to work for less. They saw the Chinese as racially inferior "semislaves" who were unable to assimilate into the American way of life.&lt;ref name=Laurie/&gt; Some argued that the hiring of Chinese workers would only serve to lower the [[standard of living]] for the average American working man in the West, who would be forced to accept lower wages to compete. Others asserted that the Chinese workers were stripping America of her wealth because many immigrants sent paychecks back to their families in China.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard White|title="It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own": A New History of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCF8eIFe93cC&amp;pg=PA342|accessdate=21 March 2013|year=1991|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2567-1|pages=341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Knights of Labor]] were leaders of the organized movement against Chinese workers in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name=Carlos/&gt;&lt;ref name=uw&gt;"[http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Pacific%20Northwest%20History/Lessons/Lesson%2015/15.html Lesson Fifteen: Industrialization, Class, and Race: Chinese and the Anti-Chinese Movement in the Late 19th-Century Northwest]", History of Washington State &amp; the Pacific Northwest, Center for Study of the Pacific Northwest, University of Washington. Retrieved 20 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Knights in  [[Washington Territory]] were only loosely affiliated with the national organization. The chapter's organizer was  [[Daniel Cronin (labor organizer)|Daniel Cronin]], a 38-year-old [[carpenter]] who came to the [[Puget Sound]] area via [[California]] during the summer of 1885. Under Cronin's leadership, the Washington Knights of Labor went from a loose-knit band of workers to an organized and militant "brotherhood".&lt;ref name=Carlos/&gt; In September 1885, Cronin warned Seattle's workers that riot and bloodshed would follow during the winter if the Chinese were not removed. It was Cronin and the leadership of the Knights of Labor who planned for the systematic expulsion of Seattle's Chinese; the group organized a territorial anti-Chinese congress and declared that all Chinese must leave Seattle by November 1, 1885.&lt;ref name=Carlos&gt;Schwantes, Carlos A. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/968690  Protest in a Promised Land: Unemployment, Disinheritance, and the Origin of Labor Militancy in the Pacific Northwest, 1885-1886]," ([[JSTOR]]), ''[[The Western Historical Quarterly]]'', Vol. 13, No. 4.  (Oct., 1982), pp. 373–390. Retrieved 20 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After forming local coordinating committees, Cronin stepped away from his post as Knights leader and left the Chinese expulsion, largely, to other individuals.&lt;ref name=Carlos/&gt;

Disgruntled over the presence of 3000+ Chinese immigrants in the Seattle-[[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] corridor, the Washington Knights organized a meeting on the 28th of September. The meeting was presided over by Tacoma's mayor, [[Jacob Weisbach]], and the assembled men concluded they must rid the area of "Chinese slave labor". They intended to speak to employers about their discharge, and thus formed local committees to enforce the expulsion if all Chinese were not removed from the town by November 1. Some Chinese were persuaded to evacuate at this point and between November 4–14, some 150 Chinese fled Seattle. This prompted territorial Governor [[Watson Squire]] to telegraph President Cleveland for troops, and he received soldiers under the command of Brig. Gen. [[John Gibbon]] by train the next morning. These soldiers never took action and were ordered back to garrison on November 17.&lt;ref name=Laurie/&gt; The tensions did not end there, however, as Knights of Labor meetings continued through January. On February 6, 1886, the Knights again met and charged a six-man committee with delivering an ultimatum to the Chinese that they must leave Seattle or be forcibly removed.&lt;ref name=Laurie/&gt;

==Riot==
On the morning of February 7, many "committees" forced their way into Chinese homes, demanding the Chinese pack their bags and report to the steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' at 1pm. The committees set up wagons through [[Seattle Chinatown-International District|Seattle's Chinatown]] to haul baggage down to the pier. After a search was conducted for Chinese who fled or hid, the committees led some 350 Chinese from Chinatown to the pier. Local Sheriff [[John McGraw (governor)|John McGraw]] was aroused to enforce law and order with his force of deputies, but McGraw was sympathetic to the plight of the Knights and simply protected the Chinese immigrants from violence on their way to the pier. When Governor Squire ordered the dispersal of the mob and the release of the Chinese, the riotous mob ignored him. Thus, Squire called for the local "Seattle Rifles" militia and requested the aid of federal troops to assist McGraw.

Meanwhile, at the dock, rioters were significantly short of raising the funds needed to transport 350 people by steamship. Only 97 of 350 Chinese had their fare paid. U.S. Justice Greene heard of the incident through an angered Chinese merchant and issued a writ of [[habeas corpus]] which required the captain of the ''Queen'' to produce the Chinese in court the next morning. At midnight, McGraw along with local militia blocked 2 attempts by the mob to lead the remaining 253 Chinese to a train to Tacoma. McGraw defused the situation by ordering the train to leave before the mob could reach it.

The next morning, McGraw led the 97 passengers still on the ''Queen of the Pacific'' to the territorial court as ordered by Justice Greene. There was an incident along the way as the mob tried to block their progress and 8 Knights leaders were arrested. Once there, Greene informed the Chinese that they had a legal right to remain in the city. Though he promised to protect them, only 16 elected to stay and the rest were escorted back to the ship. By the time they had returned the mob had raised funds for the additional passage of 115 more Chinese and the boat set sail. It was agreed that the remaining 150 Chinese would depart on the steamship ''[[SS George W. Elder|George Elder]]'' once funds had been raised.

News of the agreement failed to spread throughout Seattle. As McGraw, his deputies, and the militiamen tried to lead the Chinese back to their homes, a new mob formed, incensed at the arrest of their leaders. The militiamen clubbed members of the mob with rifle butts when progress was impeded. When members of the mob began to wrest the militia rifles, shots rang out and stopped only after 2 militia men and 3 rioters lay seriously injured. The mob backed off and prepared for another charge when an extra company of militiamen arrived and sent the crowd into a confused state. Once McGraw stated that those responsible for the shooting would be prosecuted, the crowd dispersed. When a third mob threatened the lives of the militiamen who fired upon the crowd, Governor Squire issued martial law.

Neither Greene nor Squire believed that McGraw and his combined militia force would be able to enforce martial law in the territory, and federal troops arrived in Seattle on February 10 and found it "devoid of traces...of the rioting". Squire ended martial law and restored local civil order on February 23. Most troops were recalled, but two companies of troops were left in Seattle for another 4 months after the riot.&lt;ref name=Laurie/&gt;

==Aftermath==

The increasingly common outbursts of anti-Chinese violence in the 1880s, like that of the Seattle riot, allowed Congress to pass the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that completely barred the immigration of all Chinese workers into the United States. Congress then voted to extend the ban in 1892 and 1902. This led to a dramatically reduced Chinese population in the U.S. in the 1890s into the 1900s. Those who did leave were restricted from being replaced by other Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;
Congress paid [[U.S. dollar|$]]276,619.15 to the Chinese government in compensation for the rioting, but the actual victims never saw any such compensation.&lt;ref name=crowley&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Walt|title=Anti-Chinese Activism - Seattle,|year=1999|publisher=The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though 13 men were tried in court in relation to the riot, not a single one was ever convicted of a crime. Both Mayor [[Henry Yesler]] and Sheriff McGraw were unseated in the following election.&lt;ref name=Laurie/&gt;

Few Chinese remained in the Seattle area following the riot.&lt;ref name=Laurie/&gt; Many of the Chinese chose to return to China following the wave of racially inspired violence.&lt;ref name= White/&gt; There was a considerable loss of property because of their forced and hasty expulsion &lt;ref name=Clain/&gt; The Qing government could only look to secure indemnities for the Seattle riot, knowing that the guilty parties would likely never be brought to answer for their crimes. This was because federal and territorial authorities had been largely unwilling to assist in declaring martial law and arresting the criminals &lt;ref name=Zhou/&gt;

The Chinese asked the advice of their Consuls in the U.S. and sent additional diplomats to investigate the matter and report back with possible actions. [[Ouyang Ming]], the Chinese Consul-General of San Francisco concluded that the Chinese were not well liked by either the American public or the government. He proposed that the best way to prevent future harm to Chinese citizens was to bar all Chinese emigration to the states, feeling as though only trouble would result if things were left unchanged. Others, such as influential Governor-General [[Zhang Zhidang]], disagreed. He proposed that the Chinese immigration policy remain fluid because of Chinese interests in the United States and it did.&lt;ref name=Zhou/&gt;

Qing officials continued efforts in Washington to combat the unjust restrictions that were placed on Chinese immigrants following the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. The killing of Chinese gradually came to a stop in the years after 1886, however legislation restricting them continued. Protection of current and future Chinese in America proved difficult to achieve &lt;ref name=Zhou/&gt;

Chinese consul [[Goon Dip]], a Chinese businessman, was largely responsible for the 2nd wave of Chinese immigration into Seattle and founded the cradle for Seattle's second Chinatown. Soon Japanese and Filipino immigrants also gravitated to the area because of the area's inexpensive housing and storefronts for their own businesses and restaurants.

By the late 1930s, Chinatown was re-established in Seattle as a distinct and proud neighborhood. Many Chinese prospered despite lingering tensions. However, relations again soured after the surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by the Empire of Japan. Many Japanese Americans were rounded up in the spring of 1942 for "internment" camps throughout World War II. In response, many Chinese Americans in Seattle were forced to wear badges declaring that they were not Japanese.

The area's population continued to diversify following World War II, as an increasing number of Filipinos passed through or settled in the area. This prompted Seattle Mayor William Devin to promote a new name for the neighborhood, the "International District," in 1951, though this still rankles some in the Chinese community.&lt;ref name=Seattle&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the International District|url=http://www.cidbia.org/history|publisher=HistoryLink.org|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multicultural India has developed its discourse on sexuality differently based on its distinct regions with their own unique cultures. However, one common aspect remains: the existence of a subtle conspiracy of silence and taboos that clouds the Indian world of sexual desires and expressions. The origins of this silence towards India's rich contributions to sexuality and shunning of it almost are to be found in the repurcussions of the colonial rule and of the [[Bible]]. &lt;ref&gt;García-Arroya, Ana. First Indian Reprint: 2010, Alternative Sexualities in India.&lt;/ref&gt; This shaped the attitude and opinions Indian people hold about their sexuality today; one that is hegemonically hetereosexual and must aim at procreation after marriage. However, from the second half of the 20th century, several significant voices have challenged this silence imposed over sexuality and questioned the roles assigned to desires within the socio-political and artistic fields. Many recently published studies confirm the richness of India's erotic past and popular voices are now spotlighting this for the masses to know. A myriad of folk tales,&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik, Devdutt. 2002. The Man Who Was A Woman And Other Queer Tales.&lt;/ref&gt; sculptures like those in [[Khajuraho]],&lt;ref&gt;LINGIS, ALPHONSO. "KHAJURAHO." Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal, vol. 62, no. 1, 1979, pp. 52–69. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41178110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James Sloan. "The Mystery of the Smiling Elephant: In the Erotic Temples of Khajuraho." The Georgia Review, vol. 53, no. 2, 1999, pp. 321–340. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41401706.&lt;/ref&gt; religious poetry&lt;ref&gt;Kidwai, Saleem and Vanita, Ruth. 2000.

Sakhiyani:Lesbian Desire in Ancient and Modern India&lt;/ref&gt; reveal homoerotic content and how love and sex between women, men, gods, semi-gods and goddesses was expressed.

== Background ==

The seeming contradictions of Indian attitudes towards sex (more broadly - sexuality) can be best explained through the context of history. India played a role in shaping understandings of sexuality, and it could be argued that one of the first pieces of literature that treated "[[Kama]]" as a science came from the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;Vātsyāyana, Richard F. Burton, and ibn M. 'Umar. The Kama Sutra. New York: Diadem Books, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be argued that historically, India pioneered the use of [[sexual education]] through various art forms like sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;Sahai, Surendra.1999. Khajuraho: The Art of Love, Prakash Book Depot&lt;/ref&gt; paintings, and pieces of literature. As in all societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in "self-gratification" lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Moreover, there are distinct cultural differences seen through the course of history across India.

== Ancient times ==
[[File:Khajuraho-Vishvanath Temple erotic detal4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Sculpture]] depicting a sexual Pose]]
The origins of the current Indian culture can be traced back to the [[Indus Valley civilisation]], which was contemporaneous with the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Sumer]]ian civilisations, around 2700 BCE. During this period, the first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]]. These ancient texts, the [[Rig Veda]] among few others, reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. The epics of ancient India, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], which may have been first composed as early as 500 BCE, had a huge effect on the [[culture of Asia]], influencing later [[History of China|Chinese]], [[History of Japan|Japanese]], [[Tibetan culture]] and [[History of Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It seems that [[polygamy]] was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice both [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] as a way of preserving dynastic succession.

[[Nudity]] in art was considered acceptable in southern India, as shown by the paintings at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and the sculptures of the time. It is likely that as in most countries with [[tropical]] climates, Indians from some regions did not need to wear clothes, and other than for [[fashion]], there was no practical need to cover the upper half of the body. This is supported by historical evidence, which shows that men in many parts of ancient India mostly dressed only the lower half of their bodies with clothes and upper part of body was covered by gold and precious stones, jewellery, while women used to wear traditional sarees made of silk and expensive clothes as a symbol of their wealth.

As Indian civilisation further developed and the writing of the [[Upanishads]] around 500&amp;nbsp;BCE, it was somewhere between the 1st and 6th centuries that the [[Kama Sutra]], originally known as Vatsyayana Kamasutram ('Vatsyayana's Aphorisms on Love'), was written.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} This philosophical work on kama shastra, or 'science of love', was intended as both an exploration of human desire, including infidelity, and a technical guide to pleasing a sexual partner within a marriage. This is not the only example of such a work in ancient India, but is the most widely known in modern times. It is probably during this period that the text spread to ancient [[China]], along with [[Buddhist]] scriptures, where Chinese versions were written.

It is also during 10th century to 12th century that some of India's most famous ancient works of art were produced, often freely depicting romantic themes and situations. Examples of this include the depiction of [[Apsaras]], roughly equivalent to [[nymph]]s or [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s in [[Europe]]an and [[Arabic]] mythology, on some ancient temples. The best and most famous example of this can be seen at the [[Khajuraho]] complex in central India built around 9th to 12th century.

== Colonial era ==
[[File:Tamil Book Front Cover 1920s.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Marriage guide published in [[Madras Presidency]], in 1920s]]

Although the Portuguese and French had managed to set up some small enclaves in India, such as Goa, where the [[Catholic]] [[inquisition]] forcibly converted some of the population of the small region to Catholicism, it was the arrival of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], who managed to annex the entire Indian subcontinent through alliances with various monarchs, that had the largest effect on the culture of India and its attitudes to sex. Rule was indirect at first through the [[East India Company]] whose administrators did not necessarily interfere extensively and even took advantage of the tattered remnants of Hindu liberalism in sexual matters, for example through liaisons and by maintaining de facto wives. At the same time there were significant number of [[Orientalism|orientalists]] who saw India as a great civilisation, invented the field of [[Indology]], and advocated a more accepting point of view.

A number of movements were set up by prominent citizens, such as the [[Brahmo Samaj]] in [[Bengal]] and the [[Prarthana Samaj]] in [[Bombay Presidency]], to work for the 'reform' of Indian private and public life. Paradoxically while this new consciousness led to the promotion of [[education for women]] and (eventually) a raise in the [[age of consent]] and reluctant acceptance of [[remarriage]] for [[widows]], it also produced a [[Public morality|puritanical]] attitude to sex even within marriage and the home. The liberality of pre-colonial India had also respected the home and relationships.

== Current issues ==
Conservative views of sexuality are now the norm in the modern republic of India, and South Asia in general. It is often argued that this is partly related to the effect of colonial influence, as well as to the puritanical elements of Islam in countries like Pakistan (e.g. the Islamic revivalist movements, which has influenced many Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh). However, such views were also prevalent in the pre-colonial era, especially since the advent of Islam in India which brought [[purdah]] as ideal for Muslim women. Before the gradual spread of Islam largely through the influence of Sufis, there seems to be evidence of liberal attitudes towards sexuality and nudity in art. However, scholars debate the degree to which Islam, as a mass and varied phenomenon was responsible for this shift.

While during the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s and 1970s]] in the west, many people discovered the ancient culture of sexual liberalism in India as a source for western free love movements, and [[Neotantra|neo-Tantric]] philosophy, India itself is currently the more [[Prude|prudish]] culture, embodying [[Victorian era|Victorian]] sensibilities that were abandoned decades ago in their [[country of origin]]. However, with increased exposure to world culture due to globalisation, and the proliferation of progressive ideas due to greater education and wealth, India is beginning to go through a western-style [[sexual revolution]] of its own, especially in cosmopolitan cities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Modern India===
{{Main article|Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India}}
Modern issues that affect India, as part of the sexual revolution, have become points of argument between conservative and liberal forces, such as political parties and religious pressure groups. These issues are also matters of ethical importance in a nation where freedom and equality are guaranteed in the constitution.

=== Sexuality in popular entertainment ===
{{Main article|Sex in Indian entertainment}} [[Sex in Indian entertainment|The entertainment industry]] is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of Indian society in general. Historically, Indian television and film has lacked the frank depiction of sex; until recently, even [[kissing]] scenes were considered [[taboo]]. On the other hand, rape scenes or scenes showing sexual assault were shown. Currently, some Indian states show soft-core sexual scenes and [[nudity]] in films, whilst other areas do not. Mainstream films are still largely catered for the masses.

=== Pornography ===
{{Main article|Pornography in India}}
The distribution and production of pornography are both illegal in India; however, accessing pornography in private is not. Regardless, softcore films have been common since the late 1970s, and many directors have produced them. Magazine publications like ''[[Debonair (magazine)]],'' ''Fantasy,'' ''Chastity,'' ''Royal Magazine,'' and ''Dafa 302'' exist in India, and more than 50&amp;nbsp;million Indians are believed to see porn on a daily basis.

The [[Information Technology Act]], Chapter XI Paragraph 67, the [[Government of India]] clearly considers online pornography as a punishable offence. The CEO of the Indian subsidiary of [[eBay]] was charged with various criminal offences for allowing the trading of a CD on the website that contained pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iltb.apargupta.com/?p=57 |title=Avnish Bajaj back in Safe Harbors |publisher=India Law and Tech Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex industry ===
{{Main article|Prostitution in India}}
While [[prostitution|trade in sex]] was frowned upon in ancient India, it was tolerated and regulated so as to reduce the damage that it could do. Unfortunately, however, the stigmatisation that has arisen in modern times has left the many poor sex workers with problems of exploitation and rampant [[Sexually transmitted infection|infection]], including [[AIDS]], and worse, it has allowed a huge people-trafficking industry, like that of [[Eastern Europe]], to take hold. Many poor young women are kidnapped from villages and sold into sexual [[trafficking in human beings|slavery]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1205098.stm |title=Sex workers to combat trafficking, BBC News, 2001 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6925376.stm |title=HIV fears over trafficked Nepal sex workers, BBC News, 2007 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some recent efforts to regulate the Indian sex industry.

The '''statistical correlations of criminal behavior''' explore the associations of specific non-criminal factors with specific crimes.

The field of [[criminology]] studies the dynamics of crime. Most of these studies use [[Correlation (statistics)|correlational]] data; that is, they attempt to identify various factors are associated with specific categories of criminal behavior. Such correlational studies led to hypotheses about the causes of these crimes.

''The Handbook of Crime Correlates'' (2009) is a systematic review of 5200 empirical studies on crime that have been published worldwide. A crime consistency score represents the strength of relationships. The scoring depends on how consistently a [[statistically significant]] relationship was identified across multiple studies. The authors claim that the review summarizes most of what is currently known about the variables associated with criminality.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

==Gender and biology==
{{anchor|Genetics}}
{{Main article|Sex differences in crime}}
Crime occurs most frequently during the second and third decades of life. Males commit more crime overall and more violent crime than females. They commit more property crime except [[shoplifting]], which is about equally distributed between the genders. Males appear to be more likely to [[Recidivism|reoffend]]. Measures related to [[arousal]] such as [[heart rate]] and [[skin conductance]] are low among criminals. [[Mesomorphic]] or muscular body type is positively correlated with criminality, in particular with sexual crimes. [[Testosterone]] levels positively correlate to criminal behavior.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

When controlling for age and sex, strong [[human genetics|genetic]] correlates with criminality. Low [[monoamine oxidase]] activity and low [[5-HIAA]] levels tend to be found among criminals.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} [[Monoamine oxidase A]] (dubbed the "warrior gene" in the popular press) is strongly tied to an increased tendency towards [[violent crime]]. In addition, [[CDH13]], a gene previously tied to an increased risk of [[substance abuse]], has been tied to violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic background of extreme violent behavior|journal = Molecular Psychiatry|pages = 786–792|volume = 20|issue = 6|doi = 10.1038/mp.2014.130|first = J|last = Tiihonen|first2 = M-R|last2 = Rautiainen|first3 = H M|last3 = Ollila|first4 = E|last4 = Repo-Tiihonen|first5 = M|last5 = Virkkunen|first6 = A|last6 = Palotie|first7 = O|last7 = Pietiläinen|first8 = K|last8 = Kristiansson|first9 = M|last9 = Joukamaa|pmid=25349169|pmc=4776744|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies are ostensibly related, as the majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime [[Crime in Finland|in Finland]] do so under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The presence of the genetic profile is not determinative, although it increases the likelihood of [[wiktionary:Delinquency|delinquency]] in cases where other factors are present. Ferguson stated,  'a large percentage of our behaviour in terms of violence or aggression is influenced by our biology - our genes - and our brain anatomy.'&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29760212 |title=Two genes linked with violent crime |last=Hogenboom |first=Melissa |date=2014-10-28 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-02-19 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schnupp stated, 'To call these alleles "genes for violence" would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime.'&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Race, ethnicity and immigration==
{{main|Race and crime|Immigration and crime}}
Associated factors include [[race and crime]] and [[immigration and crime|status as an immigrant]]. In some countries, ethnically/racially diverse geographical areas have higher crime rates compared to homogeneous areas, and in other countries, it is the other way around. Some studies on [[immigrants]] found higher rates of crime among these populations; these rates vary according to the country of origin (immigrants from some regions having lower crime rates than the indigenous population).{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} Notions about the propensity for immigrants to commit crime vary among geographical regions. Likewise, the propensity for immigrants to commit more or less crime than the indigenous population also varies geographically. For instance within the United States, census data shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crime than residents who were born within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/immigrants-commit-crimes-us-united-states-born-america-donald-trump-alien-weekly-list-a7548956.html|title=Immigrants less likely to commit crimes than those born in the US|date=2017-01-27|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Associated factors include [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal smoking during pregnancy]], [[Low birth weight]], [[perinatal]] trauma/birth complications,{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}&lt;ref name="Monea2011"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date = June 2011|volume = 43|issue = 2|vauthors=Monea J, Thomas A |title = Unintended pregnancy and taxpayer spending|pages = 88–93|doi = 10.1363/4308811|pmid = 21651707}}&lt;/ref&gt; child maltreatment, low parent-child attachment, marital discord/family discord, alcoholism and drug use in the family, low parental supervision/monitoring, family size and birth order,{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} [[nocturnal enuresis]] or bed wetting, [[bullying]], school disciplinary problems, [[truancy]], low [[grade point average]], dropping out of high school{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} and childhood lead exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline?page=1|title=Sick Kids Are Just the Beginning of America’s Lead Crisis|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult behavior==
Associated factors include high alcohol use, alcohol abuse and alcoholism, high illegal drug use and dependence, early age of first sexual intercourse and the number of sexual partners, social isolation, criminal peer groups and gang membership.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

==Religion==
A few studies have found a negative correlation between [[religiosity]] and criminality. A 2001 [[meta-analysis]] found, "religious beliefs and behaviors exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022427801038001001 | title="If You Love Me, Keep My Commandments": A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Religion on Crime | journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency | date=2001 | volume=38 | issue=1 | pages=3–21 | first=C.

DAVID | last=EVANS}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual with high religious saliency (i.e. expressing the high importance of religion in their life) is less likely to be associated with criminal activities; similarly, an individual who regularly attends religious services or is highly involved in them tends to be less involved in criminality, with the exception of property damage.{{Sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}{{rp|108}} Other meta-analysis research suggests that those who subscribe to more orthodox religious beliefs are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than those who do not.{{Sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}{{rp|112}}

A 1997 study of six public schools found no statistically significant negative correlations between religiosity and crime, or religiosity and drug use, and the only relationship between religiosity and alcohol was statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022427897034002001 | title=An Examination of a Reciprocal Relationship Between Religiosity and Different Forms of Delinquency Within a Theoretical Model | journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency | date=1997 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=163–186 | first=B. B. | last=BENDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more recent review concludes that there are insufficient data to indicate any correlation between religiosity and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions|journal = Sociology Compass|date = 2009-12-01|issn = 1751-9020|pages = 949–971|volume = 3|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00247.x|first = Phil|last = Zuckerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ideology==
A 2016 study found statistically significant evidence that political ideology is moderately correlated with involvement in non-violent but not violent crime, among White individuals and particularly among White women. It suggests that liberal self-classification can, among some groups, be positively associated with non-violent criminal behavior compared to conservative self-classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | authors=Wright, J.P., et al. | title = Political ideology predicts involvement in crime, Personality and Individual Differences | date = 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.062 | volume=106 | journal=Personality and Individual Differences | pages=236–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological traits==
Associated factors include childhood [[conduct disorder]], adult [[antisocial personality disorder]] (also associated with each other),{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}&lt;ref name="WilsonPetersilia2002"&gt;{{cite book |first1=James Q.|last1= Wilson|first2=Joan |authorlink1=James Q.

16877653| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]]'s 1995 report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was -0.2. In his book ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' (1998), Arthur Jensen cited data which showed that IQ was generally negatively associated with crime among people of all races, peaking between 80 and 90.  Learning disability is a substantial discrepancy between IQ and academic performance and is associated with crime. Slow reading development may be particularly relevant.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

Several personality traits are associated with criminality: [[impulsivity]], [[psychoticism]], [[sensation-seeking]], (low) [[self control]], childhood [[aggression]], low [[empathy]] and low [[altruism]].{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

==Socioeconomic factors==
[[Socioeconomic status]] (usually measured using the three variables income (or wealth), occupational level, and years of education) correlates negatively with criminality, except for self-reported illegal drug use. Higher parental socioeconomic status probably has an inverse relationship with crime. Unstable employment and high frequency of unemployment correlate positively with criminality.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.knowswhy.com/why-do-celebrities-get-away-with-crimes/|title=Why do Celebrities get away with Crimes?|last=Morgan|date=22 May 2010|website=www.knowswhy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low socioeconomic status is thought to be positively correlated with higher levels of stress, and therefore the mental and psychological ill-effects of stress.&lt;ref&gt;Baum, A., Garofalo, J.P. and Yali, A.N.N., 1999. Socioeconomic status and chronic stress: does stress account for SES effects on health?. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 896(1), pp.131-144.&lt;/ref&gt; These higher stress levels would probably be correlated positively with the propensity to commit a crime. 

Somewhat inconsistent evidence indicates a positive relationship between low income levels, the percentage of population under the poverty line, low education levels, and high income inequality in an area with more crime in said area.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

A World Bank study said, “Crime rates and inequality&amp;nbsp;are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and&amp;nbsp;this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling&amp;nbsp;for other crime determinants.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fajnzylber | first1 = P. | last2 = Lederman | first2 = D. | last3 = Loayza | first3 = N. | year = 2002 | title = Inequality and violent crime | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%26Inequality.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Journal of Law and Economics | volume = 45 | issue = 1| pages = 1–39 | doi=10.1086/338347| citeseerx = 10.1.1.559.483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic factors==
Associated factors include areas with population size, neighborhood quality, residential mobility, tavern and alcohol density, gambling and tourist density, proximity to the equator,{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} temperature ([[weather]] and season). The higher crime rate in the southern US largely disappears after controlling for non-climatic factors.&lt;ref name="Miller2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.

== Parent/child relationships ==
Children whose parents did not want children are more likely to commit crimes.

==Biosocial criminology and other analysis of environmental factors==
{{main|Biosocial criminology|Environmental criminology}}
[[Biosocial criminology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by [[sociological]] theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name=Asghate2011&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anthony |last1=Walsh|first2=Kevin M |last2=Beaver|chapter=Biosocial Criminology|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V9KhAgAAQBAJ}}|date=28 January 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-9470-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: 
* [[serotonin|serotonin systems]], 
* [[catecholamine|catecholamine systems]], 
* and the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis]]. 
Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=WALTON K. G. |author2=LEVITSKY D. K. |date= 2003 |title= Effects of the Transcendental Meditation program on neuroendocrine abnormalities associated with aggression and crime. |journal= Journal of Offender Rehabilitation |volume=36 |issue=1–4 |pages=67–87 | pmc = | pmid = | issn = | doi= 10.1300/J076v36n01_04 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In environmental terms, the [[Lead and crime hypothesis|theory that crime rates and lead exposure]] are connected, with increases in the latter causing increases in the former, has attracted much scientific analysis. In 2011, a report published by the official United Nations News Centre remarked, "Ridding the world of leaded petrol, with the United Nations leading the effort in developing countries, has resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, 1.2 million fewer premature deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes". The [[California State University]] did the specific study. Then [[United Nations Environment Programme|U.N. Environment Programme]] (UNEP) executive director [[Achim Steiner]] argued, "Although this global effort has often flown below the radar of media and global leaders, it is clear that the elimination of leaded petrol is an immense achievement on par with the global elimination of major deadly diseases."&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40226&amp;Cr=pollutant&amp;Cr1=#.UZdkooJAsR4|title=Phase-out of leaded petrol brings huge health and cost benefits – UN–backed study|date=27 October 2011|accessdate=11 November 2016|publisher=[[United Nations News Centre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technophilia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τέχνη - ''technē'', "art, skill, craft"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dte%2Fxnh τέχνη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φίλος - ''philos'', "beloved, dear, friend"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfi%2Flos2 φίλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) refers generally to a strong [[enthusiasm]] for [[technology]], especially [[new technologies]] such as [[personal computer]]s, the [[Internet]], [[mobile phone]]s and [[home cinema]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;"Technophilia." The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2003. Houghton Mifflin Company 23 Sep. 2012 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/technophilia&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in [[sociology]] to examine individuals' interactions with [[society]] and is contrasted with [[technophobia]].

On a psychodynamic level, technophilia generates the expression of its opposite, technophobia.&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;Richards, Barry. "Technophobia and Technophilia." British Journal of Psychotherapy 10.2 (1993): 188–95. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Technophilia and technophobia are the two extremes of the relationship between [[technology and society]]. The technophile regards most or all technology positively, adopts new forms of technology enthusiastically and sees it as a means to improve life, whilst some may even view it as a means to combat social problems.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

The term technophilia is used as a way of highlighting how technology can evoke in humans strong positive futuristic feelings.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt; However, the reverential attitude towards technology that technophilia produces can sometimes inhibit realistic appraisals of the social and environmental impacts of technology on society.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt; Technophiles do not fear of the effects of technological developments on society, as do technophobes.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; [[Technological determinism]] is the theory that humanity has little power to resist the influence that technology has on society.&lt;ref name="baym"&gt;Baym, Nancy. "Personal Connections In the Digital Age". Cambridge: Polity Press, 2010. p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word technophile is said to have originated in the 1960s as an "unflattering word introduced by technophobes." &lt;ref&gt;"Tenner, Edward. "Confessions Of A Technophile." Raritan 22.1 (2002): 135. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism through technophilia==
Many forms of technology are seen as venerable because the user experiences them as the embodiment of their own narcissism.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt; Technophiles enjoy using technology and focus on the egocentric benefits of technology rather than seeing the potential issues associated with using technology too frequently. The notion of addiction is often negatively associated with technophilia, and describes technophiles who become too dependent on the forms of technology they possess.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt;

==Technological utopia==
Technophiles may view technology's interaction with society as creating a [[utopia]], cyber or otherwise, and a strong indescribable futuristic feeling. "In the utopian stories, technologies are seen as natural societal developments, improvements to daily life, or as forces that will transform reality for the better. Dystopian reactions emphasize fears of losing control, becoming dependent, and being unable to stop change".&lt;ref name="baym" /&gt; Both utopian and dystopian streams are weaved in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''Brave New World'' (1932) and [[George Orwell]]'s ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;On the contrast between Huxley and Orwell on that issue, see [[Michel Weber]]'s "[https://www.academia.edu/5958407/_Aldous_Huxley_and_George_Orwell_on_the_political_use_of_technoscience_2013_ Aldous Huxley and George Orwell on the political use of technoscience]," The Condemned Playground, Balliol College, Oxford University, September 1 / September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Eye of Vichy''''' ({{lang-fr|"'''L'Œil de Vichy'''"}}) is a 1993 [[Cinema of France|French]] documentary film directed by [[Claude Chabrol]]. It consists of a selection in chronological order of authentic footage, mostly newsreels and documentaries, shown on cinema screens in France between 1940 and 1944. Intertitles or a narrator occasionally add linking or supplementary information. The bulk of the material was produced under the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] régime and the aim of the film is to show the worldview which the collaborationist government of [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] promoted to its population.

==Themes==
The main messages conveyed by this Vichy propaganda were:

*That the elderly Pétain was a father to his people, incarnating the true France and heading its legitimate government. The unnamed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] was therefore a traitor and his pretensions to lead an alternative government false.

*That the destiny of France lay in co-operation with the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupiers]] to build a new Europe which excluded Britain and the USA to the west and the USSR to the east.

*That [[collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaboration]] with [[Nazi Germany]] included supplying workers of both sexes to its factories and sending soldiers to fight communism on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)| Eastern Front]]. 

*That the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]] were France's protectors against the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who only brought destruction by bombing and invasion. Coverage of Anglo-American attacks emphasised the civilians killed and dwellings demolished.

*That after resounding victories at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], the invincible German forces made strategic withdrawals from North Africa and Russia.

*That those who [[French Resistance| actively resisted]] the security forces of Vichy and the German occupiers were terrorists to be exterminated and that for every German killed innocent hostages would be shot.

*That [[Jews]] were aliens and enemies, to be rounded up and deported. Their [[Shoah|grim fate]] once transported east was not explained.

==Critical reception==
From [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'':
{{cquote|The Chabrol film is something else: a documentary composed almost entirely of cheery newsreels and propaganda films turned out in France during the occupation. The film has been criticized for not showing what was really going on at the time the newsreels and [[propaganda film]]s were made, though Mr. Chabrol's own voice-over narration bridges most of those gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canby |first=Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CEEDA143BF930A25755C0A965958260 |title=Movie Review - - FILM VIEW; French Movies Offer Tickets To Controversy - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1993-06-13 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From ''[[TV Guide]]'':
{{cquote|This documentary from director Claude Chabrol demonstrates how the old-fashioned compilation can still have a dramatic impact when skillfully edited with a carefully crafted narration. Using Vichy's own newsreels and songs, ''The Eye of Vichy'' shows the blend of opportunism and native fascism that made up the collaborationist government, undercut by brief references to the items not caught by official cameramen at staged events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/the-eye-of-vichy/131665 |title=The Eye Of Vichy Trailer, Reviews and Schedule for The Eye Of Vichy &amp;#124; TVGuide.com |publisher=Movies.tvguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46229">A '''two-child policy''' is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children. It has previously been used in [[Vietnam]]. In [[British Hong Kong]] in the 1970s, citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit (although it was not mandated by law), and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies. Since 2016, it has been implemented in China, replacing the country's previous [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= China to end one-child policy and allow two |work= BBC |date= 29 October 2015 |url= 
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34665539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/29/c_134763507.htm|title=China to allow two children for all couples|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] |date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== China (Mainland) ==
During the 1970s, Chinese citizens were encouraged to have only one child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/one-child-policy|title=one-child policy - Definition &amp; Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing [[Cultural Revolution]] and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors. During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The colloquial term "births per woman" is usually formalized as the ''[[Total Fertility Rate]]'' (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.)

As China's youngest generation (born under the [[one-child policy]], which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) came of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-07-10/154513416121.shtml | language=Chinese | accessdate=7 November 2008 | date=10 July 2007 | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | title=计生委新闻发言人:11%以上人口可生两个孩子 (English: "Spokesperson of the one-child policy committee: 11% or more of the population may have two children)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013, most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news |title=China's 'one-child' rethink marks symbolic shift |author=Patti Waldmeir |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7bed3f70-4dfa-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper=FT |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ouyang | first1 = Y. | title = China relaxes its one-child policy | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62544-1 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9907 | pages = e28–e30 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-07/10/content_17706811.htm|title=Most Chinese provincial areas relax one-child policy - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|first=|last=杨洁|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, since 2012, Han Chinese in southern [[Xinjiang]] were allowed to have two children.

In 2018, about two years after the new policy reform, China is facing new ramifications from the two-child policy. Since the revision of the one-child policy, 90 million women have become eligible to have a second child.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180223131904.htm|title=China's two-child policy may exacerbate gender inequality|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the new two-child policy may have negative implications on gender roles, with new expectations from females to bear more children and to abandon their careers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21736574-two-child-rule-still-applies-officials-know-more-babies-are-needed-not-fewer-china|title=China is in a muddle over population policy|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reform, China saw a short-lived boost in fertility rate for 2016.

Chinese couples have also polled and stated that they would rather invest in one child opposed to two children.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To add, another concern for couples would be the high costs of raising another child; China's childcare system needs to be furthered developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-03-12/no-easing-of-two-child-policy-official-says-101220222.html|title=No Easing of Two-Child Policy, Official Says - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in cultural norms appears to be having negative consequences and leads to fear of a large aging population with smaller younger generations; thus the lack of workforce to drive the economy.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Iran==
Iranian authorities encouraged families in Iran not to have more than two children when conducting [[family planning in Iran]] from early 1990s to late 2006. Iran's government "declared that Islam favored families with only two children", as one historian put it.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.184&lt;/ref&gt; When the family planning program was initiated, Iran's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives - pills, condoms, IUDs, implants, tubal ligations, and vasectomies.&lt;ref name="sciolino"&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors : the Elusive Face of Iran'', Free Press, 2000, 2005 (p.282)&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in 2006, the government's population control policy changed when Ahmadinejad called for reversal of Iran's existing policy of "two children is enough"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stimson.org/swa/pdf/Iran_DemBrief1.pdf Prospects for Ahmadinejad’s Call for More Rapid Population Growth in Iran] {{cite news

In [[Singapore]], the two-child policy until the 1980s was called "Stop at Two".

==United Kingdom==
In July 2007, the [[think tank]] Optimum Population Trust (now [[Population Matters]]) advocated what the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described as a "'two-child' policy" to combat population increases and climate change in the United Kingdom.  The article stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"According to the report, published by the Optimum Population Trust, Britain's high birth rate is a major factor in the current level of climate change, which can only be combated if families voluntarily limit the number of children they have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Firth|first=Niall|title=Families should have no more than two children - thinktank|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-467728/Families-children--thinktank.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2012, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a 'two-child policy',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep|title=Two-child benefits policy targets the strivers in low-paid jobs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/25/iain-duncan-smith-two-child-policy|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been fronted by the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] and former leader of the Conservative Party [[Iain Duncan Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice|first=Andrew|title=What is Iain Duncan Smith's two-child policy?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-is-iain-duncan-smiths-twochild-policy-8227368.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, [[David Cameron]] denied any such plans to cut child benefits or tax credits. However, three months later, [[George Osborne]], the then Finance Minister, announced that child tax credits would be limited to the first two children only. This was to come into force from the 2017/2018 financial year and apply to children born after that date only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Asa|title=Tax credits: what are they, who claims them, and why is everyone so angry about the cuts?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11951056/Tax-credits-what-are-they-who-claims-them-and-why-is-everyone-so-angry-about-the-cuts.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 2019 however the policy becomes retrospective. Families  making a new benefit claim (or whose circumstances change) will have the 2-child policy applied to them irrespective of when their children were born.

The two-child policy took effect on 5 April 2017. One particular aspect of the new rules, termed the "rape clause", has caused controversy. Although the policy excludes all but the first two children from all available benefits, an exemption can be applied for if the conception of the third and any further children occurred as a result of the [[rape]] of the claimant. A woman wishing to claim this exemption must fill in an eight-page form: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The form requires women wanting to be eligible for the exemption to sign a declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex – and giving the child’s name. They must sign a declaration reading: 'I believe the non-consensual conception exemption applies to my child.' They must also sign another declaration that says: 'I confirm that I am not living with the other parent of this child.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter||last2=Butler|first2=Patrick|title=Government under fire over new child tax credit form for rape victims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/06/government-under-fire-over-new-child-tax-credit-form-for-victims|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That the woman must thereby identify the child in question (which is thought to be assigned a tax code created for this exemption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rustin|first1=Susanna|title=The ‘rape rule’ for tax credits tramples the rights of children it’s meant to protect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/17/rape-rule-tax-credits-rights-children-sex-crime|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), that first or second children conceived by rape do not count towards this exemption and that women who are still living with their abusers are not eligible are just some of the aspects of the rape clause that caused widespread condemnation. Ruth Graham, writing for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], summarises the issues surrounding this new policy thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The policy and the exemption have received harsh criticism from a wide variety of sources since they were announced in 2015. One member of parliament called the exemption implementation 'inhumane and barbaric.' Feminists have pointed out the cuts disproportionately affect women. A coalition of the U.K.’s largest Christian denominations and Jewish groups pointed out that the policy discriminates against people whose religion compels them to have larger families. A United Nations committee on children’s rights asked the British government to explain the policy last year, because of concerns about women having to somehow prove they were raped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=Ruth|title=This Cruel New U.K. Policy Punishes Women for Having More Than Two Children 378 69 618|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/04/10/the_u_k_two_child_tax_credit_policy_is_nonsensical_and_cruel.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=Slate|date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History===

From 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into [[North and South Vietnam]] along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region. [[North Vietnam]] became the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and had a communist government, whereas [[South Vietnam]] became the [[Republic of Vietnam]] and was more aligned with the United States and other Western nations.&lt;ref name="Vietnam Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langguth|first1=A.J.|title=Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975|date=March 12, 2002|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1231-1|page=671}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, North Vietnam began a policy advocating a two-child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population.&lt;ref name="Population Council Daniel Goodkind" /&gt; Vietnam's family planning policy was developed before those of other countries, such as China and [[India]], the government used a system of information, education, communication (IEC) campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knudsen|first1=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|date=June 30, 2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5|pages=139–168|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975 under the Communist Party, there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the North to the rest of Vietnam, which extended into the next decade.&lt;ref name="Fertility Family Planning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allman|first1=James|last2=Vu|first2=Qui Nhan|last3=Nguyen|first3=Minh Thang|last4=Pham|first4=Bich San|title=Fertility and Family Planning in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=September 1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=308–317|doi=10.2307/1966685|jstor=1966685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the government of the Republic of Vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy, inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viet Nam|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/vietnam.doc|website=United Nations|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Vietnam government practiced various family planning measures, including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the National Committee for Population and Family Planning. After 1983, each family was required to limit the number of children to two. In 1985, the government increased incentives, such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors, and disincentives, such as penalties for violations in family planning.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam" /&gt;

In 1986, the Party implemented the Renovation (''[[Đổi Mới]]'') Policy, which completely reversed the Communist Party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals. The aims of the Renovation Policy were to end Vietnam's economic isolation, increase competitiveness, and raise living standards.&lt;ref name="History Doi Moi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Donald|title=Doi Moi Policy and the Small-Enterprise Boom in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam|journal=Geographical Review|date=April 1996|volume=86|issue=2|pages=178–197|doi=10.2307/215955|jstor=215955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population, the Vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruun|first1=Ole|last2=Jacobsen|first2=Michael|title=Human Rights and Asian Values: Contesting National Identities and Cultural Representations in Asia|date=2 September 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1212-0|pages=161–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[Government of Vietnam|Council of Ministers]] issued an in-depth family planning policy, adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|date=Mar 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|doi=10.2307/1973424|jstor=1973424|last1=Ministers&amp;#93;|first1=&amp;#91;Council of}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed one-or-two-child policy of Vietnam was established nine years after China's [[one-child policy]] was implemented, and elements of China's policy are reflected in Vietnam's, such as the emphasis on marrying later,&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; postponing childbearing age (22-years of age or older for women and 24-years of age or older for men),&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; and spacing out birth of children (3–5 years apart).&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; The state was required to supply free birth control devices (such as [[intrauterine device|intrauterine loops]], [[condoms]], and birth control pills) and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; Furthermore, if families did not comply with the two-child policy, they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt;

In 1993, the Vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified Vietnam of the one-to-two child policy as a mandatory national policy. The policy combined advertisements and education to promote a smaller family "so people may enjoy a plentiful and happy life."&lt;ref name="Harvard 1993 Resolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution of 1993 on Policy Concerning the Population and Family Planning Work|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/VIETNAM2.htm|website=Hanoi Voice of Vietnam Network|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese government explicitly linked the family planning policy with "historical and cultural traditions, value structures and development objectives," encouraging a collectivist mindset in which individuals honor the needs of the nation above their own.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values" /&gt; The goal of the policy was to reduce the Vietnamese fertility rate to the replacement level of 2.1&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute"/&gt; by 2015, so that the country could have a stable population during mid-21st century. In 1997, the goal was accelerated to reach the replacement level by 2005, and the government subsequently integrated an increased use of abortion as a means to curb population growth.&lt;ref name="World Policy Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=John F.|title=World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact|date=March 30, 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2836-3|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Standing Parliamentary Committee of the National Assembly issued the highest legislative document on population titled the Population Ordinance, which restructured the official family planning policy.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; According to the ordinance, couples "shall have the right to decide on the time to have babies, the number of children and the duration between child births."&lt;ref name="Population 2003"&gt;{{citation|title=Population Ordinance (6/2003)|website=The Standing Committee of National Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly after, the government implemented the National Strategy on Population 2001-2010, which again called for decreasing the fertility rate to the replacement level by 2005. This caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; To address this confusion, the government issued Resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that "to sustain high economic growth, Viet Nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country." However at this time, the population had already reached the goal of having a total fertility rate below the replacement level.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

In 2009, the Population Ordinance was amended to again restrict the number of children to be one or two children, although individuals were allowed to decide the timing and spacing of their births.&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordinance No. 08/2008|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/poppolicy.htm|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is currently drafting a new Law on Population to replace the Population Ordinance in 2015. However, there is disagreement between policy makers and academics on what should be included in the law.&lt;ref name="New Population Law 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pham|first1=Bang Nguyen|title=The Demographic Transition and Implications for the New Law on Population in Vietnam|journal=Asian Population Studies|date=2014|volume=10|issue=3|pages=237–240|doi=10.1080/17441730.2014.955162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
The organizational structure of the two-child policy was housed under different governmental units since its conception in the 1960s. As the policy evolved from "Initiation in the 1960s–1970s; Maturity in the 1980s–1990s; and Legalization in the 2000s–2010s",&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; the administration of the population policy also changed. From 1961-1983, the population program fell under the Population and Birth Control Unit. From 1984–2002, it was under the control of National Committee for Population and Family Planning. From 2003–2006, it was in the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children. Since 2007, the population program has been under the General Office for Population and Family Planning.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

Although the policy was advocated on the national level, the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives, instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"/&gt; Each family was required to have at most two children, and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement. Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice. Individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them, whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the Labor Medal for "good realization of the population – family planning program".&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt; The government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries, promotions, and sometimes even their jobs.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt;

===Current status===

Currently, the effective population policy is the revised 2009 Population Ordinance which states that "each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning, reproductive health care: (i) decide time and birth spacing; (ii) have one or two children, exceptional cases to be determined by the Government."&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend" /&gt; Thus, individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have. Furthermore, later that year, Chief Executive Trương Tấn San stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of Vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020, and suggested that a new comprehensive Law on Population be introduced to the government by 2015.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

===Effects of this policy===

====Reduction of the birthrate====
The total fertility rate in Vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993, suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|title=Falling Fertility in Vietnam|journal=Population Studies: A Journal of Demography|date=1997|volume=51|issue=2|pages=203–211|doi=10.1080/0032472031000149916}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one demographic model, the [[fertility#Bongaarts' model of components of fertility|Bongaarts' model of components of fertility]], high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate. Furthermore, because of this policy, the population has fundamentally changed their ideas of the family. In 1988, the Inter-Censal Demographic and Health Survey found that parents wanted an average of 3.3 children, and in 1994, they found that the ideal number of children fell to 2.8.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility" /&gt;

However, the reported findings differ depending on the [[fertility]] model utilized and on the particular research study cited. The [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|United Nations Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific]] found that the average number in household was 3.1 in 1998.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy" /&gt; In another study conducted by the America-based non-profit, non-governmental organization [[Population Reference Bureau]], the number found was lower at 2.3.&lt;ref name=PRB&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of Population and Development in Vietnam|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2003/AnOverviewofPopulationandDevelopmentinVietnam.aspx|website=Population Reference Bureau|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in the Worldwide State of the Family in 1995 by Tran Xuan Nhi,&lt;ref name="Vietnam Families"&gt;{{citation|last1=Nhi|first1=Tran Xuan|title=Vietnam's families|publisher=Worldwide State of the Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; found a contrasting finding that the [[total fertility rate]] only dropped slightly and the size of [[nuclear families]] experienced only a slight change, dipping from 4.8 to 4.7 from 1989 to 1994.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisensale|first1=Steven|title=Family Policy in a Changing Vietnam|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|date=2000|volume=31|issue=1|pages=79–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex-based differences====

There is evidence that [[son preference]] exists in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Son Preference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Haughton|first2=Dominique|title=Son Preference in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=1995|volume=26|issue=6|pages=325–337|doi=10.2307/2138098|jstor=2138098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, men oversee and are responsible for household enterprises, managing agriculture, ancestral worship, and carrying on the family name.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guilmoto|first1=Christophe Z.|title=Son Preference, Sex Selection, and Kinship in Vietnam|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 2012|volume=38|issue=1|pages=31–54|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00471.x|pmid=22833863}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the desire for a son is seen in the Vietnamese family's fertility practices, the desire for more than one son is not.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Families with two daughters are twice as likely to have a third child than families with at least one son, presumably with the hopes that this one will be a boy.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Furthermore, women who do not have any sons are around 15% less likely to use contraceptives than families who have at least one.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt; There were also increased rates of "contraceptive failure" amongst couples who had a son, as families secretly removed an IUD to bypass the policy in hopes of having a son.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; This is consistent with findings from other East Asian countries in which son preference corresponds with a demand for fewer children so that families will have at least one son to maintain the ancestral line.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt;

Despite the evidence for son preference, there is no clear evidence that Vietnam's sex ratio at birth is increasing, as seen in other East Asian countries, notably China, though evidence is conflicting depending on the source.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; In fact, according to the Vietnamese census data for 1989 and 1999, the sex ratios of males to females at birth are actually decreasing.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; On the other hand, some sources state that the impact of son preference varies by region of Vietnam. In the north, there is a strong relationship between sex bias in fertility decisions and number of male births, while in the south, this relationship is nonexistent.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; However, mothers who pursue certain occupations, such as government cadres and farmers, are more likely to want a particular sex of child and have higher sex-ratio differences at birth. This reflects the pressure for government employees to adhere to the two-child limit, and the perceived necessity of males for manual labor in the farm.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belanger|first1=Daniele|last2=Khuat|first2=Thi Hai Oanh|last3=Liu|first3=Jianye|last4=Le|first4=Thanh Thuy|last5=Pham|first5=Viet Thanh|title=Are Sex Ratios at Birth Increasing in Vietnam?|journal=Population|date=2003|volume=58|issue=2|pages=231–250|doi=10.2307/3246604|jstor=3246604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism===

====Inadequate contraceptives====
Although the policy states that "the state will supply, free of charge, birth control devices... to eligible persons who are cadres, manual workers, civil servants or members of the armed forces... and poor persons who register to practice family planning... The widespread sale of birth control devices will be permitted to facilitate their use by everybody that needs them,"&lt;ref name=JPRS&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|doi=10.2307/1973424 |journal=Population and Development Review|date=February 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|jstor=1973424 |last1=Ministers&amp;#93; |first1=&amp;#91;Council of }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only modern contraceptive readily available in Vietnam is the IUD.&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=S.|title=In Vietnam, Contraceptive Awareness High, Use Low Despite Two-Child Policy|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1992|volume=18|issue=3|pages=117–119|doi=10.2307/2133412|jstor=2133412}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women choose not to use it due to the side effects, such as increased bleeding, back and abdominal pains, headache, and general weakness.&lt;ref name="Abortion IUD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Annika|last2=Le|first2=Thi Nham Tuyet|last3=Nguyen|first3=Lap|last4=Kajsa|first4=Sundstrom|title=Abortion in Context: Women's Experience in Two Villages in Thai Binh Province, Vietnam|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1996|volume=22|issue=3|pages=103–107|doi=10.2307/2950750|jstor=2950750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, contraceptive use is low among women under the age of 25, and experts have speculated that "contraceptive use among young women might increase if temporary, easy-to-use methods, such as the pill and the condom, were more accessible. For the government to achieve its two-child policy, the survey committee recommends increased promotion of the commercial availability of the condom and the pill, and strengthening of the government family planning program."&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern" /&gt;

====Increased abortion====
Abortion rates in Vietnam are unusually high by international standards, with a total abortion rate of at least 2.5 abortions per woman.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodkind|first1=Daniel|title=Abortion in Vietnam: Measurements, Puzzles, and Concerns|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=December 1994|volume=25|issue=6|pages=342–352|doi=10.2307/2137878|jstor=2137878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the abortion rate for young age groups is higher than older age groups due to a limited awareness of contraceptive methods and availability. Individuals of lower educational levels also have higher abortion rates.&lt;ref name="Abortion Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Thanh Binh|title=Abortion in Present Day Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences|date=January 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam also has some of the world's most liberal abortion laws, though the Vietnamese government is aiming to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortion-related difficulties.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whittaker|first1=Andrea|title=Abortion in Asia: Local Dilemmas, Global Politics|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-795-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006,&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ngo|first1=Thoai D.|last2=Keogh|first2=Sarah|last3=Nguyen|first3=Thang H.|last4=Le|first4=Hoan T.|last5=Pham|first5=Kiet H. T.|last6=Nguyen|first6=Yen B.T.|title=Risk factors for repeat abortion and implications for addressing unintended pregnancy in Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|date=June 2014|volume=125|issue=3|pages=241–246|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2013.11.014|pmid=24726618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple factors influencing Vietnam's high abortion rates. First, because women do not have access to contraceptive methods besides IUDs, whilst condoms remain expensive relative to average income, as a result many do not use effective birth control.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Women who have undergone multiple abortions used short-term methods of contraceptives, such as condoms and contraceptive pills, which are less effective than long-acting contraceptives to which many do not have access.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt; Secondly, due to the higher costs of raising a child in some geographic areas of Vietnam, abortions have become more acceptable.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Furthermore, the era of modernization and development of free-market reforms since the 1980s has led to a rise in premarital and unwanted pregnancy, and subsequently increased abortion services.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Additionally, the Vietnamese government has insufficient alternatives to abortion within the family planning purposes and a lack of post-abortion contraceptive dialogues for families.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; Thus, experts have suggested providing more diverse, long-acting contraceptive alternatives and increasing counseling for families that have experienced an abortion as methods to decrease abortion in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt;
