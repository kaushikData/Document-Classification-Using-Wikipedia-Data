      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">'''Abu Dujana Simak bin Kharasha''' was a [[Sahabah]] and a skilled swordsman who is mentioned in [[Hadith]] narrations from the [[six major Hadith collections]] of [[Sunni]] Islam.

==Skilled in melee combat==
Abu Dujana is remembered as being one of Muhammad's most skilled companions in the battlefield, highly excelling in [[melee combat]].  He frequently distinguished himself in battle by wearing a red band on his head, and engaged in bravado before fighting by strutting in front of his adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;Life of the Prophet Muhammad : Al-Sira Al-Nabawiyya By Omar Ibn Kathir, Ibn Kathir, Al-Sira Al-Nabawiyya, pg.20&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Battle of Uhud]], Muhammad gave Abu Dujana  his sword as the often cited hadith narration reads:

:''Anas reported that prophet Muhammad took hold of his sword on the Day of Uhud and said: Who would take it from me? All the persons stretched their hands saying: I would do it, I would do it. He (Muhammad) said: Who would take it in order to fulfil its rights? Then the people withdrew their hands. Abu Dujana said: I am here to take it and fulfil its rights. He took it and struck the heads of the [[polytheists]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/44/183|title=Sahih Muslim : The Virtues Of Abu Dujanah Simak Bin Kharashah|last=Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj al-Naysaburi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Uhud]], Abu Dujana pierced into the enemy's lines, and even came within striking distance to the notorious [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] leader, [[Hind bint Utbah]] who was encouraging others to mutilate the body of dead Muslims.  According to various accounts, Abu Dujana spared her since he did not want to stain Muhammad's sword with the blood of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;History of Islam (Vol 1) By Akbar Shah Najeebabadi, pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Dujana, during the Battle of Uhud, received several wounds in his back after placing himself around Muhammad so as to act as a protection from arrows.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}



Abu Dujana is mentioned in other hadiths including in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim (see also 23:4887) he is found being served a drink by Anas alongside Abu Suhail bin Al-Baida' made from unripe and ripe dates. When the prohibition came on alcoholic drinks, Anas promptly rid them of this drink (he threw it away).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/74/26|title=Sahih Al Bukhari : Unripe-date drink and ripe-date drink should not be mixed if it is an intoxicant, and two cooked foods should not be put in one dish|last=Muhammad al-Bukhari|first=Imam|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=قَالَ إِنِّي لأَسْقِي أَبَا طَلْحَةَ وَأَبَا دُجَانَةَ وَسُهَيْلَ ابْنَ الْبَيْضَاءِ خَلِيطَ بُسْرٍ وَتَمْرٍ إِذْ حُرِّمَتِ الْخَمْرُ، فَقَذَفْتُهَا وَأَنَا سَاقِيهِمْ وَأَصْغَرُهُمْ، وَإِنَّا نَعُدُّهَا يَوْمَئِذٍ الْخَمْرَ. وَقَالَ عَمْرُو بْنُ الْحَارِثِ حَدَّثَنَا قَتَادَةُ سَمِعَ أَنَسًا.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
He died in [[Battle of Yamama]] in 632. He was one of the two warriors who killed the self-proclaimed Prophet [[Musailima]].&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Akram, The Sword of Allah: Khalidt bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns, Nat. Publishing. House, Rawalpindi (1970) {{ISBN|0-7101-0104-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahuntsic''' (died June 25, 1625) was a [[Wyandot people|Huron]], converted by the French [[Recollet]] missionary to the [[Hurons]], [[Nicolas Viel]] in the 1620s.

== Biography ==
[[File:Croix au parc-nature de l'Île-de-la-Visitation en septembre 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Cross in honour of [[Nicolas Viel]] and Ahuntsic at Parc de l'[[Île de la Visitation]]]]
After almost two years spent in the Huron territory, [[Nicolas Viel]] decided to return to [[Quebec City]] in May 1625. Ahuntsic accompanied him during this trip. After a long period of travel, they drowned when their canoe capsized near present-day [[Sault-au-Récollet]]  on June 25, 1625.

The Montreal district of [[Ahuntsic]] and the borough of [[Ahuntsic-Cartierville]] are named for him.

== Contested history ==
Almost nothing is known about the life of Ahunsic before his death. In his definitive history of the Huron people, Canadian ethnohistorian [[Bruce Graham Trigger]] wrote "Auhaitsique [Ahunsic] was not a Huron, but the nickname the Huron had given to a young Frenchman who was probably a servant of the Recollets." Assertions that  Nicolas Viel  and  Auhaitsique were murdered continue to persist. That they might have drowned when their canoe accidentally flipped in a rapid is  entirely likely according to Trigger, and the myth of martyrdom was likely a "tendentious fabrication" to leverage Indian alliances.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce G. Trigger, The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660 (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1987): 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Audrey Mestre''' (11 August 1974 - 12 October 2002)  was a French world record-setting [[Free-diving|freediver]].

== Early life ==

Mestre was born in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], to a family of [[snorkeling]] and [[scuba diving]] enthusiasts.  She began swimming when she was still a baby and won a gold medal in a 25-meter swimming competition at only age two.  She became a seasoned scuba diver by age thirteen but did not get full certification until her sixteenth birthday due to French law.&lt;ref&gt;http://audreymestre.com/bio.htm&lt;/ref&gt; She was still in her teens when her family moved to [[Mexico City]] and, fluent in the [[Spanish language]], she eventually studied marine biology at a university in [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz, Mexico]].

== Relationship with Francisco "Pipín" Ferreras ==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:FranciscoFerrerasAudreyMest.jpg|thumb|Mestre and her husband {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
In 1996 her interest in underwater sports led to her meeting [[Free diving|free-diver]] [[Francisco Ferreras (free-diver)|Francisco "Pipín" Ferreras]]. They immediately developed a relationship and Mestre soon moved to [[Miami, Florida]] to live with Ferreras. There, she took up serious free-diving and with Ferreras as her instructor was soon reaching record depths. In 1999 the two diving aficionados married and the following year, off the coast of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], Audrey Mestre broke the female world record by free diving to a depth of 125 meters (410&amp;nbsp;ft) on a single breath of air. A year later she broke her own record, by descending  to 130 meters (427&amp;nbsp;ft).

== Death ==
On October 4, 2002, with a dive team under her husband's supervision, she made a practice dive off [[Bayahibe]] Beach in the [[Dominican Republic]] to the record depth of 166 metres (545&amp;nbsp;ft). After more deep dive practices, eight days later she prepared to attempt a dive to 171 metres, but at the bottom a problem developed with the lift balloon as she started her ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itPPeroprQI&amp;NR=1 |title=Audrey's last dive |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dive that should have been no more than three minutes resulted in her remaining underwater for more than eight and a half minutes. By the time her husband was able to bring her unconscious body to the surface, it was too late and she was pronounced dead at a hospital on shore.

== Awards and accolades ==
Audrey Mestre was cremated, her ashes scattered at sea. In 2002, she was inducted posthumously into the [[Women Divers Hall of Fame]] and in August 2004 a book that tells her story was written by her husband and published under the title ''The Dive: A Story of Love and Obsession'' ({{ISBN|0-06-056416-4}}).

In 2013, Mestre's life and career were chronicled in ESPN's ''No Limits'' as part of their ''[[Nine for IX]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2013/02/espn-films-and-espnw-announce-nine-for-ix/|title=ESPN Films and espnW Announce Nine for IX|last=Cingari|first=Jennifer|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It specifies the construction and assembly requirements of personal armor for federal, state, tribal and local [[law enforcement]] and [[corrections]] agencies; the requirements of BA 9000 are voluntary (but it is recommended by the NIJ).

{{Nihongo|'''Batou'''|バトー|Batō|lead=yes}} is a main male character in [[Masamune Shirow]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' series. He is the second-best melee fighter in [[Section 9]],&lt;ref name="Official Log 1, page 23"&gt;Official Log 1, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the second in command under [[Major]] [[Motoko Kusanagi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midnightanimation.com/gallery/ghost/gallery/batou.html Midnight Animation's Batou Page.] Retrieved on September 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a battle-hardened special operative with a long military career and a no-nonsense attitude. Though he looks imposing, he is known for his warm heart and sense of humor.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Conception and creation==
Batou's serves as [[Take point|pointman]] whose combat specialty is "[[close quarters combat|near combat]]." Batou often acts as the Section 9 team's [[comedic relief]].

===Background===
Batou's limbs are all cybernetic; despite the fact that exercise provides negligible benefit, Batou enjoys jogging and weightlifting as a hobby. Shirow's characterization of Batou in the manga, and indeed the other members of Section 9, is notably more light-hearted than the characterization used in [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s films of the same name. His eyes, though cybernetic, often bulge comically when he is alarmed. He frequently jokes with Motoko, [[Togusa]], the [[Tachikomas]], and practically everyone else who crosses his path. His serious side becomes much more pronounced in a chapter of the manga where Yano, a trainee of Batou's, is murdered by a cybercriminal named Koil Krasnov. Batou loses his temper and impulsively calls up Section 9 Chief Aramaki, demanding an explanation for Yano's death, then storms off announcing (in the English translation), "That… Koil is dead meat!"

Batou had seemingly hated anyone who tried to make Section 9 fix the mess of another organization, such as the AI hijacking of the Jigabachi choppers in the SAC series. However, in the ''Ghost in the Shell'' movie he appears more stoic and silent than his TV and manga counterpart. Particularly in ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence'', Batou also appears moderately distant and possibly bitter.&lt;ref&gt;'''Batou''': "So what are you saying? Having Saito do the dirty work for them makes it fine? You're not bothered at all?"&lt;br /&gt;'''Saito''': "Batou! It's okay. I'm used to it." (Bandai, English) - {{cite episode| title = DU: Natural Enemy – NATURAL ENEMY| titlelink = List of Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG episodes#ep4| series = Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex| serieslink = Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG| network = Animax| airdate = February 7, 2004| season = 2| number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he jokes around with a hint of irony being mentioned.&lt;ref name="Official Log 1, page 23"/&gt;

===Design===
''Stand Alone Complex'' character designer Hajime Shimomura said that Batou's image was based on the [[Minotaur]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Log 1, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

While his name is officially [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as "Batou", in some copies of the first film's subtitles and credits, it is spelled "[[Bateau]]" (the [[French language|French]] word for "boat").

The name "Batou" means "horse" in Japanese and may refer to Japanese Buddhism's Batou Kannon (Horse-Headed Kannon)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/kannon.shtml#batou&lt;/ref&gt; with his small robotic implant eyes and long face as visual references. It also means "eight-headed" in Mandarin Chinese, which is significant since "Kusanagi" was the name of a sword that was taken from Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed mountain dragon in Japanese mythology.

===Relationships===
Of all Section 9 characters, Batou is closest with the Major professionally and in civilian life. Even on missions, he is known to disregard her rank or authority to "speak freely" without permission.

==Appearances in media==

[[File:Christopher Sabat by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Chris Sabat voices Batou in Arise and The New Movie.]]

===In literature===
Batou originally appeared in the manga authored by [[Masamune Shirow]], serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''"Young Magazine Pirate Edition"'' from 1989 to 1991. Unlike ''S.A.C.'', where in a similar situation Batou spares the life of an ex-[[C.I.A.]] operative, Batou makes good on his threat and personally terminates Koil. His appearance and style of dress vary considerably over the series' run.

In ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface]]'', Batou makes only a cameo appearance and is hardly recognizable. His head is shaved, and he is dressed in a simple black outfit, though his sense of humor remains intact. During a psychic monitoring of the virtual contact between the main character of the manga and another entity on the net, the psychic states, "Something of substance, something fruitful has passed between them," to which Batou remarks, "A [[persimmon]] maybe?" This prompts Chief Aramaki to issue an [[ultimatum]]: "If you can't be serious you can leave the room." He also asks to link with the psychic when she suffers a similar experience to Motoko's contact with the [[Project 2501|Puppet Master]], but his request is denied.

===In films===
====Animated film====
The portrayal of Batou in Mamoru Oshii's films is very different from the depiction in the anime series. ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence|Innocence]]'' depict a Batou who is much more subdued, even to the point of brusqueness. His appearance consists of a white crew-cut (similar to the manga) in the first film, while in the second film he has a short ponytail. Batou is voiced by [[Akio Ōtsuka]] in Japanese and [[Richard Epcar]] in English in all ''Ghost in the Shell'' media with the exception of ''The Laughing Man'' and ''Individual Eleven'' OVAs where he is voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in English, and ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Arise|Arise]]'', where he is voiced by Kenichirou Matsuda and [[Christopher Sabat]] respectively.

Batou is the central character of ''Innocence'', which centers around his personal life after the disappearance of Major Motoko Kusanagi at the end of the first film. Oshii has commented that the investigation is really secondary to the plot. What is most notable about Batou's emotion in ''Innocence'' is his lack thereof; for the most part he expresses nothing whatsoever. The commentary on the ''Innocence'' DVD touches on the fact that it is Batou's lone companion, a [[Basset Hound]] named Gabriel, that express almost all of the emotion in the entire film. When Batou is required to leave in order to continue his investigation, Gabriel is left in the care of [[Togusa]] and his family. [[Ishikawa (Ghost in the Shell)|Ishikawa]], Batou's senior, chides him for keeping such a high-maintenance dog since he is a single man in a dangerous line of work. The film strongly suggests that Batou harbors romantic feelings for the Major; however, no definitive statement of his feelings is ever made.

After shooting his own right arm as a result of brain-hacking, Batou is fitted with a new DNA-matched cybernetic arm with a shotgun hidden inside. He is depicted as being tougher than in the other ''Ghost in the Shell'' incarnations, when he is seen to shoot two live grenades and survive the blast, and withstand a substantial leap down the shaft of the Locus Solus factory ship. In both films, Batou carries a gun dubbed a "Jericho 942," based on the real [[Jericho 941]] made by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]] but chambered for [[.50AE]]. In ''Innocence'', he is also seen with a compact S&amp;W pistol and a small semiautomatic shotgun. The ''Innocence'' prequel novel, "[[After the Long Goodbye]]," notes that Batou's S&amp;W pistol is chambered for the [[.40 S&amp;W]] cartridge.

====Live action film====
[[Pilou Asbæk]] portrays Batou in the 2017 live action film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/pilou-asbaek-scarlett-johansson-ghost-in-the-shell-1201637556/|title=Pilou Asbæk to Co-Star with Scarlett Johansson in 'Ghost in the Shell' (Exclusive)|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The manga is very philosophical, very weird, very spiritual," said Asbæk. "So I knew that my job with Batou was to bring in a little bit of heart and soul into this futuristic sci-fi world." Asbæk had a hard time understanding his character until he looked back at the ''Ghost in the Shell'' source material. "I didn’t have any idea what to do with the character and then I looked at the manga again, and I saw two things. I saw he likes beer, and he likes pizza. And if you know me for five minutes, that’s 80 percent of my personality!" he said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/01/ghost-in-the-shell-meet-the-section-9-team&lt;/ref&gt; The novelization of the film describes Batou as a Scandinavian.

===In television===
====''Stand Alone Complex'' series====
In ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', Batou's personality closely resembles his manga counterpart. He is depicted as an outgoing jokester, but with a quick temper. Unlike the Major, Batou often expresses his anger at injustice and cruelty quite openly. He is sometimes shown to be impatient with Section 9's rookies, such as [[Togusa]]. At times, Batou acts as a voice of reason and displays great concern for the Major, and she in turn admits that she can confide in him. Like Oshii's films, the series suggests romantic tension between the Major and Batou. The film ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society|Solid State Society]]'' more openly addresses this tension, when Batou admits that he'd been covering up the Major's involvement in any cases prior to the Puppeteer case. The movie closes with Batou putting his arm around the Major, although whether or not this is foretelling of any relationship between the two is left ambiguous.

Batou had served in a military [[special forces]] unit and often states that he was a [[Ranger Courses (Japan Ground Self-Defense Force)|Ranger-trained soldier]] with the [[Japanese Ground Self Defense Force]] (JGSDF) before entering Section 9. Despite the fact that his cybernetic body has little to gain from [[exercise]], Batou often lifts weights and [[jogging|jogs]]. He is shown to have an affinity for martial arts and is widely regarded as nearly the best hand-to-hand combatant in Section 9, second only to the Major. He once idolized a famous boxer, Zaitsev, with whom he later spars while on an undercover mission.

Batou is the favorite superior of the [[Tachikoma]]s because he regularly showers them with care and affection; in episode 2.15, it also is apparent that he shares a physical resemblance with their chief programmer. He has even dubbed one unit as his "personal" Tachikoma, refusing to operate any other and treating it with [[organic material|organic]] [[oil]], both habits which culminate in problems. Later in the series, the [[Tachikoma]]s' [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] starts to develop rapidly, which is attributed to a mutation in a protein chip caused by Batou's oil. Also, since Batou treats them as individuals as opposed to interchangeable units, they begin to view themselves as such, which contributes to the development of their AI.

Batou is often seen driving a yellow [[Lancia Stratos]] coupe, a rare Italian car from the 1970s. He is shown to be very protective of the car and is hesitant to allow others to drive it. Togusa refers to Batou's love of the car as a comeback after Batou chides him for using a revolver instead of a more modern weapon. In ''Solid State Society'', Batou drives a yellow [[Ford GT]] with black racing stripes. When the Major notices the new vehicle, she comments to Batou that "his tastes had changed."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15798">A '''bed burial''' is a type of [[burial]] in which the deceased person is buried in the ground, lying upon a bed.  It is a burial custom that is particularly associated with high status women during the early [[Anglo-Saxon]] period (7th century), although excavated examples of bed burials are comparatively rare.

==Anglo-Saxon bed burials==
[[File:Saxon Princess Kirkleatham.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Replica of the "Saxon Princess" bed burial at the [[Street House Anglo-Saxon cemetery]]]]
A number of early Anglo-Saxon bed burials, almost all dating to the 7th century, have been found in England, predominantly in the southern counties of [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Wiltshire]], but single examples have also been found in [[Derbyshire]] and [[North Yorkshire]].  The beds used in these burials were made of wood, and although none have been fully preserved, their presence can be inferred from the presence of iron fixtures and fittings, such as nails, [[Cleat (nautical)|cleats]], [[grommet]]s, brackets, [[Headboard (furniture)|headboard]] mounts and railings, that outline the rectangular shape of the bed in the grave.&lt;ref name="Williams 2006 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antiquity-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Eagles | first=Bruce | title=Review of [[George Speake|G. Speake]], A Saxon bed burial on Swallowcliffe Down| journal=[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine]] | issn=0262-6608 | volume=84 | year=1991 | pages=163–164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in some cases it is not clear whether the iron fixtures found in a grave come from a bed or a coffin.

The majority of the Anglo-Saxon bed burials are for young women, and many of the burials include items of jewellery and other [[grave goods]] that indicate that the dead person must have been wealthy and of high status during life.  The high quality of the gold jewellery found in the [[Loftus, North Yorkshire#Anglo-Saxon royal burial site|bed burial at Loftus]] in Yorkshire suggests that the occupant of the grave may have been a princess.&lt;ref name="redcar-cleveland-2011-05-04"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Anglo-saxon princess' treasure set to go on show | url=http://www.redcar-cleveland.gov.uk/pressrel.nsf/published/may_2011_anglo_saxon_princess_treasure_set_to_go_on_show | date=4 May 2011 | publisher=Redcar and Cleveland News }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some of the young women buried on their beds have [[pectoral cross]]es or other Christian emblems buried with them ([[Ixworth#History|Ixworth]],&lt;ref name=ixworthcross&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=385467 |mname=|accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roundway Down, Swallowcliffe Down, [[Trumpington bed burial|Trumpington]]), which has suggested the possibility that they may have been [[abbess]]es, who in the early Anglo-Saxon period were recruited from noble families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|2005|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to laying the deceased on a bed, some of the bed burials exhibit other features that mark them out as special, and relate them to [[ship burial]]s, such as the bed being placed in a chamber (Coddenham, Swallowcliffe Down), or a [[Tumulus|barrow]] being raised above the grave (Lapwing Hill, Swallowcliffe Down).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2007|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In at least two sites (Loftus and Trumpington), a ''[[grubenhaus]]'' (sunken floored building) has been excavated close to the bed burial, and it is possible that the deceased was laid out in the ''grubenhaus'' before burial so that mourners could pay their respects to her.&lt;ref name="antiquity-2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Sherlock | first1=Steve | last2=Simmons | first2=Mark | title=A seventh-century royal cemetery at Street House, north-east Yorkshire, England | journal=Antiquity | issn=0003-598X | volume=82 | issue=316 | date=June 2008 | url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/sherlock/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miar-report-2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Archaeology at Cambridge 2010–2011 | url=http://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/reports/miar-report-2011.pdf | publisher=Cambridge University | year=2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925231643/http://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/reports/miar-report-2011.pdf | archivedate=2013-09-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex and elaborate funeral practices that must have been associated with a bed burial have been well described by archaeologist [[Howard Williams (archaeologist)|Howard Williams]]:

{{quote|The artefacts, body and grave would have interacted to create a complex sequences of practices and performances in the funeral. We can imagine the digging of the grave, perhaps the lining of the grave with timber shorings, and perhaps a temporary shelter over the grave in the hours or days until the body is ready for burial. We then have the lowering of a bed into the grave, followed by the clothed body together with a set of discrete deposits. Each would have required persons approaching the grave and passing them down to those in the grave itself with the body. Finally, after the funeral had approached completion, the grave would have been back-filled and the mound raised.&lt;ref name="Williams 2006 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Interring the deceased on a bed suggests that sleep was seen as a metaphor for death.&lt;ref name="Williams 2006 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the [[Old English]] word ''leger'' (modern English ''lair''), literally meaning a "place where one lies", was used to refer to both beds and graves in [[Old English literature]], which emphasizes the symbolic equivalence of the bed and the grave.&lt;ref name="cam-2012-03-16"&gt;{{Cite web | last1=Dickens | first1=Alison | last2=Lucy | first2=Sam | title=Mystery of Anglo-Saxon teen buried in bed with gold cross | url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/mystery-of-anglo-saxon-teen-buried-in-bed-with-gold-cross/ | date=16 March 2012 | accessdate=2012-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viking bed burials==
In several [[Viking]] [[ship burial]]s from [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], including the [[Oseberg ship|Oseberg ship burial]] (dated to 834) and [[Gokstad ship|Gokstad ship burial]] (dated to the late 9th century), the deceased had been laid out on beds.  However, true bed burials, in which the bed is buried directly in the ground are not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gjerset|1969|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scragg|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General|Gen]]. '''Benjamín Hill''' (born 31 March 1874, [[Choix]], [[Sinaloa]], &amp;ndash; died 14 December 1920, [[Mexico City]]) was a military commander during the [[Mexican Revolution]].

==Career==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
Following the call of [[Francisco I. Madero]] he joined the revolution in 1910. He was briefly imprisoned in the city of [[Hermosillo, Sonora]], during 1911. Following his release, he took up arms and raised a volunteer army that took [[Navojoa]] and was marching on [[Álamos]] when the [[Treaty of Ciudad Juárez]] was signed.
 
In 1912 he fought against the rebellion led by [[Pascual Orozco]] and, following the 1913 [[coup d'état]] of [[Victoriano Huerta]], he joined the northwestern corps of the [[Constitutional Army|Constitutionalist Army]], which would ultimately be commanded by Gen. [[Álvaro Obregón]], alongside whom he fought in the campaigns against [[Pancho Villa|Francisco "Pancho" Villa]] in the [[Bajío]]. He served as [[Governor of Sonora]] from August 1914 until January 1915.

Following the victory of [[Venustiano Carranza]] he was promoted to [[Divisional General]]. In 1920 he was one of the main proponents of the [[Plan of Agua Prieta]], fighting in the military rebellions that ensued.
When Obregón assumed the [[President of Mexico|presidency]] on 1 December 1920, he appointed Hill as his [[Secretariat of National Defense|Secretary of War and the Navy]]. He was seen as a potential presidential successor to Obregón, which brought him into conflict with [[Secretariat of the Interior|Interior Secretary]] [[Plutarco Elías Calles]]. A few days after his appointment.

==Death and legacy==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
in 1920, Hill died at age 46 under suspicious circumstances after attending a luncheon; poisoning, at the hands of Calles, has often been suspected.

The town of [[Benjamín Hill, Sonora]], was named in his honour.

'''Caliper, A PerkinElmer Company'''  is based in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]] with direct sales, service and application-support operations in countries around the globe.  Founded in 1995, Caliper
develops products and services to the life sciences research community, including [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] companies, and government and other not-for profit research institutions.

Caliper’s integrated systems, consisting of instruments, software and [[reagents]], [[laboratory automation]] tools and [[drug discovery]] assay services enable researchers to better understand the basis for disease and more effectively discover safe and effective drugs.  Caliper’s product portfolio includes,  [[microfluidics]], lab automation &amp; liquid handling, optical imaging technologies, and [[drug discovery]] &amp; [[drug development]] outsourcing solutions.

== Microfluidic platform ==
Caliper is a pioneer in [[microfluidic]] [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology which represents a significant advancement in laboratory experimentation, bringing the benefits of miniaturization, integration and automation to numerous research-based industries.  Caliper’s proprietary microfluidic sipper chips are a high-throughput complement to the planar chips which Caliper manufactures for the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.  The microfluidic technology forms the basis of Caliper’s LabChip EZ reader systems used for drug screening and profiling and the LabChip GX series for molecular biology [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[protein analysis]].

== Optical imaging ==
Through its acquisition of Xenogen Corporation in 2006, Caliper is now a developer of [[in vivo]] biophotonic imaging technology, which allows for real-time, non-invasive exploration of [[genes]], proteins, pathogens, and tumor cells in living animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Advancing bioluminescence imaging technology for the evaluation of anticancer agents in the MDA-MB-435-HAL-Luc mammary fat pad and subrenal capsule tumor models.| date=2009-01-01 | publisher=| pmid=19118051| doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0897| volume=15| issue=1| journal=Clin. Cancer Res.| pages=238–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caliper offers a complement of patented biophotonic and fluorescent imaging technologies, as well as genetically modified animal programs.  Caliper’s imaging product lines include a suite of IVIS imaging systems - many measuring both bioluminescence and fluorescence, ''in vivo'' imaging reagents, specialized light producing animal models, and genetic modification programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development. In a recent Japanese study, the IVIS imaging system was used to evaluate the binding affinity and RNA interference ([[RNAi]]) of LMWC/[[siRNA]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evaluation of the binding affinity and RNA interference of low-molecular-weight chitosan/siRNA complexes using an imaging system | date=2008-10-30 | publisher=| pmid=19337002 | volume=129 | issue=4 | journal=Yakugaku Zasshi | pages=475–84 | doi=10.1248/yakushi.129.475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lab automation and liquid handling ==
Caliper has held a long standing position in laboratory automation starting with the introduction of the world’s first lab robotic system, the Zymark Zymate.  To date, Caliper has a number of lab automation and liquid handling systems for the life sciences industry.  In January 2009, the Zephyr Genomics Workstation was introduced which promises to deliver a benchtop solution for automating routine but critical processes for [[molecular biology]] such as [[nucleic acid purification]], reaction setup and normalization.

In addition to automating molecular biology, Caliper has many other [[robotic]] systems including the Zephyr SPE and RapidTrace SPE workstations to automate [[solid phase extraction]] and several liquid handling and plate management systems including the Sciclone ALH 3000 liquid handler and Twister II systems to automate drug discovery and development.

Caliper also custom designs integrated vendor-neutral instruments and software such as the Twister II - LightCycler (Roche) integrated system which fully automates real-time [[PCR]].

== Discovery and development outsourcing solutions ==
Caliper’s Discovery Alliances &amp; Services division (CDAS) was created from the acquisitions of NovaScreen, a provider of [[in vitro]] &amp; [[in vivo]] discovery services.  CDAS develops, utilizes, and provides a comprehensive array of services to improve the productivity, accelerate the pace, and reduce the cost of the [[drug discovery]] process. The ''in vitro'' service arm of CDAS includes a comprehensive array of ''in vitro'' drug discovery and development solutions including more than 1000 screening [[assays]] that help define the mode of action, side effect profiles, selectivity, and other relevant activities of drug candidates. ''In vivo'' capabilities include:  non-invasive ''in vivo'' [[optical imaging]], OncoMouse studies, and ''in vivo'' compound evaluations for safety assessment and [[drug repositioning]].

== History ==
Caliper Life Sciences was founded in 1995 by [[Larry Bock]] and Drs. Michael Knapp, Michael Ramsey and Andreas Manz. as Caliper Technologies with a strong focus on microfluidics technology. In 2003, Caliper acquired Zymark a leader in laboratory automation and robotics and Caliper Life Sciences was born.  In October 2005, Caliper acquired NovaScreen Biosciences Corporation a privately held CRO offering pre-clinical drug discovery and development services.  NovaScreen’s services included ''in vitro'' compound profiling for safety assessment, drug discovery screening services for targets such as  GPCRs, Kinases, Ion Channels, Transporters, Nuclear Receptors and customized assay development services.  In August 2006, Caliper acquired Xenogen Corporation,  a developer of ''in vivo'' optical imaging systems (IVIS systems) and its division, Xenogen Biosciences a CRO offering ''in vivo'' transgenic animal production, phenotyping, gene targeting and ''in vivo'' optical imaging services.

At the end of October 2008, SOTAX—a tester and software developer of medical devices—acquired Caliper's Pharmaceutical Development &amp; Quality Analysis (PDQ) Division for $15.8 Million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Caliper sells biz unit for $15.8M to SOTAX | date=2008-10-30 | publisher=Mass High Tech | url=http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/10/27/daily33-Caliper-sells-biz-unit-for-158M-to-SOTAX.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Caliper Grabs $15.8M In Product Line Sale | date=2008-10-30 | publisher=Worcester Business Journal | url=http://www.wbjournal.com/news41938.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter on November 10, 2008, Caliper's AutoTrace(r) line of product was acquired by [[Dionex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dionex Enters Into Agreement With Caliper Life Sciences to Acquire Product Line for Water Sample Preparation | date=2008-11-10 | publisher=MarketWatch | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Dionex-Enters-Into-Agreement-With/story.aspx?guid=28223301-9045-48B7-A4B0-FEF2C02E2C73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, [[Taconic Biosciences]] acquired XenoGen Biosciences ''in vivo'' pre-clinical CRO subsidiary of Caliper Life Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Taconic Acquires Xenogen Biosciences Subsidiary of Caliper Life Sciences| date=2009-12-14 | publisher=Taconic | url=http://www.taconic.com/resources/newsroom/2009/xenogen-biosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later in December 2010, Caliper purchased Cambridge Research &amp; Instrumentation Inc. for about $20 million in a cash and stock deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Caliper buying Cambridge Research for $20 million | date=2010-12-09 | publisher=Bloomberg | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-09/caliper-buying-cambridge-research-for-20-million.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camille Lepage''' (January 28, 1988 &amp;ndash; May 12, 2014) was a [[France|French]] photojournalist who was killed during the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–present)|conflict in the Central African Republic]] in 2014. Her death was described as a "murder" by the French presidency and it marked the first death of a Western journalist in the conflict.

== Early life and career ==
After completing her secondary education in Collège Saint-Martin in [[Angers]], Lepage went on to study journalism in [[Southampton Solent University]], during which she completed an [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus]] year in [[Utrecht]]'s [[HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht|University of Applied Sciences]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copainsdavant.linternaute.com/p/camille-lepage-10314382|title=Copains d'avant (Camille Lepage)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rue89 Career"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2014/05/13/camille-lepage-tuee-centrafrique-ex-stagiaire-rue89-252146|title=Camille Lepage, tuée en Centrafrique, avait fait " un bout de rue " avec nous|date=May 13, 2014|publisher=Rue89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later specialized in [[photojournalism]] and worked independently in Africa, most notably in [[Egypt]], [[South Sudan]] and the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref name="Rue89 Career"/&gt; After finishing her degree in Southampton, she moved and based herself in South Sudan's capital [[Juba]] in July 2012, a year and a half before arriving to [[Bangui]] (CAR's capital) where she spent the last few months of her life. She opened up about her interests in conflicts and photojournalism in an interview a year before her death, where she was asked about her top moments of her career to date and she responded, "Not sure I can talk about my 'career' just yet, I’m still just getting started! I find it amazing to be able to travel probably to some of the most remote areas, meet wonderful people everywhere and being able to document them."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/13/french-photojournalist-camille-lepage-killed-central-african-republic|title=French photojournalist Camille Lepage killed in Central African Republic|date=May 13, 2014|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/05/13/photographer-camille-lepage-killed-in-central-african-republic/#1|title=Photographer Camille Lepage Killed in Central African Republic|date=May 13, 2014|publisher=TIME}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a well-known photojournalist and her work has been published in several news outlets, such as : [[New York Times]], [[The Guardian]], [[Le Monde]], [[The Washington Post]], [[Der Spiegel]], [[Libération]], [[Le Nouvel Observateur]], [[La Croix]], [[The Sunday Times]], [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Vice Magazine]], [[Al Jazeera]] and was widely used by [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UN News Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47792#.U3vwGCg69rs|title=UN condemns murder of French photojournalist in Central African Republic|date=May 14, 2014|publisher=United Nations News Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had also worked for several non-governmental organizations including : [[WFP]], [[Enough Project]], [[UNESCO]], [[Internews]], [[Crown Agents]], [[Deloitte]], [[Amnesty International]] and [[Médecins sans Frontières]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27400896|title=French journalist Camille Lepage killed in CAR|date=May 13, 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hanslucas.com/clepage/photo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/13/camille-lepage-photos-photography-journalist-french-murdered_n_5317931.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Lepage spoke passionately about the seriousness of the news stories surrounding the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–present)|Central African Republic conflict]] that are not covered by the mainstream media: "I can’t accept that people’s tragedies are silenced simply because no one can make money out of them," she said. "I decided to do it myself, and bring some light to them no matter what."&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/05/13/rip-camille-lepage-french-photojournalist-killed-in-central-african-republic/|title=RIP Camille Lepage, French photojournalist killed in Central African Republic|date=May 13, 2014|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In November 2013, the UN warned the Central African Republic was at risk of spiraling into genocide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24800682|title=UN warning over Central African Republic genocide risk|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "descending into complete chaos".&lt;ref name=BBC20131126&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25095471|title=BBC News - Central African Republic 'descending into chaos' - UN|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and France described the country as "...on the verge of genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/uk-centralafrica-france-idUKBRE9AK0WU20131121|title=France says Central African Republic on verge of genocide|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week before her death, Lepage's last entries on [[Instagram]] and [[Twitter]] said that she was traveling by motorbike for hours with an [[anti-balaka]] militia down routes chosen to avoid checkpoints of African peacekeepers to Amada Gaza about 120&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Berbérati]], where 150 people had been killed by [[Séléka]] rebels since March.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WPost"/&gt;

On May 13, 2014, Lepage's body was found by French peacekeeping troops patrolling in the [[Bouar]] region west of the country in a vehicle driven by anti-balaka rebels.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; Father Jean Maruis Zoumaldé, director of Radio Siriri in the region, said she had been in an area where there was intense fighting between the two sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20140513173910-puv1t/?source=fiTheWire|title=French journalist murdered in Central African Republic- Hollande|date=May 13, 2014|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had reportedly been traveling near the CAR border with [[Cameroon]] when she became caught up in fighting.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

=== Reactions ===
*The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) called for an immediate investigation into Lepage's death. “We call on the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic as well as French authorities to ensure a thorough investigation into Camille Lepage’s death,” said CPJ Africa Advocacy Coordinator Mohamed Keita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appablog.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/cpj-calls-for-probe-into-french-journalists-death-in-car/|title=CPJ calls for probe into French journalist’s death in CAR|date=May 14, 2014|publisher=African Press Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) and the [[European Federation of Journalists]] (EFJ) have urged the transitional government of the Central African Republic and all international forces based in the country to do everything in their power to ensure the murderers of French journalist, Camille Lepage, answer for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/justice-french-journalist-camille-lepage-murdered-central-african|title=Justice for French Journalist Camille Lepage Murdered in Central African Republic|date=May 14, 2014|publisher=ReliefWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|France}} - The [[Élysée Palace|Élysée]] said in a statement that French President [[François Hollande]] had ordered the immediate dispatch of a French team and police from the African force deployed in the country to the scene. "All necessary means will be deployed to shine light on the circumstances of this assassination and find the killers of our compatriot," the statement said, which also used the word ''assassinat'' ("murder" in English) to suggest that Paris has information that Lepage was targeted deliberately.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; French Foreign Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] described Lepage as a "journalist and photographer of great courage."&lt;ref name ="CNN UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/14/world/africa/central-african-republic-crisis/|title=U.N. condemns killing of French journalist in Central African Republic|date=May 14, 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|United Nations}} - The UN has condemned the murder of the French photojournalist:&lt;ref name="UN News Center"/&gt;
:*[[United Nations Security Council|UNSC]] - The Council condemned the killing of Lepage and said that "those responsible for the killing shall be held accountable."&lt;ref name ="CNN UN"/&gt; It also recalled in a statement that, in accordance with international humanitarian law, journalists, media professionals and associated personnel engaged in dangerous professional missions in areas of armed conflict are generally considered as civilians and shall be respected and protected as such.&lt;ref name="UN News Center"/&gt;
:*[[UNESCO]] - [[Irina Bokova]], Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) said: "I condemn the killing of Camille Lepage, whose only desire was to show, through her work, the fate of marginalised populations,” and called on the country’s authorities to do everything possible to shed light on the circumstances of her death and bring the perpetrators to justice.&lt;ref name="UN News Center"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29110">[[Capital punishment]] is a legal penalty in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The country performed at least 158 executions in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Saudi Arabia ends 2015 with one final execution|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-ends-2015-with-one-final-execution-a6793506.html|publisher= The Independent |accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least 154 executions in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Death sentences and executions in 2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/ |publisher= amnesty.org |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 146 executions in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/death-penalty-facts-and-figures-2017/|title=The Death Penalty in 2017: Facts and Figures|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=2018-04-12|accessdate=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Death sentences in Saudi Arabia are pronounced almost exclusively based on the system of judicial sentencing discretion (''[[tazir]]'') rather than Sharia-prescribed (''[[hudud]]'') punishments, following the classical principle that ''hudud'' penalties should be avoided if possible.&lt;ref name=vikor&gt;{{Cite book|first=Knut S.|last=Vikør| year=2005 | title=Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=266-267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in death sentences during recent decades resulted from a concerted reaction by the government and the courts to a rise of violent crime in the 1970s and paralleled similar developments in the U.S. and China in late 20th century.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;

==Method==
Saudi Arabia has a criminal justice system based on a hardline and literal form of [[Shari'ah]] law reflecting a particular state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam.

It is usually carried out [[public execution|publicly]] by beheading with a sword.
A recent report by the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights (ESOHR) shows that the number of beheadings in the kingdom during the first quarter of 2018 rose by over 70 percent compared to the same period last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ifpnews.com/wired/number-of-beheadings-in-saudi-arabia-rises-by-70/|title=Number of Beheadings in Saudi Arabia Rises by 70%|website=IFPNews.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally they can be performed by shooting.

A public beheading will typically take place around 9am. The convicted person is walked into the square and kneels in front of the executioner. The executioner uses a sword known as a sulthan to remove the condemned person's head from his or her body at the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOCUMENT - SAUDI ARABIA: AN UPSURGE IN PUBLIC EXECUTIONS|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde23/004/1993/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the convicted person is pronounced dead, a police official announces the crimes committed by the beheaded alleged criminal and the process is complete. The official might announce the same before the actual execution.  This is the most common method of execution in Saudi Arabia because it is specifically called for by Sharia law. Professional executioners behead as many as ten people in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/justice-sword-saudi-arabias-embrace-death-penalty-780819 |title=Justice By The Sword: Saudi Arabia's Embrace Of The Death Penalty |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2012-09-11 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion of the beheaded body is sometimes ordered.&lt;ref name= Miethe&gt;{{cite book |title=Punishment: a comparative historical perspective  |last=Miethe |first=Terance D. |author2=Lu, Hong |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-60516-8 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2009, the ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'' reported that "An [[Abha]] court has sentenced the leader of an armed gang to death and three-day crucifixion (public displaying of the beheaded body) and six other gang members to beheading for their role in jewelry store robberies in [[Asir]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death, crucifixion, for jewelry gang  |url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009080545807 |newspaper=The Saudi Gazette |date=August 5, 2009 |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(This practice resembles [[gibbeting]], in which the entire body is displayed).

In 2003, [[Muhammad Saad al-Beshi]], whom the [[BBC]] described as "Saudi Arabia's leading executioner", gave a rare interview to [[Arab News]].&lt;ref name= BBCexecutioner/&gt; He described his first execution in 1998: "The criminal was tied and blindfolded. With one stroke of the sword I severed his head. It rolled metres away...People are amazed how fast [the sword] can separate the head from the body."&lt;ref name= BBCexecutioner&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2966790.stm |title=Saudi executioner tells all |date=5 June 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said that before an execution he visits the victim's family to seek forgiveness for the criminal, which can lead to the criminal's life being spared.&lt;ref name= BBCexecutioner/&gt; Once an execution goes ahead, his only conversation with the prisoner is to tell him or her to recite the Muslim declaration of belief, the ''[[Shahada]]''.&lt;ref name= BBCexecutioner/&gt; "When they get to the execution square, their strength drains away. Then I read the execution order, and at a signal I cut the prisoner's head off," he said.&lt;ref name= BBCexecutioner/&gt;

===Murder===
Murder is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. If a murderer pays a family of the victim [[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]], and the family approves of the choice, the murderer will not be executed. The criminal justice system waits until the family makes a decision on whether the family of the victim will accept blood money&lt;ref name=Mackeyp270&gt;[[Sandra Mackey|Mackey]], p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; or if the family of the victim will choose to have the murderer executed, or to completely forgive the perpetrator.

===Other offences===
====Sharia background====
The Saudi judiciary can impose the death penalty according to three categories of criminal offence in [[Sharia law]]:&lt;ref name= Otto166&gt;

Giving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as Saudi Arabia's,&lt;ref name= Kritzer/&gt; and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as an admission of guilt resulting in conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=King Faisal and the modernisation of Saudi Arabia | last=Beling | first=Willard A. | year=1980 | isbn=0-7099-0137-2 | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adultery====
In order for an individual to be convicted in a Saudi sharia law court of adultery, he/she must confess to the act four times in front of the court; otherwise four pious male Muslims who witnessed the actual sexual penetration must testify in front of the court. If the witnesses were spying on the defendants or intentionally watched the defendants commit adultery, their uprightness would be called into question and a conviction for adultery would not take place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/daruliftaa/7741 |title=Can you provide me with some details concerning the punishment for committing adultery? Is it necessary to have a punishment for the sin to be forgiven? - IslamQA |date=28 July 2012 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Islamic sharia law, the burden of proof is on the accuser; and if only one of those witnesses retracted his/her testimony then the accused will be acquitted and the remaining witnesses will be prosecuted for perjury [http://quran.com/24 Quran 24:4]. 

The execution method for adultery for men and women is stoning. If the conviction was established based on confession, a retraction of the confession or the defendant leaving the pit while stoning is taking place results in the penalty being stayed. If the conviction was established based off the testimony of four witnesses, the witnesses must initiate the stoning, and failure to do so results in the execution being stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=86838 |title=Punishment for adultery in Islam |work=islamweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Mackey]], author of ''The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom'', stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, "unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Qur'anic law [for adultery] are extremely rare."&lt;ref name=Mackeyp271&gt;[[Sandra Mackey|Mackey]], p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Mackey explained that "[c]harges of adultery are never made lightly. Since the penalty is so severe, women are protected from unfounded accusations of sexual misconduct".&lt;ref name=Mackeyp271/&gt; During a human rights dialogue with European jurists that took place several years before 1987, a Saudi delegate acknowledged that it is difficult to have a person convicted of adultery.&lt;ref name=Mackeyp271/&gt; According to Mackey, in a 20-year period ending in 1987, one woman "is acknowledged to" have been executed by stoning for adultery.&lt;ref name=Mackeyp271/&gt;

====Witchcraft====

== 2016 mass execution ==
{{Main|2016 Saudi Arabia mass execution}}
On January 2, 2016, the kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] carried out a mass [[execution]] of 47 imprisoned civilians convicted for terrorism in 12 different [[Regions of Saudi Arabia|provinces]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/04012016-saudi-arabia-carries-out-largest-mass-execution-since-1980/ |title=Saudi Arabia Carries Out Largest Mass Execution Since 1980 – Eurasia Review |website=Eurasiareview.com |date=2016-01-02 |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-three were [[beheading|beheaded]] and four were executed by [[firing squad]]s.

==Criticism==
The use of public beheading as the methods of capital punishment and the number of executions have attracted strong international criticism.&lt;ref name= "Sharia Inc175"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sharia Incorporated: A Comparative Overview of the Legal Systems of Twelve Muslim Countries in Past and Present |last=Otto |first=Jan Michiel |year=2010 |isbn=978-90-8728-057-4 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several executions, particularly of [[Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia|foreign workers]] have sparked international outcries.

In June 2011, Ruyati binti Satubi, an Indonesian maid, was beheaded for killing her employer's wife, reportedly after years of abuse.&lt;ref name="jakartapost1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/08/govt-tries-save-280-indonesians-death-row.html |date=8 July 2012 |title=Hundreds of Indonesians on death row |last=Sijabat |first=Ridwan Max |work=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jakartapost2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/21/indonesia-%E2%80%98feels-cheated%E2%80%99-saudi-government.html |date=21 June 2011 |title=Indonesia 'feels cheated' by Saudi government |work=Jakarta Post |accessdate=14 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011161544/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/21/indonesia-%E2%80%98feels-cheated%E2%80%99-saudi-government.html# |archive-date=2012-10-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the execution, posted online, drew extensive criticism.&lt;ref name="jakartapost3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/20/ruyati-beheading-a-blow-sby%E2%80%99s-claims.html |date=20 June 2011 |title=Ruyati beheading is a blow to SBY’s claims |work=Jakarta Post |accessdate=14 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115191931/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/20/ruyati-beheading-a-blow-sby%E2%80%99s-claims.html# |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, a Sudanese migrant worker was beheaded for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sudanese man executed in Saudi Arabia for ’witchcraft and sorcery’  |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article40213 |newspaper=[[Sudan Tribune]]|date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an execution which [[Amnesty International]] condemned as "appalling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/saudi-arabia-executes-man-convicted-sorcery-2011-09-20 |title=Saudi Arabia executes man convicted of "sorcery" |author= |date=20 September 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a [[Sri Lanka]]n maid named [[Rizana Nafeek]] was beheaded after she was convicted of murdering a child under her care, an occurrence which she attributed to the infant choking. The execution drew international condemnation of the government's practises,&lt;ref name="the guardian1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/saudi-arabia-treatment-foreign-workers |date=13 January 2013 |title=Saudi Arabia's treatment of foreign workers under fire after beheading of Sri Lankan aid |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |work=The Guardian |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led Sri Lanka to [[Letter of credence|recall its ambassador]].&lt;ref name="al jazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2013/01/201311116530348352.html|date=12 January 2013| title=The plight of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia |work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are not isolated cases. According to figures by Amnesty International, in 2010 at least 27 migrant workers were executed and, {{as of|January 2013|lc=yes}}, more than 45 foreign maids were on [[death row]] awaiting execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The beheading of a housemaid in Saudi Arabia highlights slave-like conditions  |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-beheading-of-a-housemaid-in-saudi-arabia-highlights-slavelike-conditions-8451951.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2013 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the death penalty has also been used to sentence political protestors. [[Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr|Ali al-Nimr]] and [[Dawoud al-Marhoon]] were both arrested at the age of 17 in 2012 during [[2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests|Arab Spring protests]] in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], tortured, forced to confess, and sentenced to decapitation in 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref name="Huff_ArabSpring_activist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AI_AliNimr_exec_risk_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBT_nephew_NimralNimr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reprieve_alMarhoon" /&gt; [[Sheikh Nimr|Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr]], an independent sheikh critical of the Saudi government and popular among youth&lt;ref name="08RIYADH1283"/&gt; and Ali al-Nimr's uncle, was also arrested in 2012 and sentenced to death by the [[Specialized Criminal Court (Saudi Arabia)|Specialized Criminal Court]] in 2014 for his role in encouraging political protests.&lt;ref name="BBC20141015_alNimr_deathsentence" /&gt; Nimr al-Nimr was executed on January 2, 2016, along with 46 other people, mostly terrorists arrested in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamieson|first1=Alastair|last2=Gubash|first2=Charlene |title=Arab Spring Cleric Nimr al-Nimr Among 47 Executed by Saudi Arabia |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/reformist-cleric-sheikh-nimr-al-nimr-among-47-executed-saudi-n489116 |accessdate=3 January 2016 |publisher=NBC News |date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the available sources about Nimr al-Nimr case it seems that Saudi officials use the term "[[terrorism]]" as cover label for "thought crimes" which would be in other countries considered as normal work of opposition politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saudigazette.com.sa/saudi-arabia/saudi-iran-is-last-country-to-talk-about-terrorism/|title=Saudi: ‘Iran is last country to talk about terrorism’ - Saudi Gazette |first=Ajaz|last=Ali |date=3 January 2016 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the list of accusations against Nimr al-Nimr there is mention about "taking up arms against the security forces" but the details of what exactly happened are missing. It is not clear if some member of Saudi armed forces was injured or killed by Nimr al-Nimr and what happened before the incident.

Although there is no exact definition of the term "terrorism", the most common meaning is "to use intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror or fear, in order to achieve a political, religious or ideological aim ... against civilians or non-combatants". Also most terrorist attacks are characterised by long-term planning so clearly there is subtle difference between common crime (even with lethal consequences) and act of terrorism. Based on previous experience with human rights violation in Saudi Arabia there are strong reasons to take the statements of Saudi officials that Nimr al-Nimr is convicted terrorist with suspicion. This is supported by fact that in the list of offenses done by Nimr al-Nimr most of them are purely "thought crimes" like "disobeying the ruler", "inciting sectarian strife" and "encouraging, leading and participating in demonstrations".{{fact|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36857">'''Computational chemistry''' is a branch of [[chemistry]] that uses [[computer simulation]] to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of [[theoretical chemistry]], incorporated into efficient [[computer program]]s, to calculate the structures and properties of [[molecule]]s and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion ([[dihydrogen cation]], see references therein for more details), the quantum [[many-body problem]] cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.  While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical [[experiment]]s, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical [[phenomena]]. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.

Examples of such properties are structure (i.e., the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and [[interaction energy|relative]] (interaction) [[energy|energies]], [[electron]]ic [[charge density]] distributions, [[dipole]]s and higher [[multipole moment]]s, [[vibrational spectroscopy|vibrational frequencies]], [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], or other [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] quantities, and [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for [[scattering theory|collision]] with other particles.

The methods used cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases, the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied.  That system can be one molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid.  Computational chemistry methods range from very approximate to highly accurate; the latter are usually feasible for small systems only. [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''Ab initio'' methods]] are based entirely on [[quantum mechanics]] and basic [[physical constant]]s. Other methods are called empirical or [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical]] because they use additional empirical parameters.

Both ''[[ab initio]]'' and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations.  These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, [[periodic boundary conditions]]), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all.  For example, most ''ab initio'' calculations make the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which greatly simplifies the underlying [[Schrödinger equation]] by assuming that the nuclei remain in place during the calculation.  In principle, [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' methods]] eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced.  In practice, however, it is impossible to eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains.  The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable.

In some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the long-time [[phase space]] behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the [[potential energy surface]] are used, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of [[molecular dynamics]]. Furthermore, [[cheminformatics]] uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like [[machine learning]] based on physicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.

== History ==
Building on the founding discoveries and theories in the [[history of quantum mechanics]], the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] in 1927. The books that were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Edgar Bright Wilson|E. Bright Wilson]]'s 1935 ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics – with Applications to Chemistry'', [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Eyring]], Walter and Kimball's 1944 ''Quantum Chemistry'', Heitler's 1945 ''Elementary Wave Mechanics – with Applications to Quantum Chemistry'', and later [[Charles Coulson|Coulson]]'s 1952 textbook ''Valence'', each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow.

With the development of efficient [[computer]] technology in the 1940s, the solutions of elaborate [[wave equation]]s for complex [[atom]]ic systems began to be a realizable objective.  In the early 1950s, the first semi-empirical atomic orbital calculations were performed. Theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers. One major advance came with the 1951 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics by Clemens C. J. Roothaan in 1951, largely on the "LCAO MO" approach (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals Molecular Orbitals), for many years the second-most cited paper in that journal. A very detailed account of such use in the United Kingdom is given by Smith and Sutcliffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Smith |first= S. J. |last2= Sutcliffe |first2= B.

For diatomic molecules, a systematic study using a minimum basis set and the first calculation with a larger basis set were published by Ransil and Nesbet respectively in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schaefer |first =Henry F.

In 1964, [[Hückel method]] calculations (using a simple [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) method to determine electron energies of molecular orbitals of π electrons in conjugated hydrocarbon systems) of molecules, ranging in complexity from [[butadiene]] and [[benzene]] to [[ovalene]], were generated on computers at Berkeley and Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Streitwieser |first= A. |last2=Brauman |first2= J.

In the early 1970s, efficient ''ab initio'' computer programs such as ATMOL, [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], IBMOL, and POLYAYTOM, began to be used to speed ''ab initio'' calculations of molecular orbitals. Of these four programs, only Gaussian, now vastly expanded, is still in use, but many other programs are now in use. At the same time, the methods of [[molecular mechanics]], such as MM2 [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], were developed, primarily by [[Norman Allinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Allinger |first= Norman |authorlink= Norman Allinger

 |doi= 10.1021/ja00467a001 |issue= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first mentions of the term ''computational chemistry'' can be found in the 1970 book ''Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences'' by Sidney Fernbach and Abraham Haskell Taub, where they state "It seems, therefore, that 'computational chemistry' can finally be more and more of a reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernbach |first= Sidney |last2=Taub |first2= Abraham Haskell |title= Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences |publisher= Routledge |year= 1970 |isbn= 0-677-14030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, widely different methods began to be seen as part of a new emerging discipline of ''computational chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/bookhome/114034476 |title=Reviews in Computational Chemistry |chapter=vol 1, preface|doi=10.1002/9780470125786}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Journal of Computational Chemistry]]'' was first published in 1980.

Computational chemistry has featured in several Nobel Prize awards, most notably in 1998 and 2013. [[Walter Kohn]], "for his development of the density-functional theory", and [[John Pople]], "for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry", received the 1998 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1998/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Karplus]], [[Michael Levitt]] and [[Arieh Warshel]] received the 2013 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry for "the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems".&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite press release

== Fields of application ==

The term ''theoretical chemistry'' may be defined as a mathematical description of chemistry, whereas ''computational chemistry'' is usually used when a mathematical method is sufficiently well developed that it can be automated for implementation on a computer. In theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians develop [[algorithm]]s and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for [[chemical reaction]]s. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.

Computational chemistry has two different aspects:
* Computational studies, used to find a starting point for a laboratory synthesis, or to assist in understanding experimental data, such as the position and source of spectroscopic peaks.
* Computational studies, used to predict the possibility of so far entirely unknown molecules or to explore reaction mechanisms not readily studied via experiments.

Thus, computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects.

Several major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry:
* The prediction of the molecular structure of molecules by the use of the simulation of forces, or more accurate quantum chemical methods, to find stationary points on the energy surface as the position of the nuclei is varied.
* Storing and searching for data on chemical entities (see [[chemical database]]s).
* Identifying [[correlation]]s between [[chemical structure]]s and properties (see ''quantitative structure–property relationship'' (QSPR) and ''[[quantitative structure–activity relationship]]'' (QSAR)).
* Computational approaches to help in the efficient synthesis of compounds.
* Computational approaches to design molecules that interact in specific ways with other molecules (e.g. [[drug design]] and [[catalysis]]).

== Accuracy ==
The words ''exact'' and ''perfect'' do not apply here, as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly. However, almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme.

Molecules consist of nuclei and electrons, so the methods of [[quantum mechanics]] apply. Computational chemists often attempt to solve the non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]], with relativistic corrections added, although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic [[Dirac equation]]. In principle, it is possible to solve the Schrödinger equation in either its time-dependent or time-independent form, as appropriate for the problem in hand; in practice, this is not possible except for very small systems. Therefore, a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

Accuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in [[ab initio]] models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of small molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with errors for energies less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen atoms is computationally tractable by more approximate methods such as [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

There is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions, such as those in biochemistry. Large molecules can be studied by semi-empirical approximate methods. Even larger molecules are treated by [[classical mechanics]] methods that use what are called [[molecular mechanics]] (MM).  In QM-MM methods, small parts of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the remainder is treated approximately (MM).

== Methods ==
One molecular formula can represent more than one molecular isomer: a set of isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the [[potential energy surface]]) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei. A stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the stationary point is a [[Transition state|transition structure]] and the coordinate is the [[reaction coordinate]]. This process of determining stationary points is called [[geometry optimization]].

The determination of molecular structure by [[geometry optimization]] became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix]], which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.

The total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, usually with no relativistic terms included, and by making use of the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions, thereby simplifying the Schrödinger equation. This leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei. A notable exception are certain approaches called [[direct quantum chemistry]], which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing. Density functional methods and semi-empirical methods are variants on the major theme. For very large systems, the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics. The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are:

=== ''Ab initio'' methods ===
{{Main article|Ab initio quantum chemistry methods}}

The programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different [[quantum chemistry|quantum-chemical]] methods that solve the molecular [[Schrödinger equation]] associated with the [[molecular Hamiltonian]]. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations&amp;nbsp;– being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data&amp;nbsp;– are called ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]''. This does not imply that the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods must be used, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best that is possible with a finite [[word length]] on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).

[[File:Electron correlation.png|thumb|right|300px|Diagram illustrating various ''ab initio'' electronic structure methods in terms of energy. Spacings are not to scale.]]

The simplest type of ''ab initio'' electronic structure calculation is the [[Hartree–Fock method]] (HF), an extension of [[molecular orbital theory]], in which the correlated electron-electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect is included in the calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree–Fock limit. Many types of calculations (termed [[post-Hartree–Fock]] methods) begin with a Hartree–Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron-electron repulsion, referred to also as [[electronic correlation]]. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. To obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-orbit coupling|spin orbit]] terms, both of which are far more important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, along with choice of method, it is necessary to choose a [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) molecular orbital method [[ansatz]]. Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.

The Hartree–Fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant. In some cases, particularly for bond breaking processes, this is inadequate, and several [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field|configurations]] must be used. Here, the coefficients of the configurations, and of the basis functions, are optimized together.

The total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the [[molecular geometry]]; in other words, the [[potential energy surface]]. Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics. The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different [[isomer]]s and the [[Transition state theory|transition structures]] for conversion between isomers, but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface.

A particularly important objective, called computational [[thermochemistry]], is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]] to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol or 4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called [[quantum chemistry composite methods]].

=== Density functional methods ===
{{Main article|Density functional theory}}

Density functional theory (DFT) methods are often considered to be ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]'' for determining the molecular electronic structure, even though many of the most common [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-[[electronic density|electron density]] rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree–Fock exchange term and are termed [[hybrid functional]] methods.

=== Semi-empirical methods ===
{{Main article|Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods}}

Semi-empirical [[quantum chemistry]] methods are based on the [[Hartree–Fock method]] formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data. They were very important in computational chemistry from the 60s to the 90s, especially for treating large molecules where the full Hartree–Fock method without the approximations were too costly. The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.

Primitive semi-empirical methods were designed even before, where the two-electron part of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is not explicitly included. For π-electron systems, this was the [[Hückel method]] proposed by [[Erich Hückel]], and for all valence electron systems, the [[extended Hückel method]] proposed by [[Roald Hoffmann]]. Sometimes, Hückel methods are referred to as "completely emprirical" because they do not derive from a Hamiltonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Counts|first=Richard W.|date=1987-07-01|title=Strategies I|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01676961|journal=Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=177–178|doi=10.1007/bf01676961|issn=0920-654X|bibcode=1987JCAMD...1..177C}}&lt;/ref&gt;Yet, the term "empirical methods", or "empirical force fields" is usually used to describe Molecular Mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470125793.ch4/summary|title=Reviews in Computational Chemistry|last=Dinur|first=Uri|last2=Hagler|first2=Arnold T.|date=1991|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470125793|editor-last=Lipkowitz|editor-first=Kenny B.|pages=99–164|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470125793.ch4|editor-last2=Boyd|editor-first2=Donald B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular mechanics ===
{{Main article|Molecular mechanics}}

In many cases, large molecular systems can be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely. [[Molecular mechanics]] simulations, for example, use one classical expression for the energy of a compound, for instance the [[harmonic oscillator]]. All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or ''ab initio'' calculations.

The database of compounds used for parameterization, i.e., the resulting set of parameters and functions is called the [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations. A force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules, for instance proteins, would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class.

These methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules, and allow studies of the approach and interaction (docking) of potential drug molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jmgm.2006.02.008|pmid=16574446|title=Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for β2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation|journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling|volume=25|issue=4|pages=396|year=2006|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Zauhar|first2=Randy J.|last3=Lanzara|first3=Richard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/GPCR_Activation.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0166-1280(98)90217-2|title=Activation of G protein-coupled receptors entails cysteine modulation of agonist binding|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM|volume=430|pages=57|year=1998|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Lanzara|first2=Richard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods for solids ===
{{Main article|Computational chemical methods in solid state physics}}

Computational chemical methods can be applied to [[solid state physics]] problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.

=== Chemical dynamics ===
Once the electronic and [[molecular geometry|nuclear]] variables are [[separation of variables|separated]] (within the Born–Oppenheimer representation), in the time-dependent approach, the [[wave packet]] corresponding to the nuclear [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] is propagated via the [[time evolution]] [[operator (physics)]] associated to the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] (for the full [[molecular Hamiltonian]]). In the [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]] energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the [[scattering theory]] formalism. The potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the [[potential energy surface]]s. In general, the [[potential energy surface]]s are coupled via the [[vibronic coupling]] terms.

The most popular methods for propagating the [[wave packet]] associated to the [[molecular geometry]] are:
* the [[split operator technique]],
* the [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev (real) polynomial]],
* the [[multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree]] method (MCTDH),
* the semiclassical method.

=== Molecular dynamics ===
{{Main article|Molecular dynamics}}

Molecular dynamics (MD) use either [[quantum mechanics]], [[molecular mechanics]] or a [[QM/MM|mixture of both]] to calculate forces which are then used to solve [[Newton's laws of motion]] to examine the time-dependent behaviour of systems. The result of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory that describes how the position and velocity of particles varies with time.

=== Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) ===
{{Main article|QM/MM}}
QM/MM is a hybrid method that attempts to combine the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the speed of molecular mechanics. It is useful for simulating very large molecules such as [[enzyme]]s.

== Interpreting molecular wave functions ==

The [[atoms in molecules]] (QTAIM) model of [[Richard Bader]] was developed to effectively link the quantum mechanical model of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful concepts such as atoms in molecules, functional groups, bonding, the theory of [[Lewis pair]]s, and the [[Valence bond theory|valence bond model]]. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful chemistry concepts can be related to the [[topology]] of the observable charge density distribution, whether measured or calculated from a quantum mechanical wavefunction. QTAIM analysis of molecular wavefunctions is implemented, for example, in the [[AIMAll]] software package.

== Software packages ==
Many self-sufficient [[:Category:Computational chemistry software|computational chemistry software packages]] exist. Some include many methods covering a wide range, while others concentrate on a very specific range or even on one method. Details of most of them can be found in:
* [[Biomolecular]] modelling programs: [[List of protein structure prediction software|proteins]], [[Comparison of nucleic acid simulation software|nucleic acid]].
* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Molecular mechanics]] programs.
* [[List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software|Quantum chemistry and solid state physics software]] supporting several methods.

'''Vahe Avetyan''' (August 2, 1979&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Vahe_avetyan_regname.jpg Vahe Avetyan in voter's registry]&lt;/ref&gt; – June 29, 2012) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[physician|doctor]], medical serviceman major of the [[Armed Forces of Armenia]], who died on June 29, 2012 in coma, from [[brain injury]]. His death received much publicity and media attention in the Armenian society. Avetyan went into coma after being beaten in the "Harsnakar" restaurant, which belongs to a member of [[Armenian parliament]], at that time, [[Ruben Hayrapetyan]].

Avetyan graduated from the [[Yerevan State Medical University]], he was an [[otolaryngologist]] since 2004. He served at the central military hospital of the [[Ministry of Defence (Armenia)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref name=a1plus/&gt;

==Fight and background==
In the evening of June 17, 2012 a group of doctors, Vahe Avetyan among them, visited the restaurant. Avetyan was in [[Tracksuit|sport clothes]]. The quarrel occurred on about 11:00 PM between Avetyan and a waiter because of Vahe's clothing. The fighting began after he hit the waiter,&lt;ref name=police1&gt;{{cite paper|publisher=RA Police weekly|date=2012-06-29|title="Harsnakar" case investigation continues|accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The medical servers Vahe Avetyan, Edgar Mikoyan, Arkadi Aghajanyan, Garik Soghomonyan, and Artak Baiadyan were beaten by the employees and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.am/eng/news/110510.html|title=Five suspects on restaurant beating case taken to Armenia’s investigation department}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vahe Avetyan and Artak Baiadyan were moved to the hospital afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.aravot.am/2012/06/19/157869/|title=Not 2, but 3 Doctors Were Beaten up at Harsnakar}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, at around 3:00 AM Avetyan underwent brain surgery, and after one more skull surgery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aravot.am/2012/06/20/300174/|publisher=Aravot|script-title=hy:«Հարսնաքարում» ծեծված ու ծանր վիճակում գտնվող Վահեի գլխուղեղում նոր հեմատոմա է առաջացել|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armtimes.com/hy/read/34560|publisher=The Armenian time|title=OK, don't beat, he's done}}{{hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stayed in coma until his death on June 29. The approximate time of death was mentioned to be 6:15 AM.&lt;ref name=a1plus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.a1plus.am/35105.html|title=Man beaten in Harsnakar brawl dies in hospital|publisher=[[A1plus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the attack and beating Avetyan with his friends got changed and then returned as it was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Stranger Was Pouring Earth on Vahe’s Grave Being on His Knees All the Time|date=July 31, 2012|accessdate=October 10, 2012|publisher=Aravot|url=http://www.aravot.am/en/2012/07/31/96339/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal case and public reaction==
Firstly the case was sent from the police to the investigation service of the Defence Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/ru/current_topics/2012/06/30/harsnaqar-case/?sw|title=No changes to the charges upon the presented fact of "Harsnaqar" emergency|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the case was transferred to the police investigation general bureau, and the police made an announcement on that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.am/news/view/«հարսնաքար»-ռեստորանային-համալիրի-տարածքում-տեղի-ունեցած-միջադեպի-կապակցությամբ.html|title=RA police announcement of "Harsnaqar" retaurant incident}}&lt;/ref&gt; A criminal prosecution was made by the 1st section of the 112th article of the Armenian Criminal Code:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hetq.am/arm/news/15656/qreakan-gorts-ruben-hayrapetyani-tiknazory-tsetsel-e-hospitali-bzhishknerin-pn-mayori-vitchaky-tsanr-e-lracvats.html|title=Criminal case: Ruben Hayrapetyan's bodyguards beat hospital doctors|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}{{hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Infliction of willful bodily damage which is dangerous for life or caused loss of eyesight, speech, hearing or any organ, loss of functions of the organ, or was manifested in irreversible ugliness on face, as well as caused other damage dangerous for life or caused disorder... is punished with imprisonment for the term of 3 to 7 years."&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.parliament.am/legislation.php?sel=show&amp;ID=1349&amp;lang=eng#7|title=Criminal Code of RA, special part, section 7:Crimes against man}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10602">A '''decapitation strike''' is a [[military strategy]] aimed at removing the leadership or [[command and control]] of a hostile government or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wittmann|first=Anna M.|title=Talking Conflict: The Loaded Language of Genocide, Political Violence, Terorism, and Warfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lm91DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Decapitation+strike&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g_IBBpJ9uJ&amp;sig=PhbUo_mnKPFNHcwVF2p0Q7zlSdk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN36eKhYvTAhVX-2MKHV_uCUg4HhDoAQgoMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Decapitation%20strike&amp;f=false|page=92|date=2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-1-4408-3424-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy of shattering or defeating an enemy by eliminating its military and political leadership has long been utilized in warfare.

== In nuclear warfare ==
In [[nuclear warfare]] theory, a decapitation strike is a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|pre-emptive first strike]] attack that aims to destabilize an opponent's military and civil leadership structure&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9LhgC4g-QEC "Words of Intelligence: An Intelligence Professional's Lexicon for Domestic and Foreign Threats"], Jan Goldman. Scarecrow Press, Jun 16, 2011. {{ISBN|0-8108-7814-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-7814-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that it will severely degrade or destroy its capacity for [[second strike|nuclear retaliation]]. It is essentially a subset of a [[counterforce strike]] but whereas a counterforce strike seeks to destroy weapons directly, a decapitation strike is designed to remove an enemy's ability to use its weapons.

Strategies against decapitation strikes include the following:
* Distributed command and control structures.
* Dispersal of political leadership and military leadership in times of tension.
* Delegation of [[ICBM]]/[[SLBM]] launch capability to local commanders in the event of a decapitation strike.&lt;ref&gt;Documents on Predelegation of Authority for Nuclear Weapons Use | http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/predelegation/predel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distributed and diverse launch mechanisms.

A failed decapitation strike carries the risk of immediate, [[massive retaliation]] by the targeted opponent. Many countries with nuclear weapons specifically plan to prevent decapitation strikes by employing [[second-strike]] capabilities. Such countries may have mobile land-based launch, sea launch, air launch, and underground ballistic missile launch facilities so that a nuclear launch on one area of the country will not totally negate its ability to retaliate.

Other nuclear warfare doctrines explicitly exclude decapitation strikes on the basis that it is better to preserve the adversary's command and control structures so that a single authority remains that is capable of negotiating a [[surrender (military)|surrender]] or [[ceasefire]]. Implementing [[fail-deadly]] mechanisms can be a way to deter decapitation strikes and respond to successful decapitation strikes.

== In conventional warfare ==
Decapitation Strike strategy has been employed in [[conventional warfare]].
*The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] began with a decapitation strike against [[Saddam Hussein]] and other Iraqi military and political leaders.&lt;ref name = "FoxDecapitation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/03/20/us-launches-decapitation-strike-against-iraq-saddam-personally-targeted/ |title=U.S. Launches 'Decapitation' Strike Against Iraq; Saddam Personally Targeted| date=20 March 2003 |publisher=[[Fox News|Fox News Channel]] | accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNNDecapitation"&gt; {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/20/sprj.irq.int.main/ |title=Cruise missiles target Saddam| date=20 March 2003 |publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[air strike]]s failed to kill their intended targets.&lt;ref name = "NYTFail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20040613/news_1n13strikes.html |title=Airstrikes on Iraqi leaders 'abject failure'| date=13 June 2004 |publisher=New York Times News Service | accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The U.S. and its  [[NATO|NATO allies]] have, and continue to pursue this strategy in its efforts to dismantle militant [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] networks, such as [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]], that threaten Western Europe, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shinkman|first1=Paul D.|title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/23/obama-global-war-on-terror-is-over|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the term has been used to describe the [[assassination]] of a government's entire leadership group or a nation's [[Regicide|royal family]].
*April 14, 1865: The [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] of U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]] was part of a larger plot to disrupt the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] by also killing then-Vice President [[Andrew Johnson]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H.

*In 2017 in response to the [[North Korean nuclear program]], the United States threatened to conduct a decapitating strike on [[North Korea]] in order to eliminate its current government and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/us-navy-seals-f-35s-decapitation-strike-north-korea-2017-3?IR=T&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nknews.org/2017/08/n-korean-army-carefully-examining-operation-plan-for-attack-on-guam-kpa/&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
*In the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, [[Hydra_(Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] has the slogan "Cut off one head and two more shall take its place" thereby describing itself as an organization resistant to a decapitating strike, while pursuing the same strategy against its [[SHIELD|enemies]].
* The character of [[Madame Defarge]] in ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' personifies both the [[Reign of Terror]] and the concept of a decapitating strike through her knitting.
* In the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', Senator Buford complains that the U.S. nuclear deterrent lacks credibility. If the President were killed in a decapitation strike, retaliation would be impossible. Wing Attack Plan R is devised to close this loophole.
* In the essay [[The Cuban Missile Crisis: Second Holocaust]], an [[alternate history]] in which the 1962 crisis developed into war, the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] manage to destroy [[Washington, D.C.]], and kill President [[John F. Kennedy]], Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and most of their political and military advisors.
* In the 1994 [[Tom Clancy]] novel ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', a [[Japan Airlines]] pilot flies a fully fueled, passenger-less [[Boeing 747]] into the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] during a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]]. This is not an attack by a government, but it has the effect of removing the top tier of each branch of the [[United States government]]—most of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The only survivors are two men each claiming the [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidency]], and thus the presidency by succession. 
* In the 1983 film ''[[WarGames]]'', the master computer [[WOPR]] is programmed to interpret a sudden power loss as the result of a decapitation strike and automatically launch all weapons in retaliation.
* In the made-for-cable film ''[[By Dawn's Early Light]]'', the [[Soviet Union]] launches nuclear strikes against key U.S. targets including a failed decapitation strike at [[Andrews Air Force Base]] which would presumably have been the departure point for the President and his advisors. The story continues with the suggestion of a retaliatory decapitation strike strategy, referred to as "The Grand Tour".
* In the 2002 film ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]'', [[neo-Nazi]] terrorists attempt to start a war between the United States and the [[Russian Federation]] by (among other things) detonating a nuclear device during a football game in [[Baltimore]] at which the American President is in attendance.
* In the 2013 [[science fiction]] film ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', a majority of Starfleet Command's senior officers and Admiralty are killed in a surprise attack in San Francisco by Khan Noonien Singh after being tricked into attending an emergency meeting following a bombing in London.
* In the 2013 film ''[[White House Down]]'' terrorists capture the [[White House]] intending to kill the [[President of the United States]]. They subsequently strike a plane which also houses the [[Vice President of the United States]]
* The 2016 TV series ''[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]'' stars [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Tom Kirkman, the [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]], who becomes President after a terrorist attack kills the President, the Vice President, and all other members of the Cabinet.

[[File:SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.20|The formation of complex symmetrical and [[fractal]] [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in [[snowflake]]s exemplifies emergence in a physical system]]
[[File:Termite Cathedral DSC03570.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.10|A [[termite]] "cathedral" mound produced by a [[termites|termite colony]] offers a classic example of emergence in [[nature]] ]]

In [[philosophy]], [[systems theory]], [[science]], and [[art]], '''emergence''' is the condition of an entity having properties its parts do not have, due to interactions among the parts.

Emergence plays a central role in theories of [[integrative level]]s and of [[complex system]]s.  For instance, the phenomenon of ''[[life]]'' as studied in [[biology]] is an emergent property of [[chemistry]], and [[psychology|psychological]] phenomena emerge from the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] phenomena of living things.

In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called [[emergentism]]. Almost all accounts of emergentism include a form of [[epistemic]] or [[ontological]] irreducibility to the lower levels.&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt;

==In philosophy==
{{Main|Emergentism}}

In philosophy, emergence is often understood to be a claim about the [[etiology]] of a system's properties.  An emergent property of a system, in this context, is one that is not a property of any component of that system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole. [[Nicolai Hartmann]], one of the first modern philosophers to write on emergence, termed this ''categorial novum'' (new category).

===Definitions===
This idea of emergence has been around since at least the time of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book Η 1045a 8–10: "... the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts ...", i.e., the whole is other than the sum of the parts.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[John Stuart Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;"The chemical combination of two substances produces, as is well known, a third substance with properties different from those of either of the two substances separately, or of both of them taken together" {{Harv|Mill|1843}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Huxley]]&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley: "now and again there is a sudden rapid passage to a totally new and more comprehensive type of order or organization, with quite new emergent properties, and involving quite new methods of further evolution" {{Harv|Huxley|Huxley|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two of many scientists and philosophers who have written on the concept.

The term "emergent" was coined by philosopher [[George Henry Lewes|G. H. Lewes]], who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces; their sum, when their directions are the same – their difference, when their directions are contrary.  Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because these are [[homogeneous]] and [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|commensurable]]. It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds. The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lewes|1875|p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blitz|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist Jeffrey Goldstein provided a current definition of emergence in the journal ''Emergence''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jeffrey|title=Emergence as a Construct: History and Issues|journal=Emergence|date=March 1999|volume=1|issue=1|pages=49–72|doi=10.1207/s15327000em0101_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein initially defined emergence as: "the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns and properties during the process of [[self-organization]] in complex systems".

Systems scientist Peter Corning described the qualities of Goldstein's definition in more detail:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The common characteristics are: (1) radical novelty (features not previously observed in systems); (2) coherence or correlation (meaning integrated wholes that maintain themselves over some period of time); (3) A global or macro "level" (i.e. there is some property of "wholeness"); (4) it is the product of a dynamical process (it evolves); and (5) it is "ostensive" (it can be perceived).&lt;ref name="Corning"&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1002/cplx.10043 | last = Corning | first = Peter A. | authorlink = Peter Corning | title = The Re-Emergence of "Emergence": A Venerable Concept in Search of a Theory | year = 2002 | journal = Complexity | volume = 7 | pages = 18–30 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.10043/epdf | issue = 6 | bibcode = 2002Cmplx...7f..18C | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180202055002/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.10043/epdf | archivedate = 2018-02-02 | df =  | citeseerx = 10.1.1.114.1724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter Corning suggests a narrower definition, requiring that the components be unlike in kind (following Lewes), and that they involve [[division of labor]] between these components. He also says that living systems (like the game of [[chess]]), while emergent, cannot be reduced to underlying laws of emergence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span id="CorningDefn" class="citation"&gt;Rules, or laws, have no causal efficacy; they do not in fact “generate” anything. They serve merely to describe regularities and consistent relationships in nature. These patterns may be very illuminating and important, but the underlying causal agencies must be separately specified (though often they are not). But that aside, the game of chess illustrates ... why any laws or rules of emergence and evolution are insufficient. Even in a chess game, you cannot use the rules to predict “history” – i.e., the course of any given game. Indeed, you cannot even reliably predict the next move in a chess game. Why? Because the “system” involves more than the rules of the game. It also includes the players and their unfolding, moment-by-moment decisions among a very large number of available options at each choice point. The game of chess is inescapably historical, even though it is also constrained and shaped by a set of rules, not to mention the laws of physics. Moreover, and this is a key point, the game of chess is also shaped by [[teleonomic]], [[cybernetic]], feedback-driven influences. It is not simply a self-ordered process; it involves an organized, “purposeful” activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name = Corning/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Strong and weak emergence===

Usage of the notion "emergence" may generally be subdivided into two perspectives, that of "weak emergence" and "strong emergence".  In terms of physical systems, weak emergence is a type of emergence in which the emergent property is amenable to computer simulation. This is opposed to the older notion of strong emergence, in which the emergent property cannot be simulated by a computer.

Some common points between the two notions are that emergence concerns new properties produced as the system grows, which is to say ones which are not shared with its components or prior states. Also, it is assumed that the properties are [[supervenient]] rather than metaphysically primitive {{Harv|Bedau|1997}}.

Weak emergence describes new properties arising in systems as a result of the interactions at an elemental level. However, it is stipulated that the properties can be determined only by observing or simulating the system, and not by any process of analysis.

Bedau notes that weak emergence is not a universal metaphysical solvent, as the hypothesis that consciousness is weakly emergent would not resolve the traditional philosophical questions about the physicality of consciousness. However, Bedau concludes that adopting this view would provide a precise notion that emergence is involved in consciousness, and second, the notion of weak emergence is metaphysically benign.{{Harv|Bedau|1997}}

Strong emergence describes the direct causal action of a high-level system upon its components; qualities produced this way are [[irreducible (philosophy)|irreducible]] to the system's constituent parts  {{Harv|Laughlin|2005}}. The whole is other than the sum of its parts. An example from physics of such emergence is water, being seemingly unpredictable even after an exhaustive study of the properties of its constituent atoms of hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luisi|first=Pier L.|title=The Emergence of Life: From Chemical Origins to Synthetic Biology|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0521821177|page=119|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/chemistry/organic-chemistry/emergence-life-chemical-origins-synthetic-biology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023700/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/chemistry/organic-chemistry/emergence-life-chemical-origins-synthetic-biology|archivedate=2015-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then that no simulation of the system can exist, for such a simulation would itself constitute a reduction of the system to its constituent parts.{{Harv|Bedau|1997}}

====Rejecting the distinction====

However, "the debate about whether or not the whole can be predicted from the properties of the parts misses the point. Wholes produce unique combined effects, but many of these effects may be co-determined by the context and the interactions between the whole and its environment(s)" {{Harv|Corning|2002}}. In accordance with his Synergism Hypothesis, {{Harv|Corning 1983|2005}} Corning also stated, "It is the [[synergistic]] effects produced by wholes that are the very cause of the evolution of complexity in nature." Novelist Arthur Koestler used the metaphor of [[Janus]] (a symbol of the unity underlying complements like open/shut, peace/war) to illustrate how the two perspectives (strong vs. weak or [[holistic]] vs. [[reductionistic]]) should be treated as non-exclusive, and should work together to address the issues of emergence.{{Harv|Koestler|1969}} Further,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from the sum of its parts.{{Harv|Anderson|1972}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Viability of strong emergence====

The plausibility of strong emergence is questioned by some as contravening our usual understanding of physics. Mark A. Bedau observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although strong emergence is logically possible, it is uncomfortably like magic. How does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise, since by definition it cannot be due to the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities? Such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken. This not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism. Their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately getting something from nothing.&lt;ref name = Bedau&gt;(Bedau 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strong emergence can be criticized for being causally [[Overdetermination|overdetermined]]. The canonical example concerns emergent mental states (M and M∗) that supervene on physical states (P and P∗) respectively. Let M and M∗ be emergent properties. Let M∗ supervene on base property P∗. What happens when M causes M∗? [[Jaegwon Kim]] says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In our schematic example above, we concluded that M causes M∗ by causing P∗. So M causes P∗. Now, M, as an emergent, must itself have an emergence base property, say P. Now we face a critical question: if an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M as a cause of any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of M occurred? If causation is understood as nomological (law-based) sufficiency, P, as M’s emergence base, is nomologically sufficient for it, and M, as P∗’s cause, is nomologically sufficient for P∗. It follows that P is nomologically sufficient for P∗ and hence qualifies as its cause…If M is somehow retained as a cause, we are faced with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves overdetermination (since P remains a cause of P∗ as well). Moreover, this goes against the spirit of emergentism in any case: emergents are supposed to make distinctive and novel causal contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Jaegwon | year = 2016 | title = Emergence: Core ideas and issues | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 547–59 | doi = 10.1007/s11229-006-9025-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If M is the cause of M∗, then M∗ is overdetermined because M∗ can also be thought of as being determined by P. One escape route that a strong emergentist could take would be to deny [[downward causation]]. However, this would remove the proposed reason that emergent mental states must supervene on physical states, which in turn would call [[physicalism]] into question, and thus be unpalatable for some philosophers and physicists.

Meanwhile, others have worked towards developing analytical evidence of strong emergence. In 2009, Gu et al. presented a class of physical systems that exhibits non-computable macroscopic properties.&lt;ref name="morereally"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = Mile | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = More really is different | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278909000852 | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 238 | issue = 9| pages = 835–39 | doi=10.1016/j.physd.2008.12.016| arxiv = 0809.0151 | bibcode = 2009PhyD..238..835G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="binder"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Binder | first1 = P-M | year = 2009 | title = Computation: The edge of reductionism | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245| pages = 332–34 | doi=10.1038/459332a| bibcode = 2009Natur.459..332B}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, if one could compute certain macroscopic properties of these systems from the microscopic description of these systems, then one would be able to solve computational problems known to be undecidable in computer science. They concluded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although macroscopic concepts are essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics has been devoted to the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.&lt;ref name="morereally" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Emergence and interaction===

Emergent structures are patterns that emerge via collective actions of many individual entities. To explain such patterns, one might conclude, per [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Meta" /&gt; that emergent structures are other than the sum of their parts on the assumption that the emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply interact independently of one another. However, there are those who [[A New Kind of Science#Simple programs|disagree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm|title=A Designer Universe?|author=Steven Weinberg|accessdate=2008-07-14|quote=A version of the original quote from address at the Conference on Cosmic Design, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D.C. in April 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519145647/http://www.physlink.com/education/essay_weinberg.cfm|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form. In fact, some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts, and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way. In particular [[Renormalization group|renormalization]] are methods in theoretical physics which enables scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=From bottom-up approaches to levels of organization and extended critical transitions|url=https://www.academia.edu/6188830/From_Bottom-Up_Approaches_to_Levels_of_Organization|journal=Fractal Physiology|volume=3|page=232|doi=10.3389/fphys.2012.00232|pmc=3429021|pmid=22934001|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202055001/http://www.academia.edu/6188830/From_Bottom-Up_Approaches_to_Levels_of_Organization|archivedate=2018-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective or subjective quality===
The properties of complexity and organization of any system are considered by Crutchfield to be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] determined by the observer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analysed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in non-linear processes. An observer’s notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtly, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data.{{Harv|Crutchfield|1994}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, [[Peter Corning]] argues "Must the synergies be perceived/observed in order to qualify as emergent effects, as some theorists claim?  Most emphatically not.  The synergies associated with emergence are real and measurable, even if nobody is there to observe them."{{Harv|Corning|2002}}

==In religion, art and humanities==

In religion, emergence grounds expressions of [[religious naturalism]] and [[syntheism]] in which a sense of the [[sacred]] is perceived in the workings of entirely naturalistic processes by which more [[Complexity|complex]] forms arise or evolve from simpler forms. Examples are detailed in ''The Sacred Emergence of Nature'' by [[Ursula Goodenough]] &amp; [[Terrence Deacon]] and [http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kauffman06/kauffman06_index.html ''Beyond Reductionism: Reinventing the Sacred''] by [[Stuart Kauffman]], both from 2006, and in ''Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age'' by [[Alexander Bard]] &amp; [[Jan Söderqvist]] from 2014. An early argument (1904–05) for the emergence of social formations, in part stemming from religion, can be found in [[Max Weber]]'s most famous work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2010). 'Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism'. Sociological Theory, vol 28, no. 1, pp. 108–26.{{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818023547/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, emergence is used to explore the origins of novelty, creativity, and authorship. Some art/literary theorists (Wheeler, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Wendy|title=The Whole Creature: Complexity, Biosemiotics and the Evolution of Culture|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence &amp; Wishart|location=London|isbn=1-905007-30-2|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Victoria N.|title=The Biologist's Mistress: Rethinking Self-Organization in Art, Literature, and Nature|year=2011|publisher=Emergent Publications|location=Litchfield Park, AZ|isbn=0-9842165-5-3|url=http://emergentpublications.com/catalog_detail.aspx?Value=82|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208050459/http://emergentpublications.com/catalog_detail.aspx?Value=82|archivedate=2014-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have proposed alternatives to postmodern understandings of "authorship" using the complexity sciences and emergence theory. They contend that artistic selfhood and meaning are emergent, relatively objective phenomena. [[Michael Pearce (artist)|Michael J. Pearce]] has used emergence to describe the experience of works of art in relation to contemporary neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Michael J.|title=Art in the Age of Emergence|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Manchester, England|isbn=1443870579|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/art-in-the-age-of-emergence|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522021953/http://www.cambridgescholars.com/art-in-the-age-of-emergence|archivedate=2015-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practicing artist [[Leonel Moura]], in turn, attrbutes to his "artbots" a real, if nonetheless rudimentary, creativity based on emergent principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/3/28|author=Leonel Moura|date=16 July 2018|title=Robot Art: An Interview with Leonel Moura|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7030028|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In international development, concepts of emergence have been used within a theory of social change termed [[SEED-SCALE]] to show how standard principles interact to bring forward socio-economic development fitted to cultural values, community economics, and natural environment (local solutions emerging from the larger socio-econo-biosphere). These principles can be implemented utilizing a sequence of standardized tasks that [[self-assemble]] in individually specific ways utilizing recursive evaluative criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ''Empowerment on an Unstable Planet: From Seeds of Human Energy to a Scale of Global Change'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In postcolonial studies, the term "Emerging Literature" refers to a contemporary body of texts that is gaining momentum in the global literary landscape (v. esp.: J.M. Grassin, ed. ''Emerging Literatures'', Bern, Berlin, etc. : Peter Lang, 1996). By opposition, "emergent literature" is rather a concept used in the theory of literature.

==Emergent properties and processes==
An emergent behavior or emergent property can appear when a number of simple [[entity|entities]] (agents) operate in an environment, forming more complex behaviors as a collective. If emergence happens over disparate size scales, then the reason is usually a causal relation across different scales. In other words, there is often a form of top-down feedback in systems with emergent properties.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Citation | last = Korotayev | first = A. | authorlink1 = Andrey Korotayev | last2 = Malkov | given2 = A. | last3 = Khaltourina | first3 = D. | title = Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth | place = Moscow | publisher = URSS | year = 2006 | isbn = 5-484-00414-4 | url = http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150814105834/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 | archivedate = 2015-08-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes causing emergent properties may occur in either the observed or observing system, and are commonly identifiable by their patterns of accumulating change, generally called 'growth'. Emergent behaviours can occur because of intricate causal relations across different scales and feedback, known as [[interconnectivity]]. The emergent property itself may be either very predictable or unpredictable and unprecedented, and represent a new level of the system's evolution. The complex behaviour or properties are not a property of any single such entity, nor can they easily be predicted or deduced from behaviour in the lower-level entities, and might in fact be irreducible to such behavior.  The shape and behaviour of a flock of birds [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11679-flying-in-vformation-gives-best-view-for-least-effort.html] or school of fish are good examples of emergent properties.

One reason emergent behaviour is hard to predict is that the number of [[interaction]]s between a system components increases exponentially with the number of components, thus allowing for many new and subtle types of behaviour to emerge. Emergence is often a product of particular patterns of interaction. [[Negative feedback]] introduces constraints that serve to fix structures or behaviours. In contrast, [[positive feedback]] promotes change, allowing local variations to grow into global patterns. Another way in which interactions leads to emergent properties is [[dual-phase evolution]]. This occurs where interactions are applied intermittently, leading to two phases: one in which patterns form or grow, the other in which they are refined or removed.

On the other hand, merely having a large number of interactions is not enough by itself to guarantee emergent behaviour; many of the interactions may be negligible or irrelevant, or may cancel each other out.  In some cases, a large number of interactions can in fact hinder the emergence of interesting behaviour, by creating a lot of "noise" to drown out any emerging "signal"; the emergent behaviour may need to be temporarily isolated from other interactions before it reaches enough critical mass to self-support. Thus it is not just the sheer number of connections between components which encourages emergence; it is also how these connections are organised.  A hierarchical organisation is one example that can generate emergent behaviour (a bureaucracy may behave in a way quite different from that of the individual humans in that bureaucracy); but emergent behaviour can also arise from more decentralized organisational structures, such as a marketplace.  In some cases, the system has to reach a combined threshold of diversity, organisation, and connectivity before emergent behaviour appears.

[[Unintended consequence]]s and side effects are closely related to emergent properties. [[Luc Steels]] writes: "A component has a particular functionality but this is not recognizable as a subfunction of the global functionality. Instead a component implements a behaviour whose side effect contributes to the global functionality [...] Each behaviour has a side effect and the sum of the side effects gives the desired functionality".{{Harv|Steels|1990}} In other words, the global or macroscopic functionality of a system with "emergent functionality" is the sum of all "side effects", of all emergent properties and functionalities.

Systems with emergent properties or emergent structures may appear to defy [[entropy|entropic]] principles and the second law of [[thermodynamics]], because they form and increase order despite the lack of command and central control. This is possible because open systems can extract information and order out of the environment.

Emergence helps to explain why the [[fallacy of division]] is a fallacy.

==Emergent structures in nature==
{{main|Patterns in nature}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Ripple patterns in a [[sand dune]] created by wind or water is an example of an emergent structure in nature.]]
[[File:Causeway-code poet-4.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland is an example of a complex emergent structure.]]

Emergent structures can be found in many natural phenomena, from the physical to the biological domain. For example, the shape of weather phenomena such as [[hurricane]]s are emergent structures.  The development and growth of complex, orderly [[crystal]]s, as driven by the [[random motion]] of water molecules within a conducive natural environment, is another example of an emergent process, where [[randomness]] can give rise to complex and deeply attractive, orderly structures.
[[File:Water Crystals on Mercury 20Feb2010 CU1.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Water crystals forming on glass demonstrate an emergent, [[fractal]] process occurring under appropriate conditions of temperature and humidity.]]  However, crystalline structure and hurricanes are said to have a self-organizing phase.

It is useful to distinguish three forms of emergent structures. A ''first-order'' emergent structure occurs as a result of shape interactions (for example, [[hydrogen bond]]s in water molecules lead to [[surface tension]]). A ''second-order'' emergent structure involves shape interactions played out sequentially over time (for example, changing atmospheric conditions as a snowflake falls to the ground build upon and alter its form). Finally, a ''third-order'' emergent structure is a consequence of shape, time, and heritable instructions. For example, an organism's [[genetic code]] affects the form of the organism's systems in space and time.

===Nonliving, physical systems===
In [[physics]], emergence is used to describe a property, law, or phenomenon which occurs at macroscopic scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales, despite the fact that a macroscopic system can be viewed as a very large ensemble of microscopic systems.

An emergent property need not be more complicated than the underlying non-emergent properties which generate it.  For instance, the laws of [[thermodynamics]] are remarkably simple, even if the laws which govern the interactions between component particles are complex.  The term emergence in physics is thus used not to signify complexity, but rather to distinguish which laws and concepts apply to macroscopic scales, and which ones apply to microscopic scales. 

However, another, perhaps more broadly applicable way to conceive of the emergent divide does involve a dose of complexity insofar as the computational feasibility of going from the microscopic to the macroscopic property tells the 'strength' of the emergence. This is better understood given the following definition of emergence that comes from physics:

"An emergent behavior of a physical system is a qualitative property that can only occur in the limit that the number of microscopic constituents tends to infinity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kivelson |first1=Sophia |last2=Kivelson |first2=Steve |title=Defining Emergence in Physics |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/npjquantmats201624 |website=njp: Quantum Materials |publisher=Nature Research |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are no actually infinite systems in the real world, there is no obvious naturally occurring notion of a hard separation between the properties of the constituents of a system and those of the emergent whole. As discussed below, classical mechanics is thought to be emergent from quantum mechanics, though in principal, quantum dynamics fully describes everything happening at a classical level. However, it would take a computer larger then the size of the universe with more computing time then life time of the universe to describe the motion of a falling apple in terms of the locations of its electrons {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}; thus we can take this to be a "strong" emergent divide. 

Some examples include:
* [[Classical mechanics]]:  The laws of classical mechanics can be said to emerge as a limiting case from the rules of [[quantum mechanics]] applied to large enough masses. This is particularly strange since quantum mechanics is generally thought of as ''more'' complicated than classical mechanics.
* [[Friction]]:  Forces between elementary particles are conservative.  However, friction emerges when considering more complex structures of matter, whose surfaces can convert mechanical energy into heat energy when rubbed against each other.  Similar considerations apply to other emergent concepts in [[continuum mechanics]] such as [[viscosity]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[tensile strength]], etc.
* [[Patterned ground]]: the distinct, and often symmetrical geometric shapes formed by ground material in periglacial regions.
* [[Statistical mechanics]] was initially derived using the concept of a large enough [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] that fluctuations about the most likely distribution can be all but ignored.  However, small clusters do not exhibit sharp first order [[phase transition]]s such as melting, and at the boundary it is not possible to completely categorize the cluster as a liquid or solid, since these concepts are (without extra definitions) only applicable to macroscopic systems.  Describing a system using statistical mechanics methods is much simpler than using a low-level atomistic approach.
* [[Electrical networks]]: The bulk conductive response of binary (RC) electrical networks with random arrangements, known as the [[Universal dielectric response | Universal Dielectric Response (UDR)]], can be seen as emergent properties of such physical systems. Such arrangements can be used as simple physical prototypes for deriving mathematical formulae for the emergent responses of complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437112009363 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2012.10.035 | volume=392 | title=The origin of power-law emergent scaling in large binary networks | year=2013 | journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | pages=1004–1027 | last1 = Almond | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Budd | first2 = C.J. | last3 = Freitag | first3 = M.A. | last4 = Hunt | first4 = G.W. | last5 = McCullen | first5 = N.J. | last6 = Smith | first6 = N.D.| arxiv=1204.5601 | bibcode=2013PhyA..392.1004A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Weather]]

[[Temperature]] is sometimes used as an example of an emergent macroscopic behaviour.  In classical dynamics, a ''snapshot'' of the instantaneous momenta of a large number of particles at equilibrium is sufficient to find the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom which is proportional to the temperature.  For a small number of particles the instantaneous momenta at a given time are not statistically sufficient to determine the temperature of the system.  However, using the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the temperature can still be obtained to arbitrary precision by further averaging the momenta over a long enough time.

[[Convection]] in a liquid or gas is another example of emergent macroscopic behaviour that makes sense only when considering differentials of temperature. [[Convection cells]], particularly [[Bénard cells]], are an example of a [[self-organizing]] system (more specifically, a [[dissipative system]]) whose structure is determined both by the constraints of the system and by random perturbations: the possible realizations of the shape and size of the cells depends on the temperature gradient as well as the nature of the fluid and shape of the container, but which configurations are actually realized is due to random perturbations (thus these systems exhibit a form of [[symmetry breaking]]).

In some theories of particle physics, even such basic structures as [[mass]], [[space]], and [[time]] are viewed as emergent phenomena, arising from more fundamental concepts such as the [[Higgs boson]] or [[string theory|strings]].  In some interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]], the perception of a [[deterministic]] reality, in which all objects have a definite position, momentum, and so forth, is actually an emergent phenomenon, with the true state of matter being described instead by a [[wavefunction]] which need not have a single position or momentum.
Most of the laws of [[physics]] themselves as we experience them today appear to have emerged during the course of time making emergence the most fundamental principle in the universe{{According to whom|date=September 2016}} and raising the question of what might be the most fundamental law of physics from which all others emerged. [[Chemistry]] can in turn be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of physics. [[Biology]] (including biological [[evolution]]) can be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of chemistry.  Similarly, [[psychology]] could be understood as an emergent property of neurobiological laws. Finally, free-market theories understand [[economy]] as an emergent feature of psychology.

According to Laughlin (2005), for many particle systems, nothing can be calculated exactly from the microscopic equations, and macroscopic systems are characterised by broken symmetry: the symmetry present in the microscopic equations is not present in the macroscopic system, due to phase transitions. As a result, these macroscopic systems are described in their own terminology, and have properties that do not depend on many microscopic details. This does not mean that the microscopic interactions are irrelevant, but simply that you do not see them anymore&amp;nbsp;— you only see a renormalized effect of them. Laughlin is a pragmatic theoretical physicist: if you cannot, possibly ever, calculate the broken symmetry macroscopic properties from the microscopic equations, then what is the point of talking about reducibility?

[[Life]] is a major source of complexity, and [[evolution]] is the major process behind the varying forms of life. In this view, evolution is the process describing the growth of complexity in the natural world and in speaking of the emergence of complex living beings and life-forms, this view refers therefore to processes of sudden changes in evolution.

[[Life]] is thought to have emerged in the early [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]] when [[RNA]] chains began to express the basic conditions necessary for natural selection to operate as conceived by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. [[Fitness (biology)|Fitness]] of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (in the sense that they were determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = H | last2 = Byerly | first2 = HC | last3 = Hopf | first3 = FA | last4 = Michod | first4 = RA | last5 = Vemulapalli | first5 = GK | year = 1983 | title = The Darwinian Dynamic | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2828805?uid=3739568&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102790068637 | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 185–207 | doi=10.1086/413216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michod"&gt;Michod RE. (2000) Darwinian Dynamics: Evolutionary Transitions in Fitness and Individuality.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey {{ISBN|0691050112}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt;  The three primary adaptive capacities may have been (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type); (2) the capacity to avoid decay; and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources.&lt;ref name=Bernstein /&gt;&lt;ref name =Michod /&gt;  These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations of the RNA replicators (see “[[Ribozyme]]”) that, in turn, would be encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences. Competitive success among different replicators would have depended on the relative values of these adaptive capacities.

Regarding [[causality]] in evolution [[Peter Corning]] observes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Synergistic effects of various kinds have played a major causal role in the evolutionary process generally and in the evolution of cooperation and complexity in particular... Natural selection is often portrayed as a “mechanism”, or is personified as a causal agency... In reality, the differential “selection” of a trait, or an adaptation, is a consequence of the functional effects it produces in relation to the survival and reproductive success of a given organism in a given environment. It is these functional effects that are ultimately responsible for the trans-generational continuities and changes in nature.{{nowrap|{{Harv|Corning|2002}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Per his [[#CorningDefn|definition of emergence]], Corning also addresses emergence and evolution:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[In] evolutionary processes, causation is iterative; effects are also causes. And this is equally true of the synergistic effects produced by emergent systems. In other words, emergence itself... has been the underlying cause of the evolution of emergent phenomena in biological evolution; it is the synergies produced by organized systems that are the key.{{nowrap|{{Harv|Corning|2002}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Swarming]] is a well-known behaviour in many animal species from [[marching locusts]] to [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling fish]] to [[Flocking (behaviour)|flocking birds]]. Emergent structures are a common strategy found in many animal groups: colonies of ants, mounds built by termites, swarms of bees, shoals/schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds/packs of mammals.

An example to consider in detail is an [[ant colony]]. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have even demonstrated the ability to solve geometric problems.  For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Johnson. 2001. [[Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that environmental factors may play a role in influencing emergence. Research suggests induced emergence of the bee species [[Macrotera portalis]]. In this species, the bees emerge in a pattern consistent with rainfall. Specifically, the pattern of emergence is consistent with southwestern deserts' late summer rains and lack of activity in the spring.&lt;ref name="Danforth2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danforth|first1=Bryan|title=Female Foraging and Intranest Behavior of a Communal Bee, Perdita portalis (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae)|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|date=1991|volume=84|issue=5|pages=537–48|doi= 10.1093/aesa/84.5.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organization of life====
A broader example of emergent properties in biology is viewed in the [[biological organisation]] of life, ranging from the [[subatomic]] level to the entire [[biosphere]]. For example, individual [[atom]]s can be combined to form [[molecule]]s such as [[polypeptide]] chains, which in turn [[Protein folding|fold]] and refold to form [[protein]]s, which in turn create even more complex structures. These proteins, assuming their functional status from their spatial conformation, interact together and with other molecules to achieve higher biological functions and eventually create an [[organism]]. Another example is how cascade [[phenotype]] reactions, as detailed in [[chaos theory]], arise from individual genes mutating respective positioning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Campbell]], Neil A., and Jane B. Reece. ''Biology''. 6th ed. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; At the highest level, all the [[biocoenosis|biological communities]] in the world form the biosphere, where its human participants form societies, and the complex interactions of meta-social systems such as the stock market.

====Emergence of mind====
Among the considered phenomena in the evolutionary account of life, as a continuous history, marked by stages at which fundamentally new forms have appeared - the origin of sapiens intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence // Encyclopædia Britannica, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of mind and its evolution is researched and considered as a separate phenomenon in a special system knowledge [[noogenesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390703_Eryomin_A.L._Noogenesis_and_Theory_of_Intellect._Krasnodar_2005.__356_p.__._.____.___2005.__356_ Eryomin A.L. '''Noogenesis and Theory of Intellect'''. Krasnodar, 2005.  356 pp.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031233209/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390703_Eryomin_A.L._Noogenesis_and_Theory_of_Intellect._Krasnodar_2005.__356_p.__._.____.___2005.__356_ |date=2014-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humanity==

===Spontaneous order===
{{see also|Spontaneous order|Self-organization}}
Groups of human beings, left free to each regulate themselves, tend to produce [[spontaneous order]], rather than the meaningless chaos often feared. This has been observed in society at least since [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tzu]] in ancient China. A classic [[traffic]] [[roundabout]] is a good example, with cars moving in and out with such effective organization that some modern cities have begun replacing stoplights at problem intersections with traffic circles [http://www.terrain.org/articles/2/siegman.htm], and getting better results. [[Open-source software]] and [[Wiki]] projects form an even more compelling illustration.

Emergent processes or behaviors can be seen in many other places, such as cities, [[cabal]] and [[market-dominant minority]] phenomena in economics, organizational phenomena in [[computer simulation]]s and [[cellular automata]].  Whenever there is a multitude of individuals interacting, an order emerges from disorder; a pattern, a decision, a structure, or a change in direction occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Peter.  2010.  The Smart Swarm: How understanding flocks, schools, and colonies can make us better at communicating, decision making, and getting things done.  New York: Avery.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economics====
The [[stock market]] (or any market for that matter) is an example of emergence on a grand scale.  As a whole it precisely regulates the relative security prices of companies across the world, yet it has no leader; when no [[Economic planning|central planning]] is in place, there is no one entity which controls the workings of the entire market.  Agents, or investors, have knowledge of only a limited number of companies within their portfolio, and must follow the regulatory rules of the market and analyse the transactions individually or in large groupings.  Trends and patterns emerge which are studied intensively by [[technical analysis|technical analysts]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

====World Wide Web and the Internet====
The [[World Wide Web]] is a popular example of a decentralized system exhibiting emergent properties.  There is no central organization rationing the number of links, yet the number of links pointing to each page follows a [[power law]] in which a few pages are linked to many times and most pages are seldom linked to.  A related property of the network of links in the World Wide Web is that almost any pair of pages can be connected to each other through a relatively short chain of links.  Although relatively well known now, this property was initially unexpected in an unregulated network.  It is shared with many other types of networks called [[small-world network]]s.{{Harv|Barabasi, Jeong, &amp; Albert|1999|pp=130–31}}

Internet traffic can also exhibit some seemingly emergent properties. In the congestion control mechanism, [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] flows can become globally synchronized at bottlenecks, simultaneously increasing and then decreasing throughput in coordination. Congestion, widely regarded as a nuisance, is possibly an emergent property of the spreading of bottlenecks across a network in high traffic flows which can be considered as a phase transition [see review of related research in {{Harv|Smith|2008|pp=1–31}}].

Another important example of emergence in web-based systems is [[social bookmarking]] (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which gives rise to a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, even in the absence of a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Architecture and cities====
[[File:Bangkok skytrain sunset.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Traffic patterns in cities can be seen as an example of [[spontaneous order]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}]]
Emergent structures appear at many different [[integrative level|levels of organization]] or as [[spontaneous order]]. Emergent [[self-organization]] appears frequently in [[city|cities]] where no planning or zoning entity predetermines the layout of the city.{{Harv|Krugman|1996|pp=9–29}} The interdisciplinary study of emergent behaviors is not generally considered a [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] field, but divided across its application or problem [[function domain|domains]].

Architects may not design all the pathways of a complex of buildings. Instead they might let usage patterns emerge and then place pavement where pathways have become worn, such as a [[desire path]].

The on-course action and vehicle progression of the [[DARPA Grand Challenge#2007 Urban Challenge|2007 Urban Challenge]] could possibly be regarded as an example of [[cybernetic]] emergence. Patterns of road use, indeterministic obstacle clearance times, etc. will work together to form a complex emergent pattern that can not be deterministically planned in advance.

The architectural school of [[Christopher Alexander]] takes a deeper approach to emergence, attempting to rewrite the process of urban growth itself in order to affect form, establishing a new methodology of planning and design tied to traditional practices, an [http://emergenturbanism.com/2009/03/23/the-journey-to-emergence/ Emergent Urbanism]. Urban emergence has also been linked to theories of urban complexity {{Harv|Batty|2005}} and urban evolution.{{Harv|Marshall|2009}}

Building ecology is a conceptual framework for understanding architecture and the built environment as the interface between the dynamically interdependent elements of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment. Rather than viewing buildings as inanimate or static objects, building ecologist Hal Levin views them as interfaces or intersecting domains of living and non-living systems.&lt;ref name="microbe.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microbe.net/fact-sheet-building-ecology/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203182235/http://www.microbe.net/fact-sheet-building-ecology/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The microbial ecology of the indoor environment is strongly dependent on the building materials, occupants, contents, environmental context and the indoor and outdoor climate.  The strong relationship between atmospheric chemistry and indoor air quality and the chemical reactions occurring indoors. The chemicals may be nutrients, neutral or biocides for the microbial organisms. The microbes produce chemicals that affect the building materials and occupant health and well being. Humans manipulate the ventilation, temperature and humidity to achieve comfort with the concomitant effects on the microbes that populate and evolve.&lt;ref name="microbe.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microbe.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210118/http://www.microbe.net/ |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://buildingecology.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808024931/http://www.buildingecology.com/ |date=2011-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Bonabeau's attempt to define emergent phenomena is through traffic: "traffic jams are actually very complicated and mysterious. On an individual level, each driver is trying to get somewhere and is following (or breaking) certain rules, some legal (the speed limit) and others societal or personal (slow down to let another driver change into your lane). But a traffic jam is a separate and distinct entity that emerges from those individual behaviors. [[Gridlock]] on a highway, for example, can travel backward for no apparent reason, even as the cars are moving forward." He has also likened emergent phenomena to the analysis of market trends and employee behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bonabeau E. Predicting the Unpredictable. Harvard Business Review [serial online]. March 2002. 80(3):109–16. Available from: Business Source Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational emergent phenomena have also been utilized in architectural design processes, for example for formal explorations and experiments in digital materiality.&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav and Gwyllim Jahn (2012). 'Emergent Materiality though an Embedded Multi-Agent System', in 15th Generative Art Conference, ed. by Celestino Soddu (Lucca, Italy: Domus Argenia), pp. 348–63

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer AI===
Some artificially intelligent (AI) computer applications utilize emergent behavior for animation. One example is [[Boids]], which mimics the [[swarming behavior]] of birds.

=== Language ===
It has been argued that the structure and regularity of [[language]] [[grammar]], or at least [[language change]], is an emergent phenomenon {{Harv|Hopper|1998}}. While each speaker merely tries to reach his or her own communicative goals, he or she uses language in a particular way. If enough speakers behave in that way, language is changed {{Harv|Keller|1994}}. In a wider sense, the norms of a language, i.e. the linguistic conventions of its speech society, can be seen as a system emerging from long-time participation in communicative problem-solving in various social circumstances {{Harv|Määttä|2000}}.

===Emergent change processes===
Within the field of group facilitation and organization development, there have been a number of new group processes that are designed to maximize emergence and self-organization, by offering a minimal set of effective initial conditions. Examples of these processes include [[SEED-SCALE]], [[Appreciative Inquiry]], Future Search, the World Cafe or [[Knowledge Cafe]], [[Open Space Technology]], and others (Holman, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holman|first=Peggy|date=December 2010 – January 2011|title=Engaging Emergence: Turning Upheaval into Opportunity|url=http://peggyholman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/211001pkSystems-Thinkerarticle.pdf|journal=Pegasus Communication: The Systems Thinker|volume=21|pages=|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418075443/http://peggyholman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/211001pkSystems-Thinkerarticle.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The '''goblin shark''' (''Mitsukurina owstoni'') is a rare [[species]] of deep-sea [[shark]]. Sometimes called a "[[living fossil]]", it is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] representative of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mitsukurinidae]], a lineage some 125 million years old. This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flattened snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. It is usually between &lt;!-- three and four meters (10–13&amp;nbsp;ft) --&gt;{{convert|3|and|4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long when mature, though it can grow considerably larger. Goblin sharks inhabit upper [[continental slope]]s, [[submarine canyon]]s, and [[seamount]]s throughout the world at depths greater than {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, with adults found deeper than juveniles.

Various anatomical features of the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, suggest that it is sluggish in nature. This species hunts for [[teleost]] fishes, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s both near the [[sea floor]] and in the middle of the [[water column]]. Its long snout is covered with [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] that enable it to sense minute [[electric field]]s produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are [[bycatch|unintentionally caught]] by deepwater [[fisheries]]. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed it as [[Least Concern]], despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Mitsu.JPG|thumb|left|Differing jaw positions in preserved goblin sharks led to several specimens being erroneously described as distinct species.]]
American [[ichthyologist]] [[David Starr Jordan]] described the goblin shark in an 1898 issue of ''Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences'', recognizing the peculiar fish not only as a new species, but also a new [[genus]] and family. He based his account on an immature male {{convert|107|cm|in|abbr=on}} long caught in [[Sagami Bay]] near [[Yokohama]], Japan. The specimen had been acquired by [[shipmaster]] and [[naturalist]] [[Alan Owston]], who had given it to Professor [[Kakichi Mitsukuri]] at the [[University of Tokyo]], who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark ''Mitsukurina owstoni'' in honor of these two men.&lt;ref name="jordan"/&gt; The [[common name]] "goblin shark" is a translation of its old Japanese name ''tenguzame'', a ''[[tengu]]'' being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face.&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt; Another name for this species is elfin shark.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

Shortly after Jordan's description was published, several scientists noted the similarity between ''Mitsukurina'' and the extinct [[Mesozoic]] shark ''[[Scapanorhynchus]]''.&lt;ref name="hussakof"/&gt; For a time, the prevailing view was to treat ''Mitsukurina'' as a [[junior synonym]] of ''Scapanorhynchus''. Eventually, more complete [[fossil]]s revealed many anatomical differences between ''Scapanorhynchus'' and ''Mitsukurina'', leading modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera.&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] confusion arose because the specimens' jaws were fixed at varying degrees of protrusion during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences in the head.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;

==Phylogeny and evolution==
[[Phylogenetic]] studies based on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] have generally placed the goblin shark as the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Lamniformes]], known as mackerel sharks.&lt;ref name="shirai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shimada"/&gt; Studies using [[molecular phylogenetics|genetic data]] have also supported a basal position for this species.&lt;ref name="naylor et al 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naylor et al 2012"/&gt; The family Mitsukurinidae, represented by ''Mitsukurina'', ''Scapanorhynchus'', and ''[[Anomotodon]]'', dates back to the [[Aptian]] age of the [[Cretaceous]] period (''c.'' 125–113 [[Ma (unit)|Ma]]). ''Mitsukurina'' itself first appears in the [[fossil record]] during the [[Middle Eocene]] (''c.'' 49–37 Ma);&lt;ref name="sepkoski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nelson"/&gt; extinct species include ''[[Mitsukurina lineata|M. lineata]]'' and ''[[Mitsukurina maslinensis|M. maslinensis]]''.&lt;ref name="vialle et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pledge"/&gt; ''[[Striatolamia macrota]]'', which lived in warm shallow waters during the [[Paleogene]] (''c.'' 66–23 Ma), may also be a ''Mitsukurina'' species.&lt;ref name="purdy"/&gt; As the last member of an ancient lineage, and one that retains several "[[primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]]" traits, the goblin shark has been described as a "[[living fossil]]".&lt;ref name="birx"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Mistukurina owstoni museum victoria - head detail.jpg|thumb|left|The goblin shark's jaws extend dramatically when feeding.]]
The goblin shark has a distinctively long and flat snout, resembling a sword blade. The proportional length of the snout decreases with age.&lt;ref name="parsons et al"/&gt; The eyes are small and lack protective [[nictitating membrane]]s; behind the eyes are [[spiracle]]s. The large mouth is [[parabola|parabolic]] in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost to the end of the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]], and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are short, with the [[gill filament]]s inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the [[pectoral fin]]s.&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt;&lt;ref name="last and stevens"/&gt;

The body is fairly slender and flabby. The two [[dorsal fin]]s are similar in size and shape, both being small and rounded. The pectoral fins are also rather small and rounded. The [[pelvic fin|pelvic]] and [[anal fin]]s have long bases and are larger than the dorsal fins. The [[caudal peduncle]] is flattened from side-to-side and lacks keels or notches. The asymmetric [[caudal fin]] has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe.&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt;&lt;ref name="last and stevens"/&gt; The soft, semitranslucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of [[dermal denticle]]s, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. In life, this species is pink or tan due to visible [[blood vessel]]s beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white. The fins' margins are translucent gray or blue, and the eyes are black with bluish streaks in the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]. After death, the coloration quickly fades to dull gray or brown.&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; Adult sharks usually measure between {{convert|3|and|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt; However, the capture of an enormous female estimated at {{convert|5.4|-|6.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long in 2000 showed this species can grow far larger than previously suspected.&lt;ref name="parsons et al"/&gt; The maximum weight on record is {{convert|210|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for a 3.8-m-long shark.&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt;

===Etymology===
The generic name honors Keigo Mitsukuri, a Japanese zoologist who studied at University College London during the 1860s. The specific name honors [[Alan Owston]], an English collector of Asian wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/3254|title=Mitsukurina|website=www.fishesofaustralia.net.au|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The goblin shark has been caught in all three major oceans, indicating a wide global distribution.

==Biology and ecology==
Although observations of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly [[calcification|calcified]], the muscle blocks along its sides ([[myomere]]s) are weakly developed, and its fins are soft and small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout appears to have a sensory function, as it bears numerous [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] that can [[electroreception|detect]] the weak [[electric field]]s produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small [[optic tectum]] in the shark's brain.&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt; Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its [[pupil]]s, thus probably does use its sight in some situations.&lt;ref name="martin2"/&gt; Goblin sharks may fall prey to the [[blue shark]] (''Prionace glauca'').&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; [[Parasite]]s documented from this species include the [[copepod]] ''[[Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae]]'',&lt;ref name="izawa"/&gt; and the [[tapeworm]]s ''[[Litobothrium amsichensis]]'' and ''[[Marsupiobothrium gobelinus]]''.&lt;ref name="caira and runkle"/&gt;

===Feeding===
[[File:CoryphaenoidesLeptolepis.jpg|thumb|Rattails and other deep-living teleosts are the main food of the goblin shark.]]
The goblin shark feeds mainly on [[teleost]] fishes such as [[rattail]]s and [[Stomiidae|dragonfishes]]. It also consumes [[cephalopod]]s and [[crustacean]]s, including [[Decapoda|decapods]] and [[isopod]]s. Garbage has been recorded from the stomachs of some specimens.&lt;ref name="yano et al"/&gt; Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the [[blackbelly rosefish]] (''Helicolenus dactylopterus''), and midwater species such as the [[squid]] ''[[Teuthowenia pellucida]]'' and the [[ostracod]] ''[[Macrocypridina castanea rotunda]]''. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duffy"/&gt;

Since it is not a fast swimmer, the goblin shark may be an [[ambush predator]]. Its low-density flesh and large [[shark liver oil|oily]] [[liver]] make it [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]], allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized jaws can snap forward to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic [[ligament]]s associated with the [[mandible|mandibular]] joint, which are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; when the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially "catapult" the jaws forward.&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) on the floor of the mouth drops, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; Striking and prey capture events were videotaped and recorded for the first time in 2008 and 2011 and helped to confirm the use and systematics of the protrusible goblin shark jaws. The video evidence suggests that while the jaws are definitely unique, goblin sharks use ram feeding, a type of prey capture that is typical of many mackerel sharks.&lt;ref name="nakaya et al"/&gt; What makes the goblin shark unique is the kinematics of their jaw when feeding. The lower jaw seems to undergo more complex movements and is key in capturing the prey. The measured protrusions of the upper and lower jaw combined put the goblin shark jaws at 2.1–9.5 times more protrusible than other sharks. The lower jaw has a velocity about two times greater than the upper jaw because it not only protrudes forward, but also swings upward to capture the prey, and the maximum velocity of the jaws is 3.14&amp;nbsp;m/s. The goblin shark has a re-opening and re-closing pattern during the strike, a behavior that has never been seen in other sharks before and could be related to the extent with which the goblin shark protrudes its jaws.&lt;ref name="nakaya et al"/&gt; This “slingshot” style of feeding could be an adaptation to compensate for poor swimming ability by allowing the goblin shark to catch elusive, fast prey without having to chase the prey.

===Life history===
Little is known about goblin shark reproduction because a pregnant female has yet to be found and studied. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other mackerel sharks, which are [[viviparous]] with small litter sizes and [[embryo]]s that grow during [[gestation]] by eating undeveloped [[ovum|eggs]] ([[oophagy]]).&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; The birth size is probably close to {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the length of the smallest known specimen.&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt; Males [[mature sexually]] at about {{convert|2.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, while female maturation size is unknown.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; No data is available on growth and aging.&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt;

==Human interactions==
Given the depths at which it lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few specimens have been collected alive and brought to [[public aquarium]]s, though they only survived a short time. One was kept at [[Tokai University]] and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days.&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tzn"/&gt; Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="bean"/&gt; This shark is not targeted by any [[fisheries]], but is occasionally found as [[bycatch]] in bottom [[gillnet]]s and [[trawl]]s, hooked on [[longline fishing|longlines]], or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; one of the few areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A [[black scabbardfish]] (''Aphanopus carbo'') fishery off [[Madeira]] also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major [[earthquake]]. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="castro"/&gt; The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under [[Least Concern]]. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

'''Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Rhc)''' can range from a mild to a severe disease.  It is the third most common cause of severe HDN.  [[Rh disease]] is the most common and [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)]] is the second most common cause of severe HDN.

It occurs more commonly in women who are Rh D negative.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Causes==
A Rhc negative mother can become sensitised by [[red blood cell]] (RBC) Rhc antigens by her first pregnancy with a Rhc positive fetus.  The mother can make [[IgG]] anti-Rhc [[antibodies]], which are able to pass through the [[placenta]] and enter the fetal circulation.  If the fetus is Rhc positive [[alloimmune]] [[hemolysis]] can occur leading to HDN.  This is similar as for [[Rh disease]], which is usually caused when a RhD negative mother is sensitised by her first pregnancy with a RhD positive fetus.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Sensitization to Rhc antigens can also be caused by blood transfusion.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Prevention==
It has been suggested that women of child-bearing age or young girls should not be given a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] with Rhc positive blood (or Kell&lt;sub&gt; 1&lt;/sub&gt; positive blood for similar reasons).  This would require a lot of extra work in blood transfusion departments and it is considered not economical to do the blood group screening at the present time.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

It is theoretically likely that IgG anti-Rhc antibody injections would prevent sensitization to RBC surface Rhc antigens in a similar way that IgG anti-D antibodies ([[Rho(D) Immune Globulin]]) are used to prevent [[Rh disease]], but the methods for IgG anti-Rhc antibodies have not been developed at the present time.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==History of HDN==
Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDN) is a condition where the passage of maternal antibodies results in the hemolysis of fetal/neonatal red cells. The antibodies can be naturally occurring such as anti-A, and anti-B, or immune antibodies developed following a sensitizing event.&lt;ref name=pmid21572705&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0973-6247.75963 |pmid=21572705 |pmc=3082712 |title=Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn: Current trends and perspectives |journal=Asian Journal of Transfusion Science |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=3–7 |year=2011 |last1=Basu |first1=Sabita |last2=Kaur |first2=Ravneet |last3=Kaur |first3=Gagandeep }}&lt;/ref&gt; Isoimmunization occurs when the maternal immune system is sensitized to red blood cell surface antigens. The most common causes of isoimmunization are blood transfusion, and fetal-maternal hemorrhage.&lt;ref name=pmid22439037&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22439037 |pmc=3279102 |year=2009 |author1=Cacciatore |first1=A |title=Obstetric management in Rh alloimmunizated pregnancy |journal=Journal of prenatal medicine |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=25–7 |last2=Rapiti |first2=S |last3=Carrara |first3=S |last4=Cavaliere |first4=A |last5=Ermito |first5=S |last6=Dinatale |first6=A |last7=Imbruglia |first7=L |last8=Recupero |first8=S |last9=La Galia |first9=T |last10=Pappalardo |first10=E.

In the case of anti-c, the woman should be checked around 28 weeks to see if she has developed anti-E as well.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Testing==
Testing for HDN involves blood work from both mother and father, and may also include assessment with amniocentesis and Middle Cerebral Artery scans.

===Mother===
Blood testing for the mother is called an Indirect Coombs Test (ICT) or an Indirect Agglutination Test (IAT). This test tells whether there are antibodies in the maternal plasma. If positive, the antibody is identified and given a titer. Critical titers are associated with significant risk of fetal anemia and hydrops.&lt;ref name=EMedicine273995&gt;{{EMedicine|article|273995|Erythrocyte Alloimmunization and Pregnancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titers of 1:8 or higher is considered critical for Kell. Titers of 1:16 or higher are considered critical for all other antibodies. After critical titer is reached, care is based on MCA scans. If antibodies are low and have a sudden jump later in pregnancy, an MCA scan is warranted. If the titer undergoes a 4 fold increase, it should be considered significant regardless of if the critical value has been reached. It should be noted that maternal titers are not useful in predicting fetal anemia after the first affected gestation and should not be used for the basis of care.&lt;ref name=EMedicine974349treatment&gt;{{EMedicine|article|974349|Hemolytic Disease of Newborn|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titers are tested monthly until 24 weeks, after which they are done every 2 weeks.&lt;ref name=pmid22439037/&gt;

"In only 2 situations are patients not monitored identically to patients who are Rh sensitized. The first is that of alloimmunization to the c, E, or, C antigens. Some concern exists that hemolysis may occur in these patients with a lower than 1:16 titer. Thus, if the initial titer is 1:4 and stable but increases at 26 weeks' gestation to 1:8, assessment with MCA Doppler velocity at that point is reasonable. However, if the patient presents in the first trimester with a 1:8 titer that remains stable at 1:8 throughout the second trimester, continued serial antibody titers are appropriate.
The second situation in which patients should not be treated identically to patients who are Rh D sensitized is that of Kell isoimmunization because several cases of severe fetal hemolysis with anti-Kell antibodies have occurred in the setting of low titers."&lt;ref name=EMedicine273995/&gt;

In the case of a positive ICT, the woman must carry a medical alert card or bracelet for life because of the risk of a transfusion reaction.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Father===
Blood is generally drawn from the father to help determine fetal antigen status.&lt;ref name=pmid21668766&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03028.x |pmid=21668766 |title=Noninvasive fetal blood group genotyping of rhesus D, c, E and of K in alloimmunised pregnant women: Evaluation of a 7-year clinical experience |journal=BJOG: an International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology |volume=118 |issue=11 |pages=1340–8 |year=2011 |last1=Scheffer |first1=PG |last2=Van Der Schoot |first2=CE |last3=Page-Christiaens |first3=Gcml |last4=De Haas |first4=M }}&lt;/ref&gt; If he is homozygous for the antigen, there is a 100% chance of all offspring in the pairing to be positive for the antigen and at risk for HDN. If he is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance of offspring to be positive for the antigen.&lt;ref&gt;Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis: Clinical and Laboratory Aspects {{ISBN|978-0-12-397788-5}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test can help with knowledge for the current baby, as well as aid in the decision about future pregnancies. With RhD, the test is called the RhD genotype.

===Fetus===
There are 3 possible ways to test the fetal antigen status. Free Cell DNA, Amniocentesis, and Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Of the three, CVS is no longer used due to risk of worsening the maternal antibody response. Once antigen status has been determined, assessment may be done with MCA scans.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

*Cell-free DNA can be run on certain antigens. Blood is taken from the mother, and using PCR, can detect the K, C, c, D, and E alleles of fetal DNA. This blood test is non-invasive to the fetus and is an easy way of checking antigen status and risk of HDN. Testing has proven very accurate and is routinely done in the UK at the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory in Bristol.&lt;ref name=pmid17958542&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01437.x |pmid=17958542 |title=Fetal genotyping for the K (Kell) and Rh C, c, and E blood groups on cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma |journal=Transfusion |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=2126–33 |year=2007 |last1=Finning |first1=Kirstin |last2=Martin |first2=Peter |last3=Summers |first3=Joanna |last4=Daniels |first4=Geoff }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanequin laboratory in Amsterdam, Netherlands also performs this test. For US patients, blood may be sent to either of the labs. In the US, Sensigene is done by Sequenome to determine fetal D status. Sequenome does not accept insurance in the US, but US and Canadian patients have had insurance cover the testing done overseas.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
*Amniocentesis is another recommended method for testing antigen status and risk for HDN. Fetal antigen status can be tested as early as 15 weeks by PCR of fetal cells.&lt;ref name=pmid22439037/&gt;
*CVS is possible as well to test fetal antigen status but is not recommended. CVS carries a higher risk of fetal maternal hemorrhage and can raise antibody titers, potentially worsening the antibody effect.&lt;ref name=pmid22439037/&gt;

==Intervention==
There are several intervention options available in early, mid and late pregnancies.

===Early pregnancy===
*IVIG - IVIG stands for Intravenous Immunoglobulin. It is used in cases of previous loss, high maternal titers, known aggressive antibodies, and in cases where religion prevents blood transfusion. Ivig can be more effective than IUT alone &lt;ref name=pmid9085208&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9085208 |year=1997 |author1=Voto |first1=L.

==After Birth==
===Testing===
*Coombs - after birth baby will have a direct coombs test run to confirm antibodies attached to the infant’s red blood cells. This test is run from cord blood.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.076794 |pmid=17337672 |pmc=2675453 |title=Haemolytic disease of the newborn |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=F83–8 |year=2007 |last1=Murray |first1=N.

"Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions may be either immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated. Immune-mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-A, anti-B, or anti-A,B typically result in severe, potentially fatal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Immune-mediated hemolytic reactions caused by IgG, Rh, Kell, Duffy, or other non-ABO antibodies typically result in extravascular sequestration, shortened survival of transfused red cells, and relatively mild clinical reactions. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to immune hemolysis may occur in patients who have no antibodies detectable by routine laboratory procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|206885|Transfusion Reactions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HOD)''' is a [[2 dimensional|2D]] trajectory descriptor. The [[trajectory]] is described using a [[histogram]] of the directions between each two consecutive points. Given a trajectory T = {P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}, where P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the 2D position at time t. For each pair of positions P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt;, calculate the direction angle θ(t, t+1). Value of θ is between 0 and 360. A histogram of the quantized values of θ is created. If the histogram is of 8 bins, the first bin represents all θs between 0 and 45.

The histogram accumulates the lengths of the consecutive moves. For each θ, a specific histogram bin is determined. The length of the line between P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; is then added to the specific histogram bin.

To show the intuition behind the descriptor, consider the action of waving hands. At the end of the action, the hand falls down. When describing this down movement, the descriptor does not care about the position from which the hand started to fall. This fall will affect the histogram with the appropriate angles and lengths, regardless of the position where the hand started to fall.

HOD records for each moving point: how much it moves in each range of directions. HOD has a clear physical interpretation. It proposes that, a simple way to describe the motion of an object, is to indicate how much distance it moves in each direction. If the movement in all directions are saved accurately, the movement can be repeated from the initial position to the final destination regardless of the displacements order. However, the temporal information will be lost, as the order of movements is not stored-this is what we solve by applying the temporal pyramid, as shown in section \ref{sec:temp-pyramid}. If the angles quantization range is small, classifiers that use the descriptor will overfit. Generalization needs some slack in directions-which can be done by increasing the quantization range.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20068">'''Human branding''' or '''stigmatizing''' is the process which a mark, usually a symbol or ornamental pattern, is burned into the skin of a living person, with the intention that the resulting scar makes it permanent. This is performed using a hot or [[Freeze-branding|very cold]] [[branding iron]]. It therefore uses the physical techniques of [[livestock branding]] on a human, either with consent as a form of [[body modification]]; or under coercion, as a [[punishment]] or to identify an [[slavery|enslaved]] or otherwise oppressed person. It may also be practiced as a "rite of passage", e.g. within a tribe, or to signify membership of or acceptance into an organization.

[[File:Strike Branding.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Modern strike branding]]

==Etymology==
The English verb to ''burn'', attested since the 12th century, is a combination of [[Old Norse]] ''brenna'' "to burn, light", and two originally distinct [[Old English]] verbs: ''bærnan'' "to kindle" (transitive) and ''beornan'' "to be on fire" (intransitive), both from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root ''bren(wanan)'', perhaps from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''bhre-n-u'', from base root ''bhereu-'' "to boil forth, well up." In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''(ver)branden'' mean "to burn", ''brandmerk'' a branded mark; similarly, in [[German language|German]], ''Brandzeichen'' means "a brand" and ''brandmarken'', "to brand".

Sometimes, the word ''cauterize'' is used. This is known in English since 1541, and is derived via Medieval French ''cauteriser'' from [[Late Latin]] ''cauterizare'' "to burn or brand with a hot iron", itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] καυτηριάζειν, ''kauteriazein'', from καυτήρ ''kauter'' "burning or branding iron", from καίειν ''kaiein'' "to burn". However ''[[cauterization]]'' is now generally understood to mean a medical process – specifically to stop bleeding.

==Historical use==

===Marking the rightless===
The origin may be the ancient treatment of a [[slavery|slave]] (often without legal rights) as [[livestock]].
*[[European ethnic groups|European]], [[United States|American]] and other colonial slavers branded millions of slaves during the period of [[slave trade|trans-Atlantic enslavement]]. Sometimes there were several brandings, e.g. for the Portuguese crown and the (consecutive) private owner(s), an extra cross after baptism as well as by [[Africa]]n slave catchers.

To a slave owner it would be logical to mark such property just like cattle, more so since humans are more able to escape.
* [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] marked runaway slaves with the letters '''FGV''' (for ''fugitivus'').
* An intermediate case between formal slavery and criminal law is when a convict is branded and legally reduced, with or without time limit, to a slave-like status, such as on the [[galley]]s (in France branded GAL or TF ''travaux forcés'' 'forced labour' until 1832), in a [[penal colony]], or auctioned to a private owner.

===As punishment===
In [[criminal law]], branding with a [[branding iron|hot iron]] was a mode of punishment consisting of marking the subject as if goods or animals,  sometimes concurrently with their reduction of status in life.

Brand marks have also been used as a punishment for convicted criminals, combining [[physical punishment]], as burns are very painful, with [[public humiliation]] (greatest if marked on a normally visible part of the body) which is here the more important intention, and with the imposition of an indelible [[criminal record]].
Robbers, like runaway slaves, were marked by the Romans with the letter F (''fur''); and the toilers in the mines, and convicts condemned to figure in gladiatorial shows, were branded on the forehead for identification. Under [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] the face was not permitted to be so disfigured, the branding being on the hand, arm or calf.

The [[Acts of Sharbil]] record it applied, amongst other tortures, to a Christian between the eyes and on the cheeks in [[Parthia]]n [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] at the time of the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] on a judge's order for refusal to sacrifice.

In the 16th century, German [[Anabaptists]] were branded with a cross on their foreheads for refusing to recant their faith and join the [[Roman Catholic]] church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Bean Underhill]], [https://archive.org/details/martyrologyofchu01brac ''Martyrology of the Churches of Christ Commonly Called Baptists during the Era of the Reformation''], (1850), pg 118&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North-American [[Puritan]] settlements of the 17th century, men and women sentenced for [[adultery]] were branded with an "'''A'''" letter on their chest, and for other crimes, such as "'''D'''" for drunkenness and "'''B'''" for blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6REfahE4TkwC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=British Colonial America: People and Perspectives|page=54|isbn=9781598840254|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|editor1=John A. Grigg|editor2=Peter C. Mancall}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2015}}

The mark in later times was also often chosen as a code for the crime (e.g. in Canadian military prisons D for [[Desertion]], BC for Bad Character; most branded men were shipped off to a [[penal colony]]){{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Branding was used for a time by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Surgeon and [[Oxford English Dictionary]] contributor [[William Chester Minor]] was required to brand deserters at around the time of the [[Battle of the Wilderness]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Until 1832 in [[France]], various offenses carried the additional infamy of being branded with a [[Fleur-de-lis|fleur de lis]] and [[galley-slave]]s could be branded '''GAL''' or, once the galleys were replaced by the ''bagnes'' on land, '''TF''' (''travaux forcés'', 'forced' labor, i.e. [[hard labour]]) or '''TFP''' (''travaux forcés à perpetuité'', hard labour for life).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} In most of the German-speaking states, however, branding people was unlawful. 

Following the [[Conspiracy of the Slaves]] of 1749 in [[Malta]], some slaves were branded with the letter '''R''' (for ''ribelli'') on their forehead and condemned to the galleys for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciberras |first1=Sandro |title=Maltese History - E. The Decline of the Order of St John In the 18th Century |url=http://www.stbenedictcollege.org/stlucija/files/Sandro%20Sciberras/Form%203%20Option%20Maltese%20History/Unit%20E_%20The%20Decline%20of%20the%20Order%20+%20WS%2010p.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101204/http://www.stbenedictcollege.org/stlucija/files/Sandro%20Sciberras/Form%203%20Option%20Maltese%20History/Unit%20E_%20The%20Decline%20of%20the%20Order%20+%20WS%2010p.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-06 |website=St. Benedict College |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branding tended to be abolished like other judicial mutilations (with notable exceptions, such as amputation under [[sharia]] law), sooner and more widely than [[flogging]], [[caning]], and similar corporal punishments, which normally aim 'only' at pain and at worst cause stripe scars, although the most severe lashings (not uncommon in penal colonies) in terms of dosage and instrument (such as the proverbial [[knout]]) can even turn out to cause death.

===Branding in American slavery===
[[File:Slave branding iron (replica), Museum of Liverpool.jpg|thumb|A replica of a slave branding iron originally used in the Atlantic slave trade, on display at the [[Museum of Liverpool]], England.]]
[[File:Branding slaves.tif|thumb|Depiction of slave branding, from ''Illustrations of the American Anti-slavery Almanac for 1840'']]
In Louisiana, there was a "black code", or ''[[Code Noir]]'', which allowed the cropping of ears, shoulder branding, and [[hamstringing]], the cutting of tendons near the knee, as punishments for recaptured slaves. Slave owners used extreme punishments to stop flight, or escape. They would often brand the slaves' palms, shoulders, buttocks, or cheeks with a branding iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=punishments|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/sharperail/punishments|work=The Underground RailRoad: An Encyclopedia of People, Places, and Operations|publisher=Armonk: M.E. Sharpe|accessdate=Oct 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branding was sometimes used to mark recaptured runaway slaves to help the locals easily identify the runaway. Mr. Micajah Ricks, in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], was looking for his slave and described, "I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face, I tried to make the letter M."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weld|first=Theodore Dwight|title=American Slavery As It Is|year=1968|publisher=Arno Press, Inc.|location=New York|pages=21, 77, 108, 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most slave owners would use whipping as their main method, but at other times they would use branding to punish their slaves. Another testimony explains how a slave owner in [[Kentucky]] around 1848 was looking for his runaway slave. He described her having "a brand mark on the breast something like L blotched."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=S. W.|title=Slavery As Punishment: Original Public Meaning, Cruel and Unusual Punishments and the Neglected Clause in the Thirteenth Amendment|journal=Arizona Law Review|date=Winter 2009|volume=51 Ariz.

When a slave ran away, if it was the first offense, the slave would receive no more than forty lashes. Then the second offense would be branding. The slave would have been marked with the letter R on their forehead signifying that they were a criminal, and a runaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higginbotham Jr.|first=A. Leon|title=In The Matter of Color Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period|year=1978|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York|pages=176–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As religious initiation===
Ceremonial Branding is an integral part of religious initiation in most [[Vaishnava]] sects. References to this practice can be traced in texts such as Narad [[Panchratra]], Vaikhnasagama, [[Skanda Purana]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=638&amp;Itemid=225 |title=Tapta Mudra Dharana |publisher=Uttaradi Math |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011436/http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=638&amp;Itemid=225 |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is still in vogue among Madhava sect Brahmins of [[Karnataka]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Udupi, July 11, DHNS : |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/175434/tapta-mudra-dharana-ceremony-held.html |title='Tapta Mudra Dharana' ceremony held |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date=2013-05-21 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branding in Britain===
The punishment was adopted by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], and the ancient law of England authorized the penalty. By the 
[[Vagabonds Act 1547|Statute of Vagabonds (1547)]] under [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] were ordered to be branded with a large '''V''' on the breast, and brawlers with '''F''' for "fraymaker"; slaves who ran away were branded with '''S''' on the cheek or forehead. This law was repealed in England in 1550. From the time of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], branding was inflicted for all offences which received [[Benefit of clergy]] (branding of the thumbs was used around 1600 at [[Old Bailey]] to ensure that the accused who had successfully used the Benefit of Clergy defence, by reading a passage from the Bible, could not use it more than once), but it was abolished for such in 1822. In 1698 it was enacted that those convicted of petty theft or [[larceny]], who were entitled to benefit of clergy, should be "burnt in the most visible part of the left cheek, nearest the nose." This special ordinance was repealed in 1707. [[James Nayler]], a [[Quaker]] who in the year 1655 was accused of claiming to be the [[Messiah]], convicted of [[blasphemy]] in a highly publicized trial before the Second Protectorate Parliament and had his tongue bored through and his forehead branded '''B''' for "blasphemer".

In the Lancaster criminal court a branding iron is still preserved in the dock. It is a long bolt with a wooden handle at one end and an '''M''' (malefactor) at the other; close by are two iron loops for firmly securing the hands during the operation. The brander would, after examination, turn to the judge exclaiming "A fair mark, my lord." Criminals were formerly ordered to hold up their hands before sentence to show if they had been previously convicted.

In the 18th century, cold branding or branding with cold irons became the mode of nominally inflicting the punishment on prisoners of higher rank. "When Charles Moritz, a young German, visited England in 1782 he was much surprised at this custom, and in his diary mentioned the case of a clergyman who had fought a [[duel]] and killed his man in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Found guilty of [[manslaughter]] he was burnt in the hand, if that could be called burning which was done with a cold iron" (Markham's ''Ancient Punishments of [[Northamptonshire|Northants]]'', 1886).

Such cases led to branding becoming obsolete, and it was abolished in 1829 except in the case of [[deserters]] from the army, who were marked with the letter '''D''', not with hot irons but by [[tattoo]]ing with ink or gunpowder. Notoriously bad soldiers were also branded with '''BC''' (bad character). The British [[Mutiny Act]] of 1858 provided that the [[court-martial]] might, in addition to any other penalty, order deserters to be marked on the left side, 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) below the armpit, with the letter '''D''', such letter to be not less than an inch long. In 1879 this was abolished.

===Branding in Australia===
Offenders in Australia were subject to branding in accordance with British law. In 1826, in Hobart, Joseph Clarke was charged with manslaughter and ‘sentenced to be burnt in the hand’. In 1850, in New South Wales, deserter Daniel O’Neil was tattooed with the letter ‘D’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnard|first1=Simon|title=Convict Tattoos: Marked Men and Women of Australia|date=2016|publisher=Text Publishing|location=Melbourne|isbn=9781925410235|pages=54-55|url=https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/convict-tattoos}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Branding in Russia===
Branding in Russia was used quite extensively in the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Over time, red hot iron brands were gradually replaced by tattoo boards; criminals were first branded on the forehead and cheeks, later on the back and arms. Branding was totally abolished in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://murders.ru/kleymenie.html |title=Murders |publisher=Murders.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branding prostitutes===
Forced and [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[prostitutes]] are often tattooed or [[Branding iron|branded]] with a mark of their owners. Women and girls being forced into [[prostitution]] would have their boss’s name or [[gang]] symbol inked or branded with hot iron on their skin. In some organizations involved with the [[trafficking of women]] and girls like the [[mafias]] nearly all prostitutes are marked. Some [[pimps]] and [[Criminal organisation|organisations]] use their name or well-known symbol, others are using secret signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/31/us/sex-trafficking-branding/ CNN: Old mark of slavery is being used on sex trafficking victims]&lt;/ref&gt;

The branding is both painful and [[humiliating]] for the prostitute, especially when done with a [[branding iron]], and may be also a form of [[Branding as punishment|punishment]] and of [[psychological]] submission for the prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Petala Parreira describes in her book Puta (Slut) the psychological effect of branding prostitutes in the Russian mafia. [https://portugues.free-ebooks.net/ebook/Puta Petala Parreira: Puta]. 2015, Portuguese language, p. 152 - 169, 228, 253 - 260 and 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years ago the brands were usually small{{Citation needed|reason=no statistical information in source given|date=May 2018}}, only recognized by other pimps, sometimes hidden between the [[Inner lips|inner vaginal lips]], though other instances show that pimps have no issue with larger more noticeable brands &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/pictured-trafficked-prostitutes-branded-pimps-4461651 Irish Mirror: Pictured: Trafficked prostitutes BRANDED by pimps to show they ‘own’ them]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persisting practices==
* Generally voluntary, though often under severe social pressure, branding may be used as a painful form of initiation, serving both as endurance and motivation test ([[rite of passage]]) and a permanent membership mark, seen as [[male bonding]] in violent 'macho' circles. Branding is thus practiced:
** By some [[Gang|street gang]]s
** In organized crime as "stripes" to signify a violent crime that the person committed. Typically on the upper arm or upper torso.
** In [[prison]]s
** Sometimes as an extreme initiation in the increasingly less common tradition of painful [[hazing]] (otherwise mostly [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]]).
** Some members of college fraternities and sororities voluntarily elect to be branded with their fraternity/sorority letters. This is far less common in sororities than fraternities and is especially prevalent in some historically African-American fraternities, such as [[Omega Psi Phi#"Unofficial" practices|Omega Psi Phi]].&lt;ref name=Posey&gt;Posey, Sandra, "[http://www.nyfolklore.org/pubs/voic30-3-4/burnmsgs.html Burning Messages: Interpreting African American Fraternity Brands and Their Bearers]", New York Folklore Society ''Voices'', Fall-Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Branding can be used as a [[body modification|voluntary body decoration]] – a form of permanent [[body art]] rather like many [[tattoo]]s.

==Protests==
In symbolic solidarity with [[Calf 269]], protesters in [[Israel]] subjected themselves to branding on World Farm Animals Day ([[Gandhi]]'s birthday): October 2, 2012. This act was emulated by others in England and the Czech Republic.

'''Jacques Charles Noel Dugé de Bernonville''' (December 20, 1897 &amp;ndash; April 26, 1972) was a [[France|French]] [[collaborationist]] and senior police officer in the [[Milice]] of the [[Vichy regime]] in France. He was known to hunt down and execute [[French resistance|resistance fighters]] during [[World War II]], as well as for his participation in [[anti-semitic]] programs, including the deportation of French Jews to Drancy and extermination camps. After his escape from France, he was convicted of war crimes and condemned to death.

He was aided in entering [[Quebec]], Canada in 1946 by leading Catholics of the province. In 1948 his true identity was discovered by immigration officials, who instituted deportation proceedings. De Bernonville fled to [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], where he lived the rest of his life. In 1957 the Supreme Court of Brazil refused to approve an extradition order. He was murdered by asphyxiation in 1972 by his servant's son.

==Early life and education==
Count Jacques Dugé de Bernonville was born in [[Paris]] to an aristocratic family and educated in [[Jesuit]] schools. He became aligned with conservative political groups.

==Career==
In 1938, he was imprisoned for several months, charged with having taken part in the conspiracy of ''[[La Cagoule]],'' a [[far right]] [[terrorist]] group. He was released because of lack of proof.

Following the 1940 [[Battle of France|defeat of France]] against [[Nazi Germany]], Jacques de Bernonville joined the Vichy government. In 1943 he was appointed as a commander of the collaborationist Milice, the Vichy police. Working in conjunction with the head of the Milice [[Joseph Darnand]], de Bernonville hunted down members of the [[French Resistance]]. They were almost always summarily executed.

As a right-hand man to [[Klaus Barbie]] (later convicted for [[crimes against humanity]]), de Bernonville participated in the establishment and enforcement of the Vichy regime's program of [[anti-Semitic]] policies. They carried out the deportation of thousands of French Jews, refugee Jews and other "undesirables" to the [[Drancy deportation camp]] en route to [[Auschwitz]] and other German [[extermination camp]]s.

== Post-war escape to Canada ==
After the [[liberation of France]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], de Bernonville was charged with [[war crimes]] but fled the country. He was [[trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] by a French War Crimes tribunal in [[Toulouse]]. There he was found guilty and condemned to death.

Escaping French authorities in 1946, de Bernonville sailed to New York City. According to historians such as Kevin Henley, professor of history at [[Collège de Maisonneuve]] in Montreal, the politically powerful [[Roman Catholic]] priest [[Lionel Groulx]] helped de Bernonville get into Quebec. He was welcomed by a significant number of the [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] elite, but in 1948 Canadian immigration authorities discovered his identity and instituted deportation proceedings. In an attempt to keep de Bernonville in Canada, 143 Quebec notables signed a 1950 petition defending him and stating that he should be allowed to stay. Signers included the secretary general of the [[Université de Montréal]]; [[Camillien Houde]], mayor of the city of [[Montreal]]; plus [[Camille Laurin]] and [[Denis Lazure]], two future cabinet ministers in the [[Parti Québécois]] government.

Faced with a deportation order, de Bernonville fled again, going to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. In 1954 the French government was advised of his location but, since Brazil had no [[extradition]] treaty with France, he escaped punishment. The [[Supreme Court of Brazil]] refused to extradite him in October 1957. Bernonville remained in Brazil. He died in 1972, murdered by the son of his servant.

'''José Antonio Offerman Dono''' (born November 8, 1968) is a Dominican retired professional [[baseball]] player who played professional baseball for nearly 20 years. He played for 15 seasons in the [[Major League Baseball]] and has played 4 seasons of [[Independent league baseball|independent]] and [[Mexican League]] baseball since leaving MLB.

He most recently managed the [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]], leading them to the 2008–2009 and 2013–2014 Dominican Winter League Championship. During a baseball game on January 16, 2010, Offerman attacked an umpire during an argument and, as a result, was banned from the Winter League for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAX17wMMuC4&amp;feature=channel Video of José Offerman hitting an umpire] [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed the [[Rojos del Águila de Veracruz]] of the [[Mexican League]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|title=Offerman looks to coach in MLB again after legal trouble|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2014/03/30/offerman-looks-to-coach-in-mlb-again-after-legal-trouble/|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=March 30, 2014|date=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After attending [[Colegio Biblico Cristiano High School]] in [[San Pedro de Macorís]], Offerman signed with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] as an amateur [[free agent]] in 1986. In {{Baseball year|1988}}, he completed his first season of professional play being named as Best Prospect in the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]]. Progressing rapidly through the minor leagues, he made his major league debut against the [[Montreal Expos]] on August 19, {{Baseball year|1990}} becoming the 55th player in major league history to hit a [[home run]] in his first major league [[at-bat]].

==Major leagues==
By {{Baseball year|1992}}, Offerman became the Dodgers' starting shortstop. On opening day 1993, he was the first batter to ever face the [[Florida Marlins]], striking out against [[Charlie Hough]]. He made his first appearance in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[1995 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1995]] but was traded to the [[Kansas City Royals]] after the season, mostly because of his very poor defense. After a year as a utility player, he won the starting [[second baseman]] job in 1997. Offerman had his best offensive seasons in Kansas City, culminating in {{Baseball year|1998}}, when he hit .315 with a league-leading 13 triples and the fifth most stolen bases, 45. After that season, he signed with the [[Boston Red Sox]] as a free agent, making the All-Star Game for the second time in [[1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1999]].

Known more for his hitting skills than his fielding, Offerman's offense began to decline in {{Baseball year|2000}}. He was sent to the [[Seattle Mariners]] during the {{Baseball year|2002}} season, but was released afterwards. In {{Baseball year|2003}}, he joined the [[Montreal Expos]] in [[spring training]] but was cut before the regular season began. He spent the entire year with the [[Bridgeport Bluefish]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]]. In {{Baseball year|2004}}, he won a spot on the [[Minnesota Twins]] roster and led the league in pinch-hits with 12 in 29 attempts. He started {{Baseball year|2005}} with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] but was released after a slow start. Later, he signed with the [[New York Mets]] and was called back up to the majors in June.

==Post-USA major leagues==
Most recently, Offerman played in the [[2008 Caribbean World Series]] for the [[Licey Tigers]] – Dominican Republic 2 team – where he assisted the team in winning its 10th Caribbean World Series title.  During the series he signed a contract with the 2008 [[Rojos del Águila de Veracruz|Veracruz Red Eagles]] of the [[Mexican Summer League]].

In December, 2008, Offerman was named player-manager of [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]].  With Offerman as manager, Licey swept the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five straight against the Gigantes del Cibao.  As champions, Licey was then invited to participate in the 2009 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager (the series was ultimately won by Venezuela). (The Caribbean World Series is affiliated with the Winter League programs of Major League Baseball, featuring MLB players and prospects from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.)

On January 7, 2014, Offerman was again named manager of the [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]], replacing Mike Guerrero.  With Offerman at the helm, Licey won the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five games to three over the Leones del Escogido.  As champions again, Licey has been invited to the 2014 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager.  At present, his team has qualified for the semifinals of the tournament.

===Bat incident===
He has not played or managed professional baseball in the United States since 2007. 
On August 14, {{Baseball year|2007}}, Offerman was thrown out of a Ducks game against the [[Bridgeport Bluefish]] for charging Bluefish pitcher [[Matt Beech]] with a bat after he was hit by a pitch. Beech sustained broken finger in the resulting melee. Bluefish catcher [[John Nathans]] was also hit in the back of the head during the bench-clearing melee, receiving a severe concussion that effectively ended his playing career.&lt;ref name="ESPN-arrest"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beech and Nathans were taken to Bridgeport Hospital where they were treated and released.  After being removed from the game, Offerman was arrested by the [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] Police.&lt;ref name="CT-Post-arrest"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2007, he was suspended indefinitely. The independent Atlantic League announced on August 17, 2007 that Offerman would remain suspended at least until the legal case was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suspension to remain in effect until legal proceedings finish|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2979699|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2007, Offerman pleaded not guilty to two second degree assault charges.&lt;ref name="ESPN-plea"&gt;{{cite news

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His case was pending in Bridgeport Superior Court GA#2 in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  He was represented by Attorney Frank J. Riccio II.  On October 30, 2007, Offerman was given two years special probation called "[[Accelerated Rehabilitation]] ('AR')."  The Court determined that his actions on August 14, 2007 were of an aberrant nature.  The Court also found that Offerman is not likely to offend again in the future.&lt;ref name="ESPN-probation"&gt;{{cite news

Nathans filed a $4.8 million civil suit against Offerman in February 2009, claiming that he still has [[post-concussion syndrome]] and that the injury allegedly caused by Offerman ended his baseball career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3902057 Jose Offerman Sued By John Nathans] ESPN.com, February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2009/05/12/a_dizzying_turn/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A dizzying turn | first=Stan | last=Grossfeld | date=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 29, 2014, Nathans won his suit, and Offerman was ordered to pay $940,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offerman ordered to pay nearly $1M|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11282853/jose-offerman-ordered-pay-nearly-1-million-bat-attack-case|publisher=ESPN.com|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2010, Offerman once again engaged in an on-field assault when he struck an umpire while managing a Dominican Republic winter league game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/01/16/sports/s205458S68.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122003905/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2010%2F01%2F16%2Fsports%2Fs205458S68.DTL |archivedate=January 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offerman, manager of the [[Licey Tigers]], came onto the field during the third inning while losing a 6-0 game to the [[Cibao Giants]], to protest ejection of his catcher for arguing balls and strikes and ended up arguing with first-base umpire [[D.J. Reyburn]]. He swung with a right hook at Reyburn, who then fell to the ground. Offerman was detained by stadium security, eventually being transported to the local police station to await the end of the game and Reyburn's decision whether to ask for charges to be pressed against him or not.

A day after the incident, the American crew that umpired the game resigned their positions with the Dominican Baseball League and left the country, reportedly due to threats and concerns about their own safety. Because of this incident Offerman received a lifetime ban from the Dominican Republic Winter League, a suspension that was eventually lifted in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almomento.net/articulo/130505/Levantan-suspension-a-Jose-Offerman-por-golpear-arbitro |title=Levantan suspensión a José Offerman por golpear árbitro – Almomento.net: Periodico Digital Dominicano |publisher=Almomento.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809201348/http://www.almomento.net/articulo/130505/Levantan-suspension-a-Jose-Offerman-por-golpear-arbitro |archivedate=2014-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, at the time he was suspended, Offerman was replacing [[Dave Jauss]] as Licey manager after Jauss was suspended himself for two years for bumping an umpire during a playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4836498 |title=José Offerman banned for life by Dominican league – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tine Rømer Holtegaard was asleep, having taken [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]],&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amtsavisen.dk/krimi/16-aarig-doemt-9-aars-faengsel-for-blodigt-og-bestialsk-drab-paa-sin-mor|title=16-årig dømt: 9 års fængsel for blodigt og bestialsk drab på sin mor|last1=Vester|first1=Jonas|date=14 September 2015|work=Randers Amtsavis|accessdate=20 September 2015|language=Danish|trans-title=16-year-old sentenced: 9 years' prison for bloody and bestial killing of her mother}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she was stabbed at least 20 times in the chest.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sims|first1=Alexandra|title=Teenage girl Lisa Borch jailed for murdering her mother after watching Isis beheading videos online|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/teenage-girl-jailed-for-murdering-mother-after-watching-isis-beheading-videos-online-10502266.html|accessdate=20 September 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borch, who according to computer records had been watching ISIL execution videos including those of [[David Haines (aid worker)|David Haines]] and [[Alan Henning]], contacted the police, claiming that her mother had screamed and she had seen a "white man" running away from their home.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; She was indifferent when the police informed her that her mother had been killed.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Abdullah was not present when the police arrived, but was arrested on the strength of forensic evidence.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

==Trial and conviction==
Borch and Abdullah were tried in court in [[Hjørring]].&lt;ref name=rand/&gt; The prosecution argued that the aggravating factors were the brutality of the murder's planning and execution, Rømer Holtegaard having taken sleeping pills, and the crime having taken place in the victim's home.&lt;ref name=rand/&gt; They also claimed that the pair were intending to fight in the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; The defence said that Borch's sentence should be mitigated by her youth, and her being under the bad influence of others.&lt;ref name=rand/&gt; The court could not prove which of the pair carried out the stabbing; both Borch and Abdullah were found guilty of murder.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Borch's sentence was suggested by the prosecution, and was made possible because of a 2010 amendment to the law which scrapped a previous maximum eight-year sentence for criminals under 18; she was ordered to serve the first year in juvenile detention and the remaining eight in prison.&lt;ref name=rand/&gt;

Her stepfather told Danish newspaper ''[[BT (tabloid)|BT]]'' that he disagreed with the court psychologists' conclusion that Borch's psychology showed [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] elements, claiming that she changed radically after meeting Abdullah.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; He also expressed fears that she would become further radicalised in prison.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; In an interview with ''[[Se og Hør]]'', he confessed that he felt as fragile as a "Chinese porcelain doll" after the murder of his partner of eleven years, sleeping upwards of 14 hours a day and being prescribed anti-anxiety medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seoghoer.dk/nyheder/mit-liv-er-oedelagt|title=Jens' kone blev brutalt myrdet: Mit liv er ødelagt|last=|first=|date=28 September 2015|work=[[Se og Hør]]|accessdate=28 September 2015|language=Danish|trans-title=Jens' wife was brutally murdered: My life is ruined}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}

These are lists of the 100 known '''verified oldest men and women''', arranged in descending order of each individual's age in years and days. A year typically refers to a [[calendar year]], the time between two dates of the same name. However, years can be of different lengths due to the presence or absence of a [[leap day]] within the year, or to the conversion of dates from one calendar to another. 

The oldest person ever whose age has been verified is [[Jeanne Calment]] (1875–1997) of France, who died at the age of 122 years, 164 days. The oldest man ever whose age has been verified is [[Jiroemon Kimura]] (1897–2013) of Japan, who died at the age of 116 years, 54 days.

As of {{date}}, the oldest known living person is [[Kane Tanaka]] of Japan, aged {{age in years and days|1903|1|2}}. The oldest known living man is [[List of Japanese supercentenarians#Masazō Nonaka|Masazō Nonaka]] of Japan, aged {{age in years and days|1905|7|25}}. Due to [[Life expectancy#Sex differences|differences in life expectancy]], the 100 oldest women have lived significanty longer than the 100 oldest men.

Since all the people on this list have lived past the age of 110, all of them have been, or still are, [[supercentenarian]]s.

[[File:Walker County ID photo fx Recon 007b.jpg|thumb|The [[Walker County Jane Doe]]'s case is one of Texas' most-known unidentified person cases]]

In Texas, there are a number of murder victims, in the category of [[unidentified decedent]]s, whose identities have yet to be found. In most of these cases, their murderer or murderers have also gone undiscovered.

A white or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] male between 15 and 18 years old was found buried in a [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] boat shed in August 1973.

This youth is the only still-unidentified victim of serial killer [[Dean Corll]], who, together with two teenage accomplices, killed at least 28 boys and young men between 1970 and 1973.&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Christian|first=Carol|title=40 years after Houston serial killings, one victim still unidentified|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/40-years-after-Houston-serial-killings-one-4686772.php|accessdate=18 April 2014|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Doe 1973|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1109009|publisher=[[Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decedent was between 5 feet 2 and 5 feet 7 inches tall, had brown hair, and is believed to have worn striped swim trunks, boots, and a shirt displaying a [[peace symbol]].

He had received good dental care, and had never received any [[teeth fillings]] in his lifetime. It is known that he suffered from a mild form of [[spina bifida]].&lt;ref name="Case File 1010UMTX"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 1010UMTX|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/1010umtx.html|publisher=The Doe Network|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA profiling|DNA]] testing conducted in 2008 did not match any [[missing person]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 4547|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/4547|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=6 January 2015|date=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[forensic science|forensic examination]] of the boy's remains, in addition to the [[Circumstantial evidence|circumstantial fact]] that he was buried between two identified victims of Dean Corll (killed in August 1971 and July 1972), indicated that he was most likely murdered in either 1971 or 1972.

=="Orange Socks"==

{{main|Orange Socks}}

A 15- to 30-year-old woman discovered in [[Georgetown, Texas]], on Halloween of 1979. Her body was naked save for a pair of orange socks. She had been killed by strangulation, and had contracted [[salpingitis]] in her lifetime.&lt;ref name="Case File: 33UFTX"&gt;{{cite web| title=Case File: 33UFTX| url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/33uftx.html| publisher=[[The Doe Network]]| accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walker County Jane Doe==

{{main|Walker County Jane Doe}}

A teenage female whose body was discovered approximately six hours after she died on October 31 or November 1, 1980. [[Henry Lee Lucas]] has been named as a potential suspect in this case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Walker Texas Jane Doe November 1980|website=canyouidentifyme.org| url=http://www.canyouidentifyme.org/WalkerTexasJaneDoeNovember1980| accessdate=May 12, 2014| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a bite mark found upon the decedent's shoulder was inconsistent with Lucas's dentistry.&lt;ref name="Case File: 91UFTX"&gt;{{cite web| title=Case File: 91UFTX| url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/91uftx.html| publisher=The Doe Network| accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was estimated to be between the ages of 14 and 18 years old with brown hair and brown or hazel eyes. She had claimed to a waitress that she was 19 but the waitress did not believe her. She was described as wearing a yellow pullover sweater and red heeled sandals. She was also wearing a square or rectangular pendent necklace with a smokey blue or brown stone. The necklace was found on the body and the shoes were nearby but none of her clothing was located. 

When her body was found it was determined she had only been dead for several hours. She had been viciously sexually assaulted with a large foreign object. A truck driver had seen her body on the north bound side of highway 45 about a mile north of The Hitchin Post truck stop. 

The waitress who spoke to her claimed the girl told her she was from the Aransas Pass/Rockport area but no missing persons were reported in that area around the time of her death.

On August 12, 1985, the body of a Hispanic female aged between 16 and 35 was found inside a vacant store. Her body was discovered alongside that of a man who was identified as Thomas Rodriguez, and her death had occurred hours prior to her discovery. She was between five feet and five feet two inches, and weighed approximately 120 to 140 pounds. Other distinctive details regarding this decedent include two sets of distinctive earrings she had worn which contained beads and shells, a tattoo of the letter 'V' on her upper left arm, and a scar resulting from her [[gallbladder]] being removed. A necklace with an arrowhead and turquoise stone design was also found on the girl's neck. It is unknown how both victims were placed at the scene.&lt;ref name="Case File 32UFTX"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 32UFTX|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/32uftx.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 1986, a black woman was shot multiple times and left near a railroad. She was between 18 and 25, standing five feet eleven inches tall. The body had gone undiscovered for approximately three weeks to three months. The motive for the murder was apparently an argument. [[Ángel Maturino Reséndiz]], a serial killer, confessed to her murder, claiming he had also killed the woman's boyfriend, whose remains are yet to be found. The woman wore a [[white gold]] ring, a striped blue short skirt, and a flannel jacket, which was also striped. She was believed to have been native to [[Florida]], her first name reported to possibly be Norma. The woman, along with her boyfriend and another victim, has never been identified. Reséndiz apparently killed seventeen others.&lt;ref name="Case File 76UFTX"&gt;{{cite web| title= Case File 76UFTX| url= http://doenetwork.org/cases/76uftx.html| publisher= The Doe Network| accessdate= 12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A black subject, twenty to thirty years old, who was likely a [[trans woman]] or a [[drag queen]], was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital when found unresponsive on July 10, 1986, in [[Live Oak, Texas|Live Oak]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], [[Texas]]. The cause of death was strangulation, which may have been done with pantyhose. The subject was dressed in pink pants, a gray shirt, and a black belt with spikes. A pair of socks was under the shirt, likely used to mimic breasts. A heart tattoo containing a scroll was on one arm, and the victim's fingernails had been painted gold at one point. Four earrings were found in each ear; a ring with a clear stone, a ring without a stone, a silver chain, and two gold-colored necklaces were also found.

A Hispanic male between fifteen and twenty-five was found stabbed to death on December 15, 1988, in [[Collin County, Texas]]. He had died a day before his body was found abandoned in a culvert. He wore a motorcyclist's jacket and a white and gray striped shirt, along with corduroy jeans, loafers, and a belt with a multi-colored buckle. He had a tattoo on his arm of the letters "RYA" inside a heart with an arrow through it, possibly representing a significant other or a family member. He was found wearing a watch, a bracelet, and two rubber rings. He was relatively short for a male, being five feet to five feet one inch tall.

The decomposed remains of a Hispanic woman were found on a beach, scavenged by coyotes, on October 10, 2012, in South Padre Island, Cameron County, Texas. The victim's body was likely exposed due to changes with water levels on the beach. The woman had been dead from one to several weeks before her remains were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman's body found buried on South Padre Island|url=http://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=811545#.Va2DAvlVhHw|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Action News 4|agency=Valley Central|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sand above the body had been "covered with lime," possibly to speed decomposition or plant growth, likely as a way to prevent the body from being found or identified. Her height was estimated to be four feet ten to five feet two inches tall and her weight at about 95 to 120 pounds. She was middle-aged, approximately forty-two to fifty-five, at the time of death.&lt;ref name=gerber&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerber|first1=Tim|title=FBI hopes 3D facial reconstruction will help ID slain woman|url=http://www.ksat.com/content/pns/ksat/news/2014/11/20/info-sought-in-2012-slaying-of--jane-doe-.html|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=KSAT News 12|publisher=ABC|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more of the female's limbs were not found with the body, as they were likely carried away by animals.

'''Michael Asen III''' ({{lang-bg|Михаил Асен III}}, ''Mihail Asen III'', commonly called '''Michael Shishman''' (Михаил Шишман, ''Mihail Šišman'')),{{cref|a}} ruled as emperor ([[tsar]]) of [[Bulgaria]] from 1323 to 1330. The exact year of his birth is unknown but it was between 1280 and 1292. He was the founder of the last ruling dynasty of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Shishman dynasty]]. After he was crowned, however, Michael used the name Asen to emphasize his connection with the [[Asen dynasty]], the first one to rule over the Second Empire.

An energetic and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Serbia]], which ended in the disastrous [[battle of Velbazhd]] which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] over the [[Balkans]] and the last one who attempted to seize [[Constantinople]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Ivan Stephen of Bulgaria|Ivan Stephen]] and later by his nephew [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]], who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.&lt;ref name="kazhdan"&gt;Kazhdan, "Michael III Šišman", p. 1365&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to the throne==
Born between 1280&lt;ref&gt;Андреев, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; and 1292&lt;ref name="kazhdan"/&gt; Michael Shishman was the son of the [[Despot (court title)|despot]] [[Shishman of Vidin]] by an unnamed daughter of the ''[[sebastokrator]]'' Peter and [[Anna-Theodora Asenina of Bulgaria|Anna (Theodora)]], herself daughter of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (r. 1218-1241) and [[Irene Komnene of Epirus]]. He was also a distant cousin of his predecessors on the Bulgarian throne, [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theodore Svetoslav]] (r. 1300-1321) and [[George II of Bulgaria|George Terter II]] (r. 1321-1322). After the peace between his father and [[Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Milutin]] in 1292, Michael Shishman was engaged to Milutin's daughter [[Anna Neda of Serbia|Anna Neda]] and they married in 1298 or 1299.&lt;ref name="fine268"&gt;Fine, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the middle of the 13th century, the area of [[Vidin]] had been autonomous under ineffective Bulgarian overlordship, and was ruled successively by [[Yakov Svetoslav]] (died 1276), Shishman (died between 1308 and 1313), and then Michael Shishman. Shishman and his son received the high courtly title of ''despotēs'' from their cousin Theodore Svetoslav and the latter was referred to in a contemporary Venetian source as a ''Despot of Bulgaria and Lord of Vidin''.&lt;ref name="fine268"/&gt; With the death of the Serbian king Stefan Milutin, Michael Shishman was able to follow a more active policy in the Bulgarian capital [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. He soon became a leading noble in the internal affairs of the country and, on the childless death of young George Terter II in 1323, Michael Shishman was elected emperor of Bulgaria by the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt; According to some historians he was chosen because he was a descendant of the Asen dynasty and interpret his ascencion to the throne not as the beginning of a new dynasty but rather as a continuation of the House of Asen.&lt;ref&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; His half-brother, [[Belaur]], succeeded him as despot of Vidin.&lt;ref name="fine269"&gt;Fine, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with the Byzantine Empire==

===War against Byzantium===
[[File:Battle of Velbazhd.png|thumb|right|300px|Bulgaria during the rule of Michael Shishman.]]
The sudden death of George Terter II had been followed by a brief period of confusion and uncertainty, which was exploited by the Byzantine emperor [[Andronicus III Palaeologus|Andronikos III Palaiologos]]. The Byzantines overran northeastern [[Thrace]] and captured a number of important cities including [[Yambol]], [[Lardea]], [[Ktenia (fortress)|Ktenia]], [[Rusokastro]], [[Pomorie|Anchialus]], [[Sozopol]] and [[Tsarevo|Agatopol]]. At the same time, a Byzantine-sponsored pretender, [[Voysil (despot)|Voysil]], brother of the former Bulgarian emperor [[Smilets of Bulgaria|Smilets]] (r. 1292-1298), ensconced himself in [[Kran, Stara Zagora Province|Krăn]], controlling the valleys between the [[Balkan mountains]] and [[Sredna Gora]] from [[Sliven]] to [[Anevo Fortress|Kopsis]].&lt;ref name="a256"&gt;Андреев, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the newly elected Michael Shishman marched south against Andronikos III, while another Byzantine army led by Andronikos III himself was besieging Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]). Defended by a Bulgarian garrison led by [[Ivan the Russian]], the siege was a failure despite the Byzantines use of a 100-soldier, five-story siege tower.&lt;ref name="a256"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Historia by John Kantakouzenos" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; While the Byzantine army was engaged at Philipopolis, Michael Shishman led his troops to north-eastern Thrace and quickly retook the lost cities thus forcing the Byzantines to pull back.&lt;ref name="a256"/&gt;

Although Michael Shishman forced Andronikos III to retreat, the Byzantines managed to take the Philippopolis while the Bulgarians were changing garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;"Historia by John Kantakouzenos" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the loss, Michael Shishman was able to expel Voysil and fully recover Bulgarian control over northern and northeastern Thrace in 1324 which had been taken by the Byzantines in the previous year during the interregnum.&lt;ref&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 563&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 1324, the Bulgarian emperor invaded Byzantium advancing as far as Trajanopolis{{cref|b}} and Vira in the lower course of the [[Maritsa]] river.&lt;ref&gt;Андреев, pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt; Andronikos III was unable to engage the Bulgarian army because his troops were outnumbered. He offered Michael Shishman a [[duel]] to solve the conflict. The Bulgarian emperor answered with the words cited by [[John VI Kantakouzenos|John Kantakouzenos]]:&lt;ref name="a257"&gt;Андреев, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Historia by John Kantakouzenos" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{cquote|Stupid would be the blacksmith who instead of taking the hot iron with pincers takes it with his hands. He himself would be ridiculed by the Bulgarians if he risks not his large and strong army but his own body.}}
The Byzantine emperor was said to have been infuriated with the answer and the fact that he was outsmarted. However, Michael III who was informed of the conflict between Andronikos III and Andronikos II hinted him that he could help Andronikos III against his grandfather in case of war and returned to Bulgaria promising that soon he would begin negotiations.&lt;ref name="a257"/&gt;

===Peace agreement and involvement in Byzantine civil war===
On a council held in Constantinople on the relations with Bulgaria it was decided that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married [[Theodora Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria|Theodora Palaiologina]], the 35-year-old widow of emperor [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theodore Svetoslav]].&lt;ref name="f270"&gt;Fine, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that the deterioration of the Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="a258"&gt;Андреев, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bg566"&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 566&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border should follow the Philippopolis-[[Ormenio|Chernomen]]-Sozopol line.&lt;ref name="a258"/&gt; The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.&lt;ref name="a258"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1327 Michael Shishman became involved in the renewed civil war in the [[Byzantine Empire]], taking the side of his brother-in-law Andronikos III, while his grandfather and rival [[Andronicus II Palaeologus|Andronikos II]] obtained the support of the Serbian king. Andronikos III and Michael Shishman [[Treaty of Chernomen|met at Chernomen]] (according to [[Nicephorus Gregoras]] at [[Didymoteicho|Dimotika]])&lt;ref name="bg565"&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 565&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded an aggressive alliance against Serbia. The Byzantine emperor promised to Bulgaria territory with several towns and large amount of money if he would become a sole emperor.&lt;ref name="a259"&gt;Андреев, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that alliance, Andronikos III gained control of Macedonia but his success made Michael Shishman, who aimed at a prolonged conflict within the Byzantine Empire, enter into negotiations with Andronikos II, offering military support in exchange for money and the cession of some border lands.&lt;ref&gt;Андреев, pp. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian ruler sent a detachment of 3,000 cavalry, commanded by [[Ivan the Russian]], from Yambol to guard the Imperial Palace in Constantinople and Andronikos II but his intentions were to capture the old emperor and the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jireček, p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Павлов&lt;/ref&gt; Forewarned by his grandson, Andronikos II prudently kept the Bulgarians away from the capital and his person. When Michael Shishman understood that his plans were revealed he sent Ivan a letter with a single feather to retreat which meant that the orders had to be promptly executed.&lt;ref name="a260"&gt;Андреев, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the victory of Andronikos III over his grandfather, Michael Shishman attempted to gain some lands by force. He invaded Thrace in June 1328 and pillaged the vicinities of [[Vize|Viza]] but retreated before the advance of Andronikos III.&lt;ref name="a261"&gt;Андреев, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Another showdown in front of [[Adrianople]] 60 days later ended without battle and with the renewal of the peace treaty in October 1328, after which Michael Shishman returned to his country, but not before securing a large payoff.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the Bulgarians gave back the fortress of [[Matochina|Bukelon]] which they had taken during the initial stages of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, pp. 567–568&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the next year the Bulgarian emperor requested a personal meeting with his Byzantine counterpart to negotiate a definitive treaty and joint military operations against the growing power of Serbia.&lt;ref name="kazhdan"/&gt; In the locality known as ''Krimni'' between Sozopol and Anchialus the two signed "lasting peace and eternal alliance".&lt;ref name="a261"/&gt;

==Relations with Serbia==
{{See also|Battle of Velbazhd}}
[[File:Bitkakodvelbuzda1330.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[battle of Velbazhd]].]]
The divorce with Anna Neda in 1324 worsened the relations between Bulgaria and Serbia which had been cordial since the beginning of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Андреев, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Neda had to leave the capital [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] with her sons and sought refuge from her brother [[Stephen Uroš III Dečanski of Serbia|Stephen Dečanski]], the king of Serbia.&lt;ref name="a258"/&gt; Dečanski, who was engaged in war against his cousin [[Stephen Vladislav II of Syrmia|Stephen Vladislav II]], was in no position to oppose Michael Shishman.&lt;ref name="f270"/&gt; The Bulgarian emperor even acknowledged his rival as King of Serbia but his help to Vladislav was insufficient. In the spring of 1324 Dečanski sent the future Serbian archbishop [[Saint Danilo II|Danilo II]] to negotiate with the Bulgarian emperor in Tarnovo but his mission was inconclusive.&lt;ref name="bg565"/&gt; The two countries were again on the opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war when the Bulgarians allied with Andronikos III while the Serbs supported his grandfather.&lt;ref name="f270"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Андреев, pp. 258–259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

After the agreement with Andronikos III in 1329, Michael Shishman started preparations to attack while the Serbs were pillaging the areas around [[Ohrid]]. According to the Serbian chroniclers, he arrogantly demanded the submission of the Serbian king and threatened to "set up his throne in the middle of the Serbian land".&lt;ref name="a262"&gt;Андреев, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; In 1330, expecting to join the army of Andronikos III advancing from the south, Michael Shishman marched on Serbia with a large force of 15,000 troops, including reinforcements from his vassals and allies from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="a262"/&gt; At first he headed to Vidin, where historians believe he wanted to join forces with the soldiers of his brother Belaur, and then marched to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor coordination with the Byzantines, the Bulgarian army met the Serbs, whose army numbered 15,000 men as well, alone near Velbazhd ([[Kyustendil]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fine, pp. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; On a personal meeting, the two rulers agreed to a one-day truce as both were expecting reinforcements. Backed on the agreement, Michael Shishman allowed his army to disperse in search for provisions. However, in the morning of 28 July, the main Serbian reinforcements, 1,000 heavily armed Catalan horsemen under the command of the King's son [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Stephen Dušan]] arrived, and the Serbs broke their word and attacked the Bulgarians.&lt;ref name="g265"&gt;"Historia by John Kantakouzenos" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unexpected assault, Michael Shishman tried to bring his army to order but it was too late and the Serbs were victorious.&lt;ref name="a262"/&gt; The outcome of the battle shaped the balance of power in the Balkans for the next decades to come and although Bulgaria did not lose territory, the Serbs could occupy much of Macedonia.&lt;ref name="f272"&gt;Fine, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Манастир Св Ђорђа.JPG|200px|thumb|right|The [[Church of St. George, Staro Nagoričane|Church of St George]] where Michael Shishman was buried.]]
The circumstances around the death of Michael Shishman are unclear. According to the Byzantine emperor and historian [[John VI Cantacuzenus|John Kantakouzenos]] the emperor was mortally wounded in the battle and soon died&lt;ref name="g265"/&gt; while another Byzantine historian suggests that Michael Shishman lived for three more days not able to gain consciousness and died on the fourth day.&lt;ref&gt;Андреев, pp. 263–264&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian chronicles state that his horse fell during the battle and crashed his body. When his body was taken to Dečanski, he mourned him but pointed out that he preferred war to peace.&lt;ref name="a264"&gt;Андреев, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The early 15th-century Bulgarian scholar and cleric [[Gregory Tsamblak]] says that Michael Shishman was captured and killed by the son of the Serbian king, Stephen Dušan.&lt;ref name="a264"/&gt; He was buried in the [[Church of St. George, Staro Nagoričane|Church of St George]] in [[Staro Nagoričane]].&lt;ref&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Shishman is considered a vain, aggressive, and opportunistic ruler, whose [[Proteus|Protean]] foreign policy perhaps contributed to the battle that put an end to his life. At the same time he was clearly forceful and energetic, overcoming and reversing Bulgaria's losses during the uncertainty that preceded his accession, and managing to maintain internal peace and security within Bulgaria during his short reign. Andreev calls him the most remarkable 14th-century Bulgarian monarch.&lt;ref name="a264"/&gt; According to Kantacouzenos he desired to expand the country from Byzantium to the Istros, i. e. from [[Constantinople]] to the [[Danube]]&lt;ref name="bg566"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a259"/&gt; which makes him the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who effectively attempted to capture the Byzantine capital. He was also the first Bulgarian ruler for decades who tried to lead a more active policy in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Божилов, Гюзелев, p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Shishman's seal is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Bulgarian 2 [[Bulgarian lev|levs]] banknote, issued in 1999 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnb.bg Bulgarian National Bank].

==Family==
Michael Shishman was married first to [[Anna Neda of Serbia]], a daughter of [[Stefan Milutin|Stefan Uroš II Milutin]] of Serbia. By this marriage he had several children, including [[Ivan Stephen of Bulgaria|Ivan Stefan]], who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria (r. 1330-1331), Michael who ruled shortly as despot of Vidin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vidin-info.hit.bg/vidinski%20vladeteli%202.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222192151/http://vidin-info.hit.bg/vidinski%20vladeteli%202.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 February 2007|title=Rulers of Vidin|last=|first=|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shishman (son of Michael Shishman)|Shishman]]. By his second marriage to [[Theodora Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria]], a daughter of [[Michael IX Palaiologos]] of Byzantium, Michael Shishman had several children whose names are unknown.

===Notes===

{{Cnote|a|The common usage Michael Shishman is technically inaccurate, as it consists of the name ''Michael'' followed by the patronymic ''Shishman'', i.e., ''Michael [the son of] Shishman''. Contemporary Bulgarian and Byzantine sources show that the emperor reigned under the name ''Michael Asen''. He is also known among historians as ''Michael III Shishman'' or ''Michael III Shishman Asen''.}}

'''Mokomokai''' are the preserved heads of [[Māori people|Māori]], the indigenous people of [[New Zealand]], where the faces have been decorated by [[tā moko]] [[tattoo]]ing.  They became valuable trade items during the [[Musket Wars]] of the early 19th century.

==Moko==
{{Main|Tā moko}}
Moko facial tattoos were traditional in Māori culture until about the mid 19th century when their use began to disappear, although there has been something of a revival from the late 20th century.  In pre-European Māori culture they denoted high social status.  There were generally only men that had full facial moko, though high-ranked women often had moko on their lips and chins.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moko tattoos served as identifying connection between an individual and their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Heritage, Cultural Rights, Cultural Diversity: New Developments in International Law,
 edited by Silvia Borelli, Federico Lenzerini, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Moko marked rites of passage for people of chiefly rank, as well as significant events in their lives.  Each moko was unique and contained information about the person’s rank, tribe, lineage, occupation and exploits.  Moko were expensive to obtain and elaborate moko were usually limited to chiefs and high-ranked warriors.  Moreover, the art of moko, the people who created and incised the designs, as well as the moko themselves, were surrounded by strict [[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] and protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mokomokai==
When someone with moko died, often the [[head]] would be preserved.  The brain and eyes were removed, with all orifices sealed with [[Phormium|flax]] fibre and [[Gum-digger#Uses of kauri gum|gum]].  The head was then boiled or steamed in an oven before being smoked over an open fire and dried in the sun for several days.  It was then treated with [[shark oil]].  Such preserved heads, mokomokai, would be kept by their families in ornately carved boxes and brought out only for sacred ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TeIMoko.html NZETC: Mokomokai: Preserving the past] Accessed 25 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The heads of enemy chiefs killed in battle were also preserved; these mokomokai, being considered [[war trophy|trophies of war]], would be displayed on the [[Marae#Marae in New Zealand|marae]] and mocked.  They were important in diplomatic negotiations between warring tribes, with the return and exchange of mokomokai being an essential precondition for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musket Wars==
{{Main|Musket Wars}}
In the early 19th century, with the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, tribes in contact with European sailors, traders and settlers had access to [[firearm]]s, giving them a military advantage over their neighbours.  This gave rise to the Musket Wars, when other tribes became desperate to acquire firearms too, if only to defend themselves.  During this period of social destabilisation, mokomokai became commercial trade items that could be sold as curios, artworks and as museum specimens which fetched high prices in Europe and America, and which could be bartered for firearms and [[ammunition]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for firearms was such that tribes carried out raids on their neighbours to acquire more heads to trade for them.  They also tattooed slaves and prisoners (though with meaningless motifs rather than genuine moko) in order to provide heads to order.  The peak years of the trade in mokomokai were from 1820 to 1831.  In 1831 the [[Governor of New South Wales]] issued a proclamation banning further trade in heads out of New Zealand, and during the 1830s the demand for firearms diminished because of [[market saturation]].  By 1840 when the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed, and New Zealand became a [[British Empire|British colony]], the export trade in mokomokai had virtually ended, along with a decline in the use of moko in Māori society, although occasional small-scale trade continued for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janes &amp; Conaty (2005), pp.156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Robley collection==
{{Main|Horatio Gordon Robley}}
[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] Horatio Gordon Robley was a British army officer and artist who served in New Zealand during the [[New Zealand land wars]] in the 1860s.  He was interested in [[ethnology]] and fascinated by the art of tattooing as well as being a talented illustrator.  He wrote the classic text on the subject of moko, ''Moko; or Maori Tattooing'', which was published in 1896.  After he returned to England he built up a notable collection of 35–40 mokomokai which he later offered to sell to the New Zealand Government.  When the offer was declined, most of the collection was sold to the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=sst/&gt;

==Repatriation==
More recently there has been a campaign to repatriate to New Zealand the hundreds of mokomokai held in museums and private collections around the world, either to be returned to their relatives or to the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Museum of New Zealand]] for storage, though not display.  It has had some success, though many mokomokai remain overseas and the campaign is ongoing.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4353909a20455.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223000152/http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4353909a20455.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=The trade in preserved Maori heads |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |accessdate=25 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Wellington. 7 April 2000.

'''Moral luck''' describes circumstances whereby a [[moral agent]] is assigned moral [[blame]] or [[praise]] for an action or its consequences even if it is clear that said agent did not have full control over either the action or its consequences. This term, introduced by [[Bernard Williams]], has been developed, along with its significance to a coherent moral theory, by Williams and [[Thomas Nagel]] in their respective essays on the subject.

==Responsibility and voluntarism==
Broadly speaking, human beings tend to correlate, at least [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitively]], responsibility and voluntary action. Thus, the most blame is assigned to persons for their actions and the consequences they [[logical consequence|entail]] when we have good cause to believe that both:
* the action was performed voluntarily and without outside coercion
* the agent understood the full range of the consequences of their decisions and actions, as could have reasonably been foreseen either at or prior to the time that the action was performed.

Conversely, there is a tendency to be much more sympathetic to those who satisfy any of the following conditions:
* the agent was coerced to perform the action
* the agent performed the action through accident and without any fault or negligence of their own
* at the time of their actions, the agent did not know, and had no way of knowing, the consequences that their actions would bring

Parenthetically, the above criteria do not correlate exactly with moral praise – while it may be true that one can, and should assign a good deal of [[moral praise]] to those who had performed a good action, or an action entailing good consequences, completely on their own volition and uncoerced, it is debatable that the same distinction holds for involuntary actions that happened to turn out well or happened to produce good outcomes.

This correlation between responsibility and voluntary action is acceptable to most people on an intuitive level; indeed, this correlation is echoed in American and European law: for this reason, for example, [[manslaughter]], or killing in self-defense carries a significantly different type of legal punishment (i.e., formalized [[moral blame]]) than premeditated murder.

==The problem of moral luck==
Given the notion of equating moral responsibility with voluntary action, however, moral luck leads to counterintuitive solutions. This is illustrated by an example of a traffic accident. Driver A, in a moment of inattention, runs a red light as a child is crossing the street. Driver A tries to avoid hitting the child but fails and the child dies. Driver B also runs a red light, but no one is crossing and only gets a traffic ticket. 

If a bystander is asked to morally evaluate Drivers A and B, they may assign Driver A more moral blame than Driver B because Driver A's course of action resulted in a death. However, there are no differences in the controllable actions performed by Drivers A and B. The only disparity is an external uncontrollable event. If it is given that moral responsibility should only be relevant when the agent voluntarily performed or failed to perform some action, Drivers A and B should be blamed equally. This may be intuitively problematic, as one situation resulted in a death.

==Four types of moral luck==
Thomas Nagel (1979) identified four kinds of moral luck in his essay. The kind most relevant to the above example is "resultant moral luck".

===Resultant moral luck (consequential)===
Resultant moral luck concerns the consequences of actions and situations. In the above example, both drivers were affected by resultant moral luck in that a particular set of circumstances turned out in two different ways: in one situation, a pedestrian appeared on the road; in the other, the pedestrian did not.

===Circumstantial moral luck===
Circumstantial moral luck concerns the surroundings of the moral agent. The best-known example is provided in Nagel's essay. Consider [[Nazism|Nazi]] followers and supporters in [[Hitler]]'s [[Germany]]. They were and are worthy of moral blame either for committing morally reprehensible deeds or for allowing them to occur without making efforts to oppose them. But, if in 1929, those people were moved to some other country, away from the coming hostilities by their employers, it is quite possible that they would have led very different lives, and we could not assign the same amount of moral blame to them. It is down, then, to the luck of the circumstances in which they find themselves.

===Constitutive moral luck===
Constitutive moral luck concerns the personal character of a moral agent. There can be little argument that education, upbringing, genes and other largely uncontrollable influences shape personality to some extent. Furthermore, one's personality dictates one's actions to some extent. Moral blame is assigned to an individual for being extremely selfish, even though that selfishness is almost certainly due in part to external environmental effects.

===Causal moral luck===
Causal moral luck, which equates largely with the problem of [[free will]], is the least-detailed of the varieties that Thomas Nagel describes. The general definition is that actions are determined by external events and are thus consequences of events over which the person taking the action has no control. Since people are restricted in their choice of actions by the events that precede them, they should not be held accountable or responsible for such actions.

Thomas Nagel has been criticized by Dana Nelkin for including causal moral luck as a separate category, since it appears largely redundant. It does not cover any cases that are not already included in constitutive and circumstantial luck, and seems to exist only for the purpose of bringing up the problem of free will.{{sfn|Nelkin|2013}}

==Alternatives==
Some philosophers, such as [[Susan Wolf]], have tried to come up with "happy mediums" that strike a balance between rejecting moral luck outright and accepting it wholesale. Wolf introduced the notions of rationalist and irrationalist positions as part of such a reconciliation.

The rationalist position, stated simply, is that equal fault deserves equal blame. For example, given two drivers, both of whom failed to check their brakes before driving, one of them runs over a pedestrian as a consequence while the other does not. The rationalist would say that since both of the drivers were equally at fault in failing to check their brakes, it should make no difference that one of them was lucky in not hitting a pedestrian while the other was unlucky – moral fault is independent of consequence. Since the fault here is equal, the agents should receive equal blame.

The consequentialist position argues that equal fault need not deserve equal blame, as blame should depend on the consequences. By this logic, the lucky driver certainly does not deserve as much blame as the unlucky driver, even though their faults were identical.

Wolf combines these two approaches in trying to reconcile the tensions associated with moral luck by introducing the concept of a virtuous agent. A virtuous agent should accept that they have a special connection with the consequences of their actions, including equal-fault cases (such as the lucky/unlucky drivers above), and even in no-fault cases. This argument essentially retains the rationalist claim that equal fault is equally deserving of blame while also retaining the consequentialist claim that different outcomes should result in moral agents feeling and acting differently.

It is important to underline the distinction between internal and external moral blame or praise. Wolf believes that the outsiders should blame the lucky and unlucky drivers equally despite their intuition that the two of them should not feel equally bad (i.e., the unlucky driver that ran over a pedestrian should feel worse). ''However'', the unlucky driver themselves should voluntarily accept the notion of the special connection between their actions and the unfortunate consequences, and assign more blame to themselves than the lucky driver should.

He was a 15-year-old juvenile living in a foster home with his [[Foster care|foster parents]] and their children in [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]], [[Utah]], [[United States]].

==Description==
On February 28, 1984, Clatterbuck had some disagreements with the foster parents, resulting in Clatterbuck shooting the foster father 16 times, killing him. He then proceeded to shoot the foster mother several times and stabbed her, resulting in her death. The state decided to prosecute Clatterbuck as an adult.

Clatterbuck was represented by attorney [[Michael D. Esplin]] throughout the juvenile court process where it was determined that he should be tried as an adult in the adult court system. He appealed this determination through the [[Utah Supreme Court]], but his appeal was denied and it was ruled once again that he could be tried as an adult.

The state charged Clatterbuck with capital homicide charges, which carried the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Case Number: 700p.2d1076.&lt;/ref&gt; Esplin represented Clatterbuck in those proceedings, which ultimately resulted in a plea deal, where the death penalty was taken off the table, and Clatterbuck pleaded to two homicide charges resulting in a sentence of 5 to life in the [[Utah State Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corrections.utah.gov|title=Utah Department of Corrections|website=corrections.utah.gov|accessdate=21 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Clatterbuck graduated from high school prison and was named "outstanding student for the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/49118/56-SALUTED-AT-PRISON-GRADUATION-CEREMONY.html|title=56 Saluted at Prison Graduation Ceremony| |last=Van Leer|first=Twila|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=1 Jun 1989|accessdate=8 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jul 89"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6476">'''Pessimism porn''' is a [[neologism]] coined in 2009 during the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]] to describe the alleged [[eschatological]] and [[survivalist]] thrill some people derive from predicting, reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system.  
== Origin ==
[[Pessimism]] porn's coinage is attributed to [[Hugo Lindgren]] when he wrote about the concept in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' in February 2009.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7299825&amp;page=1 Pessimism Porn? Economic Forecasts Get Lurid], Dan Harris, ABC News, April 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mary&gt;''Apocalypse and Post-Politics: The Romance of the End'', Mary Manjikian, Lexington Books, March 15, 2012, {{ISBN|0739166220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schott&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/pessimism-porn/ Pessimism Porn: Titillatingly bleak media reports], Ben Schott, ''New York Times'', February 23, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   Lindgren wrote of the attraction of predicting and planning for economic collapse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like real porn, the economic variety gives you the illusion of control, and similarly it only leaves you hungry for more. But econo-porn also feeds a powerful sense of intellectual vanity. You walk the streets feeling superior to all these heedless knaves who have no clue what’s coming down the pike. By making yourself miserable about the frightful hell that awaits us, you feel better. Pessimism can be bliss too.&lt;ref name=Lindgren&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/53858/ Pessimism Porn: A soft spot for hard times], Hugo Lindgren, ''New York'', February 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The change in programming of news channels to [[infotainment]] has played a role in the spread of pessimism porn.&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505183_162-28541906-10391735/is-pessimism-porn-ruining-your-sales/ Is "Pessimism Porn" Ruining Your Sales?], Geoffrey James, CBS News, March 27, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of news programming designed to put the issues of the day in a context understandable to viewers, stories follow an "if it bleeds it leads" priority that increase people's fear and anxiety followed by advertisements that offer a way to soothe those anxieties, such as ones for companies for [[Gold as an investment|investing in gold]] to hedge against economic collapse.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt;  

[[Thomas P.M. Barnett]], chief analyst at [[Wikistrat]], has criticized apocalyptic predictions for the global economy as problematically short-sighted because "human history is progress, so if you're constantly having to screen out the good to spot the bad, your vision will be unduly narrow....you must consistently discount advances as 'illusions' and 'buying time' and so on, and after a while, you're just this broken clock who's dead-on twice a day".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/04/pessimism-porn/203306/ Pessimism Porn], Andrew Sullivan, ''The Atlantic'', April 10, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Apocalypse and Post-Politics: The Romance of the End'', [[Regent University]] professor Mary Manjikian linked Lindgren's concept of pessimism porn to [[Frank Kermode]]'s "eschatological anxiety", which he wrote about in his landmark ''The Sense of an Ending''.&lt;ref name=Mary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/books/19kermode.html?pagewanted=all Frank Kermode, a Critic Who Wrote With Style, Is Dead at 90], Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, ''New York Times'', September 8, 2010; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   Kermode argued that "worrying about the apocalypse is actually a feature of societies undergoing significant social and technological transitions".&lt;ref name=Mary/&gt;

== Purveyors ==
Purveyors of pessimism porn tend to cite as examples of an approaching economic [[Armageddon]] the scenario of the world, particularly the Chinese, giving up on the dollar as a [[reserve currency]]; movements such as [[Occupy Wall Street]]; and the collapse of the [[European Union]] and the [[Euro]].&lt;ref name=Lindgren/&gt;&lt;ref name=USA&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/stocks/story/2012-02-26/stock-market-bears-doomsayers/53259742/1 3 doomsaying experts who foresee economic devastation ahead], Adam Shell, USA TODAY, February 27, 2012; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   Mainstream economists usually disregard the [[econometrics]] of people who forecast the collapse of society and the need to resort to [[survivalism]] because of what they perceive as the imminent end of the western financial model.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;  

Lindgren cited the blog [[Calculated Risk]] as a "reliable turn-on" for its author's knack for writing about the dangers of plummeting rates for various goods, such as [[commercial paper]].&lt;ref name=Schott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindgren/&gt;  [[Peter Schiff]] and trend forecaster [[Gerald Celente]] were singled out by [[ABC News]] as purveyors of pessimism porn.  Celente has predicted that in 2012 the United States will see food riots, shantytowns in [[Central Park]] and "economic martial law", and that the only protections from the chaos to come are "the three g's—gold, guns and a get-away plan".&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindgren/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2011/11/17/talk-show-host-alex-jones-guest-call-for-run-on-banks/ Talk Show Host Alex Jones &amp; Guest Call For Run On Banks], Kenneth Rapoza, ''Forbes'', November 17, 2011; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alex Pareene]] called [[Nouriel Roubini]] the "[[Joe Francis]] of Pessimism Porn" for writing multiple doomsday columns for major publications, including a February 2009 column in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' declaring that unless the U.S. government seized and nationalized all banks the system would collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/5153314/the-joe-francis-of-pessimism-porn The Joe Francis of Pessimism Porn], Alex Pareene, Gawker, February 13, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/02/12/ST2009021203365.html Nationalize the Banks! We're all Swedes Now], Matthew Richardson and Nouriel Roubini, ''Washington Post'', February 15, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo foot|'''''Pokémon Emerald Version'''''|ポケットモンスター エメラルド|Poketto Monsutā Emerarudo|"Pocket Monsters: Emerald"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It was first released in Japan in 2004, and was later internationally released in 2005. It is an enhanced version of [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and is part of the third generation of the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' video game series]].

The gameplay and controls are mostly unchanged from previous games in the series; players control a [[Pokémon trainer]] from an [[overhead perspective]]. As with previous games, the player's general goal is to traverse the [[Hoenn]] region and conquer a series of eight [[Pokémon]] gyms in order to challenge the [[Elite Four]] and its champion, while the main subplot is to defeat two criminal organizations attempting to harness a legendary Pokémon's power for their own goals. Along with Pokémon that debuted in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', the game incorporated Pokémon from [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] not featured in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' in the post-game.

''Emerald''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s reception was generally positive upon release.

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay in ''Emerald'' is largely the same as it was in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Much of the game takes place in an overhead style; players' characters can move in four directions and can talk to other people on the overworld. Players can encounter wild Pokémon by walking into grass, surfing on their Pokémon, walking through caves, and other means. They can also fight other trainers' Pokémon. When this happens, the game shifts to a battle screen where players and their Pokémon are seen on the front-left portion of the screen while opponents are viewed on the back-right portion. Stats of the Pokémon and their trainers are shown on the side of each participant; these stats include the Pokémon's levels, the trainers' Pokémon number (which can be anywhere between one and six), the Pokémon's health, and any status effects (such as poison, paralysis, burn, sleep, and freeze). Trainers send out the first Pokémon in their party and they take turns attacking where the first strike is determined usually by the speed of the two Pokémon. Players can choose from one of four options: Fight, Bag, Switch, and Run. Each Pokémon has 1-4 different moves that they can use, which have different effects, number of uses, and types (such as Grass, Psychic, etc.). When a Pokémon hits 0 HP, they faint, forcing the Pokémon's trainer to switch out. Once one trainer runs out of Pokémon, the battle is ended. When a human-controlled Pokémon wins a battle, the Pokémon gains experience. Enough experience will earn that Pokémon a higher level, which grants upgraded stats (which includes attack, speed, defense, special attack, special defense, and health) and sometimes grant new moves.

Certain battles allow for two-on-two combat; certain moves were designed to support partners while other moves are capable of attacking two or more Pokémon. Unlike ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' which had you fight two specific trainers, ''Emerald'' allowed for you to have a 2-on-2 battle with two trainers both of whom you could usually battle separately. Every Pokémon has an ability that often aides in battle, such as abilities that make a Pokémon more powerful if they are close to fainting. Wild Pokémon encountered by players can be captured using items called Poké Balls, which have a greater chance of success the weaker the wild Pokémon is. Players can battle and trade with other players by linking their copies of ''Emerald'' with other Game Boy Advance games (which include ''Ruby'', ''Sapphire'', [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'', and ''LeafGreen'']]). This can be accomplished either by using a Game Boy Advance link cable or by use of the wireless adapter that was bundled with ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''. It is also compatible with ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]''. This allows players to trade for Pokémon not normally obtained in ''Emerald''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pokemon Emerald Retail Hands-On |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-emerald-retail-hands-on/1100-6123210/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |last=Massimilla |first=Bethany |date=2006-04-28 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ultimate Pokémon Adventure For Nintendo GameCube Arrives On 18th November 2005 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-ultimate-pokeacutemon-adventure-for-nintendo-gamecube-arrives-on-18th-november-2005 |work=Games Industry.biz |date=2005-08-30 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the traditional battle and overworld style, players' Pokémon are able to participate in Pokémon Contests where they can try and win in five different contest categories: "Cool", "Beauty", "Cute", "Smart", and "Tough" competitions. The players' characters are given a device early on called the PokéNav, which allows players to view the world map, check their Pokémon's contest stats, and make and receive phone calls with trainers that they have met with whom they can chat or plan a battle. This replaces a function called "Trainer's Eyes", which allows players to register certain trainers and see when they are in the mood to battle. This also allows players to rebattle Gym Leaders, an ability not found in previous Pokémon games. ''Emerald'' includes several other new features and changes. It includes animations of Pokémon in-battle (which was not present in ''Ruby'' or ''Sapphire'') and an area called the Battle Frontier. It is an expansion of the Battle Tower found in previous games. A man whom players encounter several times throughout the game will eventually allow them to access the Battle Frontier after beating the Pokémon League Champion. The Battle Frontier features the aforementioned Battle Tower in addition to six new areas. Completing these areas awards players with "Battle Points" which can be spent on prizes to use in and out of battle. The Japanese version featured compatibility with the [[Nintendo e-Reader]]; however, this was cut for the English release due to its lack of success. ''Emerald'' features the Trainer Hill area which, in the Japanese version, is compatible with the e-Reader.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref name="gsreader"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nintendo reveals new WarioWare Inc. |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-new-warioware-inc/1100-6104102/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=2004-08-04 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare Pokémon that originated from earlier ''Pokémon'' games such as [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]], [[Lugia]], and [[Ho-Oh]] were made available through an in-game event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=15 Amazing Pokémon Facts and Secrets |url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/42565/15-amazing-pokemon-facts-and-secrets/?page=2 |work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] |last=Zablotny |first=Marc |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Setting and plot ==
The setting and plot remains largely the same as [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. Players can choose between either a boy or girl, both of whom have been given new outfits with a green color scheme, and one of three Pokémon before they proceed from their hometown into the rest of the game's world. 

Players are tasked with filling their [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokédex|Pokédex]] by catching different Pokémon species and evolving them. They are also tasked to complete eight gym challenges and defeat the Elite Four and its champion by battling their Pokémon. Along the way, they make two rivals: May/Brendan, the child of the Pokémon Professor Birch, and Wally, a sickly child from Petalburg who the player assists in catching his first Pokémon, a Ralts. They also encounter Steven, the Hoenn Region's Champion.

Along their journey they face both Team Magma and Team Aqua, who originally could only be faced in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', respectively. Both have a goal to change the world they believe will benefit Pokémon—Magma desiring to expand the landmass and Aqua desiring to expand the sea—and both plan to accomplish their respective goals by summoning the legendary Pokémon [[Groudon]] and [[Kyogre]]. Both teams make repeated efforts to alter the landscape. Team Magma attempts to make a volcano erupt and Team Aqua tries to steal a weather-altering Pokémon. 

Between the player's visit to the seventh and eighth gyms, both teams summon their respective legendary Pokémon with mystical orbs stolen from Mt. Pyre; however, the Pokémon refuse to obey either team and begin fighting, which puts the world in a constantly switching state of droughts and heavy rainfalls. The player climbs a tower in order to summon the legendary Pokémon [[Rayquaza]], who quells the other two Pokémon's rage.

After the player beats the Elite Four, they are able to encounter two Pokémon flying across Hoenn called [[Latias and Latios]], and can access an area called the Battle Frontier, which adds several new challenges for the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Emerald Version|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344|website=IGN|accessdate=11 July 2014|ref=ignemerald|quote=A new Battle Frontier area has you play through seven big battles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gsdetails"/&gt;

''Emerald'' was developed by [[Game Freak]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]].

Nintendo has done several promotions related to ''Emerald''. Nintendo held a competition for players based on ''Emerald'' where players compete to be the "''Pokémon Emerald'' Ultimate Frontier Battle Brain". The competition took place in seven areas across the United States and Canada, where 14 finalists (two from each area) competed in [[Seattle, Washington]]'s [[Space Needle]] for a trip for two to the Pokémon Park in [[Nagoya, Japan]]. People could also enter to win a trip to the Space Needle to watch the competition. The competition centered around trivia about characters from Pokémon and their abilities.&lt;ref name="nwr2"&gt;{{cite web |title=POKÉMON EMERALD PUTS PLAYERS ON THE PATH TO THE EMERALD CITY |url=https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/pr/10384 |work=Nintendo World Report |date=2005-03-15 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nwr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top Pokemon Trainers Take over Seattle's Space Needle: the Emerald City Battle Tower |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/10485 |work=Nintendo World Report |last=Castaneda |first=Karl |date=2005-04-25 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo also introduced a pre-order program that would give those who pre-ordered the game exclusive access to a ''Pokémon'' website, a collector's tin holder, and a guide to the Battle Frontier.&lt;ref name="nwr2"/&gt; A limited edition [[Game Boy Advance SP]] was released by Nintendo which featured a silhouette of the Pokémon [[Rayquaza]].

'''Public humiliation''' or '''public shaming''' is a form of [[punishment]] whose main feature is [[Dishonor|dishonoring]] or disgracing a person, usually an offender or a [[prisoner]], especially in a public place. It was regularly used as a form of judicially sanctioned punishment in previous centuries, and is still practiced by different means in the modern era.

In the United States, it was a common punishment from the beginning of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] through the 19th century.  It fell out of common use in the 20th century, though it has seen a revival starting in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-04-12/news/0004120235_1_unusual-punishment-humiliation-sentencing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shameful exposure ==
[[File:Edmondaviv2014.jpg|thumb|A man (Edmond Aviv) sits down in punishment, sentenced by judge, holding up a sign that says he was a [[Bullying|bully]] for bullying children with disabilities.]]


Public humiliation exists in many forms. Most often a criminal was placed in the center of town and having the local populace enact a form of "[[mob justice]]" on the individual. [[File:Flute of Shame Torture Museum Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Flute of Shame displayed at the [[Torture museum|Torture Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].]]

The punishment of public humiliation could be, amongst other things, an offender being forced to relate his crime, such as by exaggerated physical parody: a 'shame [[flute]]' for a bad musician or wearing a giant [[rosary]] ({{lang-nl|schandstenen}}, "stones of shame") for someone late to church. The offender could alternatively be sentenced to remain exposed in a specific public place, in a restraining device.

In the [[Netherlands|Low Countries]], the {{lang|nl|schandstoel}} ("Chair of shame"), the {{lang|nl|kaak}} or {{lang|nl|schandpaal}} ("pole of shame", a simple type of [[pillory]]), the {{lang|nl|draaikooi}} were customary for [[Adultery|adulteresses]], and the {{lang|nl|schopstoel}}, a [[scaffold]]ing from which one is kicked off to land in [[mud]] and dirt.

In the more extreme cases being subjected to [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] from the crowd, which could have serious consequences especially when the hands are not free to protect himself. Some sentences actually prescribe additional humiliation, such as shaving, or combine it with painful corporal punishments, see below.&lt;ref name="williamsburg"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm | title=Bilboes, Brands, and Branks: Colonial Crimes and Punishments | author=Cox, James | journal=Colonial Williamsburg Journal |date=Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colonial America]], common forms of public humiliation were the [[stocks]] and [[pillory]], imported from [[Europe]]. Nearly every sizable town had such instruments of public humiliation, usually at the town square. Historic public humiliation displays can still be seen in the historic [[Virginia]] town of [[Colonial Williamsburg]].[[File:Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan, around 1860.]]In pre–World War Japan, [[adulterer]]s were publicly exposed purely to shame them.

In post-Colonial times, judicial use of public humiliation punishment has largely fallen out of favor since the practice is now considered [[cruel and unusual punishment]], which is outlawed in the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="ziel"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/jpl/papers/v19n2_Paul_Ziel.pdf | title=Eighteenth Century Public Humiliation Penalties in Twenty-First Century America: The 'Shameful' Return of 'Scarlet Letter' Punishments in ''U.S. v.

In [[Thailand|Siam]], an adulteress was paraded with a [[hibiscus]] behind the ear. Thieves were tattooed on their faces. Other criminals were paraded with a device made of woven cane on the forehead, or lengths of bamboo hung around the neck. Errant Brahmans had to wear a string of oversize beads.

Just like painful forms of corporal punishment, it has parallels in educational and other rather private punishments (but with some audience), in school or domestic disciplinary context, and as a [[rite of passage]]. Physical forms include being forced to wear some sign such as "donkey ears" (simulated in paper, as a sign one is—or at least behaved—proverbially stupid), wearing a [[dunce cap]], having to stand, kneel or bend over in a corner, or repeatedly write something on a blackboard ("I will not spread rumors", for example). Here different levels of physical discomfort can be added, such as having to hold heavy objects, go barefoot (see below) or kneel on an uneven surface. Like physical punishment and harsh hazing, these have become controversial in most modern societies, in many cases leading to legal restrictions and/or (sometimes voluntary) abolishment.[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-041-10, Paris, der Kollaboration beschuldigte Französinnen.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Paris 1944: French women accused of collaboration with Nazis had their heads shaved and were paraded through the streets barefoot.]]Having the [[Head shaving|head shaved]] can be a humiliating punishment prescribed in law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wluml.org/node/3908 ''"Article 87 ... shall be sentenced to flogging, having his head shaven, and one year of exile..."''], The Islamic Penal Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt; but also something done as "mob justice" - a stark example of which was the thousands of European women who had their heads shaved in front of cheering crowds in the wake of World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antony Beevor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war |title="An Ugly Carnival" |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Shorn Women: Gender and Punishment in Liberation France", {{ISBN|978-1-85973-584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for associating with occupying [[Nazism|Nazis]] during the war.[[File:Slave dance to banjo, 1780s.jpg|thumb|Modern era slaves typically had to go barefoot by regulation in slave codes (colonial United States, 1780s).]]Forcing people to go [[barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery|barefoot]] has been used as a relatively effortless and more subtle form of humiliation in most past and present civilized cultures, primarily using the visual contrast to the standard form of appearance while also creating some level of physical discomfort.

It usually also causes a considerable degree of humiliation, as this noticeable detail typically sets the prisoner apart from spectators visually and demonstrates the person's vulnerability and general powerlessness.

Further means of public humiliation and degradation consist in forcing people to wear typifying clothes, which can be penitential garbs or [[prison uniform]]s.

Presenting arrestees or prisoners to the public in restraints (such as [[handcuffs]], [[legcuffs|shackles]] or similar devices) also serves as a convenient{{how|date=September 2017}} method of public humiliation besides the primary security aspects. The effect is complemented by presenting the person in a prison uniform or similar clothing.{{example needed}}

== Corporal punishment ==
[[File:Antoin Sevruguin 12 Falak Whipping the soles of a criminal.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Public [[foot whipping]] in Iran]]
[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Public [[flagellation]] in Russia, 18th century.]]
[[File:Pelourinho.jpg|thumb|Public flogging in Brazil, [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]]]]
Apart from specific methods essentially aiming at humiliation, several methods combine pain and humiliation or even death and humiliation. In some cases, pain or at least discomfort is insignificant or rather secondary to the humiliation.

=== Public punishment ===
The simplest is to administer painful [[corporal punishment]] in public - the major aim may be [[deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] of potential offenders - so the public will witness the perpetrator's fear and agony. This can either take place in a [[town square]] or other public gathering location such as a school, or take the form of a procession through the streets. This was not uncommon in the sentences to ''Staupenschlag'' (whipping or [[birching]], generally on the bare [[buttocks]]) in various [[German language|German-speaking]] states, till the 19th century. A naval equivalent was [[Cat o' nine tails#Flogging round the fleet|Flogging round the fleet]] on a raft taken from ship to ship for consecutive installments of a great total of lashes, that could even be lethal. In some countries the punishment of [[foot whipping]] is executed in public to this day.

*The humiliation as well as degradation is generally intensified if the perpetrator is unclothed (partially or entirely) as the exposure leaves the person feeling vulnerable and helpless. A common and simple form of humiliating exposure consists in taking away a person's shoes and keeping him or her [[barefoot]] during corporal punishment or generally.
*Further means of intensifying the public humiliation and degradation especially during punishment consist in forcing people to wear typifying clothes, which can be [[prison uniform]]s or in former times penitential garbs or rags, further incremented in combination with an exposure aspect such as bare feet.
*Even when not strictly public, humiliation can still be a psychologically "painful" aspect of punishment because of the presence of witnessing peers (such as fellow prisoners), staff or other onlookers, or simply because the person administering the punishment is witnessing the reactions of the culprit. The loss of self-control in the presence of bystanders further increments the humiliating effect of the punishment significantly. This is also true for punishments in class and similar situations.
*[[Crucifixion]] was used by the Romans to add public humiliation to a [[death penalty]]. [[Josephus]] describes how the Roman soldiers would crucify people naked, and using different tortuous positions as a way to further humiliate them. Crucified bodies were left to decay on the cross for weeks, and crows would come to feed on the corpses; this can be seen as post-mortem public humiliation. See also [[gibbeting]].
&lt;!--*{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}Public shaving was also applied to (true or alleged) collaborators after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied liberated]] occupied territories from the [[Storm Troopers|Nazi troops]]; being thus marked, they would remain in danger from [[molestation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}--&gt;

=== Torture marks ===
[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|The 1774 [[tarring and feathering]] of British customs agent [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] soon after the [[Boston Tea Party]] ]]

The humiliation can be extended; intentionally or not; by leaving visible marks, such as [[scar]]s, notably on body parts that are normally left visible. This also serves as a virtually indelible criminal record. This can even be the main intention of the punishment, as in the case of [[scarification]]s, such as [[branding persons|branding]]. It invariably is essential in forms of mutilation, such as [[cropping (punishment)|ear cropping]], though the functional loss is even greater; pain may even be intentionally minimized as in the case of surgical amputation, eliminating the risk of accidental death. [[Tarring and feathering]] also serves as means of extended humiliation.

== Psychological effects ==
{{main|Humiliation#Psychological effects}}
Public shaming can result in negative psychological effects and devastating consequences, regardless of the punishment being justifiable or not. It could cause depression, suicidal thoughts and other severe mental problems. The humiliated individuals may develop a variety of symptoms including apathy, paranoia, anxiety, PTSD, etc. The rage and fury may arise in the persecuted individual, themselves lashing out against innocent victims, as they seek revenge or as a means of release.

In 1145, he went to fight the [[Almohads]], under the leadership of [[Abd al-Mu'min]], in the [[Oran]] area. He was besieged for several days by the Almohad forces and finally opted for escaping by sea. He subsequently called on a fleet from [[Almeria]], burned his military encampment and while trying to join the port by night on horseback, he fell off a cliff and died in March 1145.&lt;ref name="ibn khaldun"/&gt; He was succeeded first by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Tashfin]], who was still an infant, and soon after by his brother [[Ishaq ibn Ali]].

'''Grief Recovery Institute Educational Foundation''' ('''GRIEF''') is a [[501(c)(3) organization]] specializing in helping people with [[grief]] issues. The organization is headquartered in [[Sherman Oaks, California]], with locations in [[Canada]], [[England]], and [[Sweden]]. Its mission focuses on disseminating information about grief and the possibility of recovery from the impact of death, divorce, and other significant emotional losses.

Members of the institute have appeared on [[CNN]] and other broadcast networks to help people understand emotional responses to national and international grief events – notably, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001; when [[Andrea Yates]] drowned her five children; and during the [[Ronald Reagan]] memorial week.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} They have also conducted hundreds of print and radio interviews relative to chronicling events like the death of [[Princess Diana]] and other [[celebrities]]; plane crashes; and natural disasters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The organization donated 1500 copies of James and Friedman’s books, ''The Grief Recovery Handbook'' and ''When Children Grieve'', to the families directly affected by the 9/11 attacks, and donated 2500 copies of ''When Children Grieve'' to the school districts in [[Texas]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]] that took in thousands of children displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina|Hurricanes Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]].&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-81567340.html Institute Donates Recovery Books As Emotional Rebuilding Begins]{{dead|fix-attempted=yes|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead|fix-attempted=yes|date=August 2016}}

The institute also trains and certifies [[mental illness|mental]] and medical health professionals, funeral directors, [[clergy]], and others in the application of the principles and actions that help grieving people. After completing the training, certificants take groups of individuals through a 12-week outreach program. More than 500,000 people have completed the program.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

'''Transcranial random noise stimulation''' ('''tRNS''') is a non-invasive [[neurostimulation|brain stimulation technique]] and a form of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). Terney et al from [[Göttingen University]] was the first group to apply tRNS in humans in 2008. They showed that by using an [[alternate current]] along with random amplitude and frequency (between 0.1 and 640&amp;nbsp;Hz) in healthy subjects, the [[motor cortex]] excitability increased (i.e. increased amplitude of [[motor evoked potentials]]) for up to 60 minutes after 10 minutes of stimulation. The study included all the frequencies up to half of the [[sampling rate]] (1280 samples/s) i.e. 640&amp;nbsp;Hz, however the positive effect was limited only to higher frequencies. Although tRNS has shown positive effects in various studies the optimal parameters, as well as the potential clinical effects of this technique, remain unclear.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=sV1zAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=transcranial%20random%20noise&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Stimulated Brain: Cognitive Enhancement Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation|first=Roi Cohen|last=Kadosh|date=1 June 2014|publisher=Elsevier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of tRNS are not well known,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; however many hypotheses have been suggested.
The robust changes in cortical excitability observed after tRNS could be attributed to the repeated opening of [[sodium channels]] or to the increased sensitivity of neuronal networks to modulation. tRNS may influence cortical oscillations, leading to changes in excitability. These proposed mechanisms are consistent with the observation that reversing electrode polarities in tRNS does not interfere with the augmentation in cortical excitability, suggesting that tRNS-induced cortical excitability is independent of current flow direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES - tDCS; tRNS, tACS) methods|first=Walter|last=Paulus|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|journal=Neuropsychol Rehabil|volume=21|issue=5|pages=602–617|doi=10.1080/09602011.2011.557292|pmid=21819181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since tRNS is a repetitive, random, and subthreshold stimulation, it is speculated that tRNS induces direct [[temporal summation]] of neural activity because the time constant of a neuron is sufficiently long to permit the summation of two stimuli presented in close succession.

The effects of tRNS may also be explained in the context of the [[stochastic resonance]] phenomenon. tRNS is, by definition, a stimulation that induces non-finalized random activity in the system (i.e., noise). The presence of neuronal noise might enhance the sensitivity of the neurons to a given range of weak inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modelling non-invasive brain stimulation in cognitive neuroscience|first1=Carlo|last1=Miniussi|first2=Justin A.|last2=Harris|first3=Manuela|last3=Ruzzoli|date=1 September 2013|publisher=|journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev|volume=37|issue=8|pages=1702–1712|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.06.014|pmid=23827785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other tES techniques==
[[File:Fnhum-07-00435-g001.jpg|thumb|While tDCS uses constant current intensity, tRNS and tACS use oscillating current. The vertical axis represents the current intensity in milliamp (mA), while the horizontal axis illustrates the time-course.]]
Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) generally includes the following techniques:
*[[Transcranial alternating current stimulation]] (tACS)
*[[Transcranial direct current stimulation]] (tDCS)
*Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)
*[[Transcranial pulsed current stimulation]] (tPCS)

tRNS stimulation differs from tDCS in that instead of constant direct current delivery, current levels are ''randomly'' generated, with a [[normal distribution]] around a specific mean intensity. Other parameters related to the stimulation electrodes, like position and size, are similar to tDCS.
Compared to tDCS, tRNS has also the advantage of being more comfortable, which makes it potentially advantageous for setting and [[blinded experiment|blinding studies]].
tRNS is easier to blind than tDCS with the 50% perception threshold for tDCS at 400 µA while this threshold was at 1200 µA in the case of tRNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cutaneous perception thresholds of electrical stimulation methods: comparison of tDCS and tRNS|first1=Géza Gergely|last1=Ambrus|first2=Walter|last2=Paulus|first3=Andrea|last3=Antal|date=1 November 2010|publisher=|journal=Clin Neurophysiol|volume=121|issue=11|pages=1908–1914|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2010.04.020|pmid=20471313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) is a frequency-specific stimulation method that is also thought to influence oscillatory neuronal activity. This method differs from tRNS in that a [[sinusoidal]] current is applied at a fixed frequency rather than a randomly presented range of frequencies. Often, tACS is applied at frequencies that mirror the predominant frequency bands observed in [[EEG]] in different regions of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=aAIXDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=transcranial%20random%20noise&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Rethinking Cognitive Enhancement|first1=Ruud ter|last1=Meulen|first2=Ahmed|last2=Mohammed|first3=Wayne|last3=Hall|date=2 March 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the so-called Solomon technique or dichorionization in fetoscopic laser therapy for TTTS is proven to be beneficial in preventing post-laser TAPS.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} With this technique, not only all anastomoses are coagulated but also a line is drawn between those in order to coagulate anastomoses that might not (yet) be visible during fetoscopy.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} It should be stressed that the success of such a technique is highly dependent on the specific situation.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} For example, when one of the fetusses obstructs the view on the vascular equator (the part of the placenta where the anastomoses need to be coagulated), complete dichorionization by the Solomon technique might not be possible.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

'''Victor Sen Yung''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:揚|揚]][[wikt:森|森]]|s=扬森|first=t|p=Yáng Sēn|j=Joeng4 Sam1}}; October 18, 1915 – November 9, 1980)&lt;ref name="State Journal"/&gt; , born Sen Yew Cheung&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950958/bio |title= Victor Sen Yung: Biography |last=Brumburgh |first=Gary |website=IMDB (Internet Movie Database)|publisher=IMDB.com, Inc. |access-date=17 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, was an American [[character actor]], best known for playing Jimmy Chan in the [[Charlie Chan]] films and [[Hop Sing]] in the western series ''[[Bonanza]]''. He was born in [[San Francisco, California]] to Gum Yung Sen and his first wife, both immigrants from China.&lt;ref&gt;His father's name is given in the dedication to the ''Great Wok Cookbook''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When his mother died during the [[1918 flu pandemic|flu epidemic]] of 1919, his father placed Victor and his younger sister, Rosemary, in a children's shelter, and returned to his homeland to seek another wife. His father returned in 1922, with his new wife Lovi Shee, once again forming a household with his two children.&lt;ref&gt;''United States Census, 1930'', Household of Gum Young Sen, San Francisco (Districts 251-409), San Francisco, California. NARA Publication: T626, roll 209; Enumeration District Number: 0393; Family Number: 584; Sheet Number and Letter: 30B; Line Number: 59&lt;/ref&gt; During his acting career, Victor was given billing under a variety of names, including '''Sen Yung''', '''Sen Young''', '''Victor Sen Young''', and '''Victor Young'''.

==Career==
{{one source|section|date=March 2017}}
Sen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1938 film ''Charlie Chan in Honolulu'', as the Chinese detective's "number two son," Jimmy Chan. In this movie, [[Sidney Toler]] replaced the recently deceased [[Warner Oland]] as [[Charlie Chan]] and Sen Yung replaced Oland's "number one son" Lee, who had been played by [[Keye Luke]]. Sen Yung played Jimmy Chan in 10 Charlie Chan films between 1938 and 1942. He played the crucial role of lawyer's clerk Ong Chi Seng alongside [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (1940).

In common with other [[Chinese American|Chinese-American]] actors, Sen Yung was cast in [[Japanese people|Japanese]] parts during World War II, such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 [[Humphrey Bogart]] film ''[[Across the Pacific]]''.

During World War II, he joined the U.S. [[Army Air Forces]]. During his military service, he was replaced in the Charlie Chan series by [[Benson Fong]], who played "number three son", Tommy Chan. Yung's military service included work in training films at the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] and a role in the Army Air Forces' play and film ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''San Antonio Light'', September 29, 1944, p. 8-C&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Sen Yung resumed his [[Hollywood]] career. The Charlie Chan series was now in the hands of [[Monogram Pictures]], with Sidney Toler continuing in the leading role. Toler's health was failing by 1946; author [[Scott MacGillivray]] contends that Monogram was conserving Toler's energy and shooting around him wherever possible, even reusing two-year-old footage to finish Toler's last film. To relieve the burden on Toler, Monogram hired his original screen foil, Sen Yung (now billing himself as Victor Sen Young). He and [[Mantan Moreland]] shared the spotlight in Toler's final two films, ''Shadows over Chinatown'' and ''The Trap''.

Following Toler's death in 1947, Victor Sen Young continued to work in motion pictures but also moved into television, playing affable or earnest Asian characters. He is probably best remembered as [[Hop sing|Hop Sing]], the cook on the long-running television series ''[[Bonanza]]'', appearing in 102 episodes between 1959 and 1973.

Sen Yung was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner, Quong Kee,  in [[Tombstone, Arizona]], in the 1957 episode, "Quong Kee", of the [[Television syndication|syndicated television]] [[anthology series]], ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]]. In the story line, an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother, played by Mary Newton, with the saloon musician Ann Bailey ([[Eugenia Paul]]), who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs. Art Gresham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556712/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_52|title=Quong Kee on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef. He frequently appeared on cooking programs, and authored ''[[The Great Wok Cookbook]]'' in 1974.

==Plane hijacking==
In 1972, Yung was on [[Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 710]], which was hijacked. The FBI stormed the plane, and in the ensuing gunfire Sen Yung was shot in the small of the back. He and another wounded passenger survived, but a third passenger and the two hijackers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ada Evening News'', July 6, 1972, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he appeared on [[Garry Moore]]'s ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' show and related the events of the hijacking. With Yung dressed in a sport coat and flanked by two dissimilar imposters, none of the four panelists was able to choose him as the character actor.

==Death and Legacy==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}
Victor Sen Yung died under unusual circumstances in his [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] home in 1980. The actor, who ran a small mail-order Chinese pottery business, was creating clayware and curing the items with an oven, and died of natural gas poisoning from a gas leak.  His body was found November 10, but he had reportedly been dead at least ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19801110&amp;id=1WFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vVgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7125,2598510&amp;hl=en | title='Bonanza's' Hop Sing found dead | date=November 10, 1980 | work=Evening Independent | location=[[St. Petersburg, Florida]] | page=11-A | accessdate=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports suggested at first that the actor had been murdered,&lt;ref&gt;''Valley Independent'', November 11, 1980, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; but police ultimately ruled the death accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Indiana (Pennsylvania) ''Gazette'', November 10, 1980, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a memorial scholarship named after him, awarded each year by the Chinese Alumni Association of his alma mater, [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he had majored in [[animal husbandry]]. The eulogy at his funeral was delivered by fellow ''Bonanza'' actor [[Pernell Roberts]], who also paid the funeral expenses.

The '''Western Cape 2012 Farm Workers' strike''' was a wave of strikes and protests by agricultural workers in the Western Cape from 27 August 2012 to the 22 January 2013.  The events led the deaths of 3 workers, R160 million in damages as well as a 52% increase in the official minimum wage.  The protests mostly took place the towns of [[De Doorns]] and [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]]&lt;ref name="OneYearOn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-10-28-western-cape-farm-strikes-one-year-on-still-a-political-football/#.VhkhMvmqpBd | title=Western Cape farm strikes: one year on, still a political football | publisher=Daily Maverick | date=28 October 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2015 | author=Davis, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; with smaller protests in [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]], [[Robertson, Western Cape|Robertson]], [[Grabouw]],&lt;ref name="doorns1yearlater"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/de-doorns-protests-one-year-later-1.1601628#.VhQqvvmqpBd | title=De Doorns protests: One year later | publisher=Cape Argus | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2015 | author=Daneel Knoetze}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolseley, Western Cape|Wolseley]] and [[Villiersdorp]].&lt;ref name="Doornsquiet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/labour/2013/01/14/de-doorns-quiet-as-farm-workers-await-word-from-unions | title=De Doorns quiet as farm workers await word from unions | publisher=Business Day | date=14 January 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2015 | author=Vecchiatto, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Villiersdorp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/labour/2013/01/14/farm-strike-violence-targets-villiersdorp | title=Farm strike violence targets Villiersdorp | publisher=Business Day | date=14 January 2013 | accessdate=5 October 2015 | author=PAUL VECCHIATTO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of the strikes was low worker pay of R69 (roughly US$8.54 in 2012) per day and high unemployment.&lt;ref name="OneYearOn" /&gt;

== Initial protests in 2012 ==
The protests began on a farm near [[De Doorns]] on 27 August 2012 when a group of largely female workers walked off the job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amandlapublishers.co.za/blog/1614-fire-in-the-vineyards-the-making-of-a-farm-worker-uprising-in-the-hex-river-valley Fire in the Vineyards: The Making of a Farm Worker Uprising in the Hex River Valley], by Chris Webb, ''Amandla'', 8 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It then spread to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-11-16-00-leaderless-farm-strike-is-organic Leaderless farm strike is 'organic'], Sean Christie, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 16  November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as 'organic' and organised by workers without mediation by political parties, trade unions or NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-11-16-00-leaderless-farm-strike-is-organic Leaderless farm strike is 'organic'], Sean Christie, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 16  November&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WhoBehind"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/who-is-behind-de-doorns-strike-1.1421842#.VhLFR_mqpBc | title=Who is behind De Doorns strike? | publisher=Cape Times | date=12 November 2012 | accessdate=5 October 2015 | author=Caryn Dolley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was finally called off on 4 December 2012.&lt;ref name="dailymaverick.co.za"&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-12-05-western-cape-winelands-the-strikes-over-nothings-solved Western Cape winelands: The strike's over, nothing's solved], Benjamin Fogel, ''The Daily Maverick'', 5 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'' "the fact that the protests spread so fast after decades of quiescence shocked the country."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-11-16-00-editorial-farm-workers-deserve-better Farm workers deserve better], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', Editorial'', 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the strike was, in part, inspired by the [[Marikana miners' strike]] which took place earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahala.co.za/reality/notes-from-a-farmworkers-strike/ Notes from a Farmworkers Strike], by Ben Fogel, ''Mahala'', 7 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Three protesters were killed during the strike amidst widespread claims of [[police brutality]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-01-23-farmworkers-strike-may-be-over-but-everyones-a-loser Farmworkers' strike may be over – but everyone's a loser], Rebecca Davis, 23 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and intimidation of workers to join the strikes.&lt;ref name="AnarchyinDeD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/anarchy-in-de-doorns-1.1423333#.VhLFXfmqpBc | title=Anarchy in De Doorns | publisher=Cape Argus | date=14 November 2012 | accessdate=5 October 2015 | author=Murray Williams, Daneel Knoetze and Sapa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of Protest===

The strike mostly included road blockades, stoning of police, and burning vineyards but also included the intimidation of non-striking workers and damage to property (both agricultural as well as urban).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-11-16-western-cape-protests-calmer-day-thicker-plot Western Cape protests: calmer day, thicker plot], Rebecca Davis, ''The Daily Maverick'', 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The police reported that shops were also looted.&lt;ref name="doorns1yearlater" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/local-news?oid=353076&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=146826&amp;Western-Cape-farm-worker-protests-continue Farmers should decide workers' fate – Agri SA], ''The Citizen'', 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence===

==Role of COSATU==

On 14 November [[COSATU]] announced that the strike was suspended but workers continued with their strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/1491 The Farm Workers' Strike: It's Far From Over], by Anna Majavu, ''SACSIS'', 15 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-11-16-why-the-farmworkers-defied-cosatu Cape winelands: Why the farmworkers defied Cosatu], Jared Sacks, ''Daily Maverick'' 16 November&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, most farmworkers remained on strike. This led to a split between the Food and Allied Workers Union (FAWU), which is affiliated with COSATU, and the leadership of COSATU in the Western Cape with the former opting to support the farmworkers in defying COSATU's agreement with government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/26-held-over-de-doorns-strike-1.1425218#.UKau4RLJX_g Twenty Six held over De Doorns strike], ''Cape Argus'' 16 November&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Daily Maverick]]'', Cosatu did not have a democratic mandate to call off the strike on 4 December 2010.&lt;ref name="dailymaverick.co.za"/&gt;

==Resumption of the Strike in 2013==

The strike was resumed in January 2013. It was, again, accompanied by considerable violence by&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-01-14-de-doorns-a-community-enveloped-by-fear-and-anger De Doorns: A community enveloped by fear and anger], Benjamin Fogel, ''The Daily Maverick'', 14 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and spreading to the towns of Villiersdrop and Wolseley.&lt;ref name="Villiersdorp" /&gt;

It was argued{{by whom|date=October 2015}} that Nosey Pieterse, the president of the Black Association of the Wine and Spirit Industry and general secretary of Bawusa, the Bawsi Agricultural Workers Union of South Africa, emerged as the primary leader in the strike in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-01-14-in-the-eye-of-the-winelands-storm-nosey-pieterse In the eye of the winelands storm: Nosey Pieterse] by Rebecca Davis, ''The Daily Maverick'', 14 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However others have argued that the strike was largely self organised and that leaders were largely self-proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groundup.org.za/article/farm-workers-union-csaawu-should-be-saved_2452 Farm workers union Csaawu should be saved], Daneel Knoetze, ''GroundUp'', 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Letsekang Tokhwane, 25, was shot dead by the police on 14 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-01-17-de-doorns-strike-continues-in-spite-of-cosatu De Doorns: Strike continues, in spite of Cosatu], Rebecca Davis, ''Daily Maverick'', 17 January&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was finally called off on 22 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-01-23-farmworkers-strike-may-be-over-but-everyones-a-loser Farmworkers' strike may be over – but everyone's a loser], Rebecca Davis, 23 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A number of workers were fired as a result of their participation in the strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groundup.org.za/content/tensions-remain-following-dismissals-workers-de-doorns Tensions remain following dismissals of workers in De Doorns], Ben Fogel, ''GroundUp'', 30 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The strikes had an imitate impact on the daily minimum wage for agricultural workers being raised from R69 (roughly US$8.54 in 2012) per day to R105 (US$13 in 2012) per day.  The event was also used as a regional campaign issue in the run up to the [[South African general election, 2014|South African general election of 2014]].  Attempts to resume the strike one year later in November 2013 where unsuccessful due to a reported lack of interest by workers and well as disagreement over the necessity of striking again.&lt;ref name="OneYearOn" /&gt;  The Western Cape's premier and member of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA), Helen Zille, stated that she believed there was a political motive for the strike with the [[African National Congress]] stoking unrest in the province to present the DA run province as "exploitative, racist and ungovernable".&lt;ref name="zilleWarns"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/zille-warns-that-farm-strikes-are-not-over-1.1488204#.Vhkkc_mqpBd | title=Zille warns that farm strikes are not over | publisher=Cape Times | date=18 March 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
