[[File:Aias Kassandra Louvre G458.jpg|thumb|Ajax the Lesser raping Cassandra]]
'''Ajax''' ({{lang-grc|Αἴας}} ''Aias'') was a [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] hero, son of [[Oileus]], the king of [[Locris]].  He was called the "lesser" or "Locrian" Ajax,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D2%3Acard%3D511  ii. 527]&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish him from [[Ajax the Great]], son of [[Telamon]]. He was the leader of the [[Locrians|Locrian]] contingent during the [[Trojan War]].  He is a significant figure in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and is also mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard | contribution = Ajax (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 87–88  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0096.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in  [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and in [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Trojan Women]]''. In [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan legend]], he was known as ''Aivas Vilates''.

==Life==
Ajax's mother's name was [[Eriopis]].  According to [[Strabo]], he was born in [[Naryx]] in [[Locris]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ix. p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Ovid]] calls him ''Narycius Heroes''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiv. 468&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''Iliad'',&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' ii. 527, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; he led his [[Locrians]] in forty ships against [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 97 gives the number of ships as twenty&lt;/ref&gt;  He is described as one of the great heroes among the Greeks. In battle, he wore a [[linen]] [[cuirass]] ({{lang|grc|λινοθώραξ}}), was brave and intrepid, especially skilled in throwing the spear and, next to [[Achilles]], the swiftest of all the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' xiv. 520, &amp;c., xxiii. 789, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In the funeral games at the [[pyre]] of [[Patroclus]], Ajax contended with [[Odysseus]] and [[Antilochus]] for the prize in the footrace; but [[Athena]], who was hostile towards him and favored Odysseus, made him stumble and fall, so that he won only the second prize.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' (xxiii. 754), &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In later traditions, this Ajax is called a son of Oileus and the [[nymph]] Rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Julius Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 81, 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' iii. 10. § 8&lt;/ref&gt; After the taking of Troy, he rushed into the temple of Athena, where [[Cassandra]] had taken refuge, and was embracing the statue of the goddess in [[supplication]]. Ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' ii. 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Troad.'' 70, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dict. Cret.'' v. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gaius Julius Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 116&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some writers, he raped Cassandra inside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tryphiodorus]], 635&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], xiii. 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lycophron]], 360, with the [[Scholion]]&lt;/ref&gt; Odysseus called for Ajax's death by stoning for this crime, but Ajax saved himself by claiming innocence with an oath to Athena, clutching her statue in supplication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' x. 26. § 1, 31. § 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Ajax drags Cassandra from Palladium.jpg|thumb|Ajax in Troy drags [[Cassandra]] from [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]] before eyes of [[Priam]], Roman mural from the [[Casa del Menandro]], [[Pompeii]]]]

Since Ajax dragged a supplicant from her temple, Athena had cause to be indignant. According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', no one was aware that Ajax had raped Cassandra until [[Calchas]], the Greek seer, warned the Greeks that Athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the Greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately. Despite this, Ajax managed to hide in the altar of a deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allowed him to live. When the Greeks left without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices, Athena became so angry that she persuaded [[Zeus]] to send a storm that sank many of their ships.

[[File:Poseidon and Ajax.png|thumb|left|200px|Poseidon killing Ajax the Lesser]]

As he was [[Returns from Troy|returning from Troy]], Athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt and the vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks ({{lang|grc|Γυραὶ πέτραι}}). But he escaped with some of his men, managing to cling onto a rock through the assistance of [[Poseidon]]. He would have been saved in spite of Athena, but he then audaciously declared that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals. Offended by this presumption, Poseidon split the rock with his [[trident]] and Ajax was swallowed up by the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 499, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Thetis]] buried him when the corpse washed up on Myconos.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodore, R. Scott Smith, Stephen Trzaskoma, and Hygin. ''Apollodorus' Library and Hyginus' Fabulae: Two Handbooks of Greek Mythology'', Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 2007. 84-85. "5.24-6.6."&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions depict a different death for Ajax, showing him dying when on his voyage home. In these versions, when Ajax came to the Capharean Rocks on the coast of [[Euboea]], his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm, he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from Athena in his chest, and his body thrust upon sharp rocks, which afterwards were called the rocks of Ajax.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;comp. Virgil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 40, &amp;c., xi. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ajax's death, his spirit dwelt in the island of [[Leuce (island)|Leuce]].&lt;ref name="paus319"&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html Description of Greece]'' iii. 19. § 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Opuntian Locris|Opuntian]] Locrians worshiped Ajax as their national hero, and so great was their faith in him that when they drew up their army in battle, they always left one place open for him, believing that, although invisible to them, he was fighting for and among them.&lt;ref name="paus319" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] ''Narrations'' 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The story of Ajax was frequently made use of by ancient poets and artists, and the hero who appears on some Locrian coins with the helmet, shield, and sword is probably this Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Edme Mionnet, No. 570, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other accounts of Ajax's death are offered by [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]] and the [[scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''Her.'' viii. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]] ''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
[[Image:Solomon Ajax and Cassandra.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Ajax the lesser|Ajax]] and [[Cassandra]]'' by Solomon J. Solomon (1886).  In the collection of the [[Art Gallery of Ballarat]] in [[Victoria, Australia]]&lt;ref name="tiscali"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel//paint/solomons.htm|title=Solomon Joseph Solomon RA PRBA (1860-1927)|date=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The abduction of Cassandra by Ajax was frequently represented in [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek]] works of art, such as the chest of [[Cypselus]] described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and in extant works.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' v. 17&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

== Biography ==
Upon completion of his college degree (BA Accounting, [[University of Colorado Denver]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coloradanmagazine.org/2009/06/01/alum-heads-gates-fund-to-help-students&lt;/ref&gt; Golston joined the firm [[KPMG Peat Marwick]] as a senior auditor. He later moved on to MIS, Inc., as Director of Business Analysis and Product Development, where he was responsible for designing and implementing accounting software systems for the insurance and banking industries.
In 1993 Golston returned to his alma mater, joining the [[University of Colorado Hospital]] as its director of finance and controller. In this position, Golston managed the whole of hospital finance, including accounting, risk management, compliance, debt, and some $400 million in hospital investments.

After four years at the University's hospital, Golston accepted a position with Seattle’s [[Swedish Medical Center]], acting as the hospital’s Director of Finance. In addition to the daily financial operations surrounding performance, accounting and reporting, tax compliance, and risk management, Golston also managed hospital investments worth approximately $500 million. Under Golston’s financial leadership, Swedish Medical Center received $258 million in tax-exempt debt relief; dollars that were subsequently directed toward facility improvement projects. During his tenure at Swedish, Golston also completed his MBA at [[Seattle University]].

Three years later, Golston was approached by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and asked to join the organization as [[chief financial officer]]. Because of the foundation’s unique executive structure, when Golston accepted the CFO role he also took on [[chief administrative officer]] duties. In this doubled capacity, Golston managed accounting, taxes,  and financial planning and analysis, while simultaneously leading the foundation’s work in human resources, information technology and operations. He also served on the senior executive team for foundation strategy, shaping and directing many of the foundation’s innovative strategies in the areas of Global Health, Global Development and the U.S. Program. For nine months in 2006, Golston was the interim executive director of the foundation’s Global Health division.

In October 2006, Golston was offered the role of president of the foundation’s [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation#United States Program|U.S. Program]]; a core area of foundation grantmaking.

10 December 2010, Golston was appointed to the Board of Directors for [[Stryker Corporation]]. He became lead director in 2016.  While in this role, he will continue to work as president of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. 

In addition to his work at the foundation, Golston also sits on a number of boards (University of Washington Medicine, Seattle University, [[Charter School Growth Fund]], MOM Brands) and participates in many outside philanthropic organizations. Golston is a lifetime member of the [[British-American Project]] and has previously been an active board member for [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]] (GAVI), New Futures, Make-A-Wish Foundation of Alaska and Washington, Philanthropy Northwest,  and the [[Public Library of Science]]. Golston is a resource council member for both the Rainier Scholars program and the Robert Woods Johnson Commission to Build a Healthier America, on the advisory committee for the Northwest African American Museum in Seattle, and is on the Resource Council for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC. Golston is also actively involved in the HOPE Street Bipartisan Commission and the INROADS Alumni Association. He is a member of the 2009 class of Henry Crown Fellows at the Aspen Institute.

Ettinger's research concerns light and space, and in this it follows from [[Monet]] and [[Rothko]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Erin, Manning, Erin. "Vertiginious Before the Light." in ''Art as Compassion''.

From 1981 until 1992, Ettinger's principal artwork consisted of drawing and mixed media on paper as well as notebooks and artist's books, where alongside theoretical work and conversations she made ink and wash painting and drawing. Since 1992, apart from her notebooks, most of her artwork consists of mixed media and oil paintings, with few parallel series that spread over time like: "Matrix — Family Album", "Autistwork" and "Eurydice", with themes of generational transmission of memory, personal and historical trauma, the Shoah and the World Wars,&lt;ref&gt;[[Griselda Pollock]], Between painting and the Digital, in: ''Bracha L.

&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger has become one of the major artists of the [[New European Painting]]. Along with painting she has worked on installations, theoretical research, lectures, video works, and "encounter events". Her paintings, photos, drawings, and notebooks have been exhibited at the [[Pompidou Centre]] (1987, 1996, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ettinger|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;s=ettinger\website=centrepompidou.fr|publisher=Pompidou Centre|accessdate=3 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;–2011), and the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1997. In the last decade, Ettinger's oil on canvas paintings involve figures like Medusa, Demeter and Persephone, and Eurydice. Though from 2010 onward her work still consists mainly of oil paintings and drawings, she is also doing new media animated video-films where the images are multi-layered like her painting. In 2015, Ettinger participated in the 14th [[Istanbul Biennial]] drafted and curated by [[Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pavilion Istanbul in/+Leeds Part 3|url=http://www.pavilion.org.uk/events/2015/Bracha-Ettinger/|website=pavilion.org.uk|publisher=Pavilion|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalyst==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2015}}
{{Technical|section|date=April 2017}}

Ettinger is a theoretician who proposed an [[ontology]] of string-like subject-subject (trans-subjective) and subject-object (transjective) transmissivity for a rethinking of the human subject. Working at the intersections of human [[subjectivity]], [[Human female sexuality|feminine sexuality]], maternal subjectivity, [[psychoanalysis]], [[art]] and [[aesthetics]], she contributed to psychoanalysis the idea of a feminine-maternal sphere, function, and structure with its symbolic and imaginary dimensions based on femaleness in the real (womb). This dimension, as symbolic, contributes to ethical thinking about human responsibility to one another and to the world. She is a senior clinical psychologist, and a practising psychoanalyst. Her artistic practice and her articulation, since 1985, of what has become known as the matrixial theory of trans-subjectivity have transformed contemporary debates in contemporary art, psychoanalysis, women's studies, and cultural studies. Ettinger was an analysand of [[Ronald Laing]] in London and [[Piera Aulagnier]] in Paris. She is member of the Tel Aviv Institute for Contemporary Psychoanalysis (TAICP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the Institute|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.taicp.org.il/&amp;prev=search|website=taicp.org|publisher=TAICP|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New Lacanian School (NLS) and the [[World Association of Psychoanalysis]] (AMP / WAP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wapol.org/en/index.html# World Association of Psychoanalysis]&lt;/ref&gt; For Ettinger, the Freudian attitude to psychoanalysis is crucial as it emphasizes the phantasmatic value of materials that arise during regression. To Freud and Lacan she adds, however, a feminine-maternal space-time with its particular structures, functions, and dynamics in the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. She claims that, in a similar way, when seduction is assigned to the paternal figure during regression, it is recognized in most cases as a result of the therapeutic process itself. It is worked-through accordingly without therapist's father-blaming, and without a resulting father-hate. Therapists must likewise realize that during regression phantasmatic maternal "not-enoughness" appears and must also be recognized as the result of the process itself, and be worked-through without the mother-hating that Ettinger considers contributes to a "psychotization" of the subject, and a block to the passage from rage to sorrow and compassion. To be able to recognize the phantasmatic status of the psychic material arising during therapy, the Lacanian concepts of Symbolic, Imaginary and Real are useful to her.

The idea of a corpo-Real is a part of her symbolization of a new feminine psychic zone (the matrixial, the womb as time space of psychic encounter-event), in both male and female subjects, and of the feminine-matrixial sexual difference. Thus, even if Ettinger critiques the Freudian and Lacanian analysis of the feminine, she considers herself as a "post" or "neo" Freudian and Lacanian, who elaborates the feminine in continuity to these psychoanalysts, but claims a supplementary feminine-maternal Eros. Ettinger criticises Winnicott and Bollas for offering patients a "ready-made mother-monster" as a cause for each psychic pain. She considers any practice of archaic-motherhood blaming as an obstacle, as "hystericizing" and even momentarily "psychoticizing" (in the sense of leading to internal splits rather than recognition of differences,) when such "cause" is brought as "explanation" by the analyst, a "cause" attributed to the unremembered early period of life where I and non-I are transconnected. Ettinger agrees with Lacan that the "ultimate" cause is in principle lacking: ''objet a''. She calls for a delicate process of differentiation, coemergence, and cofading between the generations, especially in analysing the same-sex (daughter-mother, son-father) relationships, with emphasize on transmission, not split. Thus, the process itself helps to negotiate and articulate delicately sexual difference, in the present. To the idea that the self is structured via mirror-like reflection she adds that of primal [[apperception]] of the other, through "fascinance" (aesthetic openness to the other and the cosmos), compassion and awe (affective accesses to the other) directed from the beginning to the (m)Other and the outside, not to the self.

===Psychoanalytic theory===

====Major concepts====
Ettinger invented the Matrixial Trans-subjectivity theory, or simply "[[The Matrixial]]", with concepts like border linking, borderspacing, martial borderspace, copoiesis, wit(h)messing and co/in-habit(u)ation.&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Matrixial Trans-subjectivity" in: ''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture and Society, Volum 23, Numbers 2–3, 2006.ISSN 0263-2764&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Carriance, Copoiesis and the Subreal.” In: ''Saltwater. Theory of Thought Forms''. 14th Istanbul Biennial Catalogue. Edited by Carolyn Christov Bokargiev, 2015. Printed also in: Bracha L. Ettinger. A α א And My Heart Wound-Space.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger is a [[Freud]]ian and Lacanian scholar and follows the late [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Object relations theory]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]/[[Félix Guattari]].

====The early theory: from 1985 through the 1990s====
Ettinger articulated a feminine-maternal (and feminine-prematernal) dimension, space, function, Eros and dynamics in the human Unconscious. She had suggested that pre-natal impressions, connected to the phantasmatic and traumatic real of the pregnant becoming-mother, are trans-inscribed in the emerging subject and form the primary phase and position of the human psyche. "I" and "non-I", without rejection and without symbiotic fusion, conjointly inscribe memory traces that are dispersed asymmetrically but in a trans-subjective mode. Trans-subjective mental and affective unconscious "strings", connecting the prenatal emerging subject to the archaic m/Other, open unconscious routes ("feminine", non phallic, in both males and females) that enable subjectivizing processes all throughout life whenever a new matrixial encounter-event takes place. The matrixial encounter-event forms specific aesthetical and ethical accesses to the Other. Ettinger articulated the 'matrixial gaze' and the process of 'co-poiesis'. This allows new understanding of trans-generational transmission, trauma and artistic processes. Ettinger formulates the woman(girl)-to-woman(mother) difference as the first sexual difference for females to be viewed first of all according to the matrixial parameters. The feminie-maternal Eros informs also the father/son and mother/son relations. According to Ettinger, in parallel but also before expressions of abjection ([[Julia Kristeva]]) or rejection (Freud on Narcissism) of the other, primary compassion, awe and fascinance (which are unconscious psychic affective accesses to the other, and which join reattunement and differentiating-in-jointness by borderlinking) occur. The combination of fascinance and primary compassion does not enter the economy of social exchange, attraction and rejection; it has particular forms of Eros and of resistance that can inspire the political sphere and reach action and speech that is ethical-political without entering any political institutional organization. The infant's primary compassion is a proto-ethical psychological means that joins the aesthetical fascinance and creates a feel-knowing that functions at best within maternal (and also parental) compassionate hospitality. Here, one witnesses in jointness: The I wit(h)ness while borderlinking (bordurelaint) to the non-I and borderspacing (bordurespacant) from the other. Ettinger calls for the recognition of the matrixial transference as a dimension in the transferential relationships in psychoanalysis. They must entails besideness to (and not a split from) the archaic the m/Other (Autremere) and parental figures; jointness-in-differentiation rather than their exclusion. She sees in the trans-subjectivity a distinct dimension of human specific linkage and shareability, different from, and supplementary to "inter-subjectivity" and "self" psychology. Her most prominent and comprehensive book regarding this theory is "The Matrixial Borderspace" (reprint of essays from 1994–1999) published in French in 1999&lt;ref&gt;''Regard et Espace-de-bord matrixiels''. La lettre volee. {{ISBN|2-87317-102-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 2006,&lt;ref name=Borderspace&gt;''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press 2006, edited by [[Brian Massumi]] and forwarded by [[Judith Butler]] and Griselda Pollock. {{ISBN|0-8166-3587-0}} [http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/E/ettinger_matrixial.html Upress relevant page].&lt;/ref&gt; but her most recent concepts are mainly elaborated in the different essays printed in 2005–2006.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly: "From Proto-ethical Compassion to Responsibility", "Fascinance" and "Com-passionate Co-response-ability, Initiation in Jointness, and the link x of Matrixial Virtuality". All published in 2006 — see list of recent publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The theory in the 2000s====
Her more recent artistic and theoretical work centers around the spiritual in art and ethics. In the domain of psychoanalysis, around the question of same-sex differences, the primary feminine difference is the difference opened between woman (girl) and woman (m/Other), maternal subjectivity, maternal/pregnance Eros of com-passion, the effects of compassion and awe and the passion for borderlinking and borderspacing&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Diotima and the Matrixial Transference: Psychoanalytical Encounter-Event as Pregnancy in Beauty." In: Van der Merwe, Chris N., and Viljoen, Hein, eds. Across the Threshold: Explorations of Liminality in Literature. New York: Peter Lang &amp; Potchefstroom: Literator, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4331-0002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea that three kinds of fantasy (that she names Mother-fantasies) should be recognized, when they appear in a state of regression aroused by therapy itself, as primal: Mother-fantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment. Their mis-recognition in psychoanalysis (and analytical therapy), together with the ignorance of maternal Eros of com-passion leads to catastrophic blows to the matrixial daughter-mother tissue and hurts the maternal potentiality of the daughter herself, in the sense that attacking the "non-I" is always also attacking the "I" that dwells inside an "I"-and-"non-I" trans-subjective matrixial (feminine-maternal) tissue. Contributing to Self psychoanalysis after [[Heinz Kohut]], Ettinger articulated the difference between com-passionate borderlinking, compassion (as affect) and empathy, and between "empathy without compassion" and "empathy within compassion", claiming that the analyst's empathy without compassion harms the matrixial psychic tissue of the analysand, while empathy within compassion leads to creativity and to the broadening of the ethical horizon. Ettinger explains how by empathy (toward the patient's complaints) ''without'' compassion (toward the patient's surrounding past and present family figures, no less than toward the patient itself), the therapist "produces" the patient's real mother as a "ready-made monster-mother" figure, that serves to absorb complaints of all kinds, and thus, a dangerous splitting is induced between the "good" mother figure (the therapist) and a "bad" mother figure (the real mother). This splitting is destructive in both internal and external terms, and mainly for the daughter-mother relations, since the I and non-I are in any case always trans-connected, and therefore any split and projected hate (toward such figures) will turn into a self-hate in the woman/daughter web. Such a concept of subjectivity, where "non-I" is trans-connected to the "I", has deep ethical implications&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L.

ISSN 1822-5047.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as far-reaching sociological and political implications that have been further developed by [[Griselda Pollock]] in order to rethink [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern art]] and History.

She is [[beatification|beatified]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

== Early life ==

Bronislava was born at [[Kamień, Włodawa County]], in eastern Poland as Bronislawa Odrowaz in about 1200,&lt;ref name ="Saints.SQPN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saints.sqpn.com/blessed-bronislava-of-poland/ |title=Blessed Bronislava of Poland |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=24 August 2014 |website= |publisher= Saints.SQPN.com |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources give a birth date of 1203&lt;ref name ="Petit"&gt;Petit, François (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lst5BLcIIsIC&amp;pg=PA136 ''Spirituality of the Premonstratensians: The Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries''], Cistercian Publications {{ISBN|978-0-87907-242-1}} (p. 136)&lt;/ref&gt; or 1204.&lt;ref name="Błogosławiona Bronisława"/&gt;  She was the daughter of Count Stanislaus and Countess Anna of Prandata-Odrowaz and a cousin of Saint [[Hyacinth of Poland]].&lt;ref name ="Petit"/&gt;

== Religious vocation ==

At the age of sixteen, she was introduced by Hyacinth to a religious community of the [[Norbertine]] order at [[Zwierzyniec, Kraków]]. She subsequently worked with the sick and poor at a number of [[monastery|monasteries]], living in a most austere way. She is believed to have seen a vision of the [[Virgin Mary]] at the moment of the death of Hyacinth in 1257.&lt;ref&gt;Petit, pp. 137 - 140&lt;/ref&gt; Bronislava died of natural causes on 29 August 1259 at Zwierzyniec.&lt;ref name ="Saints.SQPN"/&gt;

Part VI.|date=2007|location=Kraków}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1707 she was designated a patron of Poland, and of orphans. She was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on 23 August 1839,&lt;ref name ="Saints.SQPN"/&gt; after being attributed for protecting [[Zwierzyniec]] from cholera in 1835. Her feast day is celebrated on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gryczyński|first1=Michał|title=Św.

She is commemorated by the [[Blessed Bronisława Chapel]] in [[Kraków]].

[[Image:Statue Cardinal Newman, Brompton Oratory.jpg|right|thumb|upright|200px|Statue outside the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], popularly known as Brompton Oratory, in London]]

[[John Henry Newman]] (21 February 1801 – 11 August 1890) was a [[Catholic theology|Roman Catholic theologian]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] who converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] from [[Anglicanism]] in October 1845. In early life, he was a major figure in the [[Oxford Movement]] to bring the [[Church of England]] back to its roots. Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic.

[[Canonisation]] would make Newman the first [[English people|English]] person who has lived since the 17th century officially recognised as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1991, Newman was proclaimed "[[Venerable]]" by the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] – the first stage in the canonisation process. He was [[beatification|beatified]] on 19 September 2010 at an open air mass in [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="Switched"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_and_warwickshire/10403660.stm|title=Pope's Coventry visit moved to Birmingham|work=BBC News Online|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The canonisation process==

===The road to beatification===
A file on Newman's beatification was first opened in 1958.

In 1991, Newman was proclaimed [[Venerable]] after a thorough examination of his life and work by the [[Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. One miracle attributed to Newman's intercession was required to have occurred and been fully investigated and approved by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] before he could be [[beatified]]. A second miracle would then be necessary for his [[canonisation]].

In October 2005, Paul Chavasse, provost of the [[Birmingham Oratory]], who is the [[postulator]] responsible for the cause, announced that a miraculous cure had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=40255|title=Catholic News|work=cwnews.com|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Sullivan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4356268.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – England – West Midlands – 'Miracle' hope for new sainthood|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[deacon]] from [[Marshfield, Massachusetts|Marshfield]], [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]], attributed his recovery from a spinal cord disorder to Newman.&lt;ref name=timesonnewman&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/tls_selections/religion/article3779846.ece Morgan, Christopher. "Victorian cleric put on path to sainthood." ''The Sunday Times''. 20 April 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; The claimed miracle occurred in the jurisdiction of the [[Archbishop of Boston]], whose responsibility it was to determine its validity. In August 2006, the Archbishop of Boston, [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Sean O'Malley]] announced he was passing details to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2300520.html|title=The Sunday Times|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2008, the press secretary to the Fathers of the Birmingham Oratory reported that the medical consultants at the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] had met that day and voted unanimously that Sullivan's recovery defied any scientific or medical explanation. The question of the genuineness of the alleged miracle then went to the panel of theological consultors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7705085.stm | work=BBC News | title=Historic mass for Cardinal Newman | date=2 November 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who unanimously agreed to recognise the miracle a year later on 24 April 2009.&lt;ref name=beatify&gt;{{cite news|date=2009-04-24|work=The Telegraph|title=Cardinal John Newman poised for beatification after ruling|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/5214156/Cardinal-John-Newman-poised-for-beatification-after-ruling.html|last=Caldwell|first=Simon | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel's vote, presumably having been verified by the prelate members of the Congregation, allowed [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to [[Beatification|beatify]] Newman at a date of his choosing following a meeting with the Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (then Archbishop [[Angelo Amato]]) to formally approve the Congregation's voting process.

On 3 July 2009, Pope Benedict XVI recognised the healing of Deacon Jack Sullivan in 2001 as a miracle, resulting from the intercession of the Venerable Servant of God, John Henry Newman. This decision paved the way for Newman's beatification, which occurred on 19 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7011733.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&amp;attr=797084 |title=Pope to Meet Queen on Visit to Scotland |date=2 February 2010 | work=The Times | location=London | accessdate=28 April 2010 | first1=Charlene | last1=Sweeney | first2=Ruth | last2=Gledhill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it had been originally announced that Newman would be beatified at an open air [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] at [[Coventry Airport]],&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/8576825.stm|title=Mass to be held at Coventry Airport by Pope Benedict |date=19 March 2010|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the venue was later switched to [[Cofton Park]] in [[Longbridge]].&lt;ref name="Switched"/&gt;  Thus it was during the first [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom|Papal state visit]] to the UK that Pope [[Benedict XVI]] himself performed the beatification on 19 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20100919_beatif-newman_en.html |title=Mass with the beatification of Newman |date=19 September 2010 | work= | location=Birmingham | accessdate=20 September 2010 | first1= | last1= | first2= | last2=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps towards canonisation===

Chavasse expanded on his remarks at the [[Michaelmas]] 2006 dinner of the [[Oxford University Newman Society]] (held in November), suggesting that Benedict XVI had shown a personal interest in Newman's cause.&lt;ref name=timesonnewman/&gt;

A second miracle was needed for Newman's canonisation. In November 2018, the Vatican approved a second miracle, involving the unexplained healing of a pregnant American woman from a life-threatening diagnosis and investigated by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Archdiocese of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rousselle |first=Christine |title=Vatican approves second miracle for Blessed John Henry Newman |url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican-approves-second-miracle-for-blessed-john-henry-newman-87278 |deadurl=no |agency=Catholic News Agency |date=29 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129112105/https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican-approves-second-miracle-for-blessed-john-henry-newman-87278 |archive-date=29 November 2018 |access-date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement of remains===
In 2008, the Vatican decided to enact plans to move Newman's remains from The [[Lickey Hills]], near Rednal, Worcestershire where he was buried, to the [[Birmingham Oratory|Oratory]] in [[Birmingham]] city centre in anticipation of his being declared a saint. The move required prior permission from the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]; in preparation the area was enclosed by steel fencing incorporating The Oratory country house, a mortuary chapel and a small graveyard which contained his shared grave (with [[Ambrose St. John]]).

The planned exhumation and move of Newman's remains were finally agreed by the UK authorities as a special case, as UK law prohibits the removal of a body from a graveyard to a church tomb. Licence was finally granted on 11 August 2008, the 118th anniversary of Newman's death in 1890, to permit the move by undertakers.

Newman's grave at Rednal was opened on 2 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7646182.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – England – West Midlands – Exhumed cardinal to lie in state|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had been hoped that his body had been buried in a lead coffin and would be well preserved.  However, the [[exhumation]] revealed that Newman had been buried in a wooden coffin and his body had completely decomposed; there were no [[cadaver|human remains]].  The only artefacts retrieved, including an inscription plate, were wooden, brass and cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7652841.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – England – West Midlands – No body in exhumed Newman's grave|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These artefacts, along with locks of hair, which had been sent to Sullivan before his inexplicable cure (and had always been in the possession of the Birmingham Oratory), were placed in a glass sided casket for a Vigil of Reception. The [[relic]]s were then solemnly placed in the Chapel of [[St Charles Borromeo]] situated to the right of the Sanctuary. They will rest in the Chapel while the process of Beatification continues in Rome. The Fathers of the Birmingham Oratory have decided that the specially made green Italian marble [[sarcophagus]] will not be placed between the columns opposite the Holy Souls' Altar in the Oratory Church, Birmingham as originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4921649.ece "Solemn return of Cardinal Newman's remains to the Birmingham Oratory"] {{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
The proposed movement of Newman's body angered some [[gay rights]] campaigners, who saw it as an attempt to deliberately separate him from his close companion [[Ambrose St John]], with whom he was buried in accordance with his personal wishes. In their view, this was to deliberately downplay the intense nature of the relationship between the two men, who had been companions for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/2308728/Vatican-orders-Cardinal-Newman-to-be-parted-from-priest-friend-in-shared-grave.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Vatican orders Cardinal Newman to be parted from priest friend in shared grave The final request of Britain's most famous Roman Catholic convert, Cardinal Newman, is to be overriden &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; as the Vatican prepares to make him a saint. | first1=Jonathan | last1=Wynne-Jones | date=19 July 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Tatchell]] entered the debate in an article in ''The Times'' on 19 August 2008, accusing the Vatican of "moral vandalism",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4566639.ece Gay rights activist accuses Vatican of "moral vandalism"], ''Times Online''&lt;/ref&gt; and renewed his criticisms on the ''[[Sunday (radio programme)|Sunday]]'' programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 24 August 2008.

In response, the Vatican commissioned [[Ian Ker]], a [[theologian]] at the [[University of Oxford]], to rebut the allegations in an article for the Vatican's newspaper, ''[[L’Osservatore Romano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1052229/Vatican-hits-claims-Britains-saint-Cardinal-Newman-closet-homosexual.html "Vatican hits back at claims Britain's 'next saint' Cardinal Newman was a closet homosexual"], Simon Caldwell, ''Daily Mail'', 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Tatchell went on to criticise the [[Home Office]] of collusion with the Vatican. According to his interpretation of heavily censored documents released to him under the [[Freedom of Information Act]], Tatchell claimed that the Catholic Church had "put the government under sustained pressure" to obtain the authorisation to exhume the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9474.html|title=Ministry of Justice accused of "collusion" over Cardinal Newman exhumation|work=PinkNews|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Ker and Paul Chavasse, current provost of the Birmingham Oratory, maintain that Newman would have been glad to submit to the wishes of the Vatican in whatever they asked, no matter his previous wishes&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidecatholic.com/Joomla/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=Cardinal-Newman-s-resting-place.html&amp;Itemid=102] "As a great man of the church and devoted to the saints himself, Cardinal Newman would have been the first to insist on obeying a request of the Holy See and the last to insist that his own personal wishes be regarded as immutable."&lt;/ref&gt; – Newman had stated "I wish, with all my heart, to be buried in Fr Ambrose St John's grave&amp;nbsp;— and I give this as my last, my imperative will''", he wrote, later adding: "''This I confirm and insist on."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1050418/GEOFFREY-WANSELL-The-buried-secrets-Cardinal-Newman-man-set-Britains-newest-saint.html ''Buried secrets: Cardinal Newman is set to become Britain's newest saint. First he must be exhumed from the grave he shares with another man – the greatest love of his life''], Geoffrey Wansell, ''Daily Mail'', 29 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chen Sanli''' (1853 -1937), aka Boyan, Sanyuan Laoren, was a Chinese poet who wrote in the classical style in the early modern era. He was descended from a Hakka family that had settled in Yining (now Xiushui), Jiangxi Province [Kowallis, p.&amp;nbsp;169]. His father was [[Chen Baozhen]], Qing dynasty governor of Hunan. Along with [[Zheng Xiaoxu]] and [[Shen Zengzhi]], he became one of the leading figures of the [[Tongguang school]], which was related to but not identical with the [[Song poetry]] style [Kowallis, pp.&amp;nbsp;168–208]. From 1889 Chen Sanli served as a [[civil servant]], and with his father [[Chen Baozhen]] (1831-1900), the governor-general of Hunan and an associate of Tan Sitong and Kang Youwei, he led [[Hundred Days' Reform|local reform]] in [[Hunan]], which became a model in the minds of reformists for the entire country. After the Empress Dowager suppressed the Hundred Days Reform of 1898, the Chens were forced to leave the government and go into internal exile near [[Nanchang]].  His father died shortly thereafter, which greatly saddened the son. He then moved to a villa he built outside Jinling (Nanjing) called Sanyuan Jingshe (The Sanyuan Retreat), from which Chen Sanli derived his pen-name. After the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], Chen Sanli declined to serve in government under the Republic, but he was not a Qing yilao [loyalist] in the classic sense. After the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], he is said to have committed suicide by starvation in protest at the Japanese invasion.

[[Chen Yan (poet)|Chen Yan]], the main theorist of the poetics of the Tongguang school, characterized Chen Sanli's poetry as "obscure and profound" (生涩奥衍). Chen Sanli was said to have learned from the [[Northern Song]] poet [[Huang Tingjian]], but he did not imitate, he developed this style [Kowallis, p.&amp;nbsp;194]. Many of Chen's poems reflect the chaos and suffering of the [[Chinese people]] during the early 20th century.

[[Chen Shizeng]], One of Chen Sanli's sons became a famous painter. Another, the historian [[Chen Yinke]], was an eminent authority on Buddhism and the institutional history of Tang-era China [Lo and Schultz, p.&amp;nbsp;351].

'''Constantin G. Cantacuzino''', also known as '''Costache Cantacozino''' or '''Costandin Cantacuzino''' ([[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|transitional Cyrillic]]: Кonстanтin Кanтaкozino; 1790s–1877), was the ''[[Caimacam]]'' (Regent) of [[Wallachia]] in September 1848–June 1849, appointed directly by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A member of the [[Cantacuzino family]], he had emerged as a leader of the conservative [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyardom]] during the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' period. As a commander in the [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian militia]], he organized in 1831 the first elections for [[Bucharest]]'s [[General Council of Bucharest|Town Council]], and subsequently served as one of the [[Mayor of Bucharest|Bucharest Governors]]. He first played a major part in national government from 1837 to 1842, when he served [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Alexandru II Ghica]] as ''[[Postelnic]]'' and ''[[Logothete]]''. During that interval, he clashed with his own brother [[Grigore Cantacuzino]], who sided with the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]].

Falling out of favor with the [[Russian Empire]], Cantacuzino was deposed ahead of Ghica himself, and was an unsuccessful candidate in the [[Wallachian princely election, 1842|princely election of December 1842]]. After years in self-imposed exile, Cantacuzino returned with the [[Ottoman Army]] in September 1848, helping to quell the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]]—although his own son, [[Ion C. Cantacuzino (politician)|Ion C. Cantacuzino]], had been active within the revolutionary movement. Supervised by [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha|Fuad Pasha]], Constantin sent the revolutionary leadership, including his immediate predecessors, into exile. He then oversaw the imprisonment and mistreatment of various others, being allegedly responsible for the death in custody of writer [[Ion Catina]]. He also disarmed the rebel forces, while restoring both ''Regulamentul'' and its symbols of power, as well as reintroducing [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]]. 

Cantacuzino resigned when [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]] took over as Prince, but remained active within Știrbei's successive governments, being granted the office of Great ''[[Vornic]]''. He opposed the Prince's views on [[Land reform in Romania|agrarian reform]], taking an ultra-conservative stance which favored [[indentured servitude]] for Wallachian farmers. Throughout the early 1850s, Cantacuzino actively sought the crown of Wallachia for himself, championing [[Ottomanism|Ottoman loyalism]]. His in-law [[Nicolae Mavros]] also attempted to make him ruler of both [[Danubian Principalities]].

Cantacuzino's final moment in power was in late July 1854, during an interregnum caused by the [[Crimean War]]. He became the president of an Administrative Council created by [[Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov]] just before the Russian withdrawal from Wallachia. The Ottomans then recognized him as head of a caretaker government, jointly with [[Constantin Năsturel-Herescu]], although both resigned after Știrbei's second return that September. After rallying with a larger conservative coalition, he served a final ministerial term in 1856, and was a minor contender in the [[Wallachian Elective Assembly, 1859|princely election of 1859]], also taking a seat in the [[Ad hoc Divan]]. While the ''Caimacam'' spent the remainder of his life abroad, his sons Ion and Adolf remained active in the administration of the [[United Principalities]]. Constantin was the father-in-law of General [[Gheorghe Manu]], as well as the grandfather of microbiologist [[Ioan Cantacuzino]] and of poet [[Scarlat Cantacuzino]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Of distant [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] origins, the Cantacuzinos had reached prominence in both Wallachia and [[Moldavia]], which were governed as [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary states]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to diverging accounts, Constantin was born in 1791,&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; 1793,&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; or "about 1798".&lt;ref&gt;Rizo-Rangabé, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the ''[[Clucer]]'' Gheorghe (Iordache) Cantacuzino (1747–1803), grandson of [[Constantin I Cantacuzino]]; through his two paternal great-grandparents, Constantin descended from [[Michael Kantakouzenos Şeytanoğlu]] and Prince [[Radu Șerban]].&lt;ref&gt;Rizo-Rangabé, pp. 17–18, 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin was born from Gheorghe's marriage to Maricuța, daughter of ''[[Ban (title)|Ban]]'' Ștefan Pârșcoveanu. The couple had another son, Grigore (1800–1849), who also served as Wallachia's ''Vornic''.&lt;ref&gt;Rizo-Rangabé, pp. 25–26. See also Bezviconi, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantacuzino's involvement with the Wallachian administration began during the late stages of the [[Phanariote]] era, when both Principalities were being [[Hellenization|Hellenized]]. He first became a titled boyar in 1813, under Prince [[John Caradja]], when he was appointed ''[[Sardar|Serdar]]'' of the [[Wallachian military forces]]; in 1820, he was an ''[[Agha (title)|Aga]]'', or head of Wallachia's police.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, following the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|anti-Phanariote uprising]], he and his family took refuge in the [[Austrian Empire]], joining a colony of boyars in [[Brașov|Corona (Brașov)]].&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, pp. 62–65; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous letter, tentatively dated to April 1821, cites him as one of the boyars attracted into the anti-Phanariote faction of this diaspora, alongside [[Grigore Brâncoveanu]], [[Scarlat Rosetti]] and [[Alexandru Vilara]].&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aga'' had returned home by 1822, the year when he probably married Zoe Slătineanu, from whom he had his four children.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, under [[Grigore IV Ghica]], he issued the first-ever decree regulating Wallachia's police, which also marked a first step in its transition to modern metropolitan law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Cadeschi, "Câteva aspecte privind aplicarea Legii pentru autorizarea comunelor urbane de a avea poliție municipală (1878)", in ''Annals of the University of Bucharest. Political Science Series'', Vol. 3, 2001, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he was also appointed as the first ethnic Romanian to serve as ''Efor'' (Curator) of the Wallachian theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cantacuzino's political climb was accelerated during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828]], when he welcomed the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and became a protege of Governor [[Pavel Kiselyov]]. Following the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]], both Principalities became protectorates of Russia under Ottoman suzerainty. In 1831, Cantacuzino was ''Vornic'' of the Wallachian Police in [[Bucharest]]. In this capacity, together with [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] he organized the very first elections for the [[General Council of Bucharest|Town Council]], which took place in November 1831. When this was convened, he also presented himself as a candidate for an executive function (''mădulăr''), earning endorsements from 56 out of 80 councilors, and emerging as one of five town governors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Moisil]], "Primul sfat orășenesc al Bucureștilor", in ''Bucureștii Vechi'', Vols. I–IV, 1935, pp. 136–154&lt;/ref&gt; Still serving as ''Aga'' in 1832, Cantacuzino was directly involved in the hunt for brigand [[Ioniță Tunsu]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 II), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Kiselyov also assigned him to committees which supervised the paving and beautification of Bucharest's streets; his colleagues were [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]] and [[Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), pp. 230, 292&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Iancu Văcărescu]] and Costache Golescu, he also collected funds for the establishment of a national theater.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; His own townhouse, located outside [[Lipscani]], was fitted with a bathhouse—one of the few private ones existing in 1830s Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; 

In parallel, Cantacuzino also ran in Wallachia's [[Wallachian legislative election, 1831|first legislative election]], taking one of the 19 [[Sfatul boieresc|Ordinary Assembly]] seats reserved for the high-ranking boyars.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ștefan Grigorescu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160623092519/http://www.memoriaoltului.ro/reviste/revista_61.pdf "Regulamentul organic și primele alegeri din Olt și Romanați"], in ''Memoria Oltului și Romanaților'', Vol. V, Issue 2, February 2016, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1836|election of 1836]], there were protracted debates between the [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]] and the conservative boyars. A ministerial crisis was finally ended in June 1837, when Cantacuzino agreed to enter a cabinet that also included his rival Știrbei.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He served as ''[[Postelnic]]'' or Secretary of State, and was also ''[[Logothete]]'' or Justice Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 277; Tiron, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to the pacification of [[Brăila]] in July 1841, signing Prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]]'s proclamation to the rebellious [[Bulgarians of Romania|Bulgarians]].&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt; Acting on Ghica's behalf, he welcomed at [[Calafat]] the Ottoman inspector, Hüseyin Pasha, with whom he discussed means of tackling Russian intrigues in Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 123–128&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1842 ''Logothete'' Cantacuzino had been received into three orders of chivalry by Wallachia's protective powers: he had the [[Order of Saint Anna]], Second Class; the [[Order of Saint Vladimir]], Fourth Class; and the [[Order of Glory (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Order of Glory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, pp. 93, 99&lt;/ref&gt; His friendship with Kiselyov afforded him a say in the legislative framework of Wallachia, codified as ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]''. From within the Ordinary Assembly, Cantacuzino supported tagging the controversial "additional article" to ''Regulamentul'', and thus revealed himself as a vocal backer of Russian influence in the Principalities.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; This pitted him against the National Party, whose leaders included [[Emanoil Băleanu]], [[Ioan Câmpineanu]], and his own brother, Grigore Cantacuzino.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, pp. 132, 134; Xenopol &amp; Kretzulescu, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bibescu's reign and 1848 Revolution===

Constantin was still a member of the Assembly following the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1841|election of 1841]]. However, on May 20, 1842, Russian commissioner [[Alexander Osipovich Duhamel]] obtained that he be deposed as ''Postelnic'' and replaced with Știrbei.&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Cantacuzino presented himself as a candidate in the [[Wallachian princely election, 1842|princely election of December]], but only managed 41 of 188 votes;&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', pp. 91–94&lt;/ref&gt; the winner was Bibescu. Initially, Bibescu promoted him, assigning him office as an ''Efor'' of the Wallachian schools, jointly with Filipescu-Vulpea and [[Mihalache Ghica]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 138–139, 166–167, 191, 349–351&lt;/ref&gt; Like his brother Grigore (who sat in the Assembly's committee for educational review), Constantin was a reactionary who objected to educational reform.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; Still present in the Assembly in 1843, he soon rallied with the anti-Bibescu opposition, blocking his legislative projects.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 69–70, 128–130&lt;/ref&gt; He later chose to expatriate himself,&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; although his family remained behind. His eldest son, [[Ion C. Cantacuzino (politician)|Ion C. (Iancu)]], was by then married to Maria, daughter of the numismatist and Russian spy [[Nicolae Mavros]], making Constantin had been in-laws with politician [[Ion Ghica]] and with the [[Kotzebue family]].&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 208, 254. See also Bogdan-Duică, pp. 37–38, 183; Florescu, pp. 381–382; Panaitescu, pp. 36, 73, 146, 148; Parusheva, pp. 159–160, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1848, [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachia's liberal revolution]] toppled Bibescu and installed a Provisional Government. Two of his three sons, Ion and Grigore, were enthusiastic participants in the events.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 160, 270. See also Xenopol &amp; Kretzulescu, pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages, both Constantin and his Mavros daughter-in-law helped the radical [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] evade police round-ups at [[Telega, Prahova|Telega]].&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, pp. 73, 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, the day of revolutionary victory, he wrote to Bălcescu a congratulatory and "rather humble" letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Berindei]], "Contradicțiile de clasă în desfășurarea revoluției muntene din 1848", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XI, Issue 3, 1958, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent weeks, the new regime sought to obtain recognition from the [[Sublime Porte]]. The Cantacuzino home was also where the Provisional Government, represented by [[Ioan Voinescu II]], welcomed [[Süleyman Hüsnü Paşa|Suleiman Pasha]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;Albini, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September, following its radicalization, the revolutionary movement was repressed by an Ottoman–Russian expedition; at the time, Cantacuzino Sr had again fled for safety to Corona. On September 21, he rode back to Bucharest, presenting his services to the [[Ottoman Army]] under [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha|Fuad Pasha]]; reportedly, he had been called back by Duhamel.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 179–180, 277. See also Ghica, pp. 33, 819&lt;/ref&gt; Favored by both Russian and Ottoman overseers,&lt;ref&gt;Ghica, pp. 107–108; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; he was subsequently appointed ''Caimacam'' by Fuad, on September 22. The short ceremony was witnessed by Ion Cantacuzino, who reportedly shouted out: "Father, do not accept this sort of offices!"&lt;ref&gt;Albini, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constantin's ascendancy led to the mass arrest of revolutionary leaders, who were then kept under armed guard at [[Cotroceni Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Albini, pp. 147–148; Ghica, pp. 53, 643; Iorga (1939), pp. 703–704; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 180, 182, 276; Xenopol &amp; Kretzulescu, pp. 264–267&lt;/ref&gt; His acts became the topic of a protest, submitted to [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha|Âli Pasha]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Foreign Minister]], by revolutionary agents Ion Ghica and [[Abdolonyme Ubicini]]. According to Ghica, Âli informed them that Cantacuzino had only been appointed ''Caimacam'' because [[Mustafa Reşid Pasha|Reshid Pasha]] had mistaken him for his more reformist brother.&lt;ref&gt;Ghica, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the Revolution's triumvirate of Princely Lieutenants had dispersed: though [[Christian Tell]] and [[Nicolae Golescu]] suggested armed resistance, [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] resigned and retreated to his home, leaving the palace to be taken by Ottoman soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Albini, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, Fuad and the ''Caimacam'' issued a deportation order for some of the core figures of the previous regime. The list included Bălcescu, Heliade, Voinescu II, and Nicolae Golescu, alongside [[Costache Aristia]], [[Cezar Bolliac]], [[Ion C. Brătianu]], [[Dimitrie Brătianu]], [[Ștefan Golescu]], [[C. A. Rosetti]], and [[Ioasaf Znagoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Albini, pp. 155–156; [[Dumitru Popovici]], ''"Santa Cetate" între utopie și poezie'', p. 57. Bucharest: Editura Institutului de Istorie Literară și Folclor, 1935.  {{OCLC|924186321}}. See also Ghica, pp. 36–37; Potra (1990 I), p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; Cantacuzino's other preoccupation as ''Caimacam'' was an investigation into looting and arson by rebellious peasants, for which purpose he founded and led a specialized boyar committee.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem, he and Fuad ordered [[Neofit II]] to expel revolutionary sympathizers from the ranks of his [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Wallachian Orthodox Bishopric]].&lt;ref&gt;Albini, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Assigning the direct supervision of education to Băleanu, Filipescu-Vulpea, and [[Petrache Poenaru]], he initiated the purge of radical teachers, and, on November 1, personally ordered for all schools to be shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 166–169, 195, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Ordering the remnants of the revolutionary army, under [[Gheorghe Magheru]], to disband,&lt;ref&gt;Albini, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; he took hold of the arsenal of weapons collected by the deposed Lieutenants. He sent these arms to the [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who used them in battle against the [[Hungarian State (1849)|Hungarian State]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghica, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Caimacam'' stood accused of orchestrating the ransacking of Heliade's home&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; and of various acts of cruelty, including being seen as responsible for the prison death of poet [[Ion Catina]], which his regime tried to conceal. Catina's brother was allegedly forced to deny that was the case, in a newspaper notice which also addressed thanks to the Russian army.&lt;ref&gt;Albini, pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Heliade disciple, Nicolae Rusu Locusteanu, the new regime imposed an "executioner" in each [[Counties of Romania|Wallachian county]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939), p. 709&lt;/ref&gt; Though he endorsed additional clampdown measures, Cantacuzino was a moderate in this respect: Colonel [[Grigore Lăcusteanu]], who organized the round-up, recalls that Fuad ordered him to limit the scope of his investigations, and also to submit to the ''Caimacam''{{'}}s every command.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; His son Ion was released from Cotroceni, and then successfully intervened to free another revolutionary, [[Nicolae Crețulescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol &amp; Kretzulescu, pp. 266–267. See also Albini, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Știrbei===
On September 28, 1848, Cantacuzino and Fuad annulled the abolition of [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]], ordering the emancipated [[Romani people in Romania|Romanies]] to return to their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Caimacam'' also had a direct say in Wallachia's industrialization when, in March 1849, entrepreneur V. G. Browning presented him with designs for a large [[gristmill]] and bread factory.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Cantacuzino set aside funds for the restoration of Bucharest's Monument to the Russian Soldiers, which had been nearly completely vandalized during the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), pp. 357–358&lt;/ref&gt; His municipal policies blended with repressive measures when he demoted [[Alexandru Orăscu]], previously Bucharest's [[council architect]], and promoted [[Xavier Vilacrosse]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Pănoiu, "Izvoare. Un memoriu adresat de arh. Al. Orăscu Căimăcămiei Țării Românești în 1848", in ''Buletinul Comisiei Monumentelor Istorice'', Vol. II, Issue 3, 1991, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; He also staged an inquiry into [[Iacob Melic]]'s activity as a revolutionary architect, ordering him to pay back sums he owed to the city government of Bucharest an to ''Clucer'' [[Barbu Catargiu]], and sequestering some of his assets.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), pp. 452–453&lt;/ref&gt; Lăcusteanu's attempt to arrest Melic's father-in-law, Hagi Nazaretian, was curbed by a riot of the [[Armenians in Romania|local Armenians]].&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantacuzino intended to make his status permanent by being recognized as Prince. This project was backed by Nicolae Mavros, who also wanted Cantacuzino to take the [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian crown]]. Nevertheless, Mavros also proposed as a better candidate the [[Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg|Duke of Leuchtenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; During 1849, the exiles continued to maneuver against Wallachian reactionaries: writing from [[Istanbul]], Bălcescu insisted that the ''Caimacam'' was a [[Russophilia|Russophile]] who "feigned friendship with the Turks."&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cantacuzino regency, Wallachia was forced to accept a loan of 300,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], most of which went to paying for the upkeep of the Russian occupation force—meaning that Russia turned a profit from the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Albini, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cantacuzino's mandate expired in June 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; His attempt to be recognized as Prince was frustrated, as Russia imposed Știrbei on the throne. That moment marked the peak of Duhamel's participation in Wallachian affairs, as Știrbei soon turned against his Russian backers.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; His bipartisan cabinet included Cantacuzino, purposefully selected among his rivals to serve as ''Logothete''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 49, 139&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, he was advanced to Great ''Vornic'' and cited as "honest and faithful to His Highness".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; His 1848 victim Bolliac claimed that Cantacuzino had amassed a fortune from "things he stole while in office", having also received a prize of 25,000 [[ducat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ghica, p. 819&lt;/ref&gt; The latter sum was ordered to be paid from the Wallachian treasury by [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdulmejid I]], who also granted Cantacuzino a [[snuffbox]] encrusted with precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;Albini, pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; Știrbei took offense with this new duty, and, according to diverging sources, either refused to grant Cantacuzino the sum,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; or only paid it in installments.&lt;ref&gt;Albini, pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; He also signed an order ending Cantacuzino's investigation of the peasant revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

The former ''Caimacam'' remained involved in the agrarian debates, opposing measures to liberalize transactions between boyars and [[tenant farmer]]s. Against Știrbei's own recommendations, he supported keeping peasants under a system of leases which closely resembled [[indentured servitude]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 57–61&lt;/ref&gt; As Știbei's ''Vornic'' or Interior Minister in 1849–1850, Cantacuzino introduced more leniency toward imprisoned liberals, assessing pleas for amnesty and reporting on revolutionary Tănasie Macovei's sufferings from [[scrofula]].&lt;ref&gt;Pippidi, pp. 330–338&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also recommended that the agitator Teodor Borcănescu be arrested and exiled to [[Poiana Mărului Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Pippidi, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1851 Cantacuzino and his rival Bibescu were both visiting the [[French Second Republic|French Republic]], both of them courting the Wallachian revolutionaries in exile, ostensibly to win their support for their candidacies for the throne. News of this infuriated Bălcescu, who suggested "that we kick these slick ''ciocoi'' [buzzards] in a certain spot on their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Ghica, p. 594&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1850, Maria Mavros-Cantacuzino had also joined Bălcescu in exile, writing back to [[Vasile Alecsandri]] about their "fraternal intimacy".&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 1853, Russia and the Ottoman Empire fought with each other in what became known as the [[Crimean War]]. Știrbei left the country and Wallachia's fate remained uncertain. On July 31, 1854, the withdrawing Russian army, under [[Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov]], assigned Wallachia's administration to an Administrative Council, presided upon by Cantacuzino.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmin Lucian Gherghe, ''Emanoil Chinezu – om politic, avocat și istoric'', p. 92. Craiova: Sitech, 2009.  {{ISBN|978-606-530-315-7}}; Iorga (1937), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after, he wrote to the [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Duke of Teschen]], inviting the Austrian army to occupy Wallachia as a buffer zone.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1937), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; In early August, Cantacuzino welcomed in his home [[Halim Pasha]], whose small expeditionary force restored an Ottoman presence in Bucharest; Austria's consul [[Anton Ritter von Laurin]] was also present.&lt;ref&gt;Ciachir, p. 199; Duzinchevici, p. 250; Iorga (1910), pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; Presiding over a delegation that also included Câmpineanu and [[Alexandru II Ghica]], Cantacuzino presented [[Michał Czajkowski|Sadyk Pasha]] and his Ottoman Cossacks with the keys to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Duzinchevici, pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, he similarly welcomed the Austrian troops, under [[Johann Baptist Coronini-Cronberg|Count Coronini]], clearing the Mavros palace to serve as their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Ciachir, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to power and later life===

Again hoping to be made ''Caimacam'' or Prince, Cantacuzino also welcomed [[Omar Pasha]] and lent him a luxurious carriage.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, Dervish Ibrahim Pasha partly satisfied Cantacuzino's request, appointing him and [[Constantin Năsturel-Herescu]] to lead a provisional government which was to handle affairs until Știrbei's promised return.&lt;ref&gt;Ciachir, p. 200; Iorga (1910), pp. 163–167. See also Duzinchevici, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; The new Council also included Ion Cantacuzino and another young boyar, [[Ioan Al. Filipescu|Ioan Alecu Filipescu-Vulpache]].&lt;ref&gt;Ciachir, p. 200; Iorga (1937), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; According to the memoirs of Sadyk Pasha, the new regime also involved Alexandru Ghica and Câmpineanu; it was primarily pro-Ottoman, fearing Russia and, "above all", Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Duzinchevici, pp. 250, 251, 254&lt;/ref&gt; Grigore Cantacuzino was included in this administrative apparatus: with Sadyk and [[Carol Davila]], he took measures to control the [[1846–1860 cholera pandemic|cholera epidemic]], earning kudos from the Ottoman overseers.&lt;ref&gt;Duzinchevici, pp. 254, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantin Cantacuzino and other "old boyars" found themselves tactically allied with Heliade and the Golescus in their repeated attempts to prevent Știrbei's return from Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Duzinchevici, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; He finally resigned on September 23, when Știrbei appointed an entirely new cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 166–167. See also Ciachir, p. 201; Iorga (1937), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, he was mainly noted as a patron of the arts. In 1855, he sponsored a debut play by lawyer Ioan Em. Bujoreanu, ''Fata supt epitrop'' ("Chaperoned Girl").&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], "Bucureștii de acum un veac, după romanul unui avocat (Ioan Em. Bujoreanu 1862)", in ''Memoriile Secțiunii Istorice'', Vol. XVI, 1935, pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; Probably at that stage, he commissioned a calligraphic and heraldic copy of his family's genealogy, originally written in the late 18th century by his ancestor, Mihai Cantacuzino; it remained one of the few surviving copies of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Rodica Rădulescu, "Un exemplar necunoscut al ''Genealogiei Cantacuzinilor'' descoperit la Călărași", in ''Cultură și Civilizație la Dunărea de Jos. Contribuții'', 1985, pp. 243–249&lt;/ref&gt; An 1861 notice in ''O Theatis'' newspaper described him as "one of the most constant and enthusiastic spectators of [Bucharest's] Greek theater."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Papacostea-Danielopolu, "La vie culturelle de la communauté grecque de Bucarest dans la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle", in ''Revue Des Études Sud-est Européennes'', Vol. VII, Issue 2, 1969, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1856, as Alexandru Ghica presided upon a new regency, the former ''Caimacam'' briefly returned as minister.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1937), p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial attempt to get the throne for himself,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939), p. 731&lt;/ref&gt; Ion Cantacuzino rallied with the Știbeist party, which now sought to effect union between Wallachia and Moldavia. A member of the [[Ad hoc Divan]] following the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1857|election of 1857]], he helped to draft its main resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Novac, "Activitatea politică a argeșenilor și mușcelenilor reflectată în paginile ziarului ''Românul'' în perioada august 1857 – iunie 1859", in ''Argessis. Studii și Comunicări, Seria Istorie'', Vol. X, 2001, pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, he was Știrbei's envoy to [[Iași]], allegedly gathering support for the unionist cause.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; A Cantacuzino faction still existed ahead of the [[Wallachian Elective Assembly, 1859|January 1859 election]], but was undecided between supporting three conservative candidates for the throne: Bibescu, Știbei, and Alexandru Ghica.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, on January 12,&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin put himself up as a candidate—although, as historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] notes, his chances of winning were minuscule.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve days later, progressives imposed a win for their own surprise candidate, [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], a Moldavian. Also a member of the Divan (or Elective Assembly), Constantin validated the election and signed the address which sought to obtain Cuza's recognition as ''[[Domnitor]]''. Some of his 1848 enemies, including Rosetti and Nicolae Golescu, also endorsed that act.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Bodea, "Actul original al alegerii prealabile a lui Alexandru I. Cuza, domn al 'Principatelor Unite'", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XII, Issue 1, 1959, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

The former ''Caimacam'' finally left Wallachia and settled in Paris, dying in exile in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 270, 276, 277&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried next to his wife (died 1839) and parents at Saint John the Great Church in Bucharest. When this building was demolished, their remains were reburied at [[Bellu cemetery]], Plot 15.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 82. See also Tiron, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Caimacam'' was survived by all his four children. Ion remained especially prominent as a minister of the [[United Principalities]], and from 1863 one of Cuza's leading conservative opponents;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioan Tanoviceanu]], "Pagini din istoria domniei lui Cuza Vodă. Urmare", in ''Revista pentru Istorie, Archeologie și Filologie'', Vol. XIII, Parts I–II, 1912, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; his youngest brother, Adolf Cantacuzino (married to Ecaterina Iarca), was the very first President of the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;Rizo-Rangabé, p. 157. See also Bezviconi, p. 81; Călinescu, p. 970&lt;/ref&gt; Having returned to Bucharest, Maria Mavros was noted for her philanthropic work during the [[Romanian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Mirela-Daniela Tîrnă, "Activitățile filantropice ale reginei Elisabeta a României — 'Mamă a Patriei'", in ''București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie'', Vol. XVI, 2002, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, Constantin and Zoe's only daughter, Alexandra or Alexandrina, had married General [[Gheorghe Manu]], who later became [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] of the [[Romanian Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Rizo-Rangabé, p. 157. See also Bezviconi, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; While Ion and Maria Cantacuzino had nine children together, Grigore died a celibate&lt;ref&gt;Rizo-Rangabé, pp. 35, 157&lt;/ref&gt; in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ''Caimacam''{{'}}s granddaughters, sisters Zoe and Sevastia became wives of two other Prime Ministers: the former married [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], the latter [[Petre P. Carp]].&lt;ref&gt;Parusheva, p. 160; Rizo-Rangabé, p. 35. See also Bogdan-Duică, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Also a Prime Minister, [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]] was Constantin's nephew.&lt;ref&gt;Virgiliu Z. Teodorescu, "Contribuții la evocarea activității sculptorului Wladimir C. Hegel", in ''București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie'', Vol. XXIII, 2009, p. 223; See also Bezviconi, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other descendants of the ''Caimacam'' included two famous grandsons: microbiologist [[Ioan Cantacuzino]], born to Maria Mavros,&lt;ref&gt;Florescu, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; and Adolf's son, the poet and diplomat [[Scarlat Cantacuzino|Scarlat (Charles-Adolphe) Cantacuzino]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 970–971; Potra (1990 II), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; During their lifetime, their grandfather's image in culture had been codified as negative, with literary historian [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]] referring to the ''Caimacam'' as "one of the most undeserving boyars this country ever had".&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin was also portrayed as an antagonist in [[Camil Petrescu]]'s historical novel, ''Un om între oameni''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Simion]], ''Scriitori români de azi, I'', p. 173.

'''David Jubb''' is a neurobehavioral physiologist and blood formation specialist, who promotes fasting, whole brain functioning and a diet based on life food.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/nyregion/thecity/06brea.html?_r=1|title=He Must Be a Dream to Cook For|author=Jennifer Bleyler|publisher=New York Times|date=February 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jubb also describes himself as a  and a specialist in colloidal biology.&lt;ref name="villagevoice2000"&gt;{{cite web|author=Debra DeSalvo |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-06-27/news/eat-it-raw/ |title=Eat It Raw! - Page 1 - News - New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=2000-06-27 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jubb&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Eton |url=http://www.davidjubb.com/index.php |title=Home |publisher=Davidjubb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifefoodism==
Jubb promotes a diet focused on food that has enzymes and  “life-force”, the ability to reproduce, and which is found growing in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/16/AR2008051601582.html |title=&amp;#124; Smart Mouth&amp;#124; |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=May 18, 2008 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Onan the vegetarian|date=April 10, 2006|publisher=New York|author=Russell Scott Smith|via=[[HighBeam]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-145533139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This excludes raw meat and raw legumes, bananas, dates, corn, wheat, rice, milk, eggs, cheese, bread, soy milk, tofu, oats, beets, and carrots, because they “cause mold, fungus, and yeast” to grow in the body.&lt;ref name="villagevoice2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon A. Senzon|publisher=New Life Journal|
date=Jun 1, 2002|title=Interview with David Jubb|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Interview+with+David+Jubb.-a091398457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jubb claims food with life-forces have “measurable biophotonic energy”.&lt;ref name=Jubb/&gt; “[Cooked food] is an error because no other life force on the whole of the earth eats cooked food except for humans. If we were meant to eat cooked food wed be born with stoves attached,” he said.&lt;ref name="findarticles1"/&gt;

Jubb promotes a 14 Day Nutritional Fast and Liver Flush and advises clients on nutritional fasts.&lt;ref name="villagevoice2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jubb/&gt;

He learned of the life food diet from [[Ann Wigmore]], and became her scientific advisor.

==Breatharianism==
Jubb has claimed to be a [[breatharian]], obtaining his primary nourishment from light and air.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;  He described "It's taken years of evolution to get to this place.  I recommend someone first become a Lifefoodarian. Then move toward liquidarian, then to breatharian. Since 1995, I've basically practiced a very austere form of 'going without.'&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;

Jubbs was a raw foodist for over a decade before the late 90’s when he says he began eating only herbal tea with honey, gaining his nutrition from "intestinal flora and friendly yeast" and his own urine.&lt;ref name="highbeam1"/&gt; "The ancient ones wanted us to know it's no secret why death occurs, so they put eat in the middle," he said &lt;ref name="highbeam1"/&gt;

Jubb’s breatharianism is not constant, and it involves eating very little rather than nothing.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt; "When I have broken down over the years, what I always like to have is a piece of cheesecake," he said.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;

==Urine therapy==
Jubb practices [[urine therapy]], drinking his own urine a few times a day.&lt;ref name="highbeam1"/&gt; "I absolutely live off my own urine,” he said.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;

==Followers and promotion==
Jubb promotes his view on diet and nutrition via talks, classes, books, and his public television show  "The Universe Inside Our Mind".&lt;ref name="findarticles1"/&gt;  He wrote "Secrets of an Alkaline Body" and "Jubb's Cell Rejuvenation."&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jubb/&gt;

Designer [[Donna Karan]] followed the diet as well as other celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Diet and Fitness |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/dietandfitness/3300176/How-Donna-Karan-had-her-cake-ate-it-and-still-lost-20-pounds.html |title=How Donna Karan had her cake, ate it and still lost 20 pounds |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jubb also maintains a wiki on topics such as “colloidal biology, zero point energy, cellular cleansing, whole brain functioning, lifefood, nutrition, ancient archeology, gender and economic egalitarianism.”&lt;ref name=Jubb/&gt;

He ran a health food store in New York City called Jubbs' Longevity, which is no longer open.

==Personal life==
Jubb grew up on the [[Furneaux Islands]] near [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;  He got his doctorate in physiology from New York University and became a raw foodist.
"I used to live off potatoes and bread.  I was a starchaholic," he said.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="villagevoice2000"/&gt;

He scuba dives, hikes, and practices yoga.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt; He describes himself as “a Shaman in the Native American Toltec tradition”&lt;ref name=Jubb/&gt; and a lover of Manhattan’s [[East Village (Manhattan)|East VIllage]].

'''Ferrer d'Abella''' (or ''de Apilia'') was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, diplomat, and scholar of the fourteenth century. He was the [[Latin Archbishop of Neopatras]] from some time before June 1323 until September 1330, when he was made [[Bishop of Mazzara]], in [[Sicily]]. He had tried to become [[Archbishop of Torres]] in [[Sardinia]] in 1325, but was met with opposition and animosity of [[Pope John XXII]].

His influence with the [[House of Barcelona]] which ruled in [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]], Sicily, and Sardinia was great. He was succeeded in Neopatras by one John Mascó.

'''Friedrich Franz Karl Hecker''' (September 28, 1811 – March 24, 1881) was a German lawyer, politician and revolutionary.  He was one of the most popular speakers and agitators of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]]. After moving to the United States, he served as a [[brigade]] commander in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Education and politics==
Born at Eichtersheim (now [[Angelbachtal]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]]), the son of a revenue official, he studied law at the [[University of Heidelberg]] with the intention of becoming a lawyer. In Heidelberg he became a member of the [[Corps Rhenania Heidelberg|Corps Rhenania]]. In 1838, he was an advocate before the Supreme Court in Mannheim.{{sfn|''New International Encyclopædia''|1905}} He abandoned the legal profession on being elected to the Second Chamber of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] in 1842, and at once began to take part in the opposition against the government, which assumed a more and more openly [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] character. His talents as an agitator and his personal charm won him wide popularity and influence. His influence helped to oust the Blittersdorf ministry from office.{{sfn|''New International Encyclopædia''|1905}}

In early 1845 the political issue of the incorporation of [[Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig and Holstein]] with [[Denmark]] arose in the public eye, with a particular interest to democratically minded politicians who favored unity of all the German states as a core of their programme. On February 6 he gave a speech opposing this annexation in the Baden Second Chamber, which gave him much notoriety outside Baden. On March 9 his friend and liberal compatriot [[:de:Adolf Sander (Baden)|Adolf Sander]] died suddenly of a lung disease, marking the beginning an ever increasing tone of bitterness by Hecker toward the government. Later that year he and [[:de:Johann Adam von Itzstein|Johann Adam von Itzstein]] conducted a campaign of democracy, one result of which was his expulsion from [[Prussia]] on the occasion of a journey to [[Stettin]], which had the effect of adding to his popularity.  During this time, even before the outbreak of the revolution, he also began to lean towards [[socialism]].{{sfn|von Weech|1905}}{{sfn|Hashagen|1911|p=194}}

==1848-49 revolutions==
{{POV check|section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Friedrich Hecker.png|thumb|Glorification of Friedrich Hecker]]
In 1847 he was temporarily occupied with ideas of emigration, and with this object made a journey to [[Algiers]], but returned to Baden and resumed his former position as the radical champion of popular rights, later becoming president of the [[:de:Volksverein (Baden)|Volksverein]], where he was destined to fall still further under the influence of the agitator [[Gustav von Struve]]. In conjunction with Struve he drew up the radical programme carried at the great Liberal meeting held at [[Offenburg]] on September 12, 1847 (entitled ''Thirteen Claims put forward by the People of Baden''). In addition to the Offenburg programme, the Sturm petition of March 1, 1848, attempted to extort from the government the most far-reaching concessions. But it was in vain that on becoming a deputy Hecker endeavoured to carry out its impracticable provisions. He had to yield to the more moderate majority, but on this account was driven still further towards the Left. The proof lies in the new Offenburg demands of March 19, and in the resolution moved by Hecker in the preliminary [[Frankfurt Parliament]] that Germany should be declared a republic. But neither in Baden nor Frankfurt did he at any time gain his point.{{sfn|Hashagen|1911|p=194}}

[[File:Friedrich Heckers farewell.png|thumb|left|Friedrich Hecker leaving Germany at [[Strasbourg|Strassburg]]]]
This double failure, combined with various energetic measures of the government, which were indirectly aimed at him (e.g. the arrest of the editor of the ''Constanzer Seeblatt'', a friend of Hecker's, in Karlsruhe station on April 8), inspired Hecker with the idea of an armed rising under pretext of the foundation of the German republic. The 9th to 11 April were secretly spent in preliminaries of what would be known as the [[Hecker Uprising]]. On April 12, Hecker and Struve sent a proclamation to the inhabitants of the [[Seekreis]] and of the [[Black Forest]] to summon the people who could bear arms to [[Donaueschingen]] at mid-day on the 14th, with arms, ammunition and provisions for six days. They expected 70,000 men, but only a few thousand appeared.{{sfn|Hashagen|1911|p=194}}

The grand-ducal government of the Seekreis was dissolved, and Hecker gradually gained reinforcements. But friendly advisers also joined him, pointing out the risks of his undertaking. Hecker, however, was not at all ready to listen to them. On the contrary, he added to violence an absurd defiance, and offered an amnesty to the German princes on condition of their retiring within fourteen days into private life. The troops of Baden and [[Hesse]] marched against him, under the command of General [[Friedrich von Gagern]], and on April 20 they met near [[Kandern]], where, although Gagern was killed, Hecker was completely defeated.{{sfn|Hashagen|1911|p=194}}

He fled into the [[Canton of Basel]], where he published a radical newspaper, and wrote his work ''Die Volkserhebung in Baden'' (“The popular uprising in Baden”). Although he was again elected to the chamber of Baden, the government, no longer willing to respect his immunity as a deputy, refused its ratification. On being refused admission to the Frankfort Parliament, though twice elected to represent [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Thiengen]], Hecker resolved in September 1848 to emigrate to North America like many other “[[Forty-Eighters]],” and bought a farm near [[Belleville, Illinois]].{{sfn|''New International Encyclopædia''|1905}}

==American experience and the Civil War==
[[File:Colonel Friedrich Hecker.png|thumb|Colonel Hecker during the American Civil War.]]
After moving to the United States, Hecker always maintained an acute interest in events in Germany. In the spring of 1849, the Baden revolution re-ignited, and Hecker returned to Europe to participate. However, he only made it as far as [[Strassburg]] when word came that the insurrection had been defeated by Prussian troops and he returned to Illinois.{{sfn|Hashagen|1911|p=194}} In 1851 he wrote a foreword to the German translation of [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''The Rights of Man'' which was published in Leipzig in 1851.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

However, like most [[Forty-Eighters]], his attention became increasingly focused on domestic political issues in the United States, and in particular the issue of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing slavery]].{{sfn|Cole|1922|pp=23-25}}  When the [[Illinois Republican Party]] was organized at a convention in 1856, German-American Forty-Eighters were everywhere conspicuous in the proceedings; Hecker and [[Abraham Lincoln]] were selected to be the two [[Electoral College (United States)|electors-at-large]] if [[John Frémont]] were to win the state (which he did not).{{sfn|Cole|1922|p=146}} The Republicans attracted a wide array of political perspectives, with often strongly divergent views except for their opposition to slavery, and the interests of the immigrant Forty-Eighters was in conflict with the nativist [[Know Nothing]]s. The influence of Hecker and the other German-American leaders was critical in keeping the party unified in regard to its most important principles.{{sfn|Cole|1922|p=151}}

After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], Lincoln called for [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|75,000 volunteers]] from among the state militia. The Illinois allotment of 6,000 volunteers was exceeded in five days.  By June, ten regiments had been accepted, one of which was the [[24th Illinois Infantry Regiment]], commanded by now [[Colonel]] Hecker. The 24th Illinois was the first unit mobilized from Chicago, and was made up of German, Hungarian, Czech and Slovak immigrants, mostly Forty-Eighters.  In the early days of the war, the 24th Illinois primarily was assigned to garrison and other rear echelon duties in the western theaters.  Under the conditions of dreary guard duty, and not being professional soldiers, morale and discipline faltered, and Hecker resigned his command on December 23, 1861.{{sfn|Wagner|1864|pp=5-8}}  The 24th continued on, still under the informal name of "Hecker's Old Regiment," and saw action throughout the western theater, including at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]].

In October 1862, he became colonel of the [[82nd Illinois Infantry Regiment]].  Approximately two-thirds of its members were German immigrants and most of the other third was composed of immigrants from various countries. Company C was entirely made up of [[Ashkenazi Jews|European Jews]], and Company I was all [[Scandinavia]]ns.  The unit served in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|eastern campaigns]], and Hecker was badly wounded at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] on May 2, 1863. After recovering from his wounds, he later served at the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]] and in the capturing of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]].  Hecker resigned this command on March 21, 1864, but like the 24th Illinois, "Hecker's Second Regiment" continued on active duty for the remainder of the war.

When Hecker returned home, almost immediately he became involved in a political split in the Republican Party.  Dissatisfaction among [[Radical Republican|radical republicans]] with Lincoln's middle political road came to a head in May 1864 when Hecker led a faction of Frémont supporters to oppose Lincoln's renomination.  The Lincoln faction won, and Hecker and others organized an independent convention in Cleveland to nominate Frémont (Frémont ultimately withdrew).  The effect, in the end, was to strengthen Lincoln's candidacy among mainstream Republicans.{{sfn|Cole|1922|p=316}}

==Post-war activities and reputation==
[[File:Friedrich Heckers Farm.png|thumb|350px|right|Friedrich Hecker's Farm in [[Summerfield, Illinois|Summerfield]], Illinois]]
After the war, Hecker returned to his farm in Illinois. It was with great joy that he heard of the union of Germany brought about by the [[Franco-Prussian War|victory over France]] in 1870-71. It was then that he gave his famous address at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in which he gave animated expression to the enthusiasm of the German Americans for their newly united fatherland. After the war, he became more and more involved in the [[German-language]] press and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] activities. He received a less favourable impression when he visited Germany in 1873 for criticizing lack of individual rights and the size of government in the new German government organization. He died at his farm in [[Summerfield, Illinois|Summerfield]], Illinois on March 24, 1881.{{sfn|Hashagen|1911|p=194}}

Hecker was always very much a favourite with all the German democrats. The song ("Heckerlied") and the hat named after him (a broad [[slouch hat]] with a feather) became famous as the symbols of the middle-classes in revolt. In America he won great esteem, not only on political grounds but also for his personal qualities.{{sfn|Hashagen|1911|p=194}}

==Descendants==

Among Hecker's male-line descendants are US Army Col. [[Bill Hecker]], a veteran of the [[Vietnam War]], and Major [[William F.  Hecker]], a former English instructor at [[West Point]] and scholar of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s military career who was killed in the [[Iraq War]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/41506256&lt;/ref&gt;

Larha became famous when he committed the [[Contract killing|contract murder]] of 77-year-old crippled businessman Wilhelm Högsten in [[Jollas (Helsinki)|Jollas]], a suburb of [[Helsinki]], on 24 April 1992. Larha was hired by Högsten's 47-year-old son Fred. Larha, Högsten and 31-year-old businessman Hannu Ratia, who drove Larha to the site of the murder, were sentenced to [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]].

On 25 February 1994 Larha escaped from a Helsinki state prison with 37-year-old Kullervo Haikas, alias Pertti Ruokolainen, who had been serving a 13-year sentence for [[drug-related crime|drug crimes]]. 

On 1 March, Larha robbed a [[bank]] in [[Pitäjänmäki]], nearly killing a [[cashier]].
 
After this, Larha and Haikas barricaded themselves with two hostages in an [[apartment]] in [[Lahti]]. Police discovered them on 15 March. This started a [[siege]] that lasted for 55 hours. While Haikas and the hostages were rescued, Larha committed suicide on 17 March 1994, shooting himself simultaneously with two handguns.

Finland's president [[Tarja Halonen]] [[pardon]]ed Hannu Ratia in the end of 2005 and Fred Högsten in May 2006.

'''Johann Friedrich Hohenberger''' [[Medal of the Order of Australia|OAM]] (7 September 1950{{spaced ndash}}27 July 1991), also known as '''John Friedrich''', was executive director of the [[National Safety Council of Australia]] during the 1980s. He was the subject of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria's]] biggest fraud case and known as "Australia's greatest [[confidence trick|conman]]".

==Early life and career==
Hohenberger was a [[Federal Republic of Germany|West German]] national. In August 1972, he began working as an independent contractor with the German road construction company Strassen und Teerbau. Around July 1974, he forged road building orders from distant mountain towns and used them to order Strassen und Teerbau to build roads. No roads were ever built, and no earthworks or materials were ever bought. Hohenberger embezzled [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]200,000 from the company.&lt;ref name="TheFraud"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Martin | year = 1991 | title = The Fraud: Behind the Mystery of John Friedrich, Australia's Greatest Conman | publisher = Pagemasters | location = Melbourne | isbn = 1-875575-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hohenberger was on a skiing holiday in Italy at the time German police issued a warrant for his arrest. He never returned to Germany. Having gone out onto the slopes and not returned, it was thought he had died. Although German police were sceptical of his disappearance, believing that somebody had tipped him off to the investigation, the discovery of his bags over a year later reinforced the theory that he had either had an accident or committed suicide.&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt;

==Move to Australia==
On 20 January 1975, Hohenberger arrived in [[Melbourne]] on a flight from [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. According to [[DIMIA|Department of Immigration]] records, Hohenberger left Australia on a flight to [[Singapore]] on 22 January. It is thought he tricked Australian Customs into believing he had boarded a plane but remained in Australia.&lt;ref name="FOI"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Friedrich's Official Identity|last=Chandler|first=Jo|publisher=The Age|date=29 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the name John Friedrich and fake qualifications, Hohenberger obtained a contract with construction company [[Codelfa Cogefar]], working on part of the [[City Loop, Melbourne|Melbourne underground rail loop]].&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt; He subsequently worked for the Board of Ecumenical Missions and Relations (BOEMAR), a [[Uniting Church in Australia]] organisation responsible for the Church's [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[Christian mission|missions]].&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt; He was offered the position of community adviser at [[Pukatja, South Australia|Ernabella]] in South Australia, where he was to assist the Aboriginal community with its development and to supervise civil works.&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt;

While working in Ernabella, Friedrich became ill with a serious infection and was treated by nurse Shirley Manning. Friedrich and Manning became engaged in October 1975 and married on 10 February 1976 in Sydney.&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt; They moved to the BOEMAR mission on [[Mornington Island]], where Shirley was to work as a nursing sister and John as the manager. During his time on Mornington, Friedrich was responsible to the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] as well as to the Church. While the Church was only concerned with the day-to-day running of the island, as an agent of the government, Friedrich acted as a coastal watcher for the [[Royal Australian Navy]], a fisheries officer, a licensee for the government-owned pub, an agent for a shipping company and the airline that serviced the island, a reporting officer for the [[Civil Aviation Safety Authority|Department of Civil Aviation]].&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt; Friedrich also began studying again while at Mornington, working on an external master's degree in engineering science with the [[University of Queensland]]. The Friedrichs resigned from BOEMAR in late 1976 but stayed to oversee relief opportunities until January 1977 after [[Pre-1980 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons#Cyclone Ted|Cyclone Ted]] destroyed 90 per cent of all buildings on the island.

==National Safety Council==
In November 1976, the Friedrichs had taken a holiday to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. While there, having seen an advertisement in ''[[The Age]]'', Friedrich applied for the position of safety engineer with the [[National Safety Council of Australia]] (NSCA) Victorian Division, to be based at the [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria|State Electricity Commission]] of Victoria (SECV) [[Yallourn Power Station, Victoria|Yallourn power station]] in the [[Latrobe Valley]]. Upon returning to Mornington, Friedrich was informed that the job at Yallourn was his if he wanted it. Friedrich began working for the NSCA in January 1977.&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt;
	
Friedrich became executive director of NSCA in 1982 and began to transform it into a national [[search and rescue]] organisation. He built up the company with loans in which 27 banks agreed to lend millions of dollars with little more surety than Friedrich's word. McGregor-Lowndes attributes this lack of probity to the [[halo effect]] of NSCA and Friedrich himself.&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt; In 1988, he was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] (OAM) "in recognition of service to the community, particularly in the area of industrial safety and search and rescue services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=874640&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true|title=It's an Honour – Honours – Search Australian Honours|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the financial collapse of NSCA in 1989, Friedrich went into hiding.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;{{citation|title=The National Safety Council Fraud – Regulatory Slip or Systemic Regulatory Failure?|author=Myles McGregor-Lowndes|publisher=Criminology Research Council|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a nationwide and international manhunt, involving all Australian police forces and [[Interpol]], he was arrested in Perth, Western Australia on 6 April 1989. He was initially charged with one count of obtaining financial advantage by deception. On 1 November, he was charged on a further 91 counts of obtaining property by deception.

In subsequent investigations, it was discovered that Friedrich was not an Australian citizen, did not possess any valid birth certificate, and did not appear on any electoral roll. This caused considerable embarrassment to the Department of Defence, which had given him a security clearance and almost unlimited access to [[Royal Australian Air Force]] bases.&lt;ref name="FOI"/&gt;

The Friedrichs lived with Shirley's brother in Sydney until the start of the trial. On 23 July 1991, Friedrich appeared in court for fraud involving [[Australian dollar|$]]296,662,436.99.&lt;ref name="TheFraud"/&gt;

==Death==
On 27 July 1991, Friedrich was found dead on his farm near [[Sale, Victoria]] with a single gunshot wound to the head in in wide open muddy  field. A helicopter was seen flying low over this area prior to the discovery of the mans body.   His death was ruled to be suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/04/06/2535979.htm|title=Twenty years on|date=6 April 2009|website=www.abc.net.au|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autobiography==
Friedrich was writing an autobiography with the assistance of [[Richard Flanagan]] at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/conversations/conversations-richard-flanagan/9032374 Friedrich and Flanagan: the con-man and his ghostwriter October 16, 2017] ''[[Conversations (radio program)|Conversations]]'' Retrieved October 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was published posthumously.&lt;ref name="Iago"&gt;John Friedrich with Richard Flanagan. ''Codename Iago: The Story of John Friedrich''. Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85561-452-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he claimed to have been born in South Australia in 1945 to German parents, attended boarding school in [[West Germany]] and studied engineering at the [[Technische Hochschule]]. Friedrich also claimed that, while working for an American construction company, he was recruited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and, under the codename "Iago", worked in [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Egypt]], [[New Zealand]] and West Germany against far left-wing extremists before returning to Australia in 1975.&lt;ref name="Iago"/&gt; Simon Caterson, writing in ''[[The Australian]]'', described it as "one of the least reliable but most fascinating memoirs in the annals of Australian publishing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/all-memoirs-are-verily-unreliable/story-e6frg8n6-1111116038527|last=Caterson|first=Simon|title=All memoirs are verily unreliable|publisher=The Australian|date=12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent 2017 essay by Caterson likening Friedrich to [[Jeff Tracy]] is titled "John Friedrich: Australia's Most Altruistic Fraudster".&lt;ref&gt;https://dailyreview.com.au/john-friedrich-one-australias-notorious-enigmatic-imposters/64910/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevan David Jones''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|PC|MP}} (born 25 April 1964) is a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]], who has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[North Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|North Durham]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]. He resigned as a shadow defence minister in January 2016 in protest against a front bench reshuffle by Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]].

==Early life==
Jones was born in [[Nottinghamshire]] and is the son of a coal miner. He attended Portland Comprehensive School in [[Worksop]] and [[Northumbria University|Newcastle Polytechnic]] and the [[University of Southern Maine]], gaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (Hons) in Government and Public Policy. Before becoming an MP, he was a [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] councillor from 1990 to 2001 and Chairman of the Development Committee as well as an elected officer of the [[GMB Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parliamentaryyearbook.co.uk/mp-member/jones-kevan.html|title=Parliamentary Yearbook|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
Jones was first elected as MP for North Durham in 2001 with a majority of 18,681. After becoming member of Parliament, Jones became a member of the influential [[Defence Select Committee]], and also a member of the Labour Party's Parliamentary Committee. His [[Private Member's Bill]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wear/3746178.stm |title=Christmas store ban set to be law  |work=[[BBC News]] | date=15 October 2004|accessdate= 18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; successfully passed Parliament, and came into force in December 2004. The Act makes it illegal for large shops to open on Christmas Day.

He was re-elected to the North Durham seat in the 2005 general election, with a majority of 16,781. He polled 64.1% of the vote. His campaigning on behalf of people who had coal health compensation payments deducted by unscrupulous claims handlers influenced the [[Compensation Act 2006]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevan Jones bio|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/kevan-david-jones|website=Politics.co.uk|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministerial career===
Jones was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Veterans at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/77428463-6C55-46F2-AEE4-522FB73D1B98/0/mod_arac0809_vol2.pdf |title=MOD – 2008–2009 annual report and accounts – (Minister for Veterans). Mr Kevan Jones MP.

In August 2009 he was accused of briefing against the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]], [[Richard Dannatt|General Sir Richard Dannatt]], who had been an outspoken critic of the government's record on equipping troops.&lt;ref name="skirmish"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/an-unpleasant-skirmish-at-the-ministry-1776202.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=An unpleasant skirmish at the ministry | first=Brian | last=Brady | date=23 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister at centre of alleged smear campaign against General Sir Richard Dannatt|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/6057787/Minister-at-centre-of-alleged-smear-campaign-against-General-Sir-Richard-Dannatt.html|accessdate=7 January 2016|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=20 Aug 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A series of FOI requests had been made&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/6073767/Help-for-Heroes-dragged-into-General-Sir-Richard-Dannatt-smear-campaign.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | title=Help for Heroes dragged into General Sir Richard Dannatt 'smear campaign' | first1=Melissa | last1=Kite | first2=Ben | last2=Leach | date=22 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning Dannat's expenses, and blogger [[Paul Staines|Guido Fawkes]] 'outed' Jones as the culprit, although he did not provide any evidence that directly connected Jones to the requests. Jones, who had tabled Parliamentary questions on Army officials' spending before becoming a minister,&lt;ref name="skirmish" /&gt; denied the allegations and said he had a good working relationship with Dannatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8210781.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Minister denies Army chief 'plot' | date=19 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones publicly apologised to [[Joanna Lumley]] in March 2010 after he had accused her of "deathly silence" over misleading advice being given to some Gurkhas following Lumley's successful campaign to allow more Gurkhas to settle in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/7535165/Defence-minister-apologises-to-Joanna-Lumley-over-Gurkha-row.html|title=Defence minister apologises to Joanna Lumley over Gurkha row|date=29 March 2010|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7407716/Joanna-Lumley-irritates-minister-over-Gurkhas.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]  | title=Joanna Lumley 'irritates' minister over Gurkhas | first=James | last=Kirkup | date=9 March 2010 | accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opposition===
In May 2010 [[Harriet Harman]] appointed Jones Shadow [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces|Minister for the Armed Forces]], outside [[First Shadow Cabinet of Harriet Harman|the Shadow Cabinet]].  He retained this position under Labour leader [[Ed Miliband]] and in [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s first appointment of shadow ministers in 2015.&lt;ref name=kevanjones-bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kevanjonesmp.org.uk/bio |title=Kevan's Biography |publisher=Kevan Jones |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a member of the special Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmarmed/779/77901.htm|accessdate = 20 September 2013| title=Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill|publisher = www.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a member of the [[Public Bill Committee]] for the [[Defence Reform Act 2014]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/defencereform/committees/houseofcommonspublicbillcommitteeonthedefencereformbill201314.html|title=House of Commons Public Bill Committee on the Defence Reform Bill 2013–14 |publisher=www.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 Jones made public his strong criticism of the new Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], in particular after Corbyn opposed military intervention in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Jones stated "because of [Corbyn's] incompetence, the Tories are getting away with things that are not being properly scrutinised and the people who are suffering are the ones that we represent."&lt;ref name=independent-20151204&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-is-incompetent-says-shadow-defence-minister-a6761136.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn is 'incompetent' says shadow Defence Minister |author=Samuel Osborne |newspaper=The Independent |date=4 December 2015 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones supported the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Labour rebels who didn’t back the Yemen vote have blood on their hands |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/emily-thornberry-labour-mps-blood-hands-yemen-conflict-saudi-arabia |work=The Guardian |date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is Treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Industrial Heritage.&lt;ref name="parliament1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/170329/industrial-heritage.htm|title=Register Of All-Party Parliamentary Groups [as at 29 March 2017]|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation as shadow Defence Minister===
In January 2016, Jones resigned as a Shadow Minister for the Armed Forces, following a reshuffle in which [[Jeremy Corbyn]] had promoted [[Emily Thornberry]], who opposes the [[Successor to the UK Trident system|replacement of the Trident nuclear weapon system]], to [[Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn|shadow Defence Secretary]]. In his resignation letter, Jones said he believed that the country had to "maintain a credible nuclear deterrent, while working to advance global nuclear disarmament."&lt;ref name=guardian-20160106&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jan/06/labour-reshuffle-mcfadden-says-he-was-sacked-for-criticising-apologists-for-terrorism-live |title=Kevan Jones becomes third shadow minister to resign following Corbyn's reshuffle - Politics live |author=Andrew Sparrow |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
In 2012, in a debate in Parliament on mental health issues and their taboo, Jones spoke about his own battles with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], alongside Conservative back-bencher [[Charles Walker (British politician)|Charles Walker]], who spoke about his own 30-year battle with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Jones stated that he had suffered with depression since 1996. Jones and Walker were both later praised for their speeches by Time to Change, a mental health anti-stigma campaign run by charities [[Mind (charity)|Mind]] and [[Rethink Mental Illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18444516|title=MPs reveal mental health issues|date=14 June 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, after the appointment of the former [[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]] to co-chair the Labour Party's review of whether to replace the [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] [[nuclear missile]] system, Jones, a Shadow Junior Defence Minister, told the PoliticsHome website he was not sure Livingstone knew anything about defence and his appointment would only damage credibility among those who care about defence. In response, Livingstone told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and others that Jones was "obviously depressed and disturbed" and "should see a GP". Jones responded that the remarks "belong in the dark ages" and that mental health should not be used to attack political differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ken-livingstones-comments-about-mental-health-belong-in-the-dark-ages-says-mp-kevan-jones-a6739216.html|title=Ken Livingstone's comments about mental health 'belong in the dark ages' says the MP he attacked|date=18 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livingstone eventually apologised, only doing so unreservedly via Twitter after intervention by Labour Leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34853430|title=Livingstone makes 'unreserved' apology|date=18 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later noted in passing that Jones had himself in 2010 ridiculed a political viewpoint by reference to "the nearest lunatic asylum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2015/11/commons-confidential-away-pret-manger Corbyn's lunch, a Keith "Vazz" hunch and the New Left Book club].

'''Lewis Goldsmith''' (c. 1763 &amp;ndash; 6 January 1846) was an Anglo-French [[publicist]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]-[[Jew]]ish extraction. He is thought to have been born in [[Richmond, London|Richmond, Surrey]].

==Allied with Napoleon==
In 1801, Goldsmith published ''The Crimes of Cabinets, or a Review of the Plans and Aggressions for Annihilating the Liberties of France and the Dismemberment of her Territories'', an attack on the military policy of [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]. Soon afterward, in 1802, he moved from London to [[Paris]]. There [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] introduced him to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. With Napoleon's assistance, Goldsmith established the ''Argus'', a biweekly publication in English reviewing English affairs from a French point of view.

In 1803, according to Goldsmith's own account, he was entrusted with a mission to obtain from the [[Counts of Provence|Comte de Provence]], the head of the French royal family and subsequent King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], a renunciation of his claim to the throne of France in return for the throne of [[Poland]]. The offer was declined. Goldsmith says he then received instructions to kidnap Louis, or to kill him if he resisted. Instead, Goldsmith revealed the plot. Until 1807, however, when his [[French Revolution|Republican]] sympathies began to wane, Goldsmith continued to undertake secret service missions on behalf of Napoleon.

Goldsmith's hand has been seen in the ''Revolutionary Plutarch'' of 1804–05, an ''émigré'' work edited in London, and with a title harking back to the ''British Plutarch'' of [[Thomas Mortimer (writer)|Thomas Mortimer]]. That would imply that Goldsmith was by then already playing a double game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Olivier Lutaud|title=Des révolutions d'Angleterre à la Révolution française: Le tyrannicide et 'Killing No Murder' (Cromwell, Athalie, Bonaparte)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N74IFY-meWQC&amp;pg=PA272|date=31 July 1973|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-1509-1|page=272|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Napoleon==
Goldsmith returned to England in 1809. At first he was arrested and imprisoned, but soon was released and established himself as a [[Solicitor|notary]] in London. By 1811 he had become strongly anti-republican, founding the ''Anti-Gallican Monitor'' and ''Anti-Corsican Chronicle'' (subsequently known as the ''British Monitor'') through which he now denounced the French Revolution. He proposed that a price be put on Napoleon's head by public subscription, but found himself condemned by the British government. In 1810 he published ''Secret History of the Cabinet of Bonaparte'' and ''Recueil des manifestes, proclamations, discours, etc. de Napoleon Buonaparte'' (Collection of the Decrees of Napoleon Bonaparte); and in 1812 he published a ''Secret History of Bonaparte's Diplomacy''. He claimed Napoleon then offered him 200,000 [francs?] to discontinue his attacks. In 1815, he published ''An Appeal to the Governments of Europe on the Necessity of Bringing Napoleon Bonaparte to a Public Trial''.

==Later life==
In 1825, he moved back to Paris, publishing his ''Statistics of France'' a few years later. His only child, Georgiana, become the second wife of [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst]] in 1837. He died ‘of paralysis’ after an illness lasting several months, in his home on the Rue de la Paix, Paris, on 6 January 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mel Cornshucker''' (born October 4, 1952) is a contemporary [[Cherokee]] potter living in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], who works in stoneware, porcelain, and [[Raku ware|raku]] clay. Cornshucker is known for his high-fire stoneware, decorated with hand-painted, Native-inspired motifs and designs.&lt;ref name="Indian Arts Board"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iacb.doi.gov/museums/archives/splains-archive-2012625.html|title= US Dept. of Interior Indian Arts and Crafts Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born and raised in [[Jay, Oklahoma]], and a member of the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]], Cornshucker was inspired by other artists in his family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Tesina|url=http://www.cherokeephoenix.org/Article/index/7817|accessdate=April 29, 2015|publisher=Cherokee Phoenix|date=December 9, 2013|title=Cheorkee Potter makes Contemporary Pieces}}&lt;/ref&gt; including his grandfather, Lincoln Trotting Wolf's, talent for weaving. His grandfather built his own rug loom on which he made rugs and blankets on the front porch. Cornshucker's cousins were basket weavers and his father was a silversmith, allowing him several creative outlets in his youth. Cornshucker spent many summers with his Cherokee family in [[Jay, Oklahoma|Jay]].&lt;ref name="oral history"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearson-Little Thunder|first1=Julie|title=Oral History Interview with Mel Cornshucker|journal=Oklahoma Native Artists|date=March 11, 2011|url=http://dc.library.okstate.edu/cdm/ref/collection/Spot/id/429|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had positive encouragement in public schools when he began making figurines out of wet plaster and metal sculptures.

==Education==
After graduating high school in 1970, Cornshucker briefly attended [[Bacone College]] in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] before transferring to [[Southwest Baptist University]] in [[Bolivar, Missouri]] working to become a tribal lawyer. It was during this time, Cornshucker took college art class which sparked his interest in pottery. Cornshucker was hired in 1975 to work as an apprentice potter in the Missouri theme park, [[Silver Dollar City]]. This job opportunity allowed him a lot of room to grow because he was perfecting his art every day for three to four hours for tourists.  He left Silver Dollar City in 1977 and moved to Colorado where he became a land surveyor. After six months, Cornshucker moved back home to set up his own studio in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;ref name="oral history" /&gt;

==Career==
When Cornshucker set up in his own studio, he began to compete in more booth shows as well as galleries. When Cornshucker began to do more Native shows, he experienced an increase in the amount of galleries taking on his work. In the early 1980's, Cornshucker would do approximately 15-16 gallery shows per year.&lt;ref name="oral history" /&gt; Cornshucker also began incorporating his trademark Native motifs on his pottery around this time. The dragonfly was a special symbol for him not only because of its symbolism for many tribal cultures, but also because of its association with his grandfather, Lincoln Trotting Wolf.&lt;ref name="oral history" /&gt; Cornshucker is also part owner of the [http://thebradyartsdistrict.com/?q=business/brady-artists-studio Brady Artists Studio] with Donna Prigmore.

In 2007, Cornshucker was selected to participate in a cultural exchange with African artists, put on by the [[Kellogg Foundation]] in tandem with the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]] of Santa Fe. Cornshucker worked in a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] village and put on a workshop for the Zulu potters. The goal of this program was for the American potters to offer tips and advice on how to better market the Zulu potters' work. Cornshucker helped influence the creation of clay masks and rattles to be sold in the markets.&lt;ref name="oral history" /&gt;

==Collections==
Cornshucker is considered a modern potter who values the functionality of his pieces while aesthetically including Native American motifs in his signature designs. He strives to create pieces that communicate past and present  Native American spirit which reflects his heritage and honors the creativity of man over time. He has shown his work in a variety of nationally significant markets, including the [https://www.eiteljorg.org/explore/festivals-and-events/indian-market-festival Eiteljorg Indian Market and Festival],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Indian Market and Festival|url=http://www.eiteljorg.org/docs/festivals-events-docs/2012-imf-artist-list.pdf?sfvrsn=0|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://www.swaia.org/ Sante Fe Indian Market], the [http://www.pueblogrande.org/indian-market/ Pueblo Grande Museum Indian Art Show] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and the [https://archive.is/20150429182540/http://www.cahokiamounds.org/news-events/blog/2012/06/12/271/ Contemporary Indian Art Show] at [[Cahokia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Serra|first1=Janet|title=Famous Native American Potter at the Institute for American Indian Studies|url=http://patch.com/connecticut/woodbury-middlebury/famous-native-american-potter-at-the-institute-for-american-indian-studies|accessdate=April 29, 2015|publisher=Woodbury-Middlebury Patch|date=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Miller was born [[Des Moines, Iowa]] in 1956, and raised there as well. He states that he worked as an [[Industrial engineering]] manager for [[Michelin Tire Company]]. Miller says that in his childhood, he admired [[Walt Disney]] and [[Davy Crockett]].&lt;ref name="occidental" /&gt;

In 2000, Miller produced and directed a western movie, ''[[Jericho (2001 film)|Jericho]]'', with [[Mark Valley]] as the title character. Retired [[U. S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] drill instructor [[R. Lee Ermey]] appeared in the movie, as did [[Buck Taylor]] and country artist [[Lisa Stewart]].&lt;ref name="imdb6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285242/|title=Jericho (2000)|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's shift in ideology led him to found Americana Pictures, based in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]], Miller's current home. According to its mission statement, the company aims "to develop, produce and market quality motion pictures, which promote fresh talent and the best of traditional European-American ideals."&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americana-pictures.com/index.php|title=Americana Pictures: "Restoring the Dream"|accessdate=February 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313003815/http://americana-pictures.com/index.php|archivedate=March 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americana Pictures' first film was said to be about the [[USS Liberty incident]], which he referred to as a "shocking Israeli attack" on the United States. He said he was planning to produce ''The Liberator'' (which was to be based on the history of [[Arminius]] and the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]).&lt;ref name="occidental" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americana-pictures.com/plans.php|title=Plans|accessdate=February 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313012433/http://americana-pictures.com/plans.php|archivedate=March 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a favorable review of the [[Martin Campbell]] movie ''[[Edge of Darkness (2010 film)|Edge of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref name="mel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theoccidentalobserver.net/tooblog/?p=724|title=Edge of Darkness|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
During the 2000s, Miller began to take on an increasingly [[paleoconservative]] political stance. He also became harshly critical of [[Hollywood]], claiming that it "surreptitiously seeks to destroy our [[European-American]] heritage and our Christian-based traditional values, and replace them with values that debase these traditional values and elevate [[ethnic minority|minorities]] as paragons of virtue and wisdom....Today's motion pictures, in concert with other forms of mass media entertainment, are the greatest enemies to the well-being of our progeny and the future of our country." Miller has also accused Hollywood of being under "[[Jewish]]-[[Zionist]] control"; he cites [[Kevin B. MacDonald]] as influencing this belief.&lt;ref name="occidental" /&gt; He has criticized celebrities such as [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], saying that they are "dysfunctional" and "come from traditional Christian or European-American backgrounds but are notorious for spurning those values."&lt;ref name="occidental" /&gt; He has cited [[Mel Gibson]] and his self-marketed movie ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' as inspirations.&lt;ref name="occidental" /&gt;

Miller also spoke at the 2008 national conference of the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]], an organization he is a member of. Miller has stated that while he does not share all the goals of the COfCC members, and rejects "extremist stances", he nonetheless agrees with the group's statement of principles. Miller states that he "doesn't like" [[interracial marriage]]; however, he does not support [[Interracial marriage bans in the southern United States|outlawing interracial marriage]], either. Miller has denied being [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], instead claiming that he merely opposes "favoritism" granted to Jews in the film industry. He also opposes [[illegal immigration]] and what he refers to as "wide open borders" in the United States.&lt;ref name="hermann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngnn.com/65041/content/2009/dec/07/arminius-movie-maker-tied-national-hate-group|title=Arminius movie maker tied to national hate group|accessdate=February 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180240/http://www.ngnn.com/65041/content/2009/dec/07/arminius-movie-maker-tied-national-hate-group|archivedate=July 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tpc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalcesspool.org/guestlist.php |title=The Political Cesspool guest list |accessdate=February 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222232315/http://www.thepoliticalcesspool.org/guestlist.php |archivedate=February 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return from Iran in 2012, he wrote on his website that he realized that the people who wanted a war between the US and Iran are "globalists (international bankers and their multinational beneficiaries). They control Israel, the American media and most of our politicians…and by extension our foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Merlin|title=Donate As The War Drums Beat|url=http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2012/09/as-the-war-drums-beat/|publisher=Occidental Observer|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
In 2008, Miller contributed $200 to the [[2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign|presidential campaign]] of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Ron Paul]]. He also served as a delegate for Paul's campaign.&lt;ref name="donation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/merlin-miller.asp?cycle=08|title=Merlin Miller Political Campaign Contributions 2008 Election Cycle|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delegate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessee.gov/sos/election/2008PPPDelegatesList.pdf|title=Candidates for Delegate|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Miller was nominated by the [[American Freedom Party]] for President of the United States in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://merlinmiller2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-Article-1st-PR-122211-Revised-01-11-2012.pdf|title=American Third Position Party nominates presidential ticket|date=January 12, 2012|work=Merlin Miller 2012|publisher=Merlin Miller|accessdate=January 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114224414/http://merlinmiller2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-Article-1st-PR-122211-Revised-01-11-2012.pdf|archivedate=November 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://american3rdposition.com/american-voice/the-sunic-journal-the-american-third-position-party%E2%80%94the-hope-of-our-future/ |title=American Third Position Party Presidential Ticket |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111195146/http://american3rdposition.com/american-voice/the-sunic-journal-the-american-third-position-party%E2%80%94the-hope-of-our-future/ |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first presidential candidate ever nominated by the party, which was founded in 2010.&lt;ref name=winger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2012/01/american-third-position-party-nominates-presidential-ticket/ "American Third Position Party nominates presidential ticket"], ''Independent Political Report''.

During the 2012 election, he received 2,307 votes (~0.0%) in these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2012&amp;minper=0&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0|title=2012 USElectionAtlas Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Miller met with Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]] for nearly 20 minutes and discussed a number of issues, including what both Miller and Ahmedinejad characterize as the "zionist-controlled media" in the West. Miller publicly defended Ahmedinejad as someone who has been unfairly demonized in western media and who cares about his people. Ahmedinejad gave Miller a collection of poems by [[Omar Khayyam]].&lt;ref name="iran"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fringe U.S. Presidential Candidate Scores Meeting With Ahmadinejad|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/09/14/fringe-us-presidential-candidate-scores-meeting-with-ahmadinejad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moses de León''' (c. 1240 &amp;ndash; 1305), known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as '''Moshe ben Shem-Tov''' ({{Hebrew|משה בן שם-טוב די-ליאון}}), was a [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spanish]] [[rabbi]] and [[Kabbalist]] who is considered the composer or redactor of the [[Zohar]]. It is a matter of controversy&lt;ref name="jewcyclo"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9767-leon-moses-ben-shem-tob-de ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; if the Zohar is his own work, or if he committed traditions going back to Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yohai]] in writing.

'''Orrin Squire Wood''' (December 14, 1817-June 22, 1909) (normally referred to as '''Orrin S. Wood''') was one of early pioneers of the telegraph industry in the United States and Canada.  

The brother-in-law of [[Ezra Cornell]], who assisted [[Samuel Morse]] in the construction of the [[Baltimore-Washington telegraph line]], Wood was recruited in August 1844 to be a telegraph operator on the line, and was Morse's first pupil.  He was one of the founders of the Magnetic Telegraph Company with Cornell, Morse, and others, in 1845.  He helped set up a telegraph exhibition in lower Manhattan in New York, and built a one-mile line for demonstration at the 1845 New York State Fair in [[Utica, New York]].  He also oversaw the building of the line between [[Albany, New York]] and Utica which opened in early 1846, the beginning of the [[Timeline of North American telegraphy|rapid expansion of the telegraph in North America]].  He then opened the first commercial telegraph office in New York City in the fall of 1846.  In 1847, he was recruited to be president of the newly formed [[Montreal Telegraph Company]], which rapidly established lines to Toronto and, Quebec City, and then New York in August 1847.&lt;ref name="wire1"&gt;(1 September 1906).

Duggan House, a mansion in Montreal now owned by [[McGill University]], was built for Wood in 1861.&lt;ref name="dugg1"&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/fph/duggan-house Duggan House], McGill.ca, Retrieved 20 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the bookies' favourite throughout the show and eventually won with 61.2% of the final vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1853731,00.html "Big Brother - does anyone really still watch it? Yes, one in four of us actually"], ''The Guardian'' website, 19 August 2006. Accessed on 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was accused by some of exploiting Bennett's Tourette's syndrome. The Tourette Syndrome Association (TSA) initially expressed concern that others with the condition would be mocked, though they later softened their stance, a TSA spokesperson said: "What it has done is put Tourette's on the map".  A Channel 4 spokesperson said "Pete's attitude to his condition is a really positive one and that's helped to educate and inspire people [...] "He's a very positive role model and he's been a great housemate."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Liam.  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5259916.stm "BB Pete: Exploitation or education?"], ''BBC News'', 18 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett was nominated for a [[National Television Award]] in 2006 for "Most Popular TV Contender"; however, this was awarded to fellow ''Big Brother'' contestant [[Nikki Grahame]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Bennett's autobiography, ''Pete: My Story'', was published in hardback in November 2006&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0007250339 Pete's BB Book]" ''Amazon.co.uk'' URL last accessed on 16 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and reissued in paperback in 2007 as ''My Journey With Tourettes''.

Bennett was lead singer in a band called [[Wobble Jaggle Jiggle|Daddy Fantastic]], but he left the band after agreeing with a record label that he should become a solo artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17716768&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=62484&amp;headline=pete-to-band--s-d-off--name_page.html "PETE TO BAND: S*D OFF"], ''Sunday Mirror'',  Accessed 11 September 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317014123/http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17716768&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=62484&amp;headline=pete-to-band--s-d-off--name_page.html |date=17 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2017}}  He wrote music with songwriter and record producer [[Guy Chambers]], but failed to gain commercial success with any releases.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bennett went on to form another band, Pete Bennett And The Love Dogs, which played at [[Glastonbury 2007]] and venues such as [[The O2 (London)#indigO2|IndigO2]] ([[The O2 (London)|The O2]]) London and The Cavern Club in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://living.scotsman.com/tv.cfm?id=1666982006 "Bennett makes most of his 15 minutes"] ''The Scotsman'' Accessed on 21 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he guest starred on the web series GIFTED in the pilot episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGkPtSdoaHk|title = Gifted Pilot 1x01|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he set up a cleaning business called Celebriclean.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/612231/big-brother-7-winner-pete-working-as-a-cleaner&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter (Balazs) Záboji''' (25 December 1943 – 3 July 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhungary.hu/start-up/Elhunyt-Zaboji-Peter-a-startup-vilag-egyik-meghatarozo-szereploje/2073 Elhunyt Záboji Péter, a startup világ egyik meghatározó szereplője] {{hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[angel investor]] and [[entrepreneur]]. Much of the [[Budapest]]'s success as a [[startup ecosystem|startup hub]] has been credited to Peter B. Záboji and his European Entrepreneurship Foundation (EEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Entrepreneurial Places in Europe Where Hub Things Are Happening|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2015/06/21/five-entrepreneurial-places-in-europe-where-hub-things-are-happening/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has contributed significantly to the development of start up businesses in Budapest and received the highest civil recognition from the president of Hungary.&lt;ref name=PORT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.hu/rendezvenyek/eloado/zaboji-b-peter/8584|title= Záboji B.

'''Plácido Benavides''' (1810–1837) was an early Mexican-born settler in De Leon's Colony, [[Victoria County, Texas]]. Benavides earned himself the sobriquet of the [[Paul Revere of Texas]] for his 1836 journey from [[San Patricio, Texas|San Patricio]] to [[Goliad]] to Victoria, warning residents of the approaching Mexican army. He was twice elected [[alcalde]] of Victoria, Texas. He married into the powerful De León family, and with his wife Agustina became the father of three daughters. Benavides fought against the dictatorship of [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], but did not feel Texas should be separated from Mexico.

He led a unit of [[Tejano]] fighters at the [[Battle of Goliad]] ,and then he proceeded with his company to [[San Antonio]], where they fought against [[Martín Perfecto de Cos]] in the [[Siege of Bexar]]. On February 11, 1836, Benavides sent a warning to [[James Bowie]] inside the Alamo that Santa Anna was approaching. Benavides escaped the [[Battle of Agua Dulce]] and was able to warn [[James Fannin]] headquartered in Goliad of the enemy army's approach, as he had warned all towns between Agua Dulce and Goliad.  When the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] was signed on March 2, 1836, [[James Fannin]] discharged Benavides from the army and sent him home. On his route back to Victoria, Benavides spread the alarm about the march of the Mexican army. In 1836, Benavides and his family were among the Mexicans evacuated out of Victoria by [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk|Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk]]. His family exiled to Louisiana, where he died of an unknown cause the next year. Texas Historical Marker number 6563 placed in 1936 at the SW Corner of S. Main and Juan Linn in Victoria, marks the site of the Benavides Round Top house.&lt;ref name="RTHouse"/&gt;

==Early life==
Plácido Benavides was born in 1810, in [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas]], Mexico.&lt;ref name="p.58"&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Details of his youth are unknown, except that he was taken under the wing of his godfather Captain Henrique Villareal.&lt;ref name="TSHA-Plácido Benavides"/&gt;
{{Main|De León's Colony (Texas)}}
In 1828, Benavides moved to [[Victoria, Texas]] with his brothers Ysidro, Nicolás and Eugenio.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.57&lt;/ref&gt; He became secretary to [[Fernando De León]], the eldest son of the influential De León family in [[Victoria County, Texas|Victoria County.]] There, Benavides was put in the position of overseeing land titles and general business transactions. He married into the De Leon family in 1831.&lt;ref name="TSHA-Plácido Benavides"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=TSHA-Plácido Benavides|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbe46|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government authorized Benavides to continue recruiting colonists to De Leon's Colony after the 1833 death of empresario Martín De León.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=TSHA-De León's Colony|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ued01|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 and 1834, Benavides was elected second [[alcalde]] of Victoria. Martín De León had held the position as the first alcalde, and [[Silvestre De León]] served as the third alcalde. Benavides built a house fortress with first-floor gun slits and reinforced door, that became known alternately as "Plácido's Round House" and the "Round Top House". Benavides and his brother-in-law Silvestre De León,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=Silvestre De Leon|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbe46|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; led several attacks against the [[Tonkawa]] and [[Karankawa]] Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.59&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Benavides, many lives were saved in 1840 by hiding in the round house during a raid by 600 [[Comanche]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.59, 70, 71&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]] number 6563 placed in 1936 at the SW Corner of S. Main and Juan Linn in Victoria, marks the site of the Benavides Round Top house.&lt;ref name="RTHouse"&gt;{{cite web|title=THC-Round Top House|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5469006563&amp;site_name=Round%20Top%20House%2C%20Site%20of&amp;class=5000|work=Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At war with Santa Anna==
When [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] became President of Mexico on April 1, 1833, he revoked the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]] and replaced its [[Federalist]] form of government with a Centralist regime to further his military dictatorship. He appointed his brother-in-law [[Martín Perfecto de Cos]] as commandant-general northeast of [[Saltillo]]. Some in the De Leon extended family felt loyal to the Federalist government of the constitution.&lt;ref name="p.28"&gt;Chance (2006) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

===José María Jesús Carbajal===
On April 28, 1835, federal legislation in Mexico invalidated the Four Hundred League Law that had been passed by the [[Coahuila y Texas]] legislature.&lt;ref name="p.32"&gt;Chance (2006) p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Benavides' brother-in-law [[José María Jesús Carbajal]] was an elected representative from Bexar to that legislature.&lt;ref name="p.30"&gt;Chance (2006) p.30&lt;/ref&gt; General Martín Perfecto de Cos sent troops to shut down the legislature, and ordered the arrest of all who voted for the Four Hundred League Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poyo|first=Gerald Eugene|title=Tejano Journey, 1770–1850|year=1996|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-76570-2|pages=118, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel [[Domingo Ugartechea]], as principal commandant of Coahuila y Texas, ordered Cabajal arrested, but soldiers searching for him in Victoria were unsuccessful in their attempts at doing so. Alcalde Benavides&lt;ref&gt;Chance (2006) p.35&lt;/ref&gt; had refused to surrender Carbajal, and ordered his local militia to block the soldiers from entry into Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.57, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Bahia===
After [[Gonzales, Texas]] repelled the Mexican attempted seizure of their cannon on October 2, 1835, Benavides teamed up with John Joseph Linn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=John Joseph Linn|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fli12|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
to capture General Cos. In Victoria, they joined with George M. Collinsworth and [[Benjamin Milam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garver|first1=Lois|title=Benjamin Rush Milam|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmi03|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinsworth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cutrer|first=Thomas W|title=Collinsworth, George Morse|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fco29|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were training men for the same purpose. During the [[Battle of Goliad]], Benavides was put in charge of thirty [[Tejano]] volunteers, who were part of the October 1835 storming of [[Presidio La Bahía]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.61&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of Goliad|Goliad]] was captured  by Collinsworth and Milam on October 9, 1835.&lt;ref name="Collinsworth"/&gt;

===James Bowie===
Following the capture of Goliad, Benavides and his men were ordered to join [[Stephen F. Austin]] in the two-month [[Siege of Béxar]] campaign to drive out General Cos. As part of the campaign, Benavides and his men joined with the [[James Bowie]] group in October 1835. In the process of searching for enemy horses, Benavides suggested to Bowie that they torture a simple Mexican herder into admitting he was hiding horses for the Mexican soldiers. The particular torture method used by Benavides and Bowie was to hang the herder by the neck until he almost choked to death, then let him down and threaten him with guns. After executing this method of torture three successive times on the man, the herder confessed and surrendered his herd to Bowie.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matamoros jail break===
José María Jesús Carbajal, his brother-in-law [[Fernando De León]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=Fernando De León|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fde81|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Kerr (Texas settler)|Peter Kerr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=L. W|title=Peter Kerr|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fke35|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; responded to an arms plea from Stephen F. Austin and began to run horses and mules to [[New Orleans]] in a trade for munitions. The trio were captured by Mexicans and taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Chance (2006) p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr was set free, and Fernando De León bribed his way out. Carbajal was transferred to [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], with an intended transfer for imprisonment at [[San Juan de Ulloa]]. In February 1836, Plácido Benavides was serving at [[San Patricio, Texas|San Patricio]] under Major Robert C. Morris. When word arrived of Carbajal's imprisonment, Benavides took a small group of men to break Carbajal out of incarceration. He bribed the guards at Matamoros.  Although Mexicans gave pursuit, the escape back to Victoria was a success.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.63, 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=Plácido Benavides|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbe46|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goliad===
{{Main|Goliad massacre}}The alcalde of Matamoros had leaked to Benavides that [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] planned to draw the Texas forces below the [[Rio Grande]]. Benavides reported the information to Major Morris, who in turn passed it along to [[James Fannin]]. Upon receipt of the information, Fannin decided against his planned invasion of Matamoros and instead moved his men to Goliad.&lt;ref name="p.64"&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Battle of the Alamo}}Inside the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio]], at 1 a.m. on February 11, 1836, messenger [[Blas María Herrera]] delivered to James Bowie a letter from Benavides, that stated Santa Anna was moving towards San Antonio with a large deployment of troops.&lt;ref name="p.64"/&gt;

===Texas Paul Revere===
{{Main|Battle of Agua Dulce}}On February 27, 1836, while Benavides and [[James Grant (Texas)|James Grant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Robert Bruce|title=James Grant|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fgr12|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; were out with a detachment hunting wild mustangs, [[José de Urrea|General José de Urrea]] captured San Patricio. On March 2, 1836, Benavides and Grant stumbled into a trap set by Urrera at Agua Dulce Creek, south of San Patricio. Benavides tried to rejoin the men but was ordered by Grant to save himself and warn Fannin of Urrea's approach. Upon reaching Fannin with the warning, and learning that the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] had just been signed at [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]], Benavides informed Fannin that he did not wish to help Texas to be torn from Mexico. Fannin discharged Benavides from the army and sent him home to Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.64, 65, 66&lt;/ref&gt; From San Patricio to his final destination of Victoria, Benavides warned every person and town along the way of Urrea's approach. Benavides became known as the  [[Paul Revere of Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald (2009) p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isaac D. Hamilton===

{{Main|Battle of Coleto}}On March 27, 1836, following the Battle of Coleto, Mexican soldiers under [[José de Urrea|General José de Urrea]] gunned down 342 unarmed Texans. Isaac D. Hamilton, who had served with Benavides at Goliad, escaped and found refuge on a ranch owned by Benavides. Upon finding the wounded Hamilton, Benavides attempted to take Hamilton to safety. Encountering a Mexican unit, Benavides saved himself by claiming Hamilton was his prisoner. Hamilton was tortured and taken to Victoria to face a firing squad. He was rescued by "The Angel of Goliad", Francisca Alvarez. With the help of Alvarez, Hamilton escaped back to his hometown of [[Courtland, Alabama]]. Hamilton returned to Texas, and in 1858 the Texas legislature awarded him a bounty certificate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bounty Certificates|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mnb01|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for league of land, as part of the state's bounty grants for participants in the battle of the Alamo, the siege of Bexar, the Goliad campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long|first=Christopher|title=Land Grants|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mpl01|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 March 2011|author2=Lang, Aldon S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton died in 1859 before he was able to take possession of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|9433942|Isaac D. Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.66, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile to Louisiana==
During the [[Texas War of Independence]] many Mexicans were opposed to Santa Anna's regime, but felt loyal to Mexico and its 1824 constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Chance (2006) p.42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk|Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] ordered the evacuation of Mexican families ''"...who were likely to afford information to the enemy."''   The Carbajal, Benavides and De Leon families evacuated to New Orleans, leaving behind their wealth and everything they owned.&lt;ref&gt;Chance (2006) p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
In 1831 Benavides married Agustina De León, daughter of [[empresario]] [[Martín De León]] and his wife [[Patricia de la Garza De León]].&lt;ref name="The Martín De León Family"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Martín De León Family|url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/deleon3.htm#benavides|publisher=Wallace L. McKeehan|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three daughters, Pilar, Librada and Matiana.&lt;ref name="p.58"/&gt;

Benavides died in [[Opelousas, Louisiana]] in 1837, cause unknown.&lt;ref name="The Martín De León Family"/&gt;

Hanning volunteered for the [[Waffen SS]] at the age of 18 at the urging of his stepmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-guard-sentenced-to-five-years-for-complicity-in-170000-murders/a-19338306|title=Auschwitz guard sentenced to five years for complicity in 170,000 murders|date=17 June 2016|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[the Holocaust]], he was an SS guard from early 1942 until June 1944.&lt;ref name="SmaleObit"/&gt; Nearly one million [[Jews]] and tens of thousands of other [[Holocaust victims|victims]] were murdered at the death camp.&lt;ref name="SmaleObit"/&gt; Hanning was one of the SS men who met Jewish prisoners as they arrived at the camp in [[Holocaust train]]s and escorted them to the [[Gas chamber|gas chambers]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

In 2016, Hanning was convicted in a [[Detmold]] court as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to 170,000 murders, following a trial in which Holocaust survivors testified against him. He apologized for participation in Holocaust atrocities. He died a year later.&lt;ref name="SmaleObit"/&gt; 

==Life==
Hanning grew up in [[Free State of Lippe|Lippe]] where he attended elementary school. He then worked in a factory. At the age of 14 he joined the [[Hitler Youth]]. Five years later he volunteered for the [[Waffen-SS]]. Following the onset of World War II, Hanning served with the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]]. On 25 July 1940 he joined the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' and in January 1942 was sent to Auschwitz [[death camp]]. He fought in several battles in the war before being hit by grenade splinters in his head and leg during close combat in [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Kiev in 1941]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} 

Following the injury, his commander decided he was no longer fit for front-line duty and assigned him to Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/reinhold-hanning-convicted-former-auschwitz-guard-dies-95-n766966|title=Reinhold Hanning, Convicted Former Auschwitz Guard, Dies at 95|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 1943 he was promoted to ''[[Unterscharführer]]'' while at Auschwitz II Birkenau. In June 1944, he was transferred to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Hanning became a prisoner of war in May 1945. He was released on 20 May 1948. For a short time he worked as a cook for the British forces in Lage (Lippe) and then as a truck driver for a dairy company and as a salesman. In 1964 he went into business for himself, and retired in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk-Ulrich Brüggemann: [http://www.nw.de/nachrichten/thema/auschwitz_prozess/20711125_Die-zwei-Gesichter-des-Reinhold-Hanning-eine-Annaehrerung.html ''Die zwei Gesichter des Reinhold Hanning – eine Annäherung''].

==Trial==
Hanning was one of some 30 former Auschwitz guards investigated in 2013 by the German federal prosecutors from special office in Ludwigsburg with the recommendation that they pursue charges after the major war crimes policy review. Until 2009, prosecutors were required to prove that an accused Nazi was responsible for killing a victim in order to obtain a conviction. In the trial of [[John Demjanjuk]], the defendant was found guilty even though he didn't directly kill any of his victims, and was convicted of being an accessory to murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reinhold Hanning, Auschwitz guard, goes on trial Thursday. Proceedings will be limited to 2 hours per day in deference to Hanning's age|publisher=The Associated Press|date=11 February 2016|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/auschwitz-hanning-trial-1.3443319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Hanning was convicted in a court in [[Detmold]], Germany, of 170,000 counts of being an accessory to murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/defence-seeking-acquittal-of-94-year-old-former-auschwitz-guard-charged-as-an-accessory-to-100000-murders|title=Defence seeking acquittal of 94-year-old former Auschwitz guard charged as an accessory to 100,000 murders|newspaper=National Post|access-date=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Holocaust survivors testified against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/i-cannot-forgive-him-auschwitz-survivor-faces-nazi-guard-on-trial-over-170000-deaths|title='I cannot forgive him': Auschwitz survivor confronts Nazi guard on trial for more than 170,000 deaths|newspaper=National Post|access-date=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In court, Hanning said, "People were shot, gassed and burned. I could see how corpses were taken back and forth or moved out.

'''Rex Geveden''' (born 1962 in [[Mayfield, Kentucky]]) is the president and chief executive officer of [[BWX Technologies]].  Previously he was chief operating officer.  

Prior to his tenure with BWXT, Geveden was executive vice president of [[Teledyne Technologies]] Inc and president of Teledyne [[Dalsa]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Previously he was the president of [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Brown Engineering]] and the associate administrator of [[NASA]] before that. He was selected for that position by NASA chief [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]] on August 17, 2005, after having served in an acting capacity since June of that year. Griffin created the position immediately prior to assigning Geveden to fill it. The associate administrator's task is described as "oversight for all the agency's technical missions' areas and field center operations".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/aug/HQ_05227_geveden.html&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin also suggested Geveden was his right-hand man, saying "...if you get a decision from Rex, it's the agency's decision."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/127082main_090805_mg_update.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Geveden's first job out of college was at Teledyne Brown Engineering (where he later became president).  After a few years at Teledyne Brown, Geveden joined NASA in 1990, and worked on hardware design for a number of science satellite missions, including as project manager for the Optical Transient Detector satellite, the Lightning Imaging Sensor satellite, and the [[Gravity Probe B]] satellite, a successful test of [[frame dragging]] effects predicted by [[General Relativity]]. He was promoted to deputy director of the science directorate at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], then in 2003 to deputy director of Marshall Space Flight Center. In November 2004, he was promoted again to become chief engineer of NASA, simultaneously with a major expansion of that office's responsibilities, in the wake of the report of the [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]]. Only seven months later, in the first weeks of Mike Griffin's administration in June 2005, Griffin made Geveden his acting associate administrator until the post was officially created.

Geveden is a native of [[Mayfield, Kentucky]], and a graduate of Lowes High School. He is married to Gail Geveden, and they have two children, Bridget and Jake. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering physics and master's degrees in physics in 1983 and 1984 respectively, both from [[Murray State University]] in [[Kentucky]]. Geveden also graduated from the Program Management School at the Defense Systems Management College.

Geveden announced his plans to leave NASA at the end of July 2007 to become president of Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville, Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbe.com/company/newsArticle.aspx?id=70 TBE - Company Info - News Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Griffin praised Geveden on his departure saying he "possesses one of the most agile minds I have encountered".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jul/HQ_07152_Geveden_departure.html NASA - Scolese to Succeed Geveden as NASA Associate Administrator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Geveden was replaced as Associate Administrator of NASA by [[Christopher Scolese]]. In 2014, Teledyne announced the promotion of Geveden to president of Teledyne [[Dalsa]] following the retirement of DALSA's CEO, in addition to his role as executive vice president of [[Teledyne Technologies]].

==Professional career==
Before playing professional ball Rhéal was a lumberjack.
Cormier made his major league debut on August 15, 1991.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web|title=Rheal Cormier|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cormirh01.shtml|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=July 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvWe89ME?url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cormirh01.shtml|archivedate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]' game against the [[New York Mets]], going six [[Innings pitched|innings]], giving up one [[earned run]], and striking out two.&lt;ref name=debutBOX&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Louis Cardinals 4, New York Mets 1|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN199108150.shtml|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=July 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvWmvw6g?url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN199108150.shtml|archivedate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pitched for St. Louis through 1994 and was traded to Boston for the 1995 season.  In Boston, Cormier split time as a starter and a reliever.  His 1995 [[Earned run average|ERA]] was 4.07.&lt;ref name=br /&gt;

Following the 1995 season, Cormier was traded to [[Montreal Expos|Montreal]] as part of the [[Wil Cordero]] deal.  He spent all of 1996 and one game in 1997 for the Expos. In 1998, he signed as a free agent with the [[Cleveland Indians]]&lt;ref name=br /&gt; and began the year in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]] before shoulder problems ended his season.&lt;ref name=olympicsBIO&gt;{{cite web|title=Rheal Cormier Bio|url=http://www.2008.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=1508/bio/index.html|work=NBC Olympics|accessdate=July 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvWuuh3j?url=http://www.2008.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=1508/bio/index.html|archivedate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Cormier signed a free agent deal to return to Boston.  In two seasons, he made 124 appearances for the Red Sox, all of which came in relief. After the 2000 season, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] signed the reliever as a free agent. In the next six seasons with the Phillies (his longest tenure with any major league team), Cormier had his most successful years. In 2003, he posted in 84.2 innings a career-best ERA of 1.70.  In 2004, he made 84 appearances, a career high. On July 31, 2006, Cormier was traded from the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for pitching prospect [[Justin Germano]].&lt;ref name=br /&gt; The Reds, leading the National League [[Wild card (sports)|wildcard]] race at the time of the trade, sought bullpen help through the trade.&lt;ref name=CINtrade&gt;{{cite web|last=Callis|first=Jim|title=Reds Make Another Bullpen Move|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/majors/trade-central/2006/262081.html|work=Baseball America|accessdate=July 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvX7uhMi?url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/majors/trade-central/2006/262081.html|archivedate=July 4, 2011|date=July 31, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team failed to make the playoffs, however, finishing the season 8 games back in the wildcard race.&lt;ref name=2006wildcard&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Wild Card Standings – 2006|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings/_/year/2006/type/wild-card|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=July 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvXDVJTJ?url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings/_/year/2006/type/wild-card|archivedate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cormier's 2006 season with the Reds included 21 appearances and a 4.50 ERA.&lt;ref name=br /&gt;

On April 28, 2007, Cormier was [[designated for assignment]] by the Reds after a poor start to the 2007 campaign. He had 3 IP, a 9.00 ERA, and 1 strikeout in his time with Cincinnati that season. On May 13, 2007, the [[Atlanta Braves]] signed Cormier to a minor league contract and assigned him to their AAA-affiliate, the [[Richmond Braves]].&lt;ref name=br /&gt; He played only briefly for them before deciding to retire.&lt;ref name=retire&gt;{{cite web|title=Rheal Cormier Fantasy Baseball News, Notes, Rumors and Statistics|url=http://www.kffl.com/player/4986/MLB|work=KFFL|accessdate=July 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvXeYHYM?url=http://www.kffl.com/player/4986/MLB|archivedate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he joined the [[Moncton Mets]], a senior team based in Moncton, New Brunswick, in an attempt to make a comeback and join the Canadian Olympic Team participating in the [[2008 Olympics]] in Beijing.

Despite winning two of three games, the team failed to advance beyond the first round.

'''Robert Reidt''' (June 25, 1892 – March 1966) was a German-born [[United States|American]] who is best known for promoting a prediction that the world would end on February 6, 1925.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;(19 May 2011).

Reidt was a house painter living in [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and heard about Californian [[Margaret Rowen]]'s claim that the day of judgment was coming on February 6, 1925.

'''The Missing 54''' are the soldiers and officers of [[Indian armed forces]] who have been given status of missing in action or killed in action in [[1971 Indo-Pak war]] by government. But they are believed to be alive and imprisoned in various Pakistani jails. Though Pakistan have denied existence of any Indian POW's of 1971 Indo-Pak war; there is strong evidence to suggest that they were captured alive and some or all of them still languish in Pakistani jails.

Missing 55 - Flt Lt Pradeep Vinayak Apte

''(This list was tabled in the Lok Sabha in 1979 by Samarendra Kundu, Minister of State of External Affairs, in reply to unstarred question 6803 raised by Amarsingh Pathawa.)
''
''Note - Initial list consisted of 40 names which later on expanded to 54.''

"If the cause be just and mind be strong,
No force is great, No distance long,
If selfless souls with such a strength,
Face hazards all, they win at length."
THIS is a diary noting in Dr R.S. Suri's diary, father of Major Ashok Suri, captured in the 1971 war. The Army had declared Major Suri as "Killed in action". DR Suri who ran a Yoga Ashram in New Delhi did not believe it. He was sent a helmet with a bullet hole in it and someone else's name written on it. 
 
During the war, the fifth battalion of the Assam Regiment was deployed as part of 191 Infantry Brigade on the west of Munnawar Tawi River in Chambb sector. 10 Infantry Division on the Indian side faced 23 Division on the Pakistani side. 5 Sikh were at Chhamb and were in the middle of the brigade group with 5 Assam and 4/1 Gorkha Rifles on either side. Throughout 4 December Pakistani artillery and PAF were very active in the areas of 5 Sikh and 5 Assam. On Dec 4th Pakistani infantry supported by armour captured Mandiala North after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. On 5 December, 2 tanks of Deccan Horse and a platoon of 5 Sikh recaptured the MandialaBridge. The battle raged on through the day and night of 5 December. These three battalions were subjected to intense shelling and repeated PAF attacks. During this battle, Maj Ashok Suri went missing.
 
Then on December 26, 1974, R.S. Suri received a hand-written note dated December 7, 1974 from his son. The letter contained a slip in which his son had written, "I am okay here." The covering note read, "Sahib, valaikumsalam, I cannot meet you in person. Your son is alive and he is in Pakistan. I could only bring his slip, which I am sending you. Now going back to Pak." Signed M. Abdul Hamid.
In August, 1975, he received another missive postmark dated 'June 14/15/16, 1975, Karachi.' The letter said, "Dear Daddy, Ashok touches thy feet to get your benediction. I am quite ok here. Please try to contact the Indian Army or Government of India about us. We are 20 officers here. Don't worry about me. Pay my regards to everybody at home, specially to mummy, grandfather – Indian government can contact Pakistan government for our freedom." The then Defence Secretary had the handwriting confirmed as Ashok's and changed the official statement from "killed in action" to "missing in action"!
When one gets one's son's letter from a prison in Pakistan, what does one do? Well, R.S. Suri spent the rest of his life making weekly trips to the Ministry of External Affairs where everyone got to know him well. He worked with the government, careful not to involve the media because MEA officials advised him that the missing servicemen were in danger of being killed if they did so. He along with other Delhi-based families formed the Missing Defence Personnel Relative's organization. He used to write to family members based in other parts of the country updating them on what all had transpired. He wrote regularly to the Prime Minister and received regular replies. The overriding concern was that the issue should be taken up whenever the two sides met as a matter of urgency.
In a letter on Jul 15th, 1980, Dr Suri writes from the Delhi Based Next of Kin to the Honourable Minister of External Affairs of Pakistan, Mr Agha Shahi. Talking of the Missing men and welcoming Pakistan's gesture to search for these men, "…….. You will appreciate that the family members have undergone enough agony and misery and some have become mental as well as physical wrecks. The suspense for them is unbearable. ….settle this issue on humanitarian grounds." 
 
In 1983, after what seemed like a breakthrough, the Pakistan government invited family members to Pakistan to identify, if found, its missing defence personnel. This happened after November, 1982 when India and Pakistan signed a protocol on exchange of prisoners when Zia Ul Haque visited India.
On May 30, 1983 – Narasimha Rao said that he would take up at the highest level the visit of the parents of missing defence personnel to Pakistan, since India had allowed the visit of some Pakistani family members to India in 1972. Dr.Suri on behalf of the missing defence families, was assured that Rao would try to facilitate this visit.
 
A delegation of six next-of-kin were allowed to go. It was made very clear that this was a classified visit that the press should not get wind of. There was a feeling of some deal having been done. The families were told to " Get the men back. They may not be in good health but you can nurse them back to health."
The families left on September 12, 1983, Monday for Lahore. This was the first time the Indians had got consular access after 1971. The families got to know that some officials of the MEA will also be going with them toMultan jail. Indira Gandhi in India was meanwhile making aggressive statements in favour of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan &amp; the MQM movement which was irritating Pak. On Sept 14th they flew to Multan. There was a sense of enthusiasm. That day India was supposed to grant Pak officials reciprocal access to 25 Pakistani prisoners at Patiala jail which did not happen. The news came in Pakistani papers that "India goes back on its words".

On Sept 15, 1983, the families visited Multan jail. Dr.Suri was getting hysterical, laughing and crying at the same time. The Pakistani newspaper report of India going back on its word in showing 25 prisoners in Patialajail was at the back of his mind at that time. However, they still clung to the promise and hope that the Indian Govt. had given them.
 
. The jail official who was present commented when Mrs.Tambay was signing her name remarked "Sorry Mrs.Tambay, Tambay is not here." They did not find any of the people they were looking for there. 200 odd prisoners were being offered repatriation by Pakistan, subject to verification during the consular access. The families including Dr Suri wondered when Pakistan had already offered to repatriate these people where was the need for the visit?
 
The family members sat through the consular access process for about 6 people, after which they were asked to go out as their part was done. The jail officials told them that only Zia ul Huq could help us with this category of prisoners.
 
Even after the visit, disheartening though it had been, did not dampen Dr Suri's commitment. He believed the government was doing all it could to get the men back. He never gave up hope. Finally, though his body gave up and he died in 1999 saying, "Perhaps I will finally find peace in the grave."

As per the Geneva Conventions, "Parties to the conflict shall communicate to each other the names of any prisoners of war who are detained till the end of proceedings or until punishment has been completed. By agreement between the parties to the conflict, commissions shall be established for the purpose of searching for dispersed prisoners of war and assuring their repatriation with the least possible delay."

On the Eastern front where there were 93,007 POWs (of which 72795 were soldiers), an agreement was signed by the Foreign Ministers of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan on 30 April 1974 at New Delhi. Thereafter the Pakistani POWs captured on the Eastern front were also repatriated.

SOME OF THE MAIN EVIDENCES

Flight Lt. V.V. Tambay ( the following is often cited as evidence- however if you note, the paper report ison 5th dec. Tambay went missing on 6th dec. SO the newspaper report is wrong.)
Maj Ghosh's photograph published in Time Magazine 
Maj AK Ghosh's photograph was published in Time Magazine dated 27-12-1971
The photograph is proof that Maj AK Ghosh was in Pakistani custody when the war ended on 17 December 1971. He did not return with the POWs in 1972 at the time of the Simla agreement. He may have died in the interim period in a Pakistani jail. Surely there must be some record of that. The Indian and Pakistan governments can work together to find out what happened to such men. Why were some names not included in the POW list is again a moot point. 
A brief note from Maj Ashok Suri followed by another letter in 1975
On 26 December 1974, R S Suri received a hand written note dated 07-12-1974 the words " I am okay here: scribbled on a tiny scrap of paper from Ashok Suri. His father also received letters from a Karachi jail on August 13th 1975 dated June 14/15/16th 1975 stating that there were 20 other officers with him there. The handwriting was authenticated by the Indian government and Indian Ministry of External Affairs officials on many occasions expressed to Dr RS Suri that they believed Ashok Suri was there. 
Why would someone come and send the note to Maj Suri's distraught father if there was no basis for it. What purpose would it serve? 
Mohanlal Bhaskar repatriated on 09.12.1974- writes "Main Bharat ka jasoos tha" or " I spied for India" 
Mohanlal Bhaskar, who was in a jail between 1968 and 1974 and repatriated on 09.12.1974 wrote a book in Hindi ( I was a spy for India) and gave a signed affidavit stating that he met a Col Asif Shafi of Second Punjab regt of Pakistan and a Maj Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra in Fort of Attock imprisoned for conspiring against Bhutto in the infamous "Attock conspiracy" . The Pakistani Major Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra spoke of his befriending a Gill of the Indian Air Force and a Captain Singh of the Indian Army as well as mentioning that there were around 40 Pows of the 1965 and 1971 wars in that jail who had no chances of release. 
In the Attock Conspiracy, several officers of Pakistan's army and air force were arrested on March 30, 1973, on charges of conspiring to overthrow the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The detainees included Major Farooq Adam, Major Nadir Pervez (who later became a federal minister in the Nawaz Sharif government), Brigadier Wajid Ali Shah, Colonel Hamdani, and Major Ayaz Sipra, and a total of 59 officers were declared conspirators. The case is well known as the Attock conspiracy. Fifteen army and four air-force officers were found guilty of conspiracy and were handed jail terms ranging from three months to life.

In this conspiracy, 15 officers were sentenced to terms in prison- among them Maj Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra and Col Asif Shafi. Others such as Farooq Adam ( a Gallian, i.e. from Lawrence school, Ghoraghali) were also sentenced in the Attock conspiracy .

Ayaaz Ahmed and Shafi later apparently moved to the US where Shafi was again traced by Manish Jain ( son in law of Sqn Ldr Jain, another Indian Officer missing and believed to be in Pakistani jails since the 1971 war) and Shafi confirmed to Jain unofficially that he had met Wg Cdr Gill in Attock in 2000 in a telephonic conversation.

A Pakistani General, General Riaz, Governor NWFP who subsequently died in an accident informed Mr Ashwini Kumar, then IG of the Border Security Force as a personal favour to him at the Munich Olympics in 1972 that Major Waraich was being held in Dargai jail, NWFP. 
The earlier sightings in 1972, 1975 seem true even if later sightings may have been mistakes. This is because at that time noone knew of the case of Missing defence personnel. Mohan Lal Bhaskar had no knowledge that some Indian Officers were kept back in Pakistan when he returned and wrote his book. In those days there was no internet or even widespread television. That is why the movement to trace the Indian POWs has remained so strong.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Vakha Arsanov was born in 1950 in the [[Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. He worked as a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[traffic police]] [[Police captain|captain]].

In 1991, Arsanov supported [[Dzhokar Dudayev]]'s [[National Congress of Chechen People]] and became a deputy in Dudayev's parliament. During the [[First Chechen War]], Arsanov became a military commander for the Chechen separatist forces, reaching the rank of [[Divisional General]]. He took part in the [[Battle of Dolinskoye]], the [[Battle of Grozny (1994–1995)|Battle of Grozny]], and others. After the Chechens retook Grozny in August 1996, Arsanov declared that "Russia does have a strong army, but they weaken themselves... The Chechens have morale and a spirit... We know what we are fighting for and what we are dying for. The Russians just want to go home to mother or to their beloved girl. They don't need this war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=David|title=Russians' Morale at a Low in Grozny|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/08/25/russians-morale-at-a-low-in-grozny/8d91b9ec-8d35-4b09-8b75-63b40ee7c1e1/|publisher=The Washington Post|date=August 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, in January 1997, he ran on the same ticket as the separatist forces' [[chief of staff]] [[Aslan Maskhadov]]. The two won Chechnya's [[presidential election]], garnering almost 300,000 votes.

===Vice-President of Chechnya===
In February 1997, "a remote-controlled bomb blast damaged two cars" in Arsanov's [[motorcade]] in central [[Grozny]]; his press spokesman claimed the attack was "'a carefully planned operation by the [[Russia]]n secret services,' designed to destabilize Chechnya by provoking conflict between supporters of [Maskhadov] and [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiev]], the outgoing acting president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parrish|first1=Scott|title=Assassination Attempt on Chechen Vice President-Elect|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1141343.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=February 6, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Russian [[Interior Minister of Russia|Interior Minister]] [[Anatoly Kulikov]] announced the arrests of two Chechen women suspected of involvement in the 1995 [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]] and the April 28 bombing of [[Pyatigorsk]] that killed two. Arsanov denied a Chechen connection to the bombings in Pyatigorsk and [[Armavir, Russia|Armavir]], instead accusing the Russian secret services of organizing the Pyatigorsk bombing in order to "sabotage the peace process. He also suggested "that ongoing peace talks with Russia should be suspended until Kulikov apologized." However, Chechen First [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Movladi Udugov]] stated that peace talks would continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kulikov Accuses Chechens of Pyatigorsk Bombing|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1141399.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=April 30, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May, Russian leaders formally apologized for the incident in which Russian [[fighter aircraft]] intercepted Arsanov's plane shortly after it took off from Grozny to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moscow Apologizes for Interception of Chechen Vice President's Plane|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1141412.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=May 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Arsanov threatened to "execute" Russian Cabinet leaders for their "[[genocide]]" during the war and said to "spit" on Russia; the Russian government demanded that Arsanov retract his "insulting statements" and apologize, but he did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/13/world/russian-chechen-agreement-rebuilding-major-oil-pipeline-beginning-unravel.html |title=Russian-Chechen Agreement on Rebuilding a Major Oil Pipeline Is Beginning to Unravel |author=Edmund L.

In July 1998, together with [[Shamil Basayev]], Arsanov saved the "[[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]]" forces aided by renegade former generals [[Arbi Barayev]] and [[Abdul-Malik Mezhidov]] from total destruction during the confrontation with the Maskhadov's government forces in [[Gudermes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca-c.org/dataeng/05.akaev.shtml |title=Religious–Political Conflict in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411140145/http://www.ca-c.org/dataeng/05.akaev.shtml |deadurl=no |archivedate=April 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 1998 televised conference, Arsanov said that by [[Operation Infinite Reach|attacking Afghanistan and Sudan]], the [[United States]] had launched an "undeclared [[World War III]]" and ordered a global attack against the Americans; he said that [[Bill Clinton]] "had been put on the 'wanted list' for his crimes against the Islamic people and would be tried according to [[Shariah]] laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98aug24/world.htm#2 |title=Chechnya declares war on USA |date=August 23, 1998 |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archivedate=June 2, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602220654/http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98aug24/world.htm#2 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afpc.org/rrm/rrm501.htm |title=Chechen leader calls for terrorist war against U.S. and says President Clinton should be killed |publisher=Russia Reform Monitor |date=August 28, 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610193652/http://www.afpc.org/rrm/rrm501.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Arsanov [[defection|defected]] to the opposition, which was agitating for a new [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[constitution|state constitution]].&lt;ref name=islamist/&gt;

After the [[Second Chechen War]] broke out in 1999, Arsanov announced in October that the [[State Defense Council]] "had decided to forbid Chechen leaders from conducting negotiations or getting in touch with Russian [[Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]]". He also demanded that the Chechens would only meet with the Russians "on neutral ground"; that an international organization would supervise and implement a Russian-Chechen agreement; and that Russian forces would withdraw from Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cockburn|first1=Patrick|title=Chechens trapped as Russians cut off escape|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chechens-trapped-as-russians-cut-off-escape-5372888.html|publisher=The Independent|date=October 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Arsanov "ruled out holding political negotiations with Russia, saying that Chechnya expects Europe and the United States to pressure Russia into ending the military operation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia: Troops Near Chechen Capital|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1092419.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=October 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2000, Arsanov, together with Basayev, were reported to have announced the start of "total military actions on the whole of Russian territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/02/06/russia.chechnya.03/ |title=Putin says Russia has taken Chechen capital; Rebels say they're ready to fight for 50 years |agency=[[CNN]] |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050112154125/http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/02/06/russia.chechnya.03/ |archivedate=January 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon disappeared in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], where he was treated for an injury, appearing publicly in the presence of [[President of Georgia]] [[Eduard Shevardnadze]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psan.org/document521.html The Security Organs of the Russian Federation (Part IV)] Retrieved March 23, 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422100252/http://www.psan.org/document521.html |date=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later reportedly moved to [[Nazran]] in [[Ingushetia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/268-8.cfm U.S. Know-How Doesn't Work in Chechnya] Retrieved March 23, 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312223245/http://www.cdi.org/russia/268-8.cfm |date=March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He resurfaced in 2001 to call Chechen resistance against Russia "pointless," and Mashkhadov fired him, saying, "“He could have fallen into the hands of the Federals at any time and they could’ve forced him to take part in the negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shermatova|first1=Sanobar|title=Maskhadov’s Last Earthly Comments about the Upcoming "Round Table"|url=http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000001-000169&amp;lang=1|website=Prague Watchdog|publisher=Prague Watchdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late life and death===
In February 2003, the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] reported that Arsanov issued a [[video]] call to the Chechen resistance to put stop attacks on [[Kadyrovtsy|pro-Moscow Chechen militias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kavkazcenter.net/eng/content/2003/02/18/923.shtml |title=Unexpected announcement by Vakha Arsanov |date=February 18, 2003 |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722054908/http://www.kavkazcenter.net/eng/content/2003/02/18/923.shtml |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russian media reports, he became close with [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], the pro-[[Moscow]] head of the republic, who asked the federal center for an [[amnesty]] for Arsanov;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.mn.ru/english/issue.php?2005-3-14 |title=Who Will Stand in for Maskhadov? |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |work=[[The Moscow News]] |author=Sanobar Shermatova |year=2007 |issue=18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810201854/http://english.mn.ru/english/issue.php?2005-3-14 |archivedate=August 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; other sources state that he and [[Isa Munayev]] remained the last commanders still fully loyal to Maskhadov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=March 23, 2008|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=396&amp;issue_id=2927&amp;article_id=23631|title=Khambiev Surrender Seen as Heavy Blow to Maskhadov}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Kommersant]]'' report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/01/18/012.html Report: Arsanov Arrested] ''[[The Moscow Times]]''  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217035803/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/01/18/012.html |date=February 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsanov was detained by the Chechen [[OMON]], led by the former separatist commander [[Artur Akhmadov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=552963 |title=Aslan Maskhadov Killed |work=[[Kommersant]] |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archivedate=April 3, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403155043/http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=552963 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the separatists protested the alleged arrest and detention of Arsanov by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=March 23, 2008 |url=http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000001-000169&amp;lang=1 |title=Maskhadov’s Last Earthly Comments about the Upcoming "Round Table" |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213505/http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000001-000169&amp;lang=1 |deadurl=no |date=March 20, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2005, [[Russia]] announced that during a raid in the village of [[Ivanovo]], a suburb of Grozny, pro-Russian police and militia forces killed four militants, including Arsanov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/2005/5/article/arsanov-believed-to-be-killed-by-police-forces-near-grozny/223277.html |title=Arsanov Believed to Be Killed by Police Forces Near Grozny |work=The Moscow Times |date=March 16, 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217020028/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/2005/5/article/arsanov-believed-to-be-killed-by-police-forces-near-grozny/223277.html |deadurl=no |archivedate=December 17, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The death was shrouded in mystery; the bodies were reported to be burned too badly to be identified, and separatists alleged that Arsanov was actually in Russian custody at the time. According to some reports, Arsanov was held in [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]'s private prison in [[Tsentoroi]] and unsuccessfully tortured there in an attempt to make him cooperate with the young Kadyrov against Maskhadov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=409&amp;issue_id=3337&amp;article_id=2369764 Fate of Former Chechen VP Remains Mysterious] The Jamestown Foundation.

'''Varg Vikernes''' ({{IPA-no|ˈvɑrɡ ˈviːkəɳeːs|lang}}), is a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] musician, writer, and blogger. In 1991, he founded the one-man music project [[Burzum]], which is considered one of the most influential [[black metal]] acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Dayel|title=20 of the best black metal albums from the 1990s|date=20 July 2016|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-07-20/20-of-the-best-black-metal-albums-from-the-1990s|website=[[Team Rock]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopper|first1=Jessica|title=The Complicated Appeal Of Black Metal|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicahopper/the-complicated-appeal-of-black-metal|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sigel|first1=Zack|title=Are Music Streaming Services Doing More Harm Than Good To The Metal Community?|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/47107/heavy-metal-music-streaming-pros-cons/|website=VH1.com|date=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, he was convicted of murder and arson, and subsequently served 14 years in prison.

A native of [[Bergen]], Vikernes spent part of his childhood in [[Iraq]]. Interested in music from a young age, he began playing guitar at the age of 14 and formed his first band, Kalashnikov, within the next two years.&lt;ref name="burzum origin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story01.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A Burzum Story: Part I – The Origin And Meaning |publisher=Burzum.org |date= |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became part of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. In 1992, he and other members of the scene were accused of burning down at least three Christian churches in Norway. By early 1993, he had recorded four albums as Burzum and another with fellow black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]].

In August 1993, Vikernes was arrested and charged with the murder of Mayhem guitarist [[Euronymous|Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth]]. In May 1994, he was found guilty of murder and the earlier church arsons, and sentenced to 21 years in prison. Vikernes maintains that he killed Aarseth in self-defense and denies responsibility for the church arsons, though he supported them. During his time in prison, Vikernes became affiliated with the [[Heathen Front|Norwegian Heathen Front]], had several writings on [[Germanic paganism]] published and recorded and released two [[ambient music|ambient]] albums as Burzum.&lt;ref name="GC204"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 204&lt;/ref&gt; Having served 14 years of his sentence, Vikernes was released on parole in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Varg Vikernes ute på prøve | url= http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 | work= [[Verdens Gang]] | location= Oslo, Norway | agency= [[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] | date= 10 March 2009 | accessdate= 10 March 2009 | language= Norwegian | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fartikkel.php%3Fartid%3D557287&amp;date=2009-03-10 | archivedate= 10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Ute av fengsel | url= http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ | work= Dagbladet.no | date= 22 May 2009 | accessdate= 23 May 2009 | language= Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his legal name to Louis Cachet to avoid difficulties with the public in Norway. He still goes by Varg Vikernes in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vikernes|first1=Varg|title=Some Facts about Varg Vikernes &amp; his Case|url=https://thuleanperspective.com/2014/06/02/some-facts-about-varg-vikernes-his-case/|website=Thulean Perspective|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release from prison, Vikernes settled with his wife and children in France, where he continued releasing music and writing. He recorded six more albums before announcing the end of Burzum in 2018. He began his blog and YouTube channel, titled Thulean Perspective, in 2013. Through his self-published writings and videos, he promotes an ideology he calls "Odalism" based on a [[Blood and Soil]]–derived form of nationalism and the re-adoption of native European values and belief systems, such as elements of [[Historical pagan|traditional paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thuleanperspective.com/2013/07/31/why-odalism/|title=Why Ôðalism?|first=Varg|last=Vikernes|website=Thulean Perspective|date=31 July 2013|quote=Ôðalism is in the strictest sense an ideology based on blood (of the native population) and soil (the homeland of the native population); protecting, promoting and if necessary reviving the customs, traditions, world view, values and religion that naturally came from each particular population in their homeland.|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocates environmentalism, [[permaculture]], and [[survivalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Burzum &amp; Varg Vikernes|url=http://metalkings.com/reviews/Burzum-Varg-Vikernes/Burzum-Varg-Vikernes-eng-2011.htm|accessdate=19 December 2015|agency=MetalKings.com|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOznP1RDGMo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lord of Lies: Part XIII - On how Negroes became Fair-Skinned, Blue-Eyed and Blond in Europe|agency=Burzum.org|date=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Vikernes does not have a published biography (authorised or unauthorised), but information can be gathered from interviews he has given and from statements he has made on burzum.org, at thuleanperspective.com, and on his YouTube channel. [[Michael Jenkins Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]], one of the authors of ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]''—where much of the information about Vikernes is found, has been described as "quite active in the propaganda support network for Vikernes".&lt;ref name="Coogan"&gt;Coogan 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and childhood===

In the interviews printed in ''Lords of Chaos'', Vikernes discusses his background and childhood. ''Lords of Chaos'' also includes an interview with his mother, Helene Bore (the book and a newspaper depicted there refer to her with the given name Lene,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos'', First Edition, Feral House 1998, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos'', First Edition, Feral House 1998, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Vikernes' own website uses the name Helene&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burzum.org/eng/gallery01.php ''Varg Vikernes in Childhood''], accessed on 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;). In a 2004 interview, Vikernes mentions his mother "is working in a large oil company".&lt;ref name="BZINT"&gt;http://www.burzum.org: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/interview01.shtml 12 August 2004 interview]&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that his father is an "electronics engineer,"&lt;ref name="BZINT"/&gt; whereas his brother, who (according to the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview) is one and a half years older,&lt;ref name=LoC148/&gt; is a "graduate civil engineer".&lt;ref name="BZINT"/&gt;

In the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes recalls that when he was 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to [[Baghdad]], Iraq, because Vikernes' "father was working for [[Saddam Hussein]]" developing a computer program.&lt;ref name=LoC147&gt;LoC 1998: 147&lt;/ref&gt; Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became "aware of racial matters".&lt;ref name=LoC148&gt;LoC 1998: 148&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corporal punishment]] was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion, Vikernes had a "quarrel" with a teacher and called him "a monkey". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers "didn't dare to hit me because I was white".&lt;ref name=LoC148 /&gt; Vikernes' mother also recalls how they "spent a year in Iraq" and that "the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not".&lt;ref name=LoC142&gt;LoC 1998: 142&lt;/ref&gt; She mentions that this created problems, but generally she "has no good explanation" of how Varg developed his views.&lt;ref name=LoC144&gt;LoC 1998: 144&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about his father, Vikernes states that he "had a [[swastika]] flag at home."&lt;ref name=LoC147 /&gt; However, Vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite because he was worried about Vikernes "being a Nazi", whereas he too was "pissed about all the colored people he saw in town".&lt;ref name=LoC147 /&gt; About his mother, Vikernes states that she was "very race conscious", in the sense that she was afraid that Vikernes "was going to come home with a black girl!"&lt;ref name=LoC146&gt;LoC 1998: 146&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 1995 ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother but "very little contact" with his father.&lt;ref name=LoC147 /&gt; He also stated that his parents are divorced; Vikernes' father is said to have "left about 10 years ago", which would have been 1985, when Vikernes was 11 or 12.&lt;ref name=LoC147 /&gt;

There are claims that Vikernes was involved with a skinhead scene in Bergen before he became a part of the black metal scene: [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] alleges [[Burzum]] as the "musical vehicle" of the "ex-skinhead" Vikernes,&lt;ref name="GC204"/&gt; while [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] claims that "Vikernes first became involved with the extreme right as a National Socialist skinhead while he was an adolescent."&lt;ref name="Kapl-319"&gt;Kaplan 2000: 319.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview whether he hung out with skinheads in Bergen, Vikernes boldly replied: "There were no skinheads in Bergen."&lt;ref name="LoC149"/&gt; He mentions, though, that he had short hair at that time, admired the Germans, and hated the British and Americans.&lt;ref name="LoC149"/&gt;

A fan of classical music as a child, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in particular, Vikernes started listening to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] at 12, citing [[Iron Maiden]] as his biggest inspiration.&lt;ref name = "Heart of Darkness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_guitar_world.shtml |title=Burzum: Heart of Darkness "Guitar World" Magazine (April 2010) by Brad Angle |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he discovered other metal bands whose sound would be influential on his own band, such as [[Kreator]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] and [[Von (band)|Von]].&lt;ref name = "Heart of Darkness"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metalasfuck.net/zine/articles/2012/%E2%80%9Cyou-can-add-rotting-christ-list%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-burzum%E2%80%99s-varg-vikernes-shares-his-metal-faves-meta |title="You can add Rotting Christ to the list" – Burzum’s Varg Vikernes shares his metal faves with Metal as Fuck!|publisher=metalasfuck.net |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Venom (band)|Venom]] are widely considered the primary influence on black metal, Vikernes has always denied to be influenced by them, as well as defining the band as "a joke". He once wore a T-shirt of Venom's ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' to promote the genre but stated he later regretted doing that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisecreep.com/burzum-varg-vikernes-does-not-care-about-black-metal/ |title=Varg Vikernes Of Burzum Talks New Album "Fallen" |publisher=Noisecreep.com|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age, Vikernes was also fascinated with the fictional realm of [[Middle-earth]] created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. His stage name, [[Middle-earth Orc characters#Grishnákh|Grishnackh]], is taken from that of an orc in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', while the band name Burzum, meaning "darkness," was taken from the [[Black Speech]] inscribed on the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The inscription read "Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh ''burzum''-ishi krimpatul," or in English, "One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the ''darkness'' bind them." Additionally, before joining the Bergen [[death metal]] band [[Old Funeral]], he was in a band called [[Uruk-hai|Uruk-Hai]], also a reference from Tolkien's text.&lt;ref name="burzum origin"/&gt;

===Early musical career===
{{Further|Burzum}}
Vikernes started playing guitar at the age of 14.&lt;ref name="LoC149"&gt;LoC 1998: 149&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 17, Vikernes came into contact with members of Old Funeral. He played guitar with them during 1990–1991 and performed on their ''Devoured Carcass'' EP before he began his solo musical project, [[Burzum]], and quickly became involved with the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. During 1992–1993, he recorded four albums as Burzum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/a_brief_history_of_the_early_norwegian_black_metal_scene_part_1-65713|title=A Brief History Of The Early Norwegian Black Metal Scene. Part 1|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old Westone guitar, which he had bought in 1987 from an acquaintance.&lt;ref name = "burzummusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story06.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VI – The Music |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the cheapest bass guitar there was in his local shop and 
borrowed drum kit from Old Funeral, the successor band [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], and "another musician living nearby".&lt;ref name = "burzummusic"/&gt; On ''[[Hvis lyset tar oss]]'', he also borrowed [[Hellhammer (musician)|Hellhammer]]'s drum kit, the same one Hellhammer used to record ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' by [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Teufel |url=http://www.teufelstomb.com/interviews/mayhem-1999/ |title=Interview with Hellhammer |publisher=Teufels Tomb |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used a Peavey amplifier, but for the recording of ''[[Filosofem]]'', he used the amplifier on his brother's stereo and some old fuzz pedals.&lt;ref name = "burzummusic"/&gt; For vocals, he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him, but during the recording of ''Filosofem'', he intentionally used the worst mic they had, a headset mic.&lt;ref name = "burzummusic"/&gt; On the track "Dungeons of Darkness", he used the large gong at [[Grieghallen]] for background noise ([[Euronymous]] assisted him by beating his fists on it).&lt;ref name = "burzummusic"/&gt;

In 1992, Vikernes joined the black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], a year after band member [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Dead]] committed suicide on 8 April 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arson of churches===
On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft Stave Church]], dating from the 12th century and considered architecturally significant, was burned to the ground by arson. By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major [[stave church]]es, including one on Christmas Eve of 1992.&lt;ref name="GC204"/&gt; Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the arson and attempted arson of [[Åsane Church]] and [[Storetveit Church]], respectively, in [[Bergen]], the arson of [[Skjold Church (Rogaland)|Skjold Church]] in [[Vindafjord]], and the arson of [[Holmenkollen Chapel]] in Oslo. He was also charged with the arson of Fantoft Stave Church, although the jurors found him not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A Burzum Story: Part II – Euronymous |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, claims were made by media outlets that Vikernes was associated with [[theistic Satanism]].&lt;ref&gt;See 1995 [[Morgenbladet]] article "Satanism in Norway", English translation Michael Moynihan, ''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 344–45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview with Michael Moynihan, Vikernes made a statement about the church burnings that hints at a [[Germanic paganism|heathen]] rather than a Satanist motivation:
{{quote|I am not going to say that I burnt any churches. But let me put it this way: There was one person who started it. I was not found guilty of burning the Fantoft stave church, but anyway, that was what triggered the whole thing. That was the 6th of June and everyone linked it to Satanism ... What everyone overlooked was that on the 6th June, 793, in [[Lindisfarne|Lindesfarne]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] was the site of the first known [[Vikings|Viking]] raid in history, with Vikings from [[Hordaland]], which is my county ... They [the Christians] desecrated our graves, our burial mounds, so it's revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moynihan, ''Lords of Chaos'', p. 88; quoted in: M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', p.306;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Echoing this sentiment, he writes in ''Vargsmål'': "For each devastated graveyard, one heathen grave is avenged, for each ten churches burnt to ashes, one [[Temple (Germanic paganism)|heathen hof]] is avenged, for each ten priests or [[freemasonry|freemasons]] assassinated, one heathen is avenged."&lt;ref&gt;quoted after M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', pp. 306, 307. Translation by M. Gardell&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked whether the church burnings were linked to [[Odinism]] or [[Germanic neopaganism]] he replied: "The point is that all these churches [i.e. church burnings] are linked to one person ... who was not [[Euronymous|Øystein]] obviously. All the church burnings, with the exception of Stavanger, because that was another group—who, by the way, have also turned into nationalistic pagans."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bergens Tidende'' article====

In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'', brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; In the anonymous interview, "Count Grishnackh" (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; ''BT'' journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder set up a meeting with Count Grishnackh with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and reportedly warned that they would be shot if the police were called.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be devil worshippers and said: "Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that is why we are telling this to ''Bergens Tidende''." They gave the journalists details about the arsons that hadn't been released to the press, so ''BT'' spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt;

The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the ''BT''. It was headlined "We Lit the Fires" and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police allegedly found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer,&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; although Vikernes believes that Tønder "snitched" on him.&lt;ref name=varg-satanrides&gt;[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/satan_rides_the_media.shtml Varg Vikernes' review of ''Satan Rides the Media'']. Burzum.org&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal, and get more customers for Helvete.&lt;ref name="Count Regrets Nothing"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 November 2017|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml|title="Count" Regrets Nothing (04.07.2009), by Rune Midtskogen|location=Telemark, Norway|website=www.burzum.org|publisher=''[[Dagbladet]]''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729085215/http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml|archivedate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Burzum was about to release the ''[[Aske (EP)|Aske]]'' mini-album.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; Vikernes said of the interview: "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it."&lt;ref name=varg-satanrides/&gt; Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] of [[Hades Almighty|Hades]] said that the interview had "grave consequences" for the rest of the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as "he had said nothing". He added that they became "bloody angry" and he, Tunsberg, was "pissed off".&lt;ref&gt;Torstein Grude: ''[[Satan rir media]]'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian magazine ''Rock Furore'' published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system: "It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in March for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt;

===Murder of Øystein Aarseth===
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, and between Euronymous and the Norwegian black metal scene.&lt;ref name=LoC117&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Bergens Tidende'' episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media.&lt;ref name=LoC120&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Tøyengata (English: Tøyen Street) in Oslo.&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |people=Stefan Rydehed (director) |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |url= |medium=motion picture |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, many blamed Swedish black metalers for the murder.&lt;ref name=LoC117/&gt;

It has been speculated{{by whom|date=February 2017}} that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at "outdoing" a recent stabbing in Lillehammer committed by Emperor drummer Faust.&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;[http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/ Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music]&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes denies all of these rumours, stating that he killed Euronymous in self-defense: He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]]. Vikernes explains: "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody, I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me."&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |people=Aaron Aites (director, producer), Audrey Ewell (director, producer) |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |url= |medium=motion picture |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt;&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous "panicked" and kicked him in the chest.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The two got into a struggle, and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; After the slaying, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The self-defense story is doubted by [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] drummer [[Faust (musician)|Faust]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was "in the wrong place at the wrong time".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Blackthorn claims that in the summer of 1993, he was almost [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, "I was neither for nor against it.

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.&lt;ref name=LoC120/&gt; The police found 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home.&lt;ref name="Dagbladet.no"&gt;{{cite web |author=Midtskogen, Rune |title="Greven" angrer ingenting |date=4 July 2009 |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/07/04/magasinet/innenriks/kriminalomsorg/kirkebrann/drapsdom/7051663/ |accessdate=25 August 2009 |language=Norwegian |trans-title="The Count" regrets nothing}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jeffrey Kaplan in his book ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]'', Vikernes "intended to blow up [[Blitz (movement)|Blitz House]], the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo",&lt;ref name="Kapl-319"/&gt; a plan which "was reportedly on the verge of execution."&lt;ref name="Kapl-319"/&gt; In an article originally published in 1999, [[Kevin Coogan]] also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to "destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House,"&lt;ref name="Coogan"&gt;Coogan 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and stated "Vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act."&lt;ref name="Coogan"/&gt; Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, stating "I was getting [the explosives and ammunition] in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union could have decided to attack us. We have no reason to trust neither the government, the royal family or the military because of [[Norwegian Campaign|what happened last time we were attacked]]. We are left to ourselves."&lt;ref name="Dagbladet.no"/&gt;

====Trial====
Vikernes' trial began on 2 May 1994; he was represented by the lawyer [[Stein-Erik Mattsson]].&lt;ref&gt;Sortland, Kjersti, &amp; Bjørn Reese. 1997. "Greven" opprørt. ''VG'' (13 April): 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were put on trial around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', "Vikernes is disgusted by the fact that, while he held fast to a code of silence, others confessed."&lt;ref name=LoC141&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial the media made Vikernes "the nation's first real bogeyman in fifty years".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The court alleged that this third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi; to make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives.&lt;ref name="Count Regrets Nothing"/&gt; Though Vikernes only confessed to the theft and storage of the explosives, two churches were set on fire the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".&lt;ref name=LoC141/&gt; Blackthorn, who hadn't taken part in the murder as he had gone down the condominium's stairs to smoke, was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.&lt;ref name=LoC141/&gt;

May 1994 also saw the release of Mayhem's album ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |coauthors= |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |pages= | accessdate=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the release, Euronymous' family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

===Imprisonment===
Vikernes served his sentence at the prisons in Bergen, [[Tønsberg]], [[Ringerike Prison|Ringerike]], [[Trondheim Prison|Trondheim]], and [[Tromsø]].

[[File:Vargsmål.gif|thumb|right|''Vargsmål'', written by Vikernes in 1994]]

In late 1994, Vikernes wrote a Norwegian-language book called ''Vargsmål'' ("Varg's Speech"&lt;ref name="VargsmålComment"/&gt;). Vikernes has said he wrote ''Vargsmål'' to defend himself against "all the media lies", and that the book is marked by his isolation and anger at the time. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', ''Vargsmål'' became available on the internet for some time in 1996 but not in a printed form.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (1998):159&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a Norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book; its publication was financed by Vikernes' mother, Helene Bore.&lt;ref name = "hist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc. |year=2003 |location=New York City |page=279 |url= |id= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Vikernes stated that "the prison authorities confiscated the manuscript, and for several years I wasn't allowed to even proof-read it. It was an unfinished manuscript, consisting of many separate articles, and ideally I would have been able to make some changes before it was published, but I wasn't. Eventually I gave up and just published it as it was – with all the errors and not-so-balanced articles."&lt;ref name=vargbooks&gt;Vikernes, Varg.

Retrieved 4 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 1997, Norwegian police arrested five [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] in [[Hemnes]]. According to police, the young men were part of a self-styled "[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe]]" and were plotting attacks on political and religious figures in Norway. They also had plans to break Vikernes out of prison.&lt;ref name=LOC362&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; The group "had all the trappings of a paramilitary unit", including guns, explosives, bulletproof vests, steel helmets and balaclavas.&lt;ref name=LOC362/&gt; One of its members, Tom Eiternes, had befriended Vikernes in prison before escaping while on leave.&lt;ref name=LOC362/&gt; Vikernes' mother, Lene Bore, was arrested for supplying the group with 100,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]]. She confessed, but claimed she did not know they were "right-wing extremists" and said her son was being attacked by fellow inmates. In late 1996, his jaw had reportedly been broken in a fight with another inmate. However, the prison director said her claims were unfounded, and police suspected that the money came from Vikernes himself.&lt;ref name=LOC362/&gt; ''Lords of Chaos'' says that Vikernes adopted a "[[White power skinhead|skinhead]]" look and wore a belt buckle with SS insignia around this time.&lt;ref name=LOC362/&gt; Despite her confession, Bore was not convicted,&lt;ref name=LOC362/&gt; and in 1998 the case against the "Einsatzgruppe" was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums made up wholly of [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[neofolk]] music. The first, ''[[Dauði Baldrs]]'', was recorded in 1994–1995 and released in October 1997. The second, ''[[Hliðskjálf (album)|Hliðskjálf]]'', was recorded in 1998 and released in April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intro.de/kuenstler/interviews/23043719/norwegischer-black-metal-als-die-kirchen-brannten |title=Norwegischer Black Metal |language=de |publisher=Intro.de |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer. In 2000, Vikernes decided to put Burzum on hold. He believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and Satanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/lords_of_chaos_review.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A review of M.

Søderlind's "Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of The Satanic Metal Underground" (new edition) |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, through his website, he indicated that he hoped to continue Burzum after his release from prison, stating: "I will publish a few books, possibly using a pseudonym in order to stay anonymous, and perhaps a Burzum album or two, but that's it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story09.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part IX – The Tomorrow |publisher=Burzum.org |date=24 February 2006 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1998 and 2004, Vikernes would write a further five books in prison.&lt;ref name=vargbooks/&gt; In 1998 he wrote a book called ''Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'' ("Teutonic Mythology and Worldview"). Apart from ''Vargsmål'', this is the only other book that was published. In 2004, he translated it into English, added new material, and renamed it ''The Mysteries and Mythology of Ancient Scandinavia''. In 1999, he wrote ''EihwaR'', a "philosophical/political/historical novel in form of a dialogue between a student and an oppositional". This too he translated into English and renamed ''The Religion of the Blood''. That year, he also wrote a Norwegian and English translation and interpretation of ''[[Völuspá]]''. In 2000–2001, he wrote ''Teorier'' ("Theories"). It offered some theories on the origin of different customs and beliefs, and contained several short stories about the prehistoric era. However, he decided to scrap this book. In 2003–2004 he wrote a "gothic-fantasy novel" called ''The Cult of Hel''.&lt;ref name=vargbooks/&gt; By late 2003, he had begun writing articles for Burzum.org, which became the official Burzum website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_terrorizer.shtml Interview with Varg Vikernes for "Terrorizer" Magazine (#194, March 2010), by James Minton].

Inside it was a family of three, who said that he hijacked the car at gunpoint. About 19 hours later, police stopped the car in [[Romerike]] and arrested him.&lt;ref name=blabberoct27/&gt; The car contained knives, a gas mask, camouflage clothing, a portable [[GPS navigation device|GPS navigator]], maps, a compass, a laptop and a mobile phone.&lt;ref name=blabberoct28/&gt; Police also found a handgun and an [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|AG3]] automatic rifle in a cabin in [[Rollag]], where Vikernes had hidden during his escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16349 "VARG VIKERNES Refuses To Name Accomplices, Faces Additional Prison Time"].

Retrieved 4 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that his escape "was well planned and involved assistance from several people on the outside".&lt;ref name=blabberoct28/&gt; Before the escape, Vikernes gave his mother a letter. In it, he wrote that he had received death threats and another inmate had tried to strangle him shortly after the newspaper article was published.&lt;ref name=blabberoct27/&gt; For his actions, thirteen months were added to Vikernes' sentence and he was moved to a prison in Ringerike. In July 2004, he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Trondheim. The last three years of his sentence were spent in [[Tromsø Prison]].

When Vikernes was convicted, it was possible to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His lawyer, [[John Christian Elden]], has complained that the policy change is a form of [[Ex post facto law|retroactive legislation]]. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force. Vikernes was denied parole again in June 2008, although he was allowed to leave Tromsø Prison for short periods to visit his family. His full sentence would run for another seven years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Too dangerous for parole"&gt;[[Aftenposten]], English edition, 11 June 2008:[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2477398.ece Too dangerous for parole] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/61BibRB0d?url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2477398.ece |date=24 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/news.shtml |title=Burzum and Varg Vikernes news and updates |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, however, his parole was announced.

===Life after prison===
Vikernes continued with Burzum after his release. He released a further three black metal albums: ''[[Belus (album)|Belus]]'' (2010), ''[[Fallen (Burzum album)|Fallen]]'' (2011) and ''[[Umskiptar]]'' (2012) and a compilation of re-recorded songs (''[[From the Depths of Darkness]]''). On 27 April 2013, Vikernes posted a song on his official YouTube channel, titled Back to the Shadows, which Vikernes has stated to be the last [[Heavy metal music|metal]] track to be released by Burzum.&lt;ref&gt;Varg Vikernes: [http://thuleanperspective.com/2013/04/30/shadows-of-the-mind/ ''Shadows of the Mind''], 30 April 2013, accessed on 27 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8RtBSXCo4M ''Back to the Shadows''], 27 April 2013, accessed on 27 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, he released another ambient album, ''[[Sôl austan, Mâni vestan]]''.

Vikernes also continued writing, both on his Burzum website and on his personal blog, Thulean Perspective, which was set up in January 2013. The website Ancestral Cult was created by him and his wife. Also in 2013, they released a film called ''ForeBears'', based on ancient Germanic pagan rituals.&lt;ref name="VICE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/role-playing-camping-trips-and-films-about-bears-inside-the-wild-world-of-varg-vikernes|title=Role Playing, Camping Trips, and Films About Bears: Inside the Wild World of Varg Vikernes|author=Staff writer(s)|website=VICE|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and politics==

===Odalism===
{{quotebox|text=Ôðalism is in the strictest sense an ideology based on blood (of the native population) and soil (the homeland of the native population); protecting, promoting and if necessary reviving the customs, traditions, world view, values and religion that naturally came from each particular population in their homeland.

In ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'', director [[Sam Dunn]] described Vikernes as "the most notorious metal musician of all time" due to his crimes as well as his political and religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Dunn, Sam (Director) |date=5 August 2005 |url= |title=Metal: A Headbanger's Journey |medium=motion picture |location=Canada |publisher=Dunn, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late '90s, "to avoid confusion" and "to find a term more suitable and accurate", Vikernes coined the name "Odalism" for his beliefs, based on the [[Odal (rune)|Odal]] rune. He explains that Odalism encompasses "Paganism, traditional nationalism, racialism and environmentalism". Vikernes contrasts it with "modern 'civilization'" which he equates with "capitalism, [[materialism]], [[Judeo-Christianity]], pollution, urbanization, [[race-mixing]], [[Americanization]], socialism, [[globalization]], ''et cetera''". He places importance on the fact that Odalism "is not a term tainted by history". The word comes "From Norse ''óðal'' ([[homeland]], [[allod]]ium, [[Allodial title|allodial law]], [[nobility]], [[Nobility|noble]], inherited goods, [[fatherland]], land property, distinguished family, [[distinguished]], splendid, [[Kinship|kin]] and the nation)".&lt;ref name="Ghost" /&gt;

In a 2010 interview with ''Vampiria'' magazine, Vikernes was asked about Odinism playing a major role in his life, to which he responded: "I am not religious in any way, but I have a Pagan ideology and Pagan values. I believe in blood, soil and honour; family, homeland and [[hamingja]]; strength, traditions and courage. And I believe in a Europe waking up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_vampiria.shtml |title=Interview with Varg Vikernes |publisher=Burzum.org |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, Vikernes embraces a "modern scientific worldview resting on a foundation made up of the Pagan values and ideals: loyalty, wisdom, courage, love, discipline, honesty, intelligence, beauty, responsibility, health and strength".&lt;ref name="bards8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_bards_tale08.shtml |title=Bard's Tale: part VIII: Religion or Reason |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He draws a direct connection between both [[race and intelligence]] and [[Religiosity and intelligence|intelligence and religion]], denouncing [[theism]] as "mental enslavement" fit only for "inferior races".&lt;ref name="bards8" /&gt;

In addition to ''Vargsmål'', works by Vikernes on his personal religious world view include ''Irminsûl'' and ''Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'' (''Germanic Mythology and Worldview''). In 2011, Vikernes published his first book in English, entitled ''Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia'', about the religious practices of Scandinavian peoples, particularly during the [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vikernes| first = Varg| title = Varg Vikernes "Sorcery And Religion In Ancient Scandinavia"| date = 27 August 2011| url = http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/sorcery_and_religion_in_ancient_scandinavia.shtml | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting most contemporary academic theories, he takes inspiration from [[James George Frazer|Sir James Frazer]]'s work ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' in interpreting the myths as representing aspects of yearly rituals related to death, burial and ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Vikernes| first = Varg| title = Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia| publisher = Abstract Sounds Books Ltd| edition = 1st| date = 5 December 2012| page = 6| isbn = 978-0-9566959-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pomo| first = Brian| title = "Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia" by Varg Vikernes| publisher = Heathen Harvest| date = 17 May 2012| url = http://heathenharvest.org/2012/05/17/sorcery-and-religion-in-ancient-scandinavia-by-varg-vikernes-3/| accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associations with Nazism===
In a July 2005 statement on his website, Vikernes wrote that although he "occasionally used the term 'nazism' to describe [his] ideological foundation", he no longer describes himself as such.&lt;ref name="Ghost"/&gt; He had labelled himself as a follower of [[Nazism]] from the period following his 1994 conviction&lt;ref name="Coogan"/&gt; to the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Ghost"/&gt; The reason, he said, was "because many of the Norwegian (and German) 'nazis' embraced our Pagan religion as our blood-religion and they rejected [[Judeo-Christian]]ity as Jewish [[heresy]]".&lt;ref name="Ghost"&gt;Varg Vikernes: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part VII – The Nazi Ghost''], July 2005, accessed on 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies three things which distinguish him from the "Nazis": "unlike them I am not socialistic (not even on a national level), I am not materialistic and I believe in (''the ancient Scandinavian''!) democracy".&lt;ref name="Ghost"/&gt; He expresses a desire to not be associated with [[Anti-Slavism|anti-Slavic]] sentiments.&lt;ref name="Ghost"/&gt; He also states that though he is a racist in the sense that he acknowledges physical and mental differences between the races, he hates no one and in general states that "hatred is irrational".&lt;ref name="Dagbladet.no"/&gt;

Religious studies scholar Egil Asprem characterised Vikernes as "an idol for skinheads with an inclination towards Paganism and for contemporary Pagans with an inclination towards National Socialism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Heathens Up North: Politics, Polemics, and Contemporary Paganism in Norway |journal=The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies |last=Asprem |first=Egil |year=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=59 |ref=harv |doi=10.1558/pome.v10i1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jewish author [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] described Vikernes as "busy promoting his [[Odinist]] and National Socialist philosophy from behind bars".&lt;ref name="Kapl-319"/&gt; According to author Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, "while in jail, Vikernes began to formulate his heathen ideology using material from Norse mythology combined with [[Esoteric Nazism|occult National Socialism]]".&lt;ref name="GC204"/&gt; Goodrick-Clarke bases this account of Vikernes' beliefs on some articles that Vikernes had written for the short-lived magazine ''Filosofem''. He also uses the book ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'', and a manifesto called ''Vargsmål'' ("Varg's Speech"&lt;ref name="VargsmålComment"/&gt;), which Vikernes began to write after his imprisonment. Vikernes has denounced the English translation of his book in an article on his website. He has also stated on the website that "''Vargsmål'' was written in anger, while I was young and in isolation, and the book is marked by this".&lt;ref name="VargsmålComment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_comment_to_vargsmal_and_other_books_by_varg_vikernes.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A Comment to "Vargsmål" and other books by Varg Vikernes |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 interview for the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' claimed that he was associated with neo-Nazi groups during his time in prison. He replied: "I have never formed or been a member of such organisations. The only organization I am a member of is [[Riksmål Society|Riksmålsforbundet]]" (''The Society for the Preservation of Traditional Standard Norwegian'').&lt;ref name="Dagbladet.no"/&gt; According to Swedish scholar [[Matthias Gardell]] in his book ''[[Gods of the Blood]]'', Vikernes became a central figure in the [[Neo-völkisch movements|neo-völkisch]] [[Heathen Front]] during his time in prison.&lt;ref&gt;"Advocating national socialism, anti-Semitism, eugenics, and racist paganism, Vikernes launched Norsk Hedensk Front in 1993, which soon evolved into a network of independent tribes called the Allgermanische Heidnische Front (AHF)". Gardell 2003: 307.&lt;/ref&gt; The Heathen Front started as a group in Norway, ''Norsk Hedensk Front'' (Norwegian Heathen Front) or NHF, and grew into the international ''Allgermanische Heidnische Front'' (Pan-Germanic&lt;!--This is the correct translation: Germanisch=Germanic, referring to the historic Germanic tribes, not to inhabitants of contemporary Germany--&gt; Heathen Front) or AHF. Vikernes was considered to be the leader of the Norwegian Heathen Front, according to Xavier Cattarinich,&lt;ref&gt;"Vikernes is also the self-proclaimed leader of the Norsk Hedensk Front (Norwegian Heathen Front) and of an international heathen brotherhood he calls Cymophane." Article by Xavier Cattarinich, Kaplan 2000: 319.&lt;/ref&gt; and Goodrick-Clarke mentions that Vikernes underlined "his role as chieftain of his Norwegian Heathen Front" with the writing of ''Vargsmål''.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was asked about his involvement in the AHF in a 2004 interview, Vikernes stated that it was [[Anti-fascism|Antifa]] groups who "repeatedly wrote" that the NHF was a neo-Nazi group and that he was their leader, claims which he describes as "persecution".&lt;ref name="BZINT"/&gt; He also said that "the [Norwegian] secret police claimed adamantly" that he was the leader of the Heathen Front.&lt;ref name="BZINT"/&gt; Vikernes then continued by stating that, as a result of these claims, he left the Heathen Front, to see what "the Antifa/Monitor morons and the secret police would do". In practice, Vikernes stated, he never was a member of the group, since, being in prison, he could not participate in their activities and he had never "met half of them".&lt;ref name="BZINT"/&gt; He also stated that if he wanted to write articles for their magazine, he could do that regardless of whether he was a member or not.&lt;ref name="BZINT"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Vikernes has a son who was born in 2007 to his wife Marie Cachet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Verdens Gang|VG Nett]], 11 June 2008: [http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=513005 Varg Vikernes for farlig for friheten] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filosofem.altervista.org/bio.htm |title=Biografia |publisher=Filosofem.altervista.org |date= |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 interview, he said he and his wife were expecting a second child (Vikernes' third).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/07/06/540102.html Rune Midtskogen, "Jeg er klar for samfunnet"] ''Dagbladet'' 6 June 2008.

Vikernes is a [[teetotaler]] and claims to have never used alcohol or other recreational drugs. He also avoids the unnecessary use of pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref name="Count Regrets Nothing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 November 2017|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2005_interview_metalcrypt.shtml|title=Interview with Varg Vikernes (10.05.2005), by Chris Mitchell|website=www.burzum.org|quote=No, I have never experienced with drugs.
