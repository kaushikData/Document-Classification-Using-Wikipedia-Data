'''48 Wall Street''', known at one time as the '''Bank of New York Building'''  was built in 1928 on land used by the bank since 1797, on the corner of [[Wall Street]] and [[William Street (Manhattan)|William Street]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyscraper.org/webwalk/printable/WallStreetTour.pdf skyscraper.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is 156 m tall. In 2001 [[Rockefeller Group Business Center]] opened their offices within this historic building. Its former banking hall has been modified to house the [[Museum of American Finance]], which moved there in October 2007.

Immediately outside is the entrance for the [[Wall Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Wall Street]] subway station (served by the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn}}) on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]].

'''Muhammed Aziz Khan''' (born 1955) is a Bangladeshi businessman, founder and chairman of the [[Summit Group]], one of the largest conglomerates in Bangladesh, whose power projects generate nearly 20% of Bangladesh's electricity.&lt;ref name=SummitBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://summitpowerinternational.com/board-directors |title=Muhammed Aziz Khan |website=Summitgroupbd.com |date= |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum-americas.org/profile/muhammed-aziz-khan |title=Muhammed Aziz Khan &amp;#124; International Economic Forum of the Americas |website=Forum-americas.org |date= |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ds15Mar2016"&gt;{{cite news |title=Summit plans to raise funds from Singapore bourse |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/business/summit-plans-raise-funds-singapore-bourse-791293 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=15 March 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan has led Summit Group from starting as Bangladesh's first private sector power producer to a diversified group with investments across power, energy trading, port, telecommunications, hospitality and real estate.&lt;ref name="ds15Mar2016"/&gt;

Khan has led Summit in building partnerships with multinationals such as [[General Electric|GE]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] and [[Wärtsilä|Wartsila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Summit Group|title=Video Profile: Muhammed Aziz Khan, Chairman, Summit|date=20 September 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCacMFxwCso|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while securing billions of dollars in financing for infrastructure projects within Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Sharier |date=20 December 2010 |title=Summit assured of $2b financing |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-166663 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan pledged to invest another $3&amp;nbsp;billion into Bangladesh's energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grab business opportunities in Bangladesh |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/grab-business-opportunities-bangladesh-206959 |newspaper=The Daily Star |agency=UNB |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan, his wife and three family members have been named by the [[ICIJ]] as operating six offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands using a Singapore address. Summit itself states that it does not have any association with these scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2016/05/07/150229.php |title=Summit rejoinder on Panama Papers |newspaper=The Daily Observer |date= |accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Khan is the son of an army officer.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt; His first steps as an businessman were taken with a friend, whose father's death thrust him into the family import business. The 18-year-old Khan borrowed Tk 30,000 from his father to partner in the venture in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The infrastructure trailblazer|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/business/the-infrastructure-trailblazer-150862 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received an MBA in 1980 from the [[Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka]] (IBA).&lt;ref name="Summit Power"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing the Directors|url=http://www.summitpower.org/Boardofdirectors.html|website=Summit Power|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt; He studied in Armanitola Government High School and Notredame College, Dhaka.

==Career==
Under the leadership of Khan, [[Summit Group]] set up the country's first independent power plant in 1998, Khulna Power Company Limited.&lt;ref name="forum-americas1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum-americas.org/profile/muhammed-aziz-khan|title=Muhammed Aziz Khan {{!}} International Economic Forum of the Americas|website=forum-americas.org|access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summit set up the country's first private off-dock facility, Ocean Containers Limited, now known as Summit Alliance Ports Limited which is currently handling about 30% of the country's export and about 10% of the country's import volume.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Summit Communications Ltd is the first company to lay nationwide telecommunication transmission network laying fibre optic to 70% of Bangladesh, and connecting Bangladesh to India and Myanmar through terrestrial fibre optics.&lt;ref name="forum-americas1"/&gt;

IPCO Ltd, a hospitality and real estate company, is building one five star and one three star hotels, a convention hall and 1000 shops beside the International Airport of Dhaka.&lt;ref name="IPCO Hotels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipco.com.bd/|title=IPCO {{!}} IPCO Hotels and IPCO Development Bangladesh Limited|website=ipco.com.bd/|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Khan led Summit Group in establishing a joint venture with [[GE]] to build plants generating 327 megawatts of electricity for Bangladesh. This joint venture secured funding of $327&amp;nbsp;million, including $112&amp;nbsp;million from the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Summit Power gets finance for GE joint venture |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/summitpower-idUSLDE70T05M20110130?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=industrialsSector |newspaper=Reuters |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Khan led Summit Group in establishing a joint venture with China Energy Group, the largest government-owned Chinese company, to build various power projects, including a 341 megawatt power plant with a $220&amp;nbsp;million deal for China Energy Group to provide construction and engineering services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Summit inks energy deal with Chinese company |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-258489 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Khan was elected president of the Bangladesh Association of Publicly Listed Companies.&lt;ref name="ds18Dec2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Aziz Khan elected BAPLC president |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/100050/Aziz-Khan-elected-BAPLC-president |newspaper=Daily Sun |date=18 December 2015 |access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led Summit Group in winning a deal to build Bangladesh's first high-tech business park, agreeing to invest $207&amp;nbsp;million to build part of the park across its 232-acre land in Kaliakor, Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh inks deal to build high-tech business park |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-29/news/63937643_1_first-phase-foreign-direct-investment-summit-group |newspaper=The Economic Times |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd. |date=29 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Khan, his wife Anjuman Aziz Khan, daughter Ayesha Aziz Khan, brother Zafar Umayyad Khan and nephew Faisal Karim Khan were named in the [[Panama Papers]] as operating six offshore companies, mostly in the British Virgin Islands using a Singapore address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2016/04/07/145571.php |title=Bangladeshis not outside Panama Papers |newspaper=The Daily Observer |date= |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summit Group states that it has no business in any form in Panama, nor it has any link with the legal firm Mossack Fonseca, and that there has not been any mention whatsoever of Khan in "The Panama Papers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2016/05/07/150229.php |title=Summit rejoinder on Panama Papers |newspaper=The Daily Observer |date= |accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Board of Revenue]] (NBR) has started an investigation into the money laundering and tax evasion histories of 25 Bangladeshi politicians and businessmen, including Khan; and the [[Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh]] (ACC) has created a three-member committee to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.banglanews24.com/national/article/51327/NBR-probing-into-Bangladeshi-names-on-Panama-Papers |title=NBR probing into Bangladeshi names on Panama Papers |newspaper=Banglanews24.com |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bangladesh-based British journalist [[David Bergman (journalist)|David Bergman]] has clarified that the only Bangladeshi people linked to offshore companies as released by the ICIJ relate to an earlier 2013 leak of information involving the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergman |first=David |url=http://bangladeshpolitico.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/icij-2013-leak-database.html |title=Bangladesh Politico: ICIJ 2013 leak database |website=Bangladeshpolitico.blogspot.co.uk |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Khan was appointed Honorary Consul General of Finland in Bangladesh due to his long-standing business relationship with Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aziz Khan as honorary consul general of Finland in Bangladesh|url=http://www.banglanews24.com/business/article/52699/Aziz-Khan-as-honorary-consul-general-of-Finland-in-Bangladesh |newspaper=BanglaNews24 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Aziz Khan has led Summit Group in building close trade relationships with leading Finnish company [[Wartsila]], who has supplied machinery and equipment to many of the Summit Group's power project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Finland opens honorary consulate general in Bangladesh|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2016/05/31/finland-opens-honorary-consulate-general-in-bangladesh |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, Khan led Summit Group in securing $190&amp;nbsp;million in a consortium led by [[Standard Chartered]] to finance a $335 megawatt power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-invest.be/nl/rss-news/news/186-stanchart-raises-190m-for-summit-power-plant.html|title=RSS Nieuws – BIO-Invest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan also helped arranged the largest ever direct loan given to a Bangladeshi company in 2016 for $210&amp;nbsp;million by [[Asian Development Bank]], [[International Finance Corporation]] and [[Islamic Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sharebazarbd24.com/news/details/Share_Bazar/123 |title=Summit eyes listing with S'pore stock exchange |date=13 March 2016 |website=Share Bazar BD 24 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan has also indicated that Summit may list on the Singapore Stock Exchange, making it the first Bangladeshi company to do so.&lt;ref name="ds15Mar2016"/&gt;

In September 2016, Khan announced that Summit Group has established a Singaporean company that it will publicly list in Singapore and help raise $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion to invest in Bangladesh projects such as a liquified natural gas terminal and additional power capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arun Devnath More stories by Arun Devnath |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-07/bangladesh-s-top-utility-to-invest-2-5-billion-in-lng-power |title=Bangladesh's Top Utility to Invest $2.5 Billion in LNG, Power |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Md Fazlur Rahman |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/summit-group-raise-25b-1282564 |title=Summit Group to raise $2.5b |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Summit Group announced that it would build a $500&amp;nbsp;million [[Liquefied natural gas terminal|LNG terminal]] in Moheshkhali, Bangladesh. The project brings [[GE]] as an equity partner. Khan has said, "We want to ensure constant supply of primary energy for the country by implementing this project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Summit signs deal to build $500m LNG terminal |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/business/summit-signs-deal-build-500m-lng-terminal-1340404 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Forbes Asia listed Khan and family 34th richest in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From plastics, Aziz Khan powers his way to business empire |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/business/from-plastics-he-powers-his-way-to-business-empire?&amp;utm_source=whatsapp&amp;utm_medium=social-media&amp;utm_campaign=addtoany |newspaper = The Straits Times |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Mitsubishi Corporation acquired 25% of Summit LNG Terminal Co (Pvt) Ltd.

The '''Banking Industry Architecture Network e.V.''' ('''BIAN''') is an independent, member owned, [[not-for-profit]] association to establish and promote a common [[Architecture framework|architectural framework]] for enabling [[banking]] [[interoperability]].  It was established in 2008.

BIAN's goal is to establish a [[semantic framework]] to identify and define [[IT services]] in the [[banking industry]]. The underlying architectural pattern originates from a [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=OpenG SOA|title=Open Group SOA Source Book|url=http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa/soa.htm|website=opengroup.org|publisher=OpenGroup|accessdate=9 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819141303/http://opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa/soa.htm|archive-date=2016-08-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community focuses on creating a standard semantic banking services landscape, while ensuring consistent service definitions, levels of detail and boundaries. This will enable banks to achieve a reduction of integration costs&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Rosen (enterprise architect)|Rosen, Michael]], et al. Applied SOA: service-oriented architecture and design strategies. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manoj|first1=Mansukhani|title=Service Oriented Architecture Whitepaper|url=ftp://hp.pl/ftp1/pub/services/spotlight/info/soa_wp_062005.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2014|publisher=HP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use the advantages of a service-oriented architecture of implementing [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) software.

[[Financial institutions]], software vendors, and system integrators, along with technology partners, are invited to join the association and play a collaborative role with other industry leaders in defining, building and implementing next-generation banking platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BIAN|url=https://bian.org/about-bian/|website=www.bian.org|publisher=BIAN|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

Banks are facing challenges that will eventually force them to decompose their business and IT landscape into independent but interlinked units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=Chirs|title=Digital Bank|publisher=Marshall Cavendish C/O Times E, 2014|isbn=978-9-814-51646-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore looking for better means of interaction in their systems.

The banking environment consists of many legacy systems that have, over the years, grown in complexity and become increasingly inflexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O´Hara|first1=Christopher|title=Improving Product Development Through Core System Replacement|url=http://www.banktech.com/channels/improving-product-development-through-core-systems-replacement/d/d-id/1292297|website=www.banktech.com|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIAN is defining a common framework as a base for a shared service-oriented catalogue for the banking industry with the goal of establishing a common language. Based on broad consensus from within the banking industry, this will enable faster, more efficient strategic and operational changes in banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahmood|first1=Zaigham|title=Service Oriented Architecture: Potential Benefits and Challenges|url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2007cscc/papers/561-287.pdf|publisher=WSEAS International Conference on Computers|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist and guide the banking industry in achieving an architecture closely aligned with business objectives, leading banks are sharing their requirements for core services with leading software and services vendors to implement these services based on formally defined semantics. BIAN is a global, open, independent and unique community where banks, software providers, and system integrators openly exchange banking IT requirements with regard to interaction and integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christopher|first1=O'Hara|title=Improving Product Development Through Core System Replacement|url=http://www.banktech.com/channels/improving-product-development-through-core-systems-replacement/d/d-id/1292297|publisher=Bank Tech Systems|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BIAN strategy ==

BIAN brings banks, vendors of banking applications, and service providers together as a community to achieve synergies by collaborating on a consensus understanding of the requirements for banking enterprise services within an SOA framework and a formal description of a banking services landscape [[canonical form|canonical definitions]].

Employing an architectural framework to foster proper definition of services, BIAN will help banks and providers move from proprietary to broadly accepted and standardized services. BIAN also represents a repository of non-proprietary knowledge and experience dedicated to supporting the roadmaps for all banks moving towards SOA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BIAN|url=https://bian.org/about-bian/|website=www.bian.org|publisher=BIAN|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIAN will offer the industry assistance in:
*'''Standards:''' a definition of IT standards for SOA in Banking ensures the highest degree of efficiency. Standards do not mean that everything is identical though. They simply form the foundation for future oriented services that offer a maximum level of flexibility in the banking industry.
*'''Agility:''' standards provide the greatest opportunity for banks to adapt quickly and efficiently to changing market conditions and demands.
*'''Flexibility:''' interoperability between IT systems through widely agreed standards ensures the highest degree of efficiency, by enabling banks to quickly adjust to meet changing needs and new challenges in a constantly evolving industry.
*'''Evolution:''' change is a constant, also in business, which includes banking and IT. BIAN members from the IT industry who actively participate in the evolutionary process of the banking industry will also find themselves better positioned as their own markets evolve.
*'''Cost reduction:''' it is safe to say that all businesses would agree that increased flexibility in their operations, the ability to adapt and react efficiently to change, and the important of maintaining a future oriented approach to their industry and business model are beneficial. The reason is simple. All of these aspects serve to reduce costs while simultaneously improving service. BIAN thus considers cost reductions of the primary goals of its efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BIAN|title=Building the future of banking services|date=July 2014|url=https://bian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BIAN_brochure_update_July2013.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BIAN standards ==

The BIAN standards are provided from the BIAN working groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIAN Working Groups|url=https://bian.org/participate/bian-working-groups/|website=www.bian.org|publisher=BIAN|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIAN working groups collaborate, sharing knowledge and experience around SOA for the banking industry with a current focus on core systems. The working groups focus on defining services within an agreed overall common services landscape.

=== Service definitions ===

BIAN is focused on semantic definitions only. Definition of business functional services for [[retail banking]], [[private banking]] and [[corporate banking]].

=== Architecture ===

In the stream Architecture BIAN defines the appropriate guidelines and methodologies and all the concepts to ensure consistent services:
* The BIAN Service Landscape as an [[architectural framework]] for banks
* Methodologies and guidelines
* [[Service quality]]
* Service definition

== The BIAN service landscape ==

The BIAN Service Landscape is a [[Enterprise architecture framework|reference framework]] that categorizes and organizes BIAN Service Domains for ease of access. Different criteria can be used to classify and organize Service Domains that would result in different layouts of the standard set of BIAN Service Domains. BIAN uses a ‘primary’ Service Landscape view based on agreed categorizations that have been refined in use by the BIAN membership.

The BIAN [[Metamodel]] is a detailed and comprehensive [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] model that defines all the BIAN design structures – it is fully documented elsewhere in its own guide (The BIAN Metamodel). The Metamodel has three elements that capture the design of the BIAN Service Landscape.
# Business Area - is the highest-level classification. A business area groups together a broad set of business capabilities. For the BIAN Service Landscape they are defined to be aspects of business activity that have similar supporting application and information-specific needs. 
# Business Domain – at the next level, business domains define a coherent collection of capabilities within the broader business area. In the BIAN Service Landscape the business domains are associated with skills and knowledge recognizable in the banking business. 
# Service Domain – is the finest level of partitioning, each defining unique and discrete business capabilities. The Service Domains are the ‘elemental building blocks’ of a service landscape. The Service Domain relates to generic capabilities that do not vary in their scope, but the definitions of the Business Domain and Business Area are classifications that are specific to a particular Service Landscape layout. The Service Landscape layout can be varied depending on use.

== BIAN and other standards bodies ==

BIAN is in partnership with independent standards bodies such as [[Object Management Group]] [http://www.omg.org/ (OMG)] and [http://www.opengroup.org/ The Open Group] and IFX Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementing BIAN Service Domains using the IFX Business Message Specification|url=https://bian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BIAN-IFX-White-Paper-Implementing-BIAN-Service-Domains-using-the-IFX-Business-Message-Specification.pdf|publisher=BIAN &amp; IFX Forum Inc.|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, BIAN has a ‘category D liaison’ with the [[International Organisation for Standardisation]] (ISO), for [[ISO 20022]] semantic models. BIAN incorporates when possible the work of these organizations. As an example, the BIAN Metamodel is closely aligned to, and draws on parts of, the ISO20022 Meta Model for many of the detailed definitional aspects. These working partnerships mark a big step forward in BIAN’s commitment to complimentary standards collaboration.
 
The TOGAF standard and the BIAN standard are mapped to each other. The leverage of the BIAN deliverables in the context of the [[Architecture Development Method#Architecture Development Method|TOGAF Architecture Development Method]] (ADM) is further elaborated. For each step in an architecture development process, the integration of BIAN deliverables is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrating the TOGAF ® Standard with the BIAN Service Landscape|url=https://bian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wp_togaf_bian_version-2-0-final1.pdf|website=www.bian.org|publisher=TOGAF &amp; BIAN|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BIAN members ==

Members of BIAN drive the banking industry by understanding the requirements and trends as well as by designing and providing new IT-solutions therefore.
The association lives by the participation of its members. BIAN members contribute actively in the association. However the degree of involvement can vary according to multiple aspects. Influencing for the involvement are e.g. the role within BIAN, specific working topics and the current projects within BIAN and the own company.

The '''Banking Ombudsman Scheme''' in New Zealand is a free and independent dispute resolution service established in 1992. They look into complaints by customers about (New Zealand) banks and some non-bank deposit takers. A full list of scheme participants can be found on [https://bankomb.org.nz/the-complaint-process/bank-participant/ their website].

It is an approved dispute resolution scheme under the Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act 2008.

In the 2016 [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|MBIE]] [http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/consumer-protection/consumer-research-and-reports/national-consumer-survey National Consumer Survey] the Banking Ombudsman Scheme was listed as the most well known financial services dispute resolution scheme, and rated second overall.

The current Banking Ombudsman is Nicola Sladden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bankomb.org.nz/about-us/banking-ombudsman/|title=Banking Ombudsman Scheme website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Barbarians at the Gate''''' is a 1993 [[television movie]] based upon [[Barbarians at the Gate|the book]] by [[Bryan Burrough]] and [[John Helyar]], about the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO) of [[RJR Nabisco]].

The film was directed by [[Glenn Jordan]] and written by [[Larry Gelbart]]. It stars [[James Garner]] as [[F. Ross Johnson]], the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of RJR Nabisco, and [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Henry Kravis]], his chief rival for the company. It also features [[Peter Riegert]], [[Joanna Cassidy]] and [[Fred Dalton Thompson]].

The film won both the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe for Best Television Movie]] while James Garner won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Movie]].     [[FOX]] also aired the film later in the same year.

==Plot==
Self-made multimillionaire and RJR Nabisco CEO F. Ross Johnson decides to take the tobacco and food conglomerate company private in 1988 after receiving advance news of the likely market failure of the company's smokeless [[cigarette]] called [[Premier (cigarette)|Premier]], the development of which had been intended to finally boost the company's stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Those Good Old Takeover Days |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDB113CF93BA25750C0A965958260 |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 18, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free-spending Johnson's bid for the company is opposed by two of the pioneers of the [[leveraged buyout]], Henry Kravis and his cousin. Kravis feels betrayed when, after Johnson initially discusses doing the LBO with Kravis, he takes the potentially enormous deal to another firm,  the [[Shearson Lehman Hutton]] division of [[American Express]].

Other bidders emerge, including [[Theodore J. Forstmann|Ted Forstmann]] and his company, [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company|Forstmann Little]], after Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences. The bidding goes to unprecedented heights, and when executive Charles Hugel becomes aware of how much Johnson stands to profit in a transaction that will put thousands of Nabisco employees out of work, he quips, "Now I know what the 'F' in F. Ross Johnson stands for." The greed was so evident, Kravis's final bid is declared the winner, even though Johnson's was higher.

The title of the book and movie comes from a statement by Forstmann in which he calls that Kravis' money "phoney [[junk bond]] crap" and how he and his brother are "real people with real money," and that to stop raiders like Kravis: "We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates."

'''Break-even''' (or '''break even'''), often abbreviated as '''B/E''' in finance, is the point of balance making ''neither'' a profit nor a loss. The term originates in finance, but the concept has been applied widely since. 

==In economics==
{{Main|Break-even (economics)}}
In [[economics]] and [[business]], specifically [[cost accounting]], the '''break-even point''' ('''BEP''') is the point at which cost or expenses and revenue are equal: there is no net loss or gain, and one has "broken even." A profit or a loss has not been made, although [[opportunity cost]]s have been "paid" and capital has received the risk-adjusted, expected return. In other words, it´s the point in which the total revenue of a business exceed its total costs, and the business begins to create wealth instead of consuming it.&lt;ref name='R000000'&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine | first = David | authorlink = David K. Levine |author2=Michele Boldrin | title = ''Against Intellectual Monopoly'' | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2008-09-07 | location = | pages = 312 | url = http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-521-87928-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is shown graphically as the point where the total revenue and total cost curves meet. In the linear case the break-even point is equal to the fixed costs divided by the [[contribution margin]] per unit.

The break-even point is achieved when the generated profits match the total costs accumulated until the date of profit generation. Establishing the break-even point helps businesses in setting plans for the levels of production which it needs to maintain be profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Breakeven point|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/business/finance/profitabilityrev1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In finance==
The accounting method of calculating '''break-even point''' does not include cost of [[working capital]]. The [[financial]] method of calculating break-even, called '''value added break-even analysis''', is used to assess the feasibility of a project. This method not only accounts for all costs, it also includes the [[opportunity cost]]s of the [[Financial capital|capital]] required to develop a project.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard A. Brealey|Brealey, R.]], [[Stewart Myers|Myers, S.]], Marcus, A., Maynes, E., Mitra, D. 2009. Fundamentals of Corporate Finance. McGraw-Hill Ryerson. USA. pp. 284. {{ISBN|978-0-07-098403-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other fields==
In [[nuclear fusion]] research, the term "break-even" refers to a [[fusion energy gain factor]] equal to unity; this is also known as the [[Lawson criterion]].  The notion can also be found in more general phenomena, such as [[percolation]]. In energy, the break-even point is the point where usable energy gotten from a process equals the input energy.

In [[computer science]], the term (used infrequently) refers to a point in the life cycle of a [[programming language]] where the language can be used to code its own [[compiler]] or [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. This is also called [[self-hosting]].

In [[medicine]], it is a postulated state when the advances of medicine permit every year an increase of one year or more of the life expectancy ''of the living'', therefore leading to medical immortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; barring accidental death.

In [[soccer]], the break-even requirement was adopted by [[UEFA]] with the purpose of prohibiting clubs from spending more money on transfers than they actually earn as businesses, i.e. revenue per each fiscal year excluding donations from sponsors or advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/02/56/20/15/2562015_DOWNLOAD.pdf Page 38 (44 in PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">'''Completed staff work''' is a principle of [[management]] which states that subordinates are responsible for submitting written recommendations to superiors in such a manner that the superior need do nothing further in the process than review the submitted document and indicate approval or disapproval.

In Completed Staff Work, the subordinate is responsible for identifying the problem or issue requiring decision by some higher authority. In written form such as a memorandum, the subordinate documents the research done, the facts gathered, and analysis made of alternative courses of action. The memo concludes with a specific recommendation for action by the superior.

The earliest description of the concept of Completed Staff Work appears in [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] publications,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army (January 1953) ''Army Information Digest''&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources indicate its origin to be a decade earlier from the [[Canadian Army]]. Since its early military origin, it has subsequently found favor in police management texts in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal police administration by Institute for Training in Municipal Administration, 1961, Institute for Training in Municipal Administration, p.80-83&lt;/ref&gt;

James Webb, Director of the Bureau of the Budget (1946-1949), attributes the Doctrine of Completed Staff Work to President Harry S. Truman.&lt;ref name=Truman&gt;

'''''Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries''''' ('''''C&amp;T''''') is a magazine focusing on [[research and development]] in the [[cosmetics]] and [[personal care]] industry. The magazine is published by [[Allured Business Media]].  It is delivered to 97 countries on a monthly basis,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and is geared toward formulators, scientists, researchers, chemists and R&amp;D management in the industry. The magazine is available in both print and [[online magazine]] format. The headquarters is in [[Northbrook, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Contact Us|url=http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/contactus/|accessdate=17 February 2016|work=Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The publication began in March 1906 as "The American Perfumer", a monthly magazine published by [[Ungerer &amp; Company]]. In September 1906, the name changed to ''"The American Perfumer and Essential Oil Review"'', and the publisher changed to [[The Perfumer Publishing Company]]. At that time, the [[perfumery]] business was more prominent than cosmetics.
By 1935, the [[Moore Publishing Company]] bought the magazine. In 1956, [[Maison G. deNavarre]] had been writing and editing for the magazine for 24 years, and in January of that year, the owners again changed the magazine’s name to ''"American Perfumer and Aromatics"''. The publication focused on perfumery, [[Aromaticity|aromatics]] and [[flavor]]s, but deNavarre incorporated the occasional personal care product; for example, hand creams and [[royal jelly]]. In the early years of the magazine, there was no mandatory labeling of product ingredients, and cosmetic companies were afraid to have their scientists publish for fear of giving away trade secrets.

In March 1960, the Allured family purchased the "American Perfumer and Aromatics" from Moore Publishing. In 1961, the name was changed again to ''"American Perfumer and Cosmetics"''. The owners explained this change in the June 1962 issue:
“The change in name that you see on the cover, and on top of this page, is in belated recognition of an editorial fact of over 30 years’ duration. During this period this magazine has gradually meant more and more to the cosmetic chemist and pharmacist, as these specialties became the major customer for fragrances. In turn, the perfumer has been more and more involved in the technical problems that new cosmetic materials have forced upon him.”

In January 1972 the name was changed to ''American Cosmetics and Perfumery'', recognizing the changes taking place in [[cosmetic raw materials]], [[cosmetic research and development]], and [[cosmetic business]] in general. The publisher, Stanley E. Allured, believed the future of the personal care industry existed in new cosmetic raw materials and in new cosmetic product ideas. He would canvass cosmetics companies and hold meetings with R&amp;D vice presidents and [[laboratory]] managers to determine what should be covered in the magazine, as well as to encourage them to write articles for the magazine.
In 1973 the title was changed again to ''Cosmetics and Perfumery''. In January 1976, the publication was divided into two separate magazines: ''Perfumer &amp; Flavorist'' and ''Cosmetics and Toiletries''. In January 1979, an ampersand was substituted in ''Cosmetics and Toiletries'' to produce the current title, ''Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries''.

The '''Deming Prize''' is the longest-running and[[List of national quality awards| one of the highest awards]] on TQM (Total Quality Management) in the world. It recognizes both individuals for their contributions to the field of [[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]] (TQM) and businesses that have successfully implemented TQM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Evans | first = James R | last2 = Lindsay | first2 = William M | year = 1993 | title = The Management and Control of Quality | chapter = 5: Total Quality Management| edition = 4 | publisher = West Publishing | publication-place = [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]] | page = 112 | isbn =  9780314008640 | oclc = 25873758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1951 to honor [[W. Edwards Deming]] who contributed greatly to Japan’s proliferation of statistical quality control after World War II. His teachings helped Japan build its foundation by which the level of Japan’s product quality has been recognized as the highest in the world, was originally designed to reward [[Japan]]ese companies for major advances in [[quality improvement]]. Over the years it has grown, under the guidance of the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]] (JUSE) to where it is now also available to non-Japanese companies, albeit usually operating in Japan, and also to individuals recognized as having made major contributions to the advancement of quality. The awards ceremony is broadcast every year in Japan on national television.

Two categories of awards are made annually, the Deming Prize for Individuals and the Deming Prize.

The purpose of these technology platforms is to digitally enable seamless integration and information exchange within the organization to employees and outside the organization to customers, suppliers, and other business partners.

== History ==

=== Origin of "The Digital Firm" ===
The term "Digital Firm" originated, as a concept in a series of [[Management information system|Management Information Systems]] (MIS) books authored by [[Kenneth C. Laudon]] &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt; and it provides a new way to describe organizations that operate differently than the traditional [[brick and mortar]] business as a result of broad sweeping changes in technology and global markets. Digital firms place an emphasis on the digitization of business processes and services through sophisticated technology and information systems. These information systems create opportunities for digital firms to decentralize operations, accelerate market readiness and responsiveness, enhance customer interactions, as well as increase efficiencies across a variety of business functions.

=== Acceleration of technology adoption ===
Technology adoption has been increasing as digital firms continually look to achieve greater levels cost savings, competitive advantage, and operational performance optimization. As organizations adopt technology, the internal appetite for additional technologies increases and in some cases accelerates.&lt;ref name=Wharton/&gt; This acceleration of technology adoption by digital firms creates a "digital divide"&lt;ref name=Wharton/&gt; as emerging technology is absorbed at varying rates across organizations. This technology divergence can affect competitive dynamics in the market place between firms that achieve operational benefits from the technology and firms which have yet to adapt.

While the growth of new technology consumption is not uniform across organizations, the trend for business-driven investment in technology across all markets has and continues to increase. During the span of 1990 to 2006, the gross U.S. domestic investment in information and communications technology, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau, increased by 170%.&lt;ref name=Census2012/&gt;

The market for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and other packaged applications started to grow substantially during the 90's to the point that the ERP market alone accounts for approximately $25 billion.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; According to surveys conducted in 2002, nearly "75% of global Fortune 1000 firms had implemented SAP’s ERP suite".&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

== Advantages ==
Through digital networks and information systems, the digital firm is able to operate core business services and functions continuously and more efficiently. This digital enablement of business processes creates highly dynamic information systems allowing for more efficient and productive management of an organization.

Additionally, digital enablement of core business functions and services provides an organization with opportunities to:

* Operate business continuously ("Time Shifting") &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt;
* Operate business in a global workplace ("Space Shifting") &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt;
* Adapt business strategies to meet market demands &lt;ref name=Bartel /&gt;
* Create business value from technology investments &lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt;
* Drive efficiency improvements in inventory and supply chain &lt;ref name=Bartel /&gt;
* Enhance the management of customer relationships &lt;ref name=CRM /&gt;
* Improve organizational productivity &lt;ref name=ERP2 /&gt;

== Effects on organizational performance ==
Technology and information systems serve many critical roles in a digital firm by providing technology-driven capabilities that increase operational performance. For example, digital networks and information systems allow organizations to connect and integrate supply chains in ways that are real-time, uninterrupted and highly responsive to market conditions.

Another example of an information system that can increase an organization's performance awareness and management capabilities is a [[Real-time business intelligence|Real-Time Business Intelligence (RTBI)]] system. A RTBI system can provide a highly responsive and strategic decision support platform for an organization to analyze operational events as they occur. RTBI systems often work closely with [[Operational risk management|Organizational Risk Management (ORM)]] systems in this capacity to increase capabilities around monitoring operational performance and assessing operational risks. These types of information systems can increase an organization's capabilities to effectively manage performance and productivity.

The three main enterprise information systems that can positively affect an organization's performance and productivity are:

=== Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) ===
ERP deployments can be complex and require a significant shift in business operations for an organization but the benefits can be substantial.

After implementation of an ERP system within an organization there are measurable performance and productivity gains that can be directly correlated to the ERP system go-live event.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; This study conducted a detailed analysis of the ERP data produced and found that there was a direct causal relationship between ERP systems and performance gains in an organization.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

Organizations that deploy ERP systems typically, based on performance and productivity gains, also implement both of the following enterprise platforms as well.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

=== Customer Relationship Management (CRM) ===
Organizations leverage CRM systems to improve the overall management of their relationships with customers. CRM systems operate as enterprise platforms that provide digital firms with opportunities to closely manage all aspects of interactions with customers through customer-oriented business processes.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;

Organizations which implement CRM systems may encounter some lag time until the CRM productivity affects are fully realized in the firm based on studies.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;  However, the lag effects are difficult to measure and based in part on the organization's ability to leverage the new CRM system and adapt to the changes in business operations as a result.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;

=== Supply Chain Management (SCM) ===
Studies of organizations that implemented SCM systems to improve supply chain management capabilities found that those systems had a significant impact on productivity and performance within the organization.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; Additionally, the implementation of SCM and CRM systems differed from an ERP implementation in that organizational performance could be directly correlated "with both the initial purchase and go-live event".&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

SCM and CRM systems are often viewed as "extended enterprise systems" due to the way that they integrate with ERP systems and the benefits that they bring to organizations.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

The Institute was listed as one of the leading executive education programs by [[Chief Executive (magazine)|Chief Executive Magazine]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chiefexecutive.net/2013-leading-executive-education-programs/|title=2013 Leading Executive Education Programs|work=ChiefExecutive.net|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also ranked as one of the top five programs for [[Organization development|Organizational Development]] by [[HR.com]]'s Leadership Excellence And Development (LEAD) in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leadershipexcellenceanddevelopment.com/content/lead2016-leadership-excellence-award-winners|title=LEAD2016 Leadership Excellence Award Winners|last=design|date=2015-12-22|work=Leadership Excellence and Development Conference|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jim Liautaud co-founded the Institute in 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Working with [[Neuroscientist|neuroscientists]], [[Psychologist|psychologists]], [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] and researchers, Liautaud and his colleagues created a training program to quickly build successful intra-company teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liblog.net/single-post/2016/05/12/Benefits-of-ISO-and-Standardization-in-Training|title=Emotional Intelligence and Leadership Blog|website=Emotional Intelligence and Leadership Blog|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Institute started to catalog the best social habits from high-performing managers. They broke down each practice into a sequence of steps and standardized them so that they could be certified, similar to the way the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) certifies the quality of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Approach==
The EI Leadership Institute uses an approach called PDT (process-designed teams), applying the principles of [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Elinor Ostrom|Dr. Elinor Ostrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3607915/should-teams-manage-themselves/|title=Should Teams Manage Themselves?|website=Time|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their leadership forum program has shown a 23% increase in [[Emotional intelligence]] for participating executives over a two-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/raman-chadha/emotional-intelligence-critical-for-leaders-to-make-impact.html|title=Emotional Intelligence Is Critical for Leaders to Make an Impact|last=|first=|date=2013-10-04|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-12-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/chuck-blakeman/the-rugged-individualist-is-dead-it-s-about-time.html|title=The Rugged Individualist Is Dead|last=|first=|date=2015-03-03|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-12-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free was the third [[Internet service provider|ISP]] in France to offer [[Internet]] access without a subscription or a surcharged phone number, on 26 April 1999.&lt;ref name="jdnAvril1999"&gt;{{cite web| title= Internet gratuit : Free, un indépendant sur le marché de la fourniture d'accès | url= http://www.journaldunet.com/99avril/990427free.shtml | date=27 April 1999 | accessdate=2008-03-20 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its predecessors in the niche of [[Free ISP|access without subscription]] ([[World Online]] on 1999-04-01 and {{Interlanguage link multi|Freesurf|fr}} on 1999-04-19), Free's offer was not restricted in time or number of subscribers.

In 2002, Free was the first [[Internet service provider|ISP]] to provide a [[56k modem|V.92]] connection.&lt;ref name="CP_Free_270202"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= Free, accès en V92 | url= http://www.iliad.fr/presse/2002/CP_Free_270202.pdf | publisher = [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] | format = PDF | date=27 February 2002 | accessdate=2008-02-10 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002-2003: ADSL at a disruptive price===
Since September 2002, Free contributed significantly to French ADSL boom. The offer was able to launch as soon as the incumbent was forced to stop abuse of dominant position and to apply fair wholesale prices.&lt;ref name="wanadoo-sentence"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= Price abuses by Wanadoo Interactive | url= http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/map/cases/wanadoo_interactive_en.html | publisher = [[European Commission]] | date=16 July 2003 | accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004-2006: Unbundled ADSL and "triple play"===
{{See also|Local-loop unbundling}}

Unbundling, in France, refers to the obligation for the incumbent carrier [[France Telecom]] to lease the [[Local loop]], because it is a [[natural monopoly]]. Although the unbundling process was intended to start by 2000, the actual unbundling process actually started at the end of 2002, after a long conflict between the French regulation authority [[ARCEP]] and the non-cooperative incumbent.&lt;ref name="arcep-degroupage"&gt;{{cite web| title= Le dégroupage de la boucle locale | url= http://www.arcep.fr/index.php?id=8649 | date=17 September 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-30 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free has to pay a rental fee of €9 per month and per subscriber to the incumbent for the [[Twisted pair]] of [[Copper]] between the area [[Telephone exchange|central office]] and the [[Demarcation point|subscriber premises]].&lt;ref name="Conference_MS_201108"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= Barcelona - TMT Conference Results and Strategy Presentation | url= http://www.iliad.fr/en/finances/2008/Conference_MS_201108.pdf | publisher= [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] | format= PDF | date= 21 November 2008 | accessdate= 2009-01-04 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209102055/http://www.iliad.fr/en/finances/2008/Conference_MS_201108.pdf | archive-date= 9 December 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although more expensive than the real cost of €7.63,&lt;ref name="ARCEP_20_Janvier"&gt;{{cite web| title= Actualité / Les titres de la presse du mardi 20 janvier 2009  | url= http://www.arcep.fr/index.php?id=9912 | publisher = [[ARCEP]] | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; this solution is still far more profitable than the bundled option.

Since January 2003, a ''Freenaut'' has maintained an unofficial website showing figures and graphics about Free unbundled network deployment (Free Unbundling).&lt;ref&gt;[http://francois04.free.fr francois04.free.fr] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Freenaut'' website has provided network status monitoring maps Unbundling status and location&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frimousse.org frimousse.org] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the end of 2003. These initiatives are made possible thanks to the transparency of Free's network: their equipment replies to [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] and has a meaningful [[Reverse DNS lookup|reverse DNS]].

==Offers==

=== Voiceband ===

====Extent====
The [[Voiceband]] [[Dial-up internet access]] offer counts for a very small number of subscribers currently, as '''98%''' of French homes were eligible for [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= ARCEP letter 52  | url= http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/lettre52.pdf | publisher = [[ARCEP]] | format = PDF | accessdate=2008-02-10 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pricing====
Free began its activities with the famous free-of-charge Internet access, although data [[Telephone call|phone calls]] fees are not included. Another offer combines an Internet access with 50 hours of data [[Telephone call|phone calls]] for 14.94 [[euro]]s per month.

===Freebox offer===
Initially, '''Freebox''' was  the name of the [[Freebox|Freebox device]], which consists of the [[Set-top box]] and [[Modem]]. Because of the device's popularity and reputation, it eventually became the name of the offer.

* Price: 29.99 [[euro]]s
* Best [[broadband]] [[Telecommunication circuit|connectivity]] available for the subscriber home: [[FTTH]], unbundled or bundled
* "[[Triple play (telecommunications)|Triple play]]" (broadband bundled [[Telecommunication circuit|connection]]) or "quadruple play" (broadband unbundled or [[FTTH]] [[Telecommunication circuit|connection]]) services
* Free-of-charge migration to better [[Telecommunication circuit|connectivity]] when available to subscriber
* Possibility to update the [[Freebox]] device; the upgrade price decreases with time and is free of charge after three years of subscription
* A /60 [[IPv6]] prefix&lt;ref name="CP_IPv6_121207_eng"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= Free deploys IPv6 | url= http://www.iliad.fr/en/presse/2007/CP_IPv6_121207_eng.pdf | publisher= [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] | format= PDF | date= 12 December 2007 | accessdate= 2008-09-13 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081029173600/http://iliad.fr/en/presse/2007/CP_IPv6_121207_eng.pdf | archive-date= 29 October 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rfc5569"/&gt;

Gunderson | date=24 October 2008 | title=Global IPv6 Statistics | page=20 | url=http://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/ripe-57/presentations/Colitti-Global_IPv6_statistics_-_Measuring_the_current_state_of_IPv6_for_ordinary_users_.7gzD.pdf | accessdate=2008-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By end 2008, almost all French [[IPv6]] traffic measured in the study comes from Free customers.&lt;ref name="Measuring_the_current_state_of_IPv6"/&gt;

Free deployed the [[IPv6]] [[infrastructure]] in only 5 weeks, from 7 November to 11 December 2007, thanks to an innovative [[IPv6 rapid deployment|6rd (IPv6 rapid deployment)]] proposal by [[Rémi Després]].&lt;ref name=rfc5569&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=5569|title=IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd)|last=Després|first=Rémi|authorlink=Rémi Després|date=January 2010|publisher=Independent Submission,[[IETF]]|issn=2070-1721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Wifi community network

In May 2009 Free reconfigured the set-top boxes to act as Wifi hotspots by default. With over 3 million hotspots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Hotspots FreeWifi | url=http://www.free.fr/adsl/pages/internet/connexion/acces-hotspot-wifiFree.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is thought to be the largest Wifi hotspot network in the world during that time. They require authentication which makes them only accessible to Free's ADSL and now [[Free Mobile|mobile]] customers. Their main use is thus to let customers away from home continue accessing the Internet using the ADSL connection of other Free customer within Wifi range. For security reasons this access is isolated from the ADSL user's normal Wifi network, and is given lower priority.

In 2003, Free introduced unlimited phone calls at no additional price, while other [[switchboard operator|phone operators]] or [[ISP]]s charged per-minute fees for telephone calls.&lt;ref name="cp_freeboxtel_310703"/&gt; Competitors have then been forced to imitate these changes, but with fewer destinations included or at an additional price.&lt;ref name="businessweek-iliad-exploits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gigaom2009-03-06"/&gt; Bundled Free subscribers enjoy same free calls as those unbundled since March 2004.&lt;ref name="CP-FREEBOXTEL180304VA"/&gt; Calls to United States and Canada have been free of charge since December 2005.&lt;ref name="cp_151205_eng"/&gt;

In 2006, Free and [[France Telecom]] were in conflict against an unfair increase of [[Neuf Cegetel]] own [[Inter-Operator Tariff|termination tariff]], aimed at undermining unlimited phone offers in France. The French regulator [[ARCEP]] then decided to apply a threshold for call termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title= Freebox: final confirmation that calls to landline numbers in France are to be free! | url= http://www.iliad.fr/en/presse/2006/CP_010606_Eng.pdf | publisher= [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] | format= PDF | date= 1 June 2006 | accessdate= 2008-07-01 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081127113906/http://www.iliad.fr/en/presse/2006/CP_010606_Eng.pdf | archive-date= 27 November 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited free phone calls have been perennial in France since then.

====Telephone services====
A wide range of telephone services are provided at no additional cost, such as an online [[answering machine]], [[ringback tone]] customization, [[call transfer]], [[caller ID]], inbound and outbound call filtering, [[conference call]]s, and [[Wi-Fi]] [[Voice over Internet Protocol|voice]] [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]].&lt;ref name="free_telephone_services"&gt;{{cite web| title= Services de téléphonie | publisher= Free | url=http://www.free.fr/adsl/pages/telephone/services-de-telephonie.html | accessdate=2009-01-30 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2007, each customer has been assigned a fax number in addition to the traditional phone number.

===Freebox device===
The sole property of Free, the [[Freebox]] device is loaned to the customer for the duration of the ADSL contract. More than a simple ADSL modem, it is the primary conduit through which Free provides many of its services. It also replaces many devices that customers may otherwise have to purchase and thus provides added value of its own. Customers wishing to use newer models — such as the Freebox Revolution — must pay an extra fee.

The latest revision is actually composed of two parts:
* A 'Server' device which houses an ADSL / optical fiber modem, 4 port gigabit switch, [[802.11n|802.11n/b/g Wifi]] access point/hotspot, [[powerline networking]], router, 250GB [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] (extensible through USB and eSATA), wired and [[DECT]] wireless phone base, [[Upnp|UPnP]] media server and more.
* A 'Player' set-top box which acts as an [[Digital Video Broadcasting|HD DVB]] recorder (using the Freebox Server NAS), TV over internet player, [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] player, gaming console equipped with a gamepad and motion sensing remote, web browser.

===Other services===
* Unlimited [[E-mail address|Email addresses]] (1 [[Gigabyte|GB]] each), web [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] based on [[Zimbra|Zimbra Collaboration Suite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Univers Freebox teste Zimbra, le nouveau webmail des Freenautes | url= http://www.universfreebox.com/article5198.html | publisher = Universfreebox.com | date=20 April 2008 | accessdate=2009-05-16 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market share ===
{{See also|Internet in France}}

Since August 2008, the parent company [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] (including Free and Alice brands) is the second-largest [[Internet service provider|ISP]] in France. The leader is [[Orange (telecoms)|Orange]] (former [[Government monopoly|state monopoly]] company [[France Telecom]]), and the third is [[SFR]].

In 2007 (a major [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] year in the French [[broadband]] market), Free was the only [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]] brand to gain market share.&lt;ref name="ILIAD_RA_2007"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= 2007 Results: Slide Show | url= http://www.iliad.fr/en/finances/2008/ILIAD_RA_2007.pdf | publisher= [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] | format= PDF | date= 12 March 2008 | accessdate= 2008-03-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081125075956/http://www.iliad.fr/en/finances/2008/ILIAD_RA_2007.pdf | archive-date= 25 November 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free was the second-largest French [[Internet service provider|ISP]] until end June 2007, when competitor [[Neuf Cegetel]] [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquired]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Club Internet|fr}} ([[T-Online]] France).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title= Neuf Cegetel Mass Market broadband customers top the 3 million mark | url= http://www.groupeneufcegetel.fr/dyn/File/2007_EN/070702CP-Club-Internet_EN.pdf | publisher = [[Neuf Cegetel]] | format = PDF | date=2 July 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuf Cegetel]] used to grow essentially by purchasing its competitors, until it was itself absorbed by [[SFR]].  Until 2009, Free has always had a higher [[organic growth]] than [[Neuf Cegetel]] and [[SFR]].&lt;ref name="challenges-sfr-revanche"&gt;{{cite web | title= SFR tient sa revanche sur Internet | url= http://www.challenges.fr/high_tech/20090901.CHA6879/sfr_tient_sa_revanche_sur_internet_par_gaelle_macke_cha.html | date= 1 September 2009 | accessdate= 2009-09-04 | language= French }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] regained its second place after buying "Alice Telecom" from [[Telecom Italia]] in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref name="CP_260808_Eng"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= Iliad has completed the acquisition of Alice France from Telecom Italia | url= http://www.iliad.fr/en/finances/2008/CP_260808_Eng.pdf | publisher= [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] | format= PDF | date= 26 August 2008 | accessdate= 2008-11-30 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081125170155/http://www.iliad.fr/en/finances/2008/CP_260808_Eng.pdf | archive-date= 25 November 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the purchase of Alice France,&lt;ref name="CP_260808_Eng"/&gt; Free's subscribers growth was exclusively [[Organic growth|organic]], except for the strategic acquisition of the {{Interlanguage link multi|CitéFibre|fr}} [[FTTH]] [[Internet service provider|ISP]] in 2006 (about 500 subscribers).&lt;ref name="CP_201006_Eng"&gt;{{Cite press release | title=  Iliad announces the acquisition of CiteFibre | url= http://www.iliad.fr/presse/2006/CP_201006_Eng.pdf | publisher = [[Iliad (company)|Iliad]] | format = PDF | date=20 October 2006 | accessdate=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Free has [[Quality of service|QoS]] control on [[Unbundled Access|unbundled lines]] since these are [[Telecommunication circuit|connected]] to Free's own [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAMs]] instead of [[France Telecom]] [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAMs]].
* Bundled lines generate expensive [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] fees paid to the [[incumbent]] [[France Telecom]].&lt;ref name="Conference_MS_201108"/&gt;
* [[Television|TV]] [[multicast]] is not provided by [[France Telecom]] [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAMs]].

Because of bandwidth cost,&lt;ref name="Conference_MS_201108"/&gt; only a subset of the [[Television|TV]] services is offered to bundled subscribers; while [[Unbundled Access|unbundled]] subscribers can access value-added services such as [[Video on demand|VOD]] and Subscription [[Video on demand|VOD]]. These services' [[revenue]]s are constantly increasing.&lt;ref name="CP_120308_Eng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CP_291007_Eng"/&gt;

In 2007, Free had the greatest [[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization|EBITDA]] margin of the sector in Europe, was the only actor to gain market share in France and had a [[debt]] ratio 10 times lower than the industry average. Thanks to these assets, the initial [[FTTH]] deployment (targeted at 2012) will be entirely self-financed by existing activities.&lt;ref name="easybourse-interview-thomas-reynaud"/&gt;

Although investors are concerned about the investments in both the 3G mobile network and an FTTH network (1 billion euros each),&lt;ref name="yahoo-strategy"/&gt; the perspectives of Free and of the whole sector in Europe are promising according to analysts.&lt;ref name="yahoo-exane"&gt;{{cite web | title= European Telecoms Operators in Strong Position to Ride Out Recession | url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/European-Telecoms-Operators-bw-14591104.html | date= 10 March 2009 | accessdate= 2009-03-30 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disruptive===
Free is the last [[Startup company|independent]] operator in France. [[Google]], in the first years of its existence, was sometimes suggested as a comparison for the Free spirit. Unlike all other French broadband [[Internet service provider|ISPs]], nearly everything is designed within the company: Freebox devices, [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAMs]], [[network switch]]es and the backend billing system.&lt;ref name="gigaom2007-12-21"/&gt; The company has a medium- and long-term industrial strategy rather than the short-term financial strategy of its competitors.&lt;ref name="yahoo-strategy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iliad : des performances sans équivalents en Europe |url=http://fr.biz.yahoo.com/20032009/17/iliad-des-performances-sans-equivalents-en-europe.html |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-30 |language=French }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Resist, persist and ignore the obstacles, are probably the greatest qualities of the culture of Free, a culture that has enabled this operator and its leaders to move forward and keep this company alive and leader, against all odds.

===Openness===
The ISP, as well as its owner [[Xavier Niel]], promote [[Political freedom|free]] and [[Alternative media|independent]] media, such as:

===Corporate culture===

Corporate culture appears obvious from these remarkable facts:
* The call center is run almost entirely on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-based [[Personal computer|PC]]s.&lt;ref name="gigaom2007-12-21"/&gt;
* On startup, each Freebox HD device was displaying '''Rock'n'roll''' on his LCD screen.
* On advertising pictures, the time displayed by the Freebox device is '''13:37''' ([[leet]]).
* In February 2000, Xavier Niel offered 10 million [[French franc|francs]] to [[Google]] directors to buy their search engine activities in France (the offer was declined).&lt;ref name="google-proposition"&gt;{{cite web| title= Google et Free, de vieilles connaissances | url= http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2008/09/13/01006-20080913ARTFIG00089--google-et-free-de-vieilles-connaissances-.php | date=13 September 2008 | accessdate=2009-03-29 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name Free was chosen in 1999 two weeks before the launch of the service, and eventually became the company's name, the other candidate name being '''Online'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Curiosité de routage email free.fr | url= http://www.mail-archive.com/frnog@frnog.org/msg06027.html | publisher = Frnog.org | date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-18 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Freebox]] device name was inspired by the name of a pack of cigarettes.&lt;ref name="ARECEP_letter_65"&gt;{{cite web| title= ARCEP letter 65 | url= http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/lettre65.pdf | publisher = [[ARCEP]] | format = PDF |date = January 2009| accessdate=2009-04-29 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Clin d'oeil : Un paquet de Freebox à fumer | url= http://www.universfreebox.com/article7958.html | publisher = Universfreebox.com | date=29 April 2009 | accessdate=2009-04-29 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularity in France===
''Freenaut'' is the common designation for each [[internaut]] using the Internet through a Free connection. This community is estimated to reach between 10 and 12 million individuals as of March 2009.&lt;ref name="lexpress-chilipoker"&gt;{{cite web| title= Chilipoker parie sur l'ouverture du marché des jeux en ligne | url= http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/economie/chilipoker-parie-sur-l-ouverture-du-marche-des-jeux-en-ligne_746091.html | date=9 March 2009 | accessdate=2009-03-14 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Freenaut'' community includes a core group of technology enthusiasts who contribute to Free's influence and popularity in several ways:
* User [[personal web page|web sites]] hosted by Free for free.
* Live {{Interlanguage link multi|TV Perso|fr}} shows presenters.
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Télésite|fr}} developers (news, weather, games, video blogs, alternate TV interfaces...).
* Free [[wiki]] writers.
* Developers of {{Interlanguage link multi|Freeplayer|fr}} software.
* Contributors to Free [[Bug tracking system|bugtracker]].
* Network monitoring, unbundling curve graphs and FTTH deployment maps.

According to recurrent [[audience measurement]] reports conducted by [[Médiamétrie]], Free's general portal is the fourth most popular [[website]] in France.&lt;ref name="2009_01_13_CdP_AudienceInternet_Novembre_2008"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= L'audience de l'Internet en France en novembre 2008 | url= http://www.mediametrie.fr/fichier.php?fichier_id=714&amp;element_id=621&amp;module=resultats | publisher= [[Médiamétrie]] | format= PDF | date= 13 January 2009 | accessdate= 2009-01-13 | language= French }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009_01_13_CdP_AudienceInternet_Decembre_2008"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= L'audience de l'Internet en France en décembre 2008 | url= http://www.mediametrie.fr/fichier.php?fichier_id=723&amp;element_id=629&amp;module=resultats | publisher= [[Médiamétrie]] | format= PDF | date= 3 February 2009 | accessdate= 2009-02-14 | language= French }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009_04_06_CdP_AudienceInternetFevrier2009"&gt;{{Cite press release | title= L'audience de l'Internet en France en février 2009 | url= http://www.mediametrie.fr/fichier.php?fichier_id=743&amp;element_id=647&amp;module=resultats | publisher= [[Médiamétrie]] | format= PDF | date= 9 April 2009 | accessdate= 2009-04-29 | language= French }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During peak load hours, Free accounts for nearly half the traffic on the [[Amsterdam Internet Exchange]].&lt;ref name="gigaom2007-12-21"/&gt;

===Criticism===
On 3 January 2013 at 4pm in France, Free released a new firmware for its latest modem named "Revolution" which contained an [[Ad filtering|advertisement blocker]]. The firmware of the modems was updated when rebooting, and the Ad filtering was enabled by default. Within a few hours, Free gained media attention and was strongly criticized by website editors for penalizing them instead of Free's target Google. On 7 January at 8.30am, the Ad filtering was removed before Free ultimately decided, on 17 January at 6pm, to include the Ad filter and disable it by default. However, customers who restarted their modem between the 3rd and 7 January had enabled the option without even knowing it.

Since Free is one of the biggest ISP in France, worries started to raise of French hosting forums concerning the people's interest into Ad blockers in general.

'''Jaime Fonalledas''' (born 1946) is the President and CEO of Empresas Fonalledas Inc., which owns [[Plaza Las Américas]], the largest shopping mall in the Caribbean and one of the top retail and entertainment venues in the world.&lt;ref name="PRH1"&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n38/ProfileFonalledas-en.html Puerto Rico Herald 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Empresas Fonalledas Inc., also has holdings in dairy cattle operations, milk processing plants, non-dairy food industries, plastics manufacturing, real estate ventures, and banking operations. Employing more than 9,000 people in total, Empresas Fonalledas companies include [[Plaza del Caribe]], Tres Monjitas, Vaqueria Tres Monjitas, Ganaderia Tres Monjitas and franchise Soft &amp; Creamy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/archives/ArcDetail2.php?archID=8320&amp;NAME=Paseo%20Caribe Persons of the year (12/21/00)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Fonalledas was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] into one of the island's wealthiest families. There he received his early education at Catholic schools in [[Hato Rey]] and [[Rio Piedras]]. In 1966, he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from the [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico]] and earned a degree in Economics. Fonalledas pursued his law degree at the [[University of Puerto Rico]] and was admitted to the Puerto Rico Bar in 1971. He joined his family's business enterprises "Empresas Fonalledas", a business which has its origins in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="PRH1"/&gt;

==Beginning of the Fonalledas dynasty==

Fonalledas' grandfather Jaime Fonalledas Garriga had a farm called "Santa Elena", located in the town of [[Toa Baja]]. There he had a small store and sold milk and dairy products from his farm. On July 21, 1918, Fonalledas Garriga together with his two brothers Jerónimo and Gerardo and his sister Rosa bought 527 acres (2 square kilometers) of land in [[Hato Rey]], a section of San Juan, which was part of a farm called "Las Monjas" and where sugar cane was cultivated.&lt;ref name="TM"&gt;[http://www.tresmonjitas.com/orden_hist.html  Tres Monjitas] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The family began their milk and dairy producing operations and named their enterprise "Vaqueria Tres Monjitas". The quality of their product made them leaders in their agricultural field.&lt;ref name="TM"/&gt; What began as a small business has evolved into Empresas Fonalledas, one of Puerto Rico's largest business enterprises which include Plaza Del Caribe in Ponce, Puerto Rico; as well as Vaqueria Tres Monjitas which produces milk, dairy products, juice drinks; an ice cream companies, several real estate developments and Plaza Las Americas.&lt;ref name="PRH1"/&gt;

==Empresas Fonalledas Inc.==

===Plaza Las Americas===
[[File:Plaza Las Americas Entrance.JPG|200px|right|thumb|One of the multiple entrances to Plaza Las Americas]]
Fonalledas was still a child in the late 1950s when the family thought of the idea of developing a shopping center, modeled after [[Lenox Square]] in [[Atlanta]] and spurred on by the evolution of the concept in the [[United States]]. Construction began on the same sugar cane fields on which the Fonalledas family had established their dairy business and Plaza Las Americas was inaugurated in 1968, boasting the first [[JC Penney]] store outside the continental United States.&lt;ref name="PLA"&gt;[http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct0100/07.php Plaza Las Americas]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606031538/http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct0100/07.php |date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonalledas eventually rose to the presidency of the family business. Under his leadership Plaza Las Americas has become the largest shopping center in the Caribbean. The center has often been used as a testing ground for U.S. retailers looking to expand internationally.&lt;ref name="PLA"/&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2013}} [[Macy’s]] opened their first store outside the continental United States, [[Borders Group|Border’s Books &amp; Music]] opened its first bilingual store and a 13-screen movie theater was opened for a total of 21 movie screens.&lt;ref name="PRH1"/&gt; The sales figures place Plaza Las Americas among the top 1% of super-regional shopping centers in North America.&lt;ref name="PLA"/&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2013}}

===Vaqueria Tres Monjitas===

Under Fonalledas' leadership Vaqueria Tres Monjitas has become the largest milk and dairy industry in Puerto Rico. The company, with over 450 employees and annual sales of $110 million (U.S.), relocated its operations to an area in the town of [[Dorado, Puerto Rico|Dorado]], into a modern plant that boasts a modern quality control laboratory. The company, which also produces fruit juices and drinks, has three warehouse and distribution centers located in the cities of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], [[Arecibo]] and [[Mayagüez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriaalimenticia.com/CDA/Articles/Vitrina_Informativa/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000419392 Netamente puertorriqueña: Vaquería Tres Monjitas]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real Estate development===

Empresas Fonalledas invested millions of dollars in various real estate projects. The construction of an office tower, Torre Chardon, began in 1998 and was finished in 2001.&lt;ref name="PRH2"&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n49/CBFonalledas-en.html Puerto Rico Herald Empresas Fonalledas To Develop Residential Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Fonalledas also oversaw the development of two residential projects in San Juan and Ponce respectively as part of the real estate holdings of Empresas Fonalledas.&lt;ref name="PRH2"/&gt;

The San Juan project includes two residential buildings with 58 apartments located in Hato Rey and the Ponce residential project  features 132 walk-up units with direct access to Plaza Del Caribe.&lt;ref name="PRH2"/&gt;

==Businessman of the Year==
In 2000, Fonalledas was named "Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce Businessman of the Year". He has also been recognized as one of the Caribbean Business Top Business Leaders of Puerto Rico. In 2003, Fonalledas donated 500 thousand dollars to the scholarship funds of the University of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.pr/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=10533 11/7/2003 Medio millón al fondo de becas UPR] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonalledas, who has been honored by universities, professional associations, and the Roman Catholic Church is married to the former Zoraida Ferraiuoli-Martinez, the Republican National Committeewoman for Puerto Rico, who was a Superdelegate to the 2000 [[Republican National Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Mrs. Fonalledas received her Juris Doctor Degree from the InterAmerican University School of Law of Puerto Rico and her LLM in Labor Law from the New York University School of Law. She was reelected National Committeewoman for Puerto Rico at the State Convention held on November 23, 2003. She has held this position since 1995. The Fonalledas have four children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goppr.org/en/5/23.html The Republican Party of Puerto Rico]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurance Spelman Rockefeller''' (May 26, 1910 – July 11, 2004) was an American philanthropist, businessman, financier, and major [[conservation movement|conservationist]]. He was a prominent third-generation member of the [[Rockefeller family]], being the fourth child of [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.|John Davison Rockefeller Jr.]] and [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller|Abigail Greene "Abby" Aldrich]]. His siblings were [[Abby Rockefeller Mauzé|Abby]], [[John D. Rockefeller III|John III]], [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]], [[Winthrop Rockefeller|Winthrop]], and [[David Rockefeller|David]].

==Early life and marriage==
Rockefeller was born in New York City.  He graduated from [[Princeton University]] (1932) and attended [[Harvard Law School]] for two years, until he decided he did not want to be a lawyer.

On August 22, 1934, in Woodstock, Vermont, Laurance married childhood friend [[Mary French Rockefeller|Mary French]], whose mother, [[Mary Billings French|Mary Montague Billings French]], was a friend of Laurance's mother. When brother [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]] attended [[Dartmouth College]], he shared a room with Mary's brother. Mary was granddaughter of [[Frederick H. Billings]], a president of [[Northern Pacific Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = May 2010 |url= http://www.thevermontstandard.com/2010/05/mary-and-laurance-rockefellers%E2%80%99/ | title = Mary and Laurance Rockefellers' Billings Farm and the Farm &amp; Museum|publisher= Vermont Standard | accessdate = May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurance and Mary had three daughters and a son. They are [[Laura Rockefeller Chasin]], [[Marion Rockefeller Weber]], [[Lucy Rockefeller Waletzky|Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky]], and Larry Rockefeller. He had eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

==Business, philanthropy, interests==
In 1937, he inherited his grandfather's seat on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. He served as founding trustee of the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] for forty-two years, from its inception in 1940 to 1982; during this time he also served as president (1958–68) and later its chairman (1968–80) for twenty-two years, longer than any other leader in the Fund's history. He was also a founding trustee of the Rockefeller Family Fund from 1967 to 1977.

He was a leading figure in the pioneering field of [[venture capital]], which began as a joint partnership with all five brothers and their only sister, Babs, in 1946. In 1969 this became the successful [[Venrock Associates]], which provided important early funding for [[Intel]] and [[Apple Computer]], amongst many other start-up technology companies, including many other firms involved in healthcare. Over the years his investment interests ranged also into the fields of aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, thermionics, instrumentation and nuclear power.

Venrock was a limited partnership investment company financed by members of the Rockefeller family and a number of the institutions with which the family had longstanding philanthropic ties, among them the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]].

Rockefeller's major interest was in aviation; after the War, he became friendly with Captain [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], who had triumphed in many dogfights over Europe. Rockefeller had learned to fly, and found Rickenbacker's vivid accounts of an approaching boom in commercial air travel to be persuasive. Within a decade after Rockefeller's considerable investment, [[Eastern Airlines]] had become the most profitable airline to emerge after World War II. He became its largest shareholder. He also funded the pivotal post-WWII military contractor [[McDonnell Aircraft]] Corp.

Rockefeller was a longtime friend and associate of [[DeWitt Wallace]], who with his wife in 1922 co-founded ''[[Reader's Digest]]''. Wallace, who was a major funder of the family's [[Colonial Williamsburg]], appointed Laurance as an outside director in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robin | last = Winks | title = Laurance S. Rockefeller: Catalyst for Conservation |location= Washington, DC | publisher = Island Press | year = 1997 | page = 181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to ensure that it preserved its patriotic mission of informing and educating the public, along with support for national parks, one of Rockefeller's primary interests.

Through his resort management company, [[Rockresorts]], Inc., Rockefeller opened environmentally focused hotels at [[Caneel Bay]] on [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands]] (1956; a favorite resort today for celebrities), some property of which was later turned over to the Virgin Islands National Park; in [[Puerto Rico]], on Virgin Gorda in the [[British Virgin Islands]], and Hawaii, contributing to the movement now known as eco-tourism. The last of these, the [[Mauna Kea Beach Hotel]], was established in 1965 on the Kohala Coast of the island of Hawaii.  Its most noted general manager was Adi Kohler, who later wrote the story of the construction of the famous hotel in his book "Mr. Mauna Kea" published by McKenna Publishing Group.  While sailing past Virgin Gorda, Rockefeller spotted an idyllic half-mile crescent bay with what he dubbed "wilderness beach".  In 1958 planning and land acquisition began for what would become Little Dix Bay.  The resort opened in 1964 and on January 18, 2014 Little Dix Bay celebrated its 50th anniversary.  In 1993, the resort became part of [[Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts]] but remains true to Rockefeller's vision of natural harmony and balance while offering an escape from the ordinary.

Rockefeller funded the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at a critical juncture of its early development. He also funded [[William Irwin Thompson]]'s [[Lindisfarne Association]], a [[think tank]] and retreat. He had a major involvement in the [[New York Zoological Society]], along with support from other family members and philanthropies; he was a long-time trustee (1935–86), president (1968–71) and chairman (1971–85).

In 1983, Laurance Rockefeller donated the primary funds to create [[The Mirror Theater Ltd]], a New York-based theater company founded by Sabra Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Nemy, Enid. "BROADWAY." The New York Times. The New York Times, 7 Dec. 1984. Web. 10 Jan. 2017. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/07/arts/broadway.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Mirror Theater Ltd]] is known for producing the 1983 Broadway play ''Alice in Wonderland'' at the Virginia Theatre and for the many plays performed by its Mirror Repertory Company.

==Controversial science==
Rockefeller also funded&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/press-statement.html | title = PEAR | publisher = Princeton | contribution = Press statement}}.&lt;/ref&gt; controversial research of the [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab|PEAR]] lab, dealing with consciousness-based physical phenomena.

==UFO==
In later life, Rockefeller became interested in [[UFO]]s. In 1993, along with his niece, Anne Bartley, the stepdaughter of [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] and the then-president of the ''Rockefeller Family Fund'', he established the ''UFO Disclosure Initiative to the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] White House''.  They asked for all UFO information held by the government, including from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[US Air Force]], to be declassified and released to the public. The first and most important test case where declassification had to apply, according to Rockefeller, was the [[Roswell UFO incident]].  In September 1994, the Air Force categorically denied the incident was UFO-related. Rockefeller briefed Clinton on the results of his initiative in 1995. Clinton did produce an Executive Order in late 1994 to declassify numerous documents in the National Archives, but this did not specifically refer to UFO-related files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.x-ppac.org/OSTP.html UFO Disclosure Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also had an interest, gained via his mother [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]], in [[Buddhism]] and Asian cultural affairs. He funded the research of [[Harvard Medical School]] Professor Dr. [[John E. Mack]], author of ''Passport to the Cosmos''.  He also was reported to have supported the work of Dr. [[Steven M. Greer]] of the Disclosure Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disclosureproject.org/PressReleaseNov132007.htm The Disclosure Project]&lt;/ref&gt; However this has only been substantiated by Greer himself with no evidence other than his word.

==Conservation and death==
[[File:Laurance Rockefeller Ski Pass.jpg|thumb|Laurance Rockefeller's ski pass for the years 1969-1970 for Mount Tom and Suicide Six in Woodstock Vermont]]
He was noted for his involvement in [[Conservation movement|conservation]] ([[Lady Bird Johnson]] in 1967 labeled him "America's leading conservationist") and the protection of wildlife and was chairman of the ''Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission''. He was also a recipient of the Lady Bird Johnson Conservation Award. He served on dozens of federal, state and local commissions and advised every president since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on issues involving recreation, wilderness preservation and ecology. He founded the American Conservation Association and supported many other environmental groups.

He funded the expansion of [[Grand Teton National Park]] and was instrumental in establishing and enlarging [[national park]]s in Wyoming, California, the Virgin Islands, Vermont, Maine and Hawaii. In his home state, New York, he expended further cash and influence to help establish parklands and urban open spaces. There, as an active member of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, he helped create a chain of parks that blocked the advance of urban sprawl.

In September 1991, he was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] for contributions to conservation and historic preservation. Awarded by President [[George H. W. Bush]], it was the first time in the Medal's history (since 1777) that it had been awarded for outdoor issues, effectively naming Rockefeller as "Mr Conservation", who more than any other American had put this issue on the public agenda. Rockefeller said at the award presentation that nothing was more important to him than "the creation of a conservation ethic in America".&lt;ref&gt;Received first Congressional Gold Medal for conservation in 1991 – Robin Winks, op. cit., (pp.1–2)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Rockefeller and his wife Mary donated their [[Woodstock, Vermont]] summer home and farm to the [[National Park Service]], creating a national park dedicated to the history of conservation, now called the [[Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park]]. In 2001, Rockefeller transferred ownership of his landmark 1106-acre (4.5&amp;nbsp;km²) ''[[Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve|JY Ranch]]'' to the [[Grand Teton National Park]] in [[Wyoming]]. It was accepted by Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] on behalf of the Federal government (see External Links below).  Mary Rockefeller died in 1997, at the age of 86.

Following his wife Mary's death, Rockefeller returned to New York. He died in his sleep of natural cause by [[pulmonary fibrosis]] on July 11, 2004 at the age of 94. Laurance Rockefeller was survived by daughters Lucy, Marion, Laura, and one son Larry Rockefeller. He was interred next to his wife at the Rockefeller Family Cemetery in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]].

'''''Listen Money Matters''''' is an American personal finance website and weekly podcast created by Andrew Fiebert in December 2012. The podcast describes itself as "honest and uncensored" and emphasizes a relatable, informal tone.&lt;ref name=Q&gt;Banjo, Shelly. [http://qz.com/410627/this-rap-video-about-your-money-is-actually-pretty-cool/ "Rap music is full of bad financial advice—but not in this video."]  ''Quartz''.

Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Giovanisci served as co-host until 2015, when he was replaced by Thomas Frank. Since the podcast's debut, the brand has expanded to include a community forum, book club, and a 2014 book, ''Mastering Mint''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/ Listen Money Matters home page]. Listen Money Matters. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
''Listen Money Matters'' was founded in December 2012 by Andrew Fiebert. Fiebert had been displaced by [[Hurricane Sandy]] and was reconsidering his personal finances, and future co-host Matt Giovanisci, who at the time was heavily in debt, had turned to Fiebert for financial advice.&lt;ref name=Q/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN /&gt;  Giovanisci says that he and Fiebert sought to create a podcast that "wasn’t just two boring white dudes on the Internet spouting off about how they should be investing in Vanguard mutual funds... The idea was to be fun, joke, curse, drink, and just be real people who happen to be sneaking in some personal finance information".&lt;ref name=Q/&gt;  

''[[Business Insider]]'' named ''Listen Money Matters'' one of their "11 podcasts to listen to if you want to get rich", writing that "This lively show... will keep you alert and laughing. The hosts offer actionable personal finance advice, and deliver it in a very raw and honest tone."&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, Kathleen. "[http://www.businessinsider.com/podcasts-about-money-2015-6 11 podcasts to listen to if you want to get rich]." ''Business Insider''. June 23, 2015.&lt;/Ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' has described the podcast as a "hit" that "has millennials all over America listening".&lt;ref name=F1&gt;Talty, Alexandra. "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2015/01/13/how-to-invest-your-first-5000/#6993a7d75dfe How To Invest Your First $5,000]." ''Forbes''. January 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F2&gt;Talty, Alexandra.

February 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Instavest named Listen Money Matters as one of the "Six Best Personal Finance Podcasters on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.instavest.com/top-5-personal-finance-podcasters Six Best Personal Finance Podcasters on the Internet]". ''Instavest''. November 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Fiebert and Giovanisci released a book, ''Mastering Mint'', advising investors on how to manage their finances with the service [[Mint.com]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Thomas. "[http://collegeinfogeek.com/listen-money-matters/ Mastering Your Money With Matt And Andrew of Listen Money Matters]". ''College Info Geek''. May 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Listen Money Matters produced a rap video about personal finance titled "All My Money".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Lauren. "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/11630012/Forget-Jay-Z-and-Kanye...-this-rap-song-has-real-financial-advice.html  Forget Jay Z and Kanye... this rap song has real financial advice]". ''The Telegraph''. May 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quartz'' wrote of the video that "it’s rare to come across something [in financial discussions] as fun—and actually educational—as this rap video".&lt;ref name=Q/&gt;

==Founders==
Andrew Fiebert took a job as a data engineer at an investment bank following college. After [[Hurricane Sandy]] struck the Eastern United States in October 2012, he was forced to move back in with his parents. The experience caused him to reconsider his finances, and his wife suggested that he put his thoughts into a podcast. He describes himself as ''Listen Money Matters''' "Chief Nerd".&lt;ref name=CN&gt;"[https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/team/andrew-fiebert/ Andrew Fiebert: Chief Nerd]." Listen Money Matters. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Matt Giovanisci left the podcast in 2015 to concentrate on his Swim University brand, which produces a podcast and other material on pool and hot tub maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.swimuniversity.com/about/ Making Pool and Hot Tub Care Easy]". Swim University. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced on the podcast by Thomas Frank of College Info Geek.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/team/thomas-frank/ Thomas Frank: College and Habit Master]".

''U.S. News &amp; World Report''. February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the podcast's July 23, 2018 episode, Frank announced that he would be stepping down and that Giovanisci would return as co-host.

Keep Memory Alive (also known as KMA) was founded by [[Larry Ruvo]], senior managing partner of Southern Wines and Spirits, in memory of his father, Lou Ruvo, a victim of Alzheimer's Disease, together with his wife Camille, [[MGM Mirage|Mirage Resorts]] CEO [[Bobby Baldwin]] (who also lost his father to Alzheimer's Disease), and Bobby Baldwin's wife Donna.  KMA supports the mission of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and has held several star-studded galas, attended by celebrities and notables from around the world. It has become one of Las Vegas' most important [[Charitable organization|charity]] initiatives and a key participant in the nation fight against [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Since its inception, the event has raised more than $20 million towards achieving its goal – the realization of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health.  Funds committed by such supporters as the Spector Family Foundation, the Roland and Terri Sturm Foundation, Steinberg Diagnostics, the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] and [[America Online]] will be utilized for the construction and operation of this state-of-the-art facility.  The Center is planned to become a national resource for the most current research and scientific information for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Huntington's|Huntington 's Diseases]], Multiple Sclerosis and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)]] as well as focusing on prevention, early detection and education.

==Design==
The ceremonial groundbreaking of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health occurred on February 9, 2007. Dignitaries who attended the groundbreaking ceremonies for the $70 million project included founder Larry Ruvo, [[Frank Gehry]], [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry Reid]] and [[John Ensign]]; [[U.S. Representative]] [[Shelley Berkley]], [[Jon Porter]] and [[Dean Heller]], Gov.

Sadek attended [[St Columba's College, Dublin|St Columba's College]] in Dublin from 1975–1980, before reading Mental &amp; Moral Science for one year, then 4 years of Pure Psychology, at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], Dublin, from 1980-1985, from where he graduated with a BA in Moderatorship.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Career==
A career in [[market research]] began in 1985 at Lansdowne Market Research in Dublin, before he moved to London with his friend, Brian Pullman, remarking at the time that they were “like generations of other Irish emigrants, catching the boat to the mainland” to seek their fortune.  Sadek became a Director of Burns Research Partners, renamed Burns Sadek Research two years later, a boutique qualitative research firm.  After 7 years there, Mr Sadek founded Sadek Wynberg Research in Kensington in 1993, with Rebecca Wynberg.  SWR conducted research for the development of brands and communications for many of the world's blue-chip companies, including [[Unilever]], [[Bacardi]] Global Brands, [[Kimberly-Clark]], [[Vodafone]] and [[Sony Ericsson]]. The firm grew to be the largest of its kind in the UK by 2000 and the world by 2003, whereupon it was sold to [[WPP plc|WPP]], becoming Sadek Wynberg Millward Brown &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/investor/financialnews/default.htm?guid=%7Be081518c-46c0-4ffa-ba58-2a23098cc13c%7D|title=Millward Brown's integration with Sadek Wynberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadek became Global Leader of Millward Brown's Qualitative Network for the next three years bringing together many of the acquisitions made by the group into a coherent network offering common standards across a wide geography, before taking up the role of Worldwide Commercial &amp; Strategy Director at [[Research International]], a company operating in 52 countries. n this position, his responsibility was to make the organisation more efficient, and renew its intellectual capital base with innovation and renovation of existing and new services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1100&amp;Itemid=76|title=Sadek Joins Research International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking of ‘practising what I preach’ he then 'became a client' and created the Inish Turk Beg brand, based on the values of the eponymous island, [[Inish Turk Beg]], off the coast of Ireland which he had purchased in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpb.co.uk/blogs/2010/07/coley-porter-bell-creates-premium-fmcg-brand-for-inish-turk-beg/ |title=Coley Porter Bell creates premium fmcg brand for Inish Turk Beg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023858/http://www.cpb.co.uk/blogs/2010/07/coley-porter-bell-creates-premium-fmcg-brand-for-inish-turk-beg/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was a 63-acre sheep grazing piece of land when acquired, and 10 years later, Sadek had installed an all-weather access system on the island (and an associated mainland farm he bought to have a 'foul-weather base' and Connemara Pony Stud), a sewage system, roads, 5 homes, a Boatyard, fuel storage facilities, and numerous agricultural buildings. Fields were reconfigured with drainage and new planting. 10,000 trees were planted to reassert the traditionally wooded nature of the island.  In addition, the island was connected by under-ocean electricity and water supplies, but investments were made in extensive solar-panel power and the burying of all utilities.  The Inish Turk Beg brand spoke of ‘living life at a tilt’ and encompassed a luxury rental destination, a Connemara Pony Stud, a smoked fish line distributed throughout Ireland and the UK, Art Residencies and Exhibitions, a number-one listed music album ‘The Brilliant Irish Flute’, and ‘Maiden Voyage’ a single-malt Irish Whiskey, which has gone on to win industry awards.  In 2013, a further whiskey bottling was made 'Chief Islander's Choice' to celebrate Celtic Whiskey Shop's 10 Anniversary.  The brand also won a 'Mobius' for best new brand, selected from almost 5,000 entries from 36 countries, in 2010. 

The company that owned [[Inish Turk Beg]] went into receivership in 2012 and the island was put up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/dream-of-island-idyll-shattered-by-global-storm-26880841.html|title=Dream of island idyll shattered by global storm|publisher=www.independent.ie/|date=26 July 2012  |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr Sadek retains all the assets of the island, including the Intellectual Property Rights to the Inish Turk Beg brand. The whiskey business continues to be active.  In a statement to the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' on 11 February 2013, Mr Sadek said: "Having travelled the world, I am certain that Inish Turk Beg is one of the most beautiful places on earth. It inspires, intoxicates, enlivens. Those who come after me benefit from a decade of loving investment, building and imagining. They will not be able to repeat that, for the place is now transformed, but they can love it as I have done. I wish them well. The island and the sea have taught me many things, among which is that some journeys are orbital and you never know when you might end up back where you started again."

Sadek is Chairman of Tryangle, a training and facilitation social-enterprise, whose purpose is to improve the lives of its clients by enabling them to have better job prospects, life coping skills and opportunities for constructive socialisation through sport. 

His principal activity is as CEO at brand management consultancy, TransgressiveX, based in London, which specialises in developing business value through brands, particularly employing a contemporary iteration of Social Exchange Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mullingar/article/50161/sixth-annual-irish-entertainment-awards-to-be-held-in-tullamore|title=Sixth annual Irish Entertainment Awards to be held in Tullamore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayworld.com/columnists/daniel-odonnell.php?aid=10932 |title=Shaefri to be honoured at entertainment awards }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiralearth.co.uk/news/irwinstory.asp?nid=5331 |title=Island of dreams |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726013833/http://www.spiralearth.co.uk/news/irwinstory.asp?nid=5331 |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connosr.com/worldwhiskyreview/issue-6/wizards-of-whisky-winners-ireland/|title=Wizards of Whisky winners: Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancehogan.com/biography. |title=Lance Hogan Biography }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; TransgressiveX was appointed globally on Unilever's business in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/12/08/unilever-appoints-global-agency-help-it-move-conversion-funnel-measurement-staple&lt;/ref&gt; Further successes with clients such as KCF &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/03/02/rustlers-recruits-transgressivex-help-refocus-its-marketing-strategy&lt;/ref&gt; and the launch of an innovative quantitative research framework for brands &lt;ref&gt;https://www.research-live.com/article/news/transgressivex-launches-measurement-tool/id/5001372&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in TransgressiveX being nominated as one of 2016's top disruptive marketing brands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingweek.com/100-disruptive-brands/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Media==
Mr Sadek's increasing breadth of activity led to him featuring on the launch series of ''[[Secret Millionaire#Irish version|The Secret Millionaire]]'' in Ireland, screened by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] (October 2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gjZLmUExIY|title=The Secret Millionaire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Channel 4, followed up by a ‘Look-back’ episode screened by RTÉ (October 2012), 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/programmes/the_secret_millionaire.html|title=RTE Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oUCH9iVTRs|title=The Secret Millionaire-Look back by Nadim Sadek}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw him return to the groups he had benefacted, [[Cork Institute of Technology]]'s Cork Academy of Music (socially-inclusive music education),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corkam.com/index.html|title=Cork Academy of Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/secret-millionaire-invites-musical-teens-to-his-island-2894928.html|title= Secret Millionaire invites musical teens to his island}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cois Tine (welcome and pastoral care for refugees and asylum seekers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coistine.ie/home/280-nadim-sadek-the-secret-millionaire-visits-cois-tin|title=Nadim Sadek the Secret Millionaire visits Cois Tine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebel Wheelers (competitive sports for disabled children),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/4956/2011-40/Secret-Millionaire-helps-out-Cork-communities |title=Secret Millionaire helps out Cork communities |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512074502/http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/4956/2011-40/Secret-Millionaire-helps-out-Cork-communities |archivedate=2012-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cork Penny Dinners (nourishment without judgment).  Mr Sadek also featured on RTÉ's long-running Late Late Show (September, 2011).

He is also Executive Producer at Boss Bikes Club, a review channel focused on the world of motorcycling.

Further involvement in the music industry came as co-manager of Shaefri, his daughter who launched her debut EP ''Venture'' in December 2011 and went on to be awarded Best New Singer-Songwriter, 2012 by the Irish Entertainment Awards, and tipped as ‘number one new act to follow’ in Hot Press's ‘Hot for 2012’ listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/8609717.html|title=50 Irish acts you have to hear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2013 Mr Sadek presented a [[TED (conference)|TEDx Talk]] in Teddington, London, featuring his views on how interactions in life can be understood through an analysis of what he calls 'eXchange', powered by the notions of seduction and persuasion.

On [[RTÉ Radio 1]]'s ''The Business Programme'', during September 2014, presenter Richard Curran interviewed Mr Sadek about his career, stretching from Lansdowne Market Research in Dublin, and in London to Burns Research Partners, Sadek Wynberg Research, Millward Brown, Research International, WPP, Inish Turk Beg and TransgressiveX.  During the interview, it was clear that global banking strategy, including a turn away from Euro-denominated assets in "delinquent markets" such as Ireland, had caused the interruption of the Inish Turk Beg brand. Meanwhile, "necessity is the mother of invention" was proven by the creation and commercial success of TransgressiveX, which was now operating globally.

Mr Sadek also writes occasional features, such as on the topic of [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.research-live.com/article/opinion/the-push-and-pull-of-europe/id/5007952&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oakes Angier Ames''' (April 15, 1829 – September 19, 1899) was a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist in the [[Ames family]] of [[North Easton, Massachusetts]].

He was an heir to the Oliver Ames and Sons Corporation and Ames Shovel and Tool Company and was born into a family already known to be successful in business and philanthropic towards the townsfolk, many of whom were employed by the Ames'.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin 2004, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; He served as superintendent in 1873 and then President of the Company in 1877, overseeing all workings in the factory.&lt;ref&gt;Ames 1938, p.239-240&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited with managing to resolve the most notable worker strike in the town's history that lasted for almost two months in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneally 2013, pg.16-21&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Oakes Angier had helped manage a highly prosperous family business and commissioned buildings for the betterment of the town of Easton (including a schoolhouse in North Easton). He served as President of the North Easton Savings Bank and Vice-President of the Easton National Bank, was a Director of the Lincoln National Bank of Boston and the Kingsley Iron Machine Company, trustee of the State Lunatic Asylum in Taunton, MA ([[Taunton State Hospital]]), Director of the American Loan and Trust Company and of the United Electric Securities Company, and co-owned a sugar plantation in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NEHGS obituary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin 1886, pg.596,606,687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson 2004, pg.97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Oakes Angier Ames was the oldest son of Massachusetts Congressman [[Oakes Ames]] (1804-1873) (a major force behind the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]) and brother of [[Oliver Ames (governor)]] (1831-1895), 35th Governor of Massachusetts from 1887-1890, Frank Morton Ames, Henry Gilmore Ames and Susan Eveline (Ames) French.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin 2004, pg.266-267&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Evelina Orville Gilmore, was the daughter of Joshua and Hannah (Lothrop) Gilmore of Easton, MA. The Ames family lineage from which he was descended can be traced back to William Ames who emigrated with his brother John to New England in 1635 and settled in Bridgewater, MA.&lt;ref&gt;Ames 1938, pg.14-21&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandfather [[Capt. John Ames]] and grandfather [[Oliver Ames Sr.]] founded the [[Ames Shovel Shop|Ames Shovel Works]] during a time when shovels were needed to build canals and railroads. The [[Ames family]] was among the wealthiest in Massachusetts.

== Early life ==
Oakes Angier attended public school in Easton, MA. He then attended Fruit Hill Academy in RI and the [[Leicester Academy]], MA. and entered the family business at the age of eighteen. He learned how shovels were made and became skilled in handling the affairs of the workers.&lt;ref&gt;NEHGS obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oliver Ames and Sons Company of Oakes Angiers’ grandfather Oliver Ames Sr. (known as Old Oliver) was originally located across from Shovelshop Pond in Easton, MA. On March 2, 1852, Oakes Angier witnessed the great fire that destroyed all buildings and subsequently became ill due to smoke inhalation while trying in vain to stop the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Ames 1938,pg.237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meninno F.&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed at the time that he had contracted Consumption and was sent to Cuba to help his lungs heal. On December 28, 1852, Evelina Ames received word from her son that he had arrived in Cuba after departing from Charleston, S.C. six days prior. When he returned he was in much better health.&lt;ref&gt;Ames 2014, Evelina diary&lt;/ref&gt;

The watchman at the time of the fire was a man by the name of Patric Quinn. Quinn, during his nightly round, accidentally dropped a lantern into highly flammable varnish. The finishing shop burst into flames and quickly caught fire to the rest of the buildings. At the time, the Ames family was considering moving the shovel making operation to another location entirely and so there was a silver lining to this devastating event.&lt;ref&gt;Ames W.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ames 2014, Evelina diary&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the fire made such a lasting impression on Oakes Angier that he was the first family member to build his home, Queset House, out of stone. The new shovel factory was also built out of stone, as were many future Ames structures.

It was often customary at the time for previous generations to live with their sons and daughters. Oakes Angier lived into his mid-twenties with his father Oakes and his mother Evelina in the house originally built by his grandfather Old Oliver. Old Oliver continued to live in a section of the house with his son and daughter-in-law until his own death. Their house was located on Main Street across from the company shops and is no longer standing. When the [[Queset House]] was finished, Oakes brought his new bride, Catherine (Hobart) Ames to live there and raise a family.&lt;ref&gt;Meninno F.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
In 1863, Oakes’ Angiers grandfather, [[Oliver Ames Sr.]] (1779-1863), passed away leaving the Oliver Ames and Sons Company and all private property to the remaining Ames family members of Easton, MA. To his three grandsons, Oakes Angier, Oliver and [[Frederick Lothrop Ames]], he bequeathed one-third of the Company interest divided equally, thus making them partners. His other grandson, Frank Morton Ames, became prosperous in his own right as President of the Kingsley Iron and Machine Company of Canton, MA.&lt;ref&gt;Ames 1938, pg.238&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the Civil War, the three grandsons of Oliver Ames worked together to maintain and expand the already thriving family business. Oliver became involved in business ventures relating to the Company outside of Easton, MA. Frederick was treasurer and secretary. Oakes Angier was supervisor, general manager, and then President from 1877 until his death. By that time the Company was producing approximately 117,500 dozen shovels per year, with 500 men working 10hr work days.&lt;ref&gt;Ames 1938,
 pg.239-240&lt;/ref&gt;

While supervisor, he obtained an antrim patent in 1863 for his welding furnace designed to balance the temperatures needed to weld a shovel blade and the strap.&lt;ref&gt;O.A.patent&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, he and his brother Frank Morton Ames purchased what would become the Southside and Estelle Plantations in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana]] for $180,000.The plantations were known at the time to be quite cutting edge in the methods of harvesting sugar and transporting the finished product. 60,000 to 70,000 pounds of sugar were produced a day. His time spent in Cuba as a young man may have influenced his interest in owning a sugar plantation.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson 2004, pg.97&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, while President of the Company, he helped finance 50% of the cost for a church in the center of Easton. The cost was $1,400. Originally a Methodist church, the new denomination was affiliated with the Swedish [[Evangelical Covenant Church]]. Prior to the purchase of the new church, the growing number of Swedish immigrants who worked in the Company had to practice their religion in various private homes. Oakes Angier also lent the use of a hall on Main Street to the Swedish for services.&lt;ref&gt;McEntee, pg.8&lt;/ref&gt; Assistance in providing a place of worship was consistent with the Ames family tradition. They also had a chapel built on Pond St. for the Irish workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Meninno F.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strike of 1889===
William Chaffin wrote in History of the Town of Easton that Oakes Angier had a temperament well suited for work as manager to the Company workers, and that he was also very knowledgeable to the process of making shovels. His character would serve him well in regards to the strike. His life was an example of integrity and compassion towards workers and other townspeople who sometimes required assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin 1886, pg.596&lt;/ref&gt; Although there had been a few documented instances of dissension among workers before the strike of 1889, none were as well documented, nor did they result in so many workers being let go or disruption in shovel production.

In shovel making, it is the handlers job to weld straps to steel-edged shovels. Handlers employed by the Oliver Ames and Sons Company at the time of the strike became disgruntled over a Company policy that had been put in place years prior.

On February 22, 1889, twenty-three handlers walked off the job, returning the following day after forming a committee to speak with General Manager Oakes Angier Ames regarding the rules. He responded that the rules put in place were necessary and explained why that was. Despite that some of the Ames’ had been handlers themselves and the Company was known for good wages and fair business practices, the handlers did not return to work. Oakes Angier, after giving the strikers until March 4 to return, was forced to hire replacements. His son Hobart and Governor Oliver Ames' son William were in charge of training the Swedish replacement workers. Hobart was also in charge of protecting replacement workers from harassment by strikers. While Oakes Angier did request in writing that strikers leave tenement housing, he never evicted them. The only arrest was a James Riley for undue violence. On April 12, 1889, the strike ended and some sixteen strikers returned to work under the same rules. Only five strikers were not allowed to return to work as handlers. Two of them had already found work elsewhere and the other three were employed as gardeners on Ames estates. Shovel sales suffered but still managed to surpass previous years sales by $950.27.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneally 2013, pg.16-21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Queset House==
Oakes Angier Ames' legacy to North Easton can still be seen in [[Queset House]], his home beside the Queset Brook. Built of stone, Queset stands on property to the rear of the Ames Free Library. His son, famous theatrical producer [[Winthrop Ames]], also lived in the house with his wife Lucy after inheriting it from his father. The property is now owned by the library and functions as a center for cultural programming.&lt;ref&gt;Ames 1938, pg.245&lt;/ref&gt; Queset was commissioned to be built in 1853 and it was completed the following year. The house's front portion design was drawn from a plan by noted architect [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (who died in 1852). Downing collaborated with [[Alexander Jackson Davis]] who provided architectural drawings. It was built in the [[Gothic Revival]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Hands, E.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard]] educated architect [[John Ames Mitchell]], (a first cousin of Oakes Angier and architect of Unity church in Easton, MA) designed the rear in 1873. He also added the copper-clad chimneys and a new staircase. The [[landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] planned its grounds and also, in consultation with Ames, created [[The Rockery]] nearby.

Together with his family, Ames commissioned Olmsted and architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H. H. Richardson]] to create a remarkable set of buildings and landscapes in North Easton, including:

* [[Ames Gate Lodge]]
* [[Oakes Ames Memorial Hall]]
* [[Old Colony Railroad Station (North Easton, Massachusetts)|Old Colony Railroad Station]]
* [[The Rockery]]
* [[F.L. Ames Gardener's Cottage]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12761">A '''partnership''' in the [[People's Republic of China]] is a [[business entity]] governed by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law] passed by order of the President of the People's Republic of China to authorize and govern [[Partnership|partnership enterprises]].  A partnership is a type of business entity in which partners share with each other the profits or losses of the business undertaking in which all have invested.

==History==

From 1368 to 1911, partnerships with distributive shares were the principal form of a business entity that [[investor]]s ran [[coal mine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Liufang; Xia Yuantao; Sang Binxue; Danian Zhang, Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 52, No. 3, The Emerging Framework of Chinese Civil Law: [Part 2]. (Summer, 1989), pp. 43-67, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, most enterprises were partnerships in the form of [[general partnership]]s levying [[unlimited liability]] on the partners.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Liufang; Xia Yuantao; Sang Binxue; Danian Zhang Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 52, No. 3, The Emerging Framework of Chinese Civil Law: [Part 2]. (Summer, 1989), pp. 43-67, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933, 41% of [[factories]] were run by partnerships and 20% were [[sole proprietorship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Liufang; Xia Yuantao; Sang Binxue; Danian Zhang Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 52, No. 3, The Emerging Framework of Chinese Civil Law: [Part 2]. (Summer, 1989), pp. 43-67, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the end of the 1950s [[Great Leap Forward|centralization of the economy]] caused the partnership form to vanish for nearly 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Liufang; Xia Yuantao; Sang Binxue; Danian Zhang
Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 52, No. 3, The Emerging Framework of Chinese Civil Law: [Part 2]. (Summer, 1989), pp. 43-67, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s partnerships returned with different names to avoid the sensitive label of [[private ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Fang Liufang; Xia Yuantao; Sang Binxue; Danian Zhang, Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 52, No. 3, The Emerging Framework of Chinese Civil Law: [Part 2]. (Summer, 1989), pp. 43-67, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2007, the Partnership Enterprise Law came into force and established partnerships as a legal business entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership enterprise==
The term partnership enterprise refers to general partnerships and [[limited partnership]]s which may be established within China by [[natural person]]s, [[legal person]]s and other organizations.&lt;ref name="fdi.gov.cn"&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter 1, article2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A state-funded company, [[state-owned company]], [[listed company]], public welfare-oriented public institution or [[social organization]] may not become a [[general partner]] of a limited partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter 1, article 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General partnership===
A [[General Partnership|general partnership]] (普通合伙) may be formed by general partners who bear unlimited [[joint and several liability]] for the [[debts]] of the partnership.&lt;ref name="fdi.gov.cn"/&gt; the general partners share unlimited liabilities for the debt of the partnership.

===Limited partnership===
A [[limited partnership]] (有限合伙) is formed by a combination of ''general partners'' and ''limited partners'' where the ''limited partners'' bear the liabilities for the partnership's debts to the extent of their [[capital contribution]]s.&lt;ref name="fdi.gov.cn"/&gt;

===Special general partnership===
A special general partnership (特殊普通合伙) resembles a general partnership except that it must be a professional service institution offering services requiring professional knowledge and special skills. The structure shields co-partners from liabilities due to the willful misconduct or gross negligence of one partner or a group of partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter II, section 6, article 55] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as the preferred form of organization for law and accounting firms.

==Establishment==
A partnership requires a written agreement between the partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter 1, article 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This written agreement must be submitted to the business registration government body along with the identity of the partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter 1, article 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A partnership must abide by the following requirements:
*Have 2 or more partners
*Have a written partnership agreement;
*Have capital contributions subscribed to or actually paid by the partners; 
*Have a name and a place of business for the partnership enterprise; and
*Abide by any other conditions as provided for the law;

Should it be a general partnership or limited partnership then that shall be in its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter II, section 1, article 14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited partnership may not have less than 2 partners where one of them is a general partner nor may it have more than fifty partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter III, article 61] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liabilities==
A partnership must pay all its debts with property contributed to the partnership by the partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter II, section 4, article 38] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

If the partnership is a general partnership then the partners bear joint and several liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter II, section 4, article 39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited partner may not conclude partnership operations nor may such a partner represent the partnership to [[3rd parties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter III, article 68] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital contributions==
A partner may contribute capital to the partnership to garner a share of the partnership's profits or losses.  A capital contribution may include [[money]], [[intellectual property]] right, [[land use]] right or other properties, or [[Labour (economics)|labor]] services at a valuation determined by agreement among the partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter II, section 1, article 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the partnership is a limited partnership, then the limited partners may not make capital contributions with labor services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law, Chapter III, article 64] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributions==
The default distribution scheme of profits or losses follows the proportion to capital contributions made by the partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter II, section 3, article 33] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the distribution scheme may follow an informal negotiated agreement or abide by scheme adopted in the partnership agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter II, section 3, article 33] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the proportions of capital contributions cannot be discerned, then the profits or losses will be distributed equally by the partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter II, section 3, article 33] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership agreement may not distribute all losses or all profits to just one or a group of partners within the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter II, section 3, article 33] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
The partners shall pay tax on their respective share of the partnership income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf Partnership Enterprise Law,Chapter 1, article 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910000549/http://www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/GeneralLawsandRegulations/BasicLaws/P020061018643910006967.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7262">'''Plaça de Catalunya''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈplasə ðə kətəˈluɲə|pron}}, meaning in [[English language|English]] "Catalonia Square"; sometimes referred to as '''Plaza de Cataluña''', its Spanish name) is a large square in central [[Barcelona]] that is generally considered to be both its [[city centre]] and the place where the old city (see [[Barri Gòtic]] and [[Raval]], in [[Ciutat Vella]]) and the 19th century-built [[Eixample]] meet.

Some of the city's most important streets and avenues meet at Plaça Catalunya: [[Passeig de Gràcia]], [[Rambla de Catalunya]], [[Las Ramblas|La Rambla]] or [[Portal de l'Àngel]], in addition to [[Ronda de Sant Pere]], [[Carrer de Vergara]] or [[Carrer de Pelai]]. The plaza occupies an area of about 50,000 square metres. It is especially known for its fountains and statues, its proximity to some of Barcelona's most popular attractions, and the flocks of [[pigeon]]s that gather in the centre. [[File:Catalunya Barcelona1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|450px|Plaça de Catalunya]]

==History==
After the medieval city walls were demolished in the 19th century, ambitious designs for the city's public spaces were conceived under the guidance of notable [[urban planning|urban planners]]. Plaça Catalunya was conceived as part of ''pla Rovira'' in 1859, but no official permission from the government was given until the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona (1888)|1888 Universal Exposition]]. It was [[urbanisation|urbanised]] for the first time in 1902 and was further modified in 1929, on the occasion of the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]], which also included the construction of a [[rapid transit|metro]] station. Architect [[Francisco Nebot]] designed the changes made in 1929.

In May 2011 Plaça Catalunya was the main location where [[2011 Spanish protests|anti-government protests]] and [[sit ins]] were held in Barcelona, mirroring the events in other Spanish cities.

==Art==

===Sculpture===
Plaça Catalunya hosts quite a few interesting sculptures representative of [[Noucentisme]], [[Neo-Classicism]] and different [[avant-garde]] movements.
*''Deessa'', by [[Josep Clarà]].
*''Pastor de Pau'', by [[Pablo Gargallo]].
*[[:Image:Standbeeld Plaça de Catalunya.JPG|Francesc Macià monument]]. It reads: "Catalunya a [[Francesc Macià]]".
*[[Josep Llimona]]'s sculptures.

===Decorative arts===
The [[mosaic]]s that decorate the walls of the underground part of Plaça Catalunya were designed by pupils of [[Escola Massana]].

==Culture==

===Theatre===
A few theatres have been established in Plaça Catalunya since its construction, none of which are extant.
*Teatre del Bon Retir (1876-1885)
*Circ Eqüestre Alegria (1879-1895)
*Eldorado Concert (1887-1929)
*Teatre Barcelona (1923-198-)
There still are, however, other theatres in the nearby area, located in other streets or squares.

===Cafés and restaurants===
[[File:14-08-06-barcelona-RalfR-304.jpg|thumb|The square in August 2014]]
Similarly, most of the cafés and restaurants where writers and artists would meet in the city haven't survived, with the notable exception of Café Zurich, where [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium|Fabiola of Belgium]]'s brother worked as a pianist. The following ones disappeared with the [[Spanish Civil War]]:

A '''postvention''' is an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] conducted after a [[suicide]], largely taking the form of support for the bereaved (family, friends, professionals and peers). Family and friends of the suicide victim may be at increased risk of suicide themselves. Postvention is a term that was first coined by Shneidman (1972), which he used to describe "appropriate and helpful acts that come after a dire event." In Schneidman's view,  "the largest public health problem is neither the prevention of suicide nor the management of suicide attempts, but the alleviation of the effects of stress in the survivors whose lives are forever altered."&lt;ref&gt;Shneidman E. ''Deaths of man'' New York: Quadrangle Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Postvention is a process that has the objective of alleviating the effects of this stress and helping survivors to cope with the loss they have just experienced. 
 
The aim is to support and debrief those affected; and reduce the possibility of [[copycat suicide]]. Interventions recognize that those bereaved by suicide may be vulnerable to suicidal behaviour themselves and may develop complicated [[grief]] reactions.
 
Postvention includes procedures to alleviate the distress of suicidally bereaved individuals, reduce the risk of imitative suicidal behavior, and promote the healthy recovery of the affected community. Postvention can also take many forms depending on the situation in which the suicide takes place. Schools and colleges may include postvention strategies in overall crisis plans. These strategies are designed to prevent suicide clusters and to help students cope with the emotions of loss that follow the suicide of a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Poland S. ''Suicide intervention in the schools'' New York: Guilford, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual and group [[counseling]] may be offered for survivors (people affected by the suicide of an individual).

==Organizations==
The Suicide Aftercare Association [http://www.suicideaftercare.org], a 501(c)(3) public charity, was formed to reduce the possibility of suicide contagion and secondary suicides by performing biohazardous cleaning of suicide attempt and completion scenes so families are relieved of this burden.

==Programs==

===Responding to Loss (RTL)===

Responding to Loss (RTL) is one of the crisis response programs that has been used to deal with postvention at high schools. This program is part of the Community Action for Youth Survival (CAYS), which is a three-year adolescent suicide prevention project serving three counties in the Chicago area. The objective of RTL is to provide strategies that will help high school crisis teams develop a structured response to the suicide of any student or member of the staff.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood M &amp; Dunne-Maxim K. ''Managing sudden violent loss in the schools'' New Jersey State Department of Education and State Department of Human Services; and University of Medicine and Dentistry at New Jersey, Community Mental Health Center at Piscataway, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three components to this program. The first is Preparing for Crisis Training, the second is Peer Witness Intervention, and the third is Crisis Consultation. This program proved to be quite successful during its trial and the participants of the program were generally satisfied with the training that they received. As a result of this program, several schools have developed or revised their crisis team in response to a suicide. They have done this by following the Preparing for Crisis training aspect of the program and also through consulting with the CAYS program.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, J., Hirsch, J., Goldenberg, D., Libby, S., Fendrich, M., Mackesy-Amiti, M., ... Chance, G. (1995). 'Strategies for school-based response to loss: Proactive training and postvention consultation. ''Crisis'', 16(1), 18-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===LOSS===

The LOSS Program includes a first-response team with the objectives of delivering immediate services to the survivors of a suicide at the time of the death. This team is made up of para-professional survivor volunteers and staff members of the Baton Rouge Crisis Intervention Center, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The LOSS Program is different from other postvention programs in several ways. First, the LOSS team physically goes to the scenes of the suicides to begin helping the survivors to cope with their loss as close to the event of death as possible. Members of this team can provide access to the needed resources and can begin the grieving process at the scene of the death. Second, since the LOSS team includes survivor volunteers at the scene, an immediate and meaningful bond is established between the newly bereaved individuals and the para-professional surveyor team members. This bond allows for the start of a conversation about the grief and the potential for hope of a suicide between the bereaved and the crisis team members. Third, the LOSS team has a strong relationship with other first responders, such as law enforcement, emergency services, fire departments, funeral home representatives, and more. This relationship allows the newly bereaved to have a larger variety of choices in regards to coping with a suicide compared to other survivors who might not have access to this program. This model of postvention provides referrals for additional support to all survivors and individuals at the scene of the suicide &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, F. R., Cataldie, L., McIntosh, J., &amp; Millet, K. (2004). An active postvention program. ''Crisis'', 25(1), 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the LOSS Program has changed the scene of the suicide to a more "concerned and caring environment" for all individuals and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell FR. Suicide: An American form of abuse. ''New Global Development (XVI)'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[pulp and paper industry]] in Europe''' accounts for about a quarter of world production and is a major employer. The leading producing countries are [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]]. The industry is a large user of [[renewable energy]] and achieved a [[recycling rate]] of 71.5% in 2015.&lt;ref name="Key Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Statistics 2015|url=http://www.cepi.org/topics/statistics/keystatistics2015|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production data== 
The European [[paper industry]] produces more than 90 million tonnes of paper and board and more than 36 million tonnes of pulp annually. Directly it provides 178,000 jobs and indirectly 3 million jobs along the forest and paper chain.&lt;ref name=cepi&gt;[http://www.cepi-sustainability.eu CEPI Sustainability Report] CEPI Sustainability Report 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The European paper industry's [[revenue|turnover]] is approximately 180 billion euros.&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulp and paper industry|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/industries/forest-based/pulp-paper/index_en.htm|website=Growth|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 633 companies are represented by the [[Confederation of European Paper Industries]] (CEPI)&lt;ref name="cepi.org"&gt;http://www.cepi.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and these account for 23% of world production.
The raw material consists of 40% recycled fibre and 44% virgin pulp, the balance being other pulp (1%) and non-fibrous materials (15%). 94% of the wood requirements come from managed forests within Europe.

In national terms the largest ''paper'' producer is Germany, followed by Finland, Sweden and France; the largest ''pulp'' producers are Finland and Sweden. The two largest European companies in the sector, [[Stora Enso]] and [[UPM (company)|UPM]], are both based in Finland.

==Renewable energy==
The European pulp and paper industry is the largest industrial producer and consumer of energy from [[renewable source]]s. Its share of [[biomass]]-based energy exceeds 55% of its total primary annual [[energy consumption]] of 1,301,483  TJ.&lt;ref name=cepi /&gt; The sector has adopted an objective to reduce carbon emissions of 80% by 2050, which is likely to involve new technological methods to reduce water usage and thus reduce energy usage.&lt;ref name=ec /&gt;

==Recycling==
Paper for recycling is a major source of the paper industry’s raw material, which is why the industry aims to maximise the European recycling rate. The recycling rate along the paper value chain (ERPC) reached 71.5% in 2015 - exceeding the voluntary target of 70% that was set by the industries declaration in 2011. The total amount of paper collected and sent to recycling in paper mills in 2015 was almost 56 million tonnes. 18.2% was exported for recycling in third countries in 2015.&lt;ref name="Key Statistics"/&gt; The recycling rate is now considered close to its maximum possible.

==Innovation==

The European paper industry is a highly innovative sector. Its strategic vision of reconciling sustainability and competitiveness, the inherent properties of its raw materials, and the transformation the sector is going through, are already delivering new products, new technologies, new bio-values, and business opportunities. 
In 2011, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI)&lt;ref name="cepi.org"/&gt; launched the “2050 Roadmap to a low-carbon bioeconomy”,&lt;ref name=roadmap&gt;{{cite web|title=2050 Roadmap to a low-carbon economy|url=http://www.cepi.org/node/300|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the very first European manufacturing industry sector to react to the European Commission’s roadmap towards a low-carbon economy with its own sector roadmap. The “Two Team Project”, which ran in 2013, sought to find the most innovative breakthrough technologies of the industry with two teams competing against each other. Eight breakthrough technologies made it to the publication.&lt;ref name="Two Team Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Team Project report|url=http://www.cepi.org/system/files/public/documents/publications/innovation/2013/finaltwoteamprojectreport_website_updated.pdf|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2015, CEPI collected more than 40 of the industry’s most innovative products in another publication, “The Age of Fibre”,&lt;ref name="Age of Fibre"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Fibre|url=http://www.cepi.org/system/files/public/documents/publications/innovation/2015/Finalwebversion.pdf|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  showcasing once again the versatility and innovation in the industry.

== Leading companies ==
In 2011 the top 10 forest and paper products companies in Europe were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/forest-paper-packaging/assets/pwc-global-annual-forest-paper-packaging-industry-survey-2012.pdf ''Global Forest &amp; Paper Industry Survey''], PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Blair was raised in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=GB/&gt; He dropped out of high school in the 9th grade, left home, and became a gang{{specify|date=May 2015}} member in his home-town of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/keen-on-why-gang-members-make-wicked-entrepreneurs-tctv|title=Keen On… Why Gang Members Make Wicked Entrepreneurs|author=Andrew Keen|date=August 15, 2011|publisher=Techcrunch|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 18, Blair's mother began dating a successful real-estate entrepreneur who became Blair’s mentor and gave him his first job at Logix Development, a computer technical support provider.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-blair-is-a-former-gang-member-turned-multimillionaire-entrepreneur-2012-8|title=How This Guy Went From Gang Member To Multimillionaire Entrepreneur|author=Vivian Giang|date=August 14, 2012|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2012/0205/The-job-shifters-people-who-reinvent-themselves-mid-career|title=The job-shifters: people who reinvent themselves mid-career|author=Laurent Belsie|date=February 5, 2012|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 21, after serving as vice president of Logix Development he founded the technical-support firm 24/7 Tech.&lt;ref name="BI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt;

'''Secondary liability''', or indirect infringement, arises when a party materially contributes to, facilitates, induces, or is otherwise responsible for directly infringing acts carried out by another party. The US has statutorily codified secondary liability rules for [[trademarks]] and [[patents]], but for matters relating to [[copyright]], this has solely been a product of case law developments. In other words, courts, rather than Congress, have been the primary developers of theories and policies concerning secondary liability.

==Early case law==
Secondary liability in copyright has come about with case-by-case decisions. In other words, there has not been any real or consolidated theory. Furthermore, patent and copyright cases have tended to cross-cite each other. Examples of this are cases such as ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''&lt;ref name=kalem&gt;''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/222/222.US.55.26.html 222 U.S. 55] (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; (the producer of the movie [[Ben Hur (1907 film)]] didn't himself infringe, but was responsible for making and commercially distributing the infringing film), ''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.''&lt;ref name=shapiro&gt;''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/316/316.F2d.304.294.27979.html 316 F.2d 304] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; (a booth in a department store that sold infringing sound recordings and the store was ultimately held liable), and the so-called "dance hall" cases (the operator of an entertainment establishment was held liable because he had effective control of the premises ''and'' obtained a direct financial benefit derived from charging entrance fees to the public).&lt;ref name=dreamland&gt;''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/36f2354.html 36 F. 2d 354] (7th Cir. 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copyright Act of 1790]] did not provide a formal definition of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies.

Despite the fact that the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] did not explicitly establish liability for acts committed by a party different than the direct infringer, several cases decided under this Act set forth the guidelines under which a party may be deemed secondarily liable. Examples of the gradual recognition by courts of copyright liability extending to those who contribute to or vicariously profit from the infringing acts of others are ''Fishel v. Lueckel''&lt;ref name=fishel&gt;''Fishel v. Lueckel'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/53f499.html 53 F. 499] (1892).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''.&lt;ref name=kalem /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, and Mark A. Lemley (2007). ''Intellectual Property in the New Technological Era'', p. 572, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of secondary liability==
There are generally two kinds of secondary [[Legal liability|liability]] developed by courts – [[vicarious liability]] and [[contributory liability]]. Although the line between these categories of liability is blurry, a precondition for all forms of secondary liability is the underlying act (or acts) of infringement. However, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ecourse/cases/netcom.htm 907 F. Supp. 1361, **36, citing 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 12.04{A}{1}, at 12-70] (1995)

Some academics have classified the active inducement adopted in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'' as a new type of secondary liability because it is based on express acts of inducement and not on a mere failure to act;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson,[http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf ''Three Reactions to MGM v. Grokster''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021534/http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, 13 Mich. Telecomm. Tech. L. Rev. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the specific intent to bring about infringing acts is another important factor in this analysis.

===Vicarious liability===
One of the theories widely accepted as a basis for liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Gorman and Jane C. Ginsburg (2009). ''Copyright Cases and Materials'', Foundation Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit as an extension of the [[common law]] doctrine of [[agency (law)|agency]] – ''respondeat superior'' (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is ''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway''.&lt;ref name=Witmark&gt;''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/22f2d412.html 22 F. 2d 412, 415 ] (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the master-servant context, however, courts have extended liability to those who profit from infringing activity when an enterprise has the right and ability to prevent the infringement. Under ''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'',&lt;ref name=dreamland/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“[T]he owner of a dance hall at whose place copyrighted musical compositions are played in violation of the rights of the copyright holder is liable, if the playing be for the profit of the proprietor of the dance hall. And this is so even though the orchestra be employed under a contract that would ordinarily make it an independent contractor.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; By contrast, courts did not extend liability to landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in organizing or soliciting the infringing activity. For example, ''Deutsch v. Arnold'',&lt;ref name=Deutsch&gt;''Deutsch v. Arnold'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/98f2d686.html 98 F. 2d 686] (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction''&lt;ref name=fonovisa&gt;''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/76/76.F3d.259.94-15717.html 76 F. 3d 259] (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; (extending liability to the operator of a swap meet who repeatedly leased booth space to concessionaires selling infringing tapes).&lt;ref&gt;[[Julie E. Cohen]], Lydia Pallas Loren, [[Ruth L. Okediji]], and [[Maureen A. O'Rourke]] (2006). ''Copyright in a Global Information Economy'', p. 481, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark case on vicarious liability for sales of counterfeit recordings is ''[[Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.]]''&lt;ref name=shapiro /&gt; In ''Shapiro'', the court was faced with a copyright infringement suit against the owner of a chain of department stores where a concessionaire was selling counterfeit recordings. The ''Shapiro'' court ultimately imposed liability, even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement, reasoning that the store proprietor had the power to cease the conduct of the concessionaire, and because the proprietor obtained direct financial benefit from the infringement.

===Contributory liability===
{{main article|Contributory copyright infringement}}

Contributory liability or [[Contributory Copyright Infringement|contributory infringement]] has been widely defined as a form of liability on the part of someone who is not directly infringing but nevertheless is making contributions to the infringing acts of others. Material contributions to the act (or enabling thereof), as well as knowledge of the act itself, are key elements of contributory liability. Additionally, in the course of performing such material contributions, the parties know that they are materially infringing copyrighted content.

Contributory liability is rooted in the [[tort]] theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third party liable for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in ''[[Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.]]'': “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.”&lt;ref name=Gershwin&gt;''Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/443/443.F2d.1159.606.35260.html 443 F. 2d 1159] (2d Cir. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the passage of the [[1976 Copyright Act]], the scope of contributory infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device – the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name=sony&gt;''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html 464 U.S. 417] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919165747/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html |date=2008-09-19 }} (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the [[Betamax]], the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the ''Sony'' exception with regard to new technologies: "The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses."&lt;ref name=sony /&gt;

==Liability of internet service providers (ISPs)==
Regarding [[internet]] communications, sometimes the most promising remedy is only available from the standpoint of the internet intermediary (e.g. delete the post, take down the link). In fact, the internet is a special field for secondary liability, because the open architecture of the internet facilitates many communications and users need intermediaries in order to access and contact each other's services.

The question of whether [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) should be held liable for the actions of network users is unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;See K. A. Taipale, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=712101 ''Secondary Liability on the Internet: Towards a Performative Standard for Constitutive Responsibility''], Center for Advanced Studies Working Paper No. 04-2003 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.

Recent statutes in the United States ([[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] of 1998) and the [[European Union]] have provided significant, though not total, immunity from primary copyright liability that, in the absence of those statutes, would exist for ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;See D. Panethiere,''The Basis for Copyright Infringement Liability: The Law in Common Law Jurisdictions'', 13 [[European Intellectual Property Review]] 26 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DMCA]] states four safe harbors:
(a) Transitory network communications
(b) System caching
(c) Information storage and
(d) Information location tools.&lt;ref name=17usc512&gt;''[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. §512]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
The last three have so called “notice &amp; take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, counter-notice and put-back and liability if false notice has been given.

In order to be eligible for the safe harbor provisions, it is required that the service provider has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to terminate the accounts of repetitive infringers. In addition, ISPs must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their works.&lt;ref name="17usc512"/&gt;

As to trademarks, in the absence of statutory guidance, courts have extended both types of secondary liability (vicarious and contributory) to third parties, including in some circumstances ISPs. Here, too, the question whether ISPs will be held liable for the acts of their infringing customers will depend on the degree of the ISP's knowledge and involvement in the specific infringing activity.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Coleman, [http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 ''Secondary Trademark Infringement: A Short Treatise on Contributory and Vicarious Infringement in Trademark''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913081422/http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 |date=2012-09-13 }} (Revised, Sept. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary liability in the future?==
Future treatment of secondary liability by US courts is uncertain. Some cases and commentators have argued for broadening secondary liability through [[cost-benefit analysis]], multi-factor balancing tests, or simply basing it on technical designs or [[business models]].&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1002676 ''Preliminary Thoughts on Copyright Reform''], Utah Law Review (2007); UC Berkeley Public Law Research Paper No. 1002676.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed EU directive would make aiding and abetting infringement a basis for liability.
In light of the above, it is permissible to conclude that there is no consensus on this issue.

A member of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] and formerly of the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]] (PD-L), she was a member of the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]] for [[Vrancea County]] from 2008 to 2012.

==Biography==

She was born in [[Focșani]] and graduated from the Textile Technology and Chemistry faculty of the [[Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iași]] in 1989. From that year until 1993, she worked as an engineer at a [[worsted]] wool spinning mill in Focșani. From 1993 to 1994, she was assistant manager of an import-export firm in [[Bucharest]]. She was then active at three textile firms in Focșani until November 2008: at Soreste, she was stockholder, administrator and board president from 1994; at Milcofil, later purchased by Soreste, she was board president from 1997; and at Artifex, a joint venture between Soreste and [[Akris]], she was administrator and general director from 2005.&lt;ref name="cvministru"/&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2013}}

In 1997, Plăcintă joined the Democratic Party (PD; later evolved into the PD-L). At the [[Romanian legislative election, 2008|2008 election]], she won a Senate seat, and became vice president of that chamber's agriculture, forestry and rural development committee.&lt;ref name="cvministru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.alegeri.tv/alegeri-parlamentare-uninominale-2008/focsani/278/colegiul-uninominal-1 Election results], alegeri.tv;  accessed July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, following the resignation of scandal-plagued minister [[Monica Iacob Ridzi]], Plăcintă was given the Youth and Sport portfolio and sworn in the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/sport/sorina-placinta-a-depus-juramantul-in-calitate-de-ministru-al-tineretului-si-sportului-video.html?1689;4639662 "Sorina Plăcintă a depus jurământul în calitate de ministru al Tineretului și Sportului" ("Sorina Plăcintă Takes Oath as Youth and Sport Minister")], Mediafax, 15 July 2009; accessed July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Her appointment was criticised by [[Vrancea County]] Council and [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]] chapter president [[Marian Oprișan]], who noted her links to the ministry were as close as those between "an old woman and a machine gun",&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/oprisan-placinta-are-legatura-cu-tineretul-si-sportul-cum-are-baba-cu-mitraliera.html?1687;4639859 "Oprișan: Plăcintă are legătură cu tineretul și sportul cum are 'baba cu mitraliera'" ("Oprișan: Plăcintă's Links to Youth and Sport Are as Those of 'an Old Woman and a Machine Gun'")], Mediafax, 14 July 2009; accessed July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and who pointed out she had contributed hundreds of thousands of [[euro]]s to her party.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/sport/sorina-placinta-a-depus-juramantul-in-calitate-de-ministru-al-tineretului-si-sportului-video.html?1689;4639662 "Şeful judeţului Vrancea: Plăcintă nici măcar nu și-a câștigat mandatul" ("Vrancea County Chief: Plăcintă Did Not Even Win Her Office")], ''Ziarul Financiar'', 14 July 2009; accessed July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, she announced plans to cut in half the number of positions at her ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanialibera.ro/a162215/sorina-placinta-injumatateste-organigrama-mts.html "Sorina Plăcintă injumătățește organigrama MTS" ("Sorina Plăcintă Cuts in Half Ministry's Organisational Chart")], ''România liberă'', 12 August 2009; accessed September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, she became interim Minister for Relations with Parliament following the resignation of her PSD cabinet colleagues, including [[Victor Ponta]], the previous occupant of that ministry, holding the portfolio until December.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florina Zainescu, Lacrima Andreica and Adriana Duțulescu, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/stire-politic/guvernul-ingropat-cu-lautari-522702.html "Guvernul, îngropat cu lăutari" ("The Government, Interred with ''Lăutari''"], ''Jurnalul Național'', 2 October 2009; accessed July 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documentare.rompres.ro/guverne.php?i=120 Emil Boc II-III Government]; accessed September 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Her ministerial term ended when she was not reappointed to a new cabinet under Boc at the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Monica Iordache Apostol, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/stire-special/guvernul-boc-zero-barat-553259.html "Guvernul Boc, zero barat" ("Boc Government, Total Zero")], ''Jurnalul Național'', 31 August 2010; accessed September 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a year later, she was elected a vice president of the Bucharest PD-L chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristina Iana, Alina Vasile, Valentina Deleanu, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/politica/PDL_Bucuresti_isi_alege_presedintele_0_376162499.html "Elena Udrea a fost aleasă preşedinte al PDL București: 'Eu vreau să scăpăm Bucureștiul de Sorin Oprescu'" ("Elena Udrea Elected President of Bucharest PDL: 'I Want Us to Get Bucharest Rid of Sorin Oprescu'"], ''Adevărul'', 21 November 2010; accessed November 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She resigned from the PD-L in June 2012, crossing to the PNL.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Oancea, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/politica/Senatorul_Sorina_Placinta_a_demisionat_din_PDL_si_se_inscrie_in_PNL_0_718128298.html "Senatorul Sorina Plăcintă a demisionat din PDL și se înscrie în PNL" ("Senator Sorina Plăcintă Resigns from PDL and Joins PNL"], ''Adevărul'', 13 June 2012; accessed June 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; She left the Senate at the end of 2012, having declined to run in [[Romanian legislative election, 2012|that year's election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Andreea Udrea, [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/Sorina-Plcint-nu-mai-candideaz-pentru-Parlament-1001535.html "Sorina Plăcintă nu mai candidează pentru Parlament" ("Sorina Plăcintă No Longer Running for Parliament"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 19 September 2012; accessed April 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stock market''', '''equity market''' or '''share market''' is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of [[stock]]s (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include ''securities'' listed on a public [[stock exchange]], as well as stock that is only traded privately. Examples of the latter include shares of private companies which are sold to [[investor]]s through [[equity crowdfunding]] platforms. Stock exchanges list shares of common equity as well as other security types, e.g. corporate bonds and convertible bonds.

==Size of the market==

Stocks are categorized in various ways. One way is by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, [[Nestlé]] and [[Novartis]] are domiciled in Switzerland, so they may be considered as part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stock market, although their stock may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as [[American depository receipt]]s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.

As of mid 2017, the size of the world stock market (total [[market capitalization]]) was about US$76.3 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/stock-market/|title=Introduction to the Stock Market|author=Agarwal|first=|date=July 14, 2017|publisher=Intelligent Economist|access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By country, the largest market was the United States (about 34%), followed by [[Japan]] (about 6%) and the [[United Kingdom]] (about 6%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-exchanges.org/files/statistics/2012%20WFE%20Market%20Highlights.pdf WFE 2012 Market Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828194227/http://world-exchanges.org/files/statistics/2012%20WFE%20Market%20Highlights.pdf |date=August 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers increased in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2142523-global-stock-rally-world-market-cap-reached-record-high-in-march|title=Global Stock Rally: World Market Cap Reached Record High In March &amp;#124; Seeking Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, there are a total of 60 stock exchanges in the world with a total [[market capitalization]] of $69 trillion. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of global market capitalization. Apart from the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], these 16 exchanges are based in one of three continents: North America, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-stock-exchanges-by-size/|title=All of the World's Stock Exchanges by Size|date=2016-02-16|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock exchange==
{{main|Stock exchange}}
A [[stock exchange]] is an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] (or [[Exchange (organized market)|bourse]]){{#tag:ref|The concept of the [[exchange (organized market)|bourse]] (or the [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]]) was 'invented' in the medieval [[Low Countries]] (most notably in predominantly Dutch-speaking cities like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]]) before the birth of formal stock exchanges in the 17th century. Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose – a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporations]] – or a stock exchange as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Larry (2005). "Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company", in Goetzmann &amp; Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165–175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} where [[stock broker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded "over the counter" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss|title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &amp;#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ?|publisher=[[IBM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.

==Trade==
[[Image:Photos NewYork1 032.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New York Stock Exchange]]]]
[[Image:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|left|The [[London Stock Exchange]]]]

Trade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.

Participants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].

Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange|commodity exchanges]], and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].

A potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.

The purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].

The [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the [[market maker|Designated Market Maker]] ("DMM") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid-offer spread|spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place – in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the "[[New York Stock Exchange|tape]]" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].

The [[NASDAQ]] is a virtual exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.

The [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system|order matching process]] was fully automated.

People trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortega |first1=Edgar |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=al86iws61SPY&amp;refer=home |last2= Yalman|first2=Onaran|title=UBS, Goldman Threaten NYSE, Nasdaq With Rival Stock Markets|publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=December 4, 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial regulators are probing [[dark pool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s-.html|title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | first=Sam|last=Mamudi|date=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0.html Financial regulators probe dark pools] Financial Times&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market participant==
[[File:Bursa Malaysia.JPG|thumb|200px|The offices of [[Bursa Malaysia]], Malaysia's national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) ]]

[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks, insurance companies and hedge funds, and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.  Some studies have suggested that institutional investors and corporations trading in their own shares generally receive higher risk-adjusted returns than retail investors.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Amedeo De Cesari, Susanne Espenlaub, Arif Khurshed, and Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1884171 The Effects of Ownership and Stock Liquidity on the Timing of Repurchase Transactions] (October 2010). Paolo Baffi Centre Research Paper No. 2011-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few decades ago, most buyers and sellers were individual investors, such as wealthy businessmen, usually with long family histories to particular corporations. Over time, markets have become more "institutionalized"; buyers and sellers are largely institutions (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s).

The rise of the [[institutional investor]] has brought with it some improvements in market operations. There has been a gradual tendency for "fixed" (and exorbitant) fees being reduced for all investors, partly from falling administration costs but also assisted by large institutions challenging brokers' oligopolistic approach to setting standardized fees.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A current trend in stock market investments includes the decrease in fees due to computerized asset management termed [[Robo Advisers]] within the industry. Automation has decreased portfolio management costs by lowering the cost associated with investing as a whole.

=== Trends in market participation ===
Stock market participation refers to the number of agents who buy and sell equity backed securities either directly or indirectly in a financial exchange. Participants are generally subdivided into three distinct sectors; households, institutions, and foreign traders. Direct participation occurs when any of the above entities buys or sells securities on its own behalf on an exchange. Indirect participation occurs when an institutional investor exchanges a stock on behalf of an individual or household. Indirect investment occurs in the form of pooled investment accounts, retirement accounts, and other managed financial accounts.

==== Indirect vs. direct investment ====
The total value of equity-backed securities in the United States rose over 600% in the 25 years between 1989 and 2012 as market capitalization expanded from $2,790 billion to $18,668 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) {{!}} Data {{!}} Graph|url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/countries/1W-US?display=graph|website = data.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite report |date=September 1995 |title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1995 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1995/compendia/statab/115ed.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |page=513 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite report |date=August 2011 |title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/statab/131ed.html?cssp=SERP |publisher=United States Census Bureau |page=730  |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Rydqvist, Spizman, and [[Ilya Strebulaev|Strebulaev]] attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Government Policy and Ownership of Financial Assets|url = https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1428442|date = 2013-01-01|first = Kristian|last = Rydqvist|first2 = Joshua|last2 = Spizman|first3 = Ilya A.|last3 = Strebulaev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====
Rates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite report |date=June 2012 |title=Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2007 to 2010: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/pdf/scf12.pdf |publisher=Federal Reserve Board of Governors |page=24 |accessdate=2015-12-17 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same time period households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite report |date=September 2014 |title=Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/pdf/scf14.pdf |publisher=Federal Reserve Board of Governors |page=20  |accessdate=2015-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Participation by head of household race and gender ====
The racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3% Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation ====
In a 2003 paper by Vissing-Jørgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Annette |last=Vissing-Jørgensen |title=Perspectives on Behavioral Finance: Does ‘Irrationality’ Disappear with Wealth? Evidence from Expectations and Actions |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=18 |year=2003 |pages=139–194 |doi=10.1086/ma.18.3585252 |citeseerx=10.1.1.195.7189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation rates have been shown to strongly correlate with education levels, promoting the hypothesis that information and transaction costs of market participation are better absorbed by more educated households. Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual’s decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation|last = Hong|first = Harrison|date = February 2004|journal = The Journal of Finance|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00629.x|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.

==History==
[[File:Brugge - Saaihalle en beurs.jpg|thumb|200px|The term [[Exchange (organized market)|bourse]] is derived from the 13th-century inn named "Huis ter Beurze" (center) in [[Bruges]]. From predominantly Dutch-speaking cities of the [[Low Countries]] (like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerpt]]), the term 'beurs' spread to other European states where it was corrupted into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'börse', etc.]]
===Early history===
In 12th-century France, the ''courretiers de change'' were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[broker]]s. A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the "Brugse Beurse", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 |title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto |publisher=Belgiumview.com |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. The idea quickly spread around [[Flanders]] and neighboring countries and "Beurzen" soon opened in [[Ghent]] and [[Rotterdam]].

In the middle of the 13th century, [[Venice|Venetian]] bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.

{{Cquote|The stock market — the daytime adventure serial of the well-to-do — would not be the stock market if it did not have its ups and downs. (...) And it has many other distinctive characteristics. Apart from the economic advantages and disadvantages of stock exchanges — the advantage that they provide a free flow of capital to finance industrial expansion, for instance, and the disadvantage that they provide an all too convenient way for the unlucky, the imprudent, and the gullible to lose their money — their development has created a whole pattern of social behavior, complete with customs, language, and predictable responses to given events. What is truly extraordinary is the speed with which this pattern emerged full blown following the establishment, in 1611, of the world's first important stock exchange — a roofless courtyard [[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|in Amsterdam]] — and the degree to which it persists (with variations, it is true) on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in the nineteen-sixties. Present-day [[stock trading]] in the United States — a bewilderingly vast enterprise, involving millions of miles of private telegraph wires, computers that can read and copy the Manhattan Telephone Directory in three minutes, and over twenty million [[stockholder]] participants — would seem to be a far cry from a handful of seventeenth-century Dutchmen haggling in the rain. But the field marks are much the same. The first stock exchange was, inadvertently, a laboratory in which new human reactions were revealed. By the same token, the New York Stock Exchange is also a sociological test tube, forever contributing to the human species' self-understanding. The behaviour of the pioneering Dutch [[stock trader]]s is ably documented in a book entitled “Confusion of Confusions,” written by a plunger on the Amsterdam market named [[Joseph de la Vega]]; originally published in 1688, (...)|200px||[[John Brooks (writer)|John Brooks]], in “Business Adventures” (1968)&lt;ref&gt;[[John Brooks (writer)|Brooks, John]] (1968). “The  Fluctuation: The Little Crash in '62”, in “Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street”.

{{Cquote|Even in the days before [[perestroika]], [[socialism]] was never a monolith. Within the [[Communist countries]], the spectrum of socialism ranged from the quasi-market, quasi-[[syndicalist]] system of Yugoslavia to the centralized [[totalitarianism]] of neighboring Albania. One time I asked Professor [[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises]], the great expert on the economics of socialism, at what point on this spectrum of statism would he designate a country as "socialist" or not. At that time, I wasn't sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises's answer. "A stock market," he answered promptly. "A stock market is crucial to the existence of [[capitalism]] and [[private property]]. For it means that there is a functioning market in the exchange of private titles to the [[means of production]]. There can be no genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market: there can be no true socialism if such a market is allowed to exist."

===Function and purpose===
The stock market is one of the most important ways for [[Company|companies]] to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocapitalmarkets.org/?q=node/176|title=Equity market Size relative to bond markets and bank assets|work=eurocapitalmarkets.org|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The [[liquidity]] that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as [[property]] and other [[immoveable]] assets. Some companies actively increase liquidity by trading in their own shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Amedeo De |last=Cesari |first2=Susanne |last2=Espenlaub |first3=Arif |last3=Khurshed |first4=Michael |last4=Simkovic |ssrn=1884171 |title=The Effects of Ownership and Stock Liquidity on the Timing of Repurchase Transactions |year=2010 |work=Paolo Baffi Centre Research Paper No. 2011-100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Simkovic |ssrn=1117303 |title=The Effect of Enhanced Disclosure on Open Market Stock Repurchases |journal=Berkeley Business Law Journal |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

History has shown that the price of [[stock]]s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.&lt;ref&gt;Mahipal Singh, 2011, {{ISBN|9788182055193}}, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, [[central bank]]s tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of [[financial system]] functions. Financial stability is the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of central banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2009/wp0970.pdf|title = Financial Stability Frameworks and the Role of Central Banks: Lessons from the Crisis|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the [[counterparty]] could default on the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clearinghouse Definition &amp; Example {{!}} Investing Answers|url = http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/investing/clearinghouse-2830|website = www.investinganswers.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates [[economic growth]] in that lower costs and enterprise risks promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way the financial system is assumed to contribute to increased prosperity, although some controversy exists as to whether the optimal financial system is bank-based or market-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ross |last=Levine |title=Bank-Based or Market-Based Financial Systems: Which Is Better? |journal=Journal of Financial Intermediation |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=2002 |pages=398–428 |doi=10.1006/jfin.2002.0341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent events such as the [[Global Financial Crisis]] have prompted a heightened degree of scrutiny of the impact of the structure of stock markets&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD354.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/future-of-computer-trading|title=Future of computer trading|work=www.gov.uk|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called [[market microstructure]]), in particular to the stability of the financial system and the transmission of [[systemic risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K. |last=Alexander |first2=R. |last2=Dhumale |first3=J. |last3=Eatwell |title=Global Governance of Financial Systems: The International Regulation of Systemic Risk |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-516698-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to the modern financial system===
The financial system in most western countries has undergone a remarkable transformation. One feature of this development is [[disintermediation]]. A portion of the funds involved in saving and financing, flows directly to the financial markets instead of being routed via the traditional bank lending and deposit operations. The general public interest in investing in the stock market, either directly or through [[mutual fund]]s, has been an important component of this process.

Statistics show that in recent decades, shares have made up an increasingly large proportion of households' financial assets in many countries. In the 1970s, in [[Sweden]], [[deposit account]]s and other very liquid assets with little risk made up almost 60 percent of households' financial wealth, compared to less than 20 percent in the 2000s. The major part of this adjustment is that [[financial portfolio]]s have gone directly to shares but a good deal now takes the form of various kinds of institutional investment for groups of individuals, e.g., pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, insurance investment of premiums, etc.

The trend towards forms of saving with a higher risk has been accentuated by new rules for most funds and insurance, permitting a higher proportion of shares to bonds. Similar tendencies are to be found in other [[Developed country|developed countries]]. In all developed economic systems, such as the European Union, the United States, Japan and other developed nations, the trend has been the same: saving has moved away from traditional (government insured) "bank deposits to more risky securities of one sort or another".

A second transformation is the move to [[electronic trading]] to replace human trading of listed [[Security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;

'''Compared to Other Asset Classes''' Over the long term, investing in a well diversified portfolio of stocks such as an S&amp;P 500 Index outperforms other investment vehicles such as Treasury Bills and Bonds, with the S&amp;P 500 having a geometric  annual average of  9.55% from 1928 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html|title=Historical Returns|work=nyu.edu|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior of the stock market===
[[Image:NASDAQ.JPG|upright|thumb|[[NASDAQ]] in Times Square, New York City]]
Investors may temporarily move financial prices away from market equilibrium. Over-reactions may occur—so that excessive optimism (euphoria) may drive prices unduly high or excessive pessimism may drive prices unduly low.  Economists continue to debate whether financial markets are generally efficient.

According to one interpretation of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (EMH), only changes in fundamental factors, such as the outlook for margins, profits or dividends, ought to affect share prices beyond the short term, where [[Randomness|random]] 'noise' in the system may prevail. The 'hard' [[efficient-market hypothesis]] does not explain the cause of events such as the [[Black Monday (1987)|crash in 1987]], when the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] plummeted 22.6 percent—the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cutler, D. Poterba, J. &amp; Summers, L. 1991 520–546"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cutler, D. Poterba, J. &amp; Summers, L. | title = Speculative dynamics | year = 1991 | journal = Review of Economic Studies | volume = 58 | pages = 520–546 | doi = 10.2307/2298010 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event demonstrated that share prices can fall dramatically even though no generally agreed upon definite cause has been found: a thorough search failed to detect ''any'' 'reasonable' development that might have accounted for the crash. (Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by [[Randomness|chance]], although very rarely.) It seems also to be the case more generally that many price movements (beyond that which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.&lt;ref name="Cutler, D. Poterba, J. &amp; Summers, L. 1991 520–546"/&gt;

A 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to ''systematically'' profit from any momentary market '[[Market anomaly|inefficiencies]]'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence, annot. ed. | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 0-465-04357-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, 2nd ed. | publisher = Random House | isbn = 1-4000-6793-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown that [[Behavioral economics|psychological factors]] may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124–1131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon—also from psychology—that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.

In one paper the authors draw an analogy with [[gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Stephen Morris (game theorist) |first=Stephen |last=Morris |first2=Hyun Song |last2=Shin |title=Risk management with interdependent choice |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=52–62 |year=1999 |doi=10.1093/oxrep/15.3.52 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~smorris/Published/paper_21_Risk_Management.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal times the market behaves like a game of [[roulette]]; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.

In the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent of the analyst's recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000–2002 bear market, the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Stock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Many different academic researchers have stated companies with low P/E ratios and smaller sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market.  Research carried out states mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies and smaller companies have higher returns historically.

=== Irrational behavior ===
Sometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counterreaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].

Over the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.

Behaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.&lt;ref&gt;Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People still place too much confidence in the markets and have too strong a belief that paying attention to the gyrations in their investments will someday make them rich, and so they do not make conservative preparations for possible bad outcomes."]]

Shiller states that [[:Image:Price-Earnings Ratios as a Predictor of Ten-Year Returns (Shiller Data).png|this plot]] "confirms that long-term investors—investors who commit their money to an investment for ten full years—did do well when prices were low relative to earnings at the beginning of the ten years. Long-term investors would be well advised, individually, to lower their exposure to the stock market when it is high, as it has been recently, and get into the market when it is low."&lt;ref name="IE2"/&gt;]]

A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in [[share price]]s of [[stock]]s listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.

There have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973–4]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.

One of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. Another famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 – Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.

By the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history – the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names "Black Monday" and "Black Tuesday" are also used for October 28–29, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday—the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.

The crash in 1987 raised some puzzles – main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.

Since the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock market prediction===

[[Tobias Preis]] and his colleagues [[Helen Susannah Moat]] and [[H. Eugene Stanley]] introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves, using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/counting-google-searches-predicts-market-movements-1.12879 | title=Counting Google searches predicts market movements | author=[[Philip Ball]] | work=Nature | date=April 26, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis of [[Google]] search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/google-search-terms-can-predict-stock-market-study-finds/ | title= Google Search Terms Can Predict Stock Market, Study Finds | author=Nick Bilton | work=[[New York Times]] | date=April 26, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22293693 | title=Google searches predict market moves | author=Jason Palmer | work=[[BBC]] | date=April 25, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock market index==
{{Main|Stock market index}}

The movements of the prices in a market or section of a market are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g., the [[Standard &amp; Poor's|S&amp;P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.

==Derivative instruments==
{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}

Financial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges—their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.

==Leveraged strategies==
Stock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.

===Short selling===
{{Main|Short selling}}
In short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called "covering." This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.

===Margin buying===
{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}
In margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).

A margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)

Regulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).

Global issuance of equity and equity-related instruments totaled $505&amp;nbsp;billion in 2004, a 29.8% increase over the $389&amp;nbsp;billion raised in 2003. [[Initial public offering]]s (IPOs) by US issuers increased 221% with 233 offerings that raised $45&amp;nbsp;billion, and IPOs in [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|Europe, Middle East and Africa]] (EMEA) increased by 333%, from $9&amp;nbsp;billion to $39&amp;nbsp;billion.

==Investment strategies==
{{Main|Investment strategy}}
There are many different approaches to investing. Many strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, general economic conditions, etc.  [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management|risk control]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].

Additionally, many choose to invest via the [[index fund|index method]]. In this method, one holds a weighted or unweighted portfolio consisting of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&amp;P 500]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from too frequent trading, and ride the general trend of the stock market (which, in the U.S., has averaged nearly 10% per year, compounded annually, since [[World War II]]).

Responsible investment emphasizes and requires a long term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment; [[socially responsible investing]] is also recommended{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} in all types of investment.

==Taxation==
{{Main|Capital gains tax}}
According to much national or state legislation, a large array of fiscal obligations are taxed for [[capital gain]]s. Taxes are charged by the state over the transactions, dividends and capital gains on the stock market, in particular in the stock exchanges. These fiscal obligations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries{{which|date=November 2017}} avoid taxing profits on stocks as the profits are already taxed when companies file returns, but double taxation is common at some level in many countries.

A '''retail manager''' (or '''store manager''') is the person ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operations (or [[management]]) of a [[retailing|retail store]]. All [[employment|employees]] working in the store report to the retail/store manager. A store manager reports to a district/area or general manager.

==Roles and responsibilities==
Responsibilities of a store manager include:

* Overall care of staff and their well being
* Presentation of store and advertising displays
* Recruiting, performance management,  and workplace scheduling
* Product management, including ordering, receiving, price changes, handling damaged products, and returns
*Team Development, facilitating staff learning training, and development
*Problem solving, handling unusual circumstances
*To understand the customer service principles
* To handle problems and questions to customers
* Basic Computer applications in [[stores management]] and materials control

==Sales generation==
A store manager must meet the monthly, quarterly, or annual sales goals, depending on the company's [[fiscal year|fiscal]] cycle. This involves setting individual sales goals (quotas), holding contests for employees, or offering sales [[promotion (marketing)|promotions]]. The manager may also find ways to make employees more productive to meet the goals. Thus, the store manager may be forced to reduce [[payroll]] expenditures by decreasing employees' hours, or otherwise reducing operating [[cost]]. A store manager should motivate his or her team to achieve the target set for the store. A store manager should set an example for his or her subordinates to follow.

==Safety and security==
[[Image:Material safety data sheet.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The General manager must post [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]s for their employees for any hazardous materials used in the store.]]

The Store manager is the store's primary key-holder and may be called to the store before, during, or after business hours in the event of an emergency. They are also responsible for the safety of all customers and employees on store premises. Store managers may be required to hold safety meetings, especially as dictated by [[trade union|union]] practices in cases where store employees belong to a union.

==Division of responsibility==
A store manager may have several [[hierarchy|subordinates]] who have management-level responsibility. These employees may be called deputy managers, assistant managers, department managers, supervisors, key holders, shift leads, or leads. Sometimes members of the management team may be several grades below the store manager. One example would be store manager - deputy manager - department manager - department leads.
A store manager has over-all responsibility for all day-to-day activity of the store. Managing &amp; controlling staff, and planning are essential points of the store manager.

==Hiring, training and development==
The store manager is responsible for hiring, training, and in some cases, development of employees. The manager must ensure staffing levels are adequate to effectively operate the store, and ensure employees receive training necessary for their job responsibilities. Managers may be responsible for developing employees so the company can [[promotion (rank)|promote]] employees from within and develop future [[leadership|leaders]], potentially for employment at other locations. Store managers also have the [[Termination of employment|fire]] powers to any under-performing or misbehaving employees. The role of store managers with regards to the other employees varies from company to company and each respective company's operating methods but in general a store manager will be required to deal with and try to solve any and all problems that may occur at any given time.

'''''The Bridge World''''' ('''TBW'''), the oldest continuously published magazine about [[contract bridge]], was founded in 1929 by [[Ely Culbertson]]. It has since been regarded as the game's principal journal, publicizing technical advances in bidding and the play of the cards, discussions of ethical issues, bridge politics and leading personalities, and reports of major tournaments.

Culbertson edited TBW (assisted by a staff of well known writers and players such as [[Josephine Culbertson]], [[Alfred Sheinwold]], [[Samuel Fry Jr.]], [[Richard L. Frey]], [[Albert Hodges Morehead|Albert H. Morehead]] and [[Alphonse Moyse|Alphonse "Sonny" Moyse Jr.]]) until 1943. Morehead then became editor and continued until 1946, when Moyse took over. The McCall Corporation purchased TBW in 1963, and subsequently sold it to [[Edgar Kaplan]]. Kaplan became editor and publisher in late 1966; his first issue is dated January 1967. [[Jeff Rubens]] acted as Kaplan's co-editor until Kaplan's death in 1997, when Rubens became editor and publisher.

Largely because of its emphasis on [[Duplicate bridge#IMP scoring|IMP]] and [[Duplicate bridge#Matchpoint scoring|matchpoint]] play, TBW is of interest primarily to tournament players.

==Regular features==

Several features appear in each issue. The most popular are:

===Editorial===

Prior to 1967, editorials had appeared infrequently in TBW. Under the Kaplan/Rubens editorship, the Editorial became a monthly feature, and occupies a privileged position, appearing directly after the table of contents.

The Editorial usually discusses issues that are both timely and of import to tournament bridge players, and from time to time provides a forum for points of view that are not shared by the editorial staff. A non-random sample of the topics that have appeared in the Editorial over the past 40 years:

* Conditions of contest that reward the deliberate loss of preliminary matches
* Effective disclosure of partnership agreements, particularly in international competition where Highly Unusual Methods ([[Contract bridge glossary#H|HUMs]]) are prevalent. Similarly, the ongoing tension between players who wish to use their own bidding innovations and administrators who need to protect tournaments from HUMs.
* Slow play
* Dealing effectively with [[Cheating in bridge|cheating]] and professionalism, primarily as to [[American Contract Bridge League]] (ACBL) tournaments
* Sex discrimination, evidenced by the existence of men-only, women-only, and open events
* Psychic bidding
* The Italian Bridge Federation's handling of the [[Cheating in bridge#Burgay tapes|Burgay-Bianchi affair]]

===Master Solvers Club (MSC)===

The MSC is a combination of quiz and commentary. Several problem hands, along with the bidding so far on each, are presented and the reader is asked what call he would make (the number of problems per month has varied, but since the 1950s at least it has settled in at eight per issue). The answers to each question are given in the next issue, along with comments by expert panelists and by the panel's moderator.

This arrangement provides a means for the reader to improve his bidding skills, and to get a glimpse of the thought processes of the experts. Readers (or, in the context of the MSC, "solvers") are invited to submit their monthly scores to TBW. An annual competition is held for the highest 12-month total; the winner is invited to participate on the expert panel for a year.

For many years, the MSC was conducted by the same person each month: Samuel Fry Jr. from 1932 through 1945 and Albert H. Morehead from 1945 until his death in 1966. In January 1967, when Kaplan and Rubens took over TBW's editorship, a rotating group of directors was established: Moyse, Alfred Sheinwold, Howard Schenken and Alan Truscott each directed the Club once every four months. Retirements, editorial disagreements and health problems led to changes in the Club's directorship, and well known players such as Bobby Wolff, Jeff Rubens, Eric Kokish, Kit Woolsey, David Berkowitz, Larry Cohen, Bart Bramley, Danny Kleinman, Steve Landen, Karen McCallum, and [[Barry Rigal]] have all served as directors.  In 2005, the MSC changed from a rotation of four directors to a rotation of six.

The form of the MSC has also changed markedly over the years. It was originally conceived as a means by which readers could test themselves on the [[Contract bridge glossary#C|Culbertson System]], and for years it was held that there was only one correct answer to each problem – there being only one correct answer in the context of the Culbertson System. In the 1940s a system of partial credits was instituted, with the "correct" answer receiving 100 points and lesser awards going to other answers. This approach continues in 2009.

A related change occurred in 1951, when the answers provided by experts other than the director were printed, along with their comments. According to TBW's [https://web.archive.org/web/20071010160736/http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=master_solver&amp;f=mschist.html%2F history of the MSC], this was the magazine's first explicit acknowledgment that such a panel existed. The publication of expert comments also continues in 2009.

Although most of the monthly problems concern bidding, under the Kaplan/Rubens editorship there has been one problem each month concerning leads, nearly always opening leads.

As to the problems that concern bidding, the experts' answers and comments lost clarity as the Culbertson/Goren consensus (four-card majors, strong notrump, strong two-bids, two-over-one showing only about 10 [[Hand evaluation#High card points|HCP]]) began to fall apart during the 1950s and 1960s. The experts' answers became influenced less by judgment and more by system, some experts even abstaining on occasion because they could not use a favored treatment. When different experts preferred different systems it became difficult to reach consensus and the comments became less valuable.

Therefore, in 1967 Kaplan and Rubens instituted a poll of experts to determine their bidding preferences (e.g., four-card or five-card majors, strong or [[weak two bid|weak]] two-bids, doubles of overcalls [[negative double|negative]] or for penalty, limit or forcing jump raises, etc.). Solvers were also invited to participate in the poll, but their role was restricted to breaking ties among the experts. The result was [[Bridge World Standard]] 1968, now known as BWS 68. There have been three major revisions of the system, in 1984, 1994 and 2001. BWS has always been intended as a platform for answering MSC problems, but also as a system that two experienced players could use if they had never partnered one another. Another use for BWS, perhaps intended in 1967 but never touted as a rationale, is to provide a means of tracking how expert preferences have changed over the years.

TBW regards the MSC as its most successful feature; certainly it is its longest running. It has been imitated in one guise or another by most bridge periodicals.

Several sample MSC problems, answers and commentary can be found at TBW's [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019002535/http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=article_sampler&amp;f=samms.html%2F web site].

===Challenge the Champs===

Challenge the Champs (CTC) is, in the words of TBW, "… a continuing bidding battle. Each month, two leading pairs compete, bidding deals from actual play (taken from old tournament reports or submitted by readers)." CTC is a feature that debuted in The Bridge Journal, a periodical edited by Jeff Rubens which was discontinued when Rubens joined the staff of TBW. At that point TBW took over the operation and the publication of CTC.

The format is to give each pair ten hands to bid, just as though they were at the table. Awards for different contracts are pre-set, and the results are scored as though they were matchpoints awarded on a 12 top. Over ten hands (again quoting from TBW): "… in the fifties is over average, in the sixties might win, higher is phenomenal."

In its original form, a pair would continue in CTC so long as it kept winning. The prior month's winners were termed the "Champs" and would compete against a new pair, the "Challengers." More recently the contest has been altered: TBW invites a pair to participate for exactly two consecutive months (first as Newcomers, then as Incumbents); if a pair wins at least one of its two matches, it is invited to return at a later time, and possibly take part in a CTC elimination tournament.

During the period that a pair could compete indefinitely, [[Matt Granovetter]] and [[Ron Rubin (bridge player)|Ron Rubin]] established the record for consecutive wins at 10, from July 1975 through April 1976, using the [[Ultimate Club]], a strong club system with many [[relay bid|relay]] sequences. In May 1976 Granovetter-Rubin lost to Kerri and Mike Shuman by the record combined score of 86-85.

CTC has been involved with some odd coincidences. As reported by John Kelly Karasek in a 1978 issue,&lt;ref&gt;The Bridge World, October 1978, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; the March 1975 issue both reported on the Facchini-Zucchelli foot-tapping incident in that year's [[Bermuda Bowl]], ''and'' featured Facchini-Zucchelli as the Challengers in CTC. The May 1977 issue reported at length on a cheating scandal in the US international team trials in Houston Texas, during which the accused, Richard Katz and Larry Cohen (not the same Larry Cohen who has written extensively on the [[Law of Total Tricks]]), resigned from the ACBL. Katz and Cohen were the CTC Challengers during that same month.

===Bits and Pieces===

Bits and Pieces is principally a letters-to-the-editor column. It first appeared in January 1955.  The very first letter printed in the column asked the correct play in a contract of 4{{Hearts}}, and the answer was to take an [[Finesse#Ann Gallagher finesse|Ann Gallagher finesse]].

The letters tend ''not'' to concern questions of bidding or play – these are dealt with in other features such as Pro et Contra (discontinued after Oswald Jacoby's death in 1984). They ''do'' tend to focus on issues raised in editorials, editorial style (e.g., matters such as gender-neutral prose, and the use of hyphens), unusual occurrences, laws and proprieties, and how sponsoring organizations such as the ACBL and the EBL regulate the game. The column also contains corrections and amplifications, book and product reviews, and occasional solicitations of readers' opinions.

===Other features appearing regularly===

* '''Test Your Play''': Two problems consisting of declarer's hand and dummy. The bidding is often provided, but is usually immaterial. The level of play is quite high, and for many years the problems were set by [[Paul Lukacs]], thought by many the game's premier composer of single dummy problems. A discussion of the correct play, or line of play, is provided elsewhere in the same issue.
* '''Kantar for the Defense''': Written by [[Edwin Kantar|Edwin B. Kantar]]. One problem consisting of a defender's hand and dummy. The bidding is usually provided and is often important to finding the correct solution. The general difficulty level is just a little lower than in Test Your Play.
* '''Tournament reports''': These were nearly always written by Edgar Kaplan from the time that he purchased TBW until the mid-1990s. They cover the major ACBL events and world championships, although reports of events held by other sponsoring organizations occasionally appear. The approach is to discuss hands that were of particular interest, or that caused major swings in a match. Since 1997, authorship of the reports has been distributed among various reporters, part of the emphasis that Rubens has placed on broadening the magazine's perspective.
* '''Swiss Match''': Usually authored by Jeff Rubens, this feature appears three times annually. It poses seven problems in bidding or play, in the form of a [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss match]]. The reader is given a raw score for each of various actions that he might take. A post mortem section describes the outcome of each problem at the "other table," and the reader can IMP the results for himself. The format extends (by means of sub-problems) that used by [[Hugh Kelsey]] in his books ''Test Your Match Play''&lt;ref&gt;Test Your Match Play, Faber and Faber, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Tough Game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last = Kelsey |first = Hugh  |authorlink = Hugh Kelsey |author-mask =  |title = The Tough Game |edition =  |publisher = Faber and Faber  |location = London  |pages =  |series =  |year = 1979  |doi =  |lccn =
 |oclc =  |isbn = 0-571-11360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fifty Years Ago''': This monthly feature first appeared in 1986. It revisits an issue that was published exactly fifty years earlier, and discusses points of interest from that issue, such as spectacular hands and bidding innovations. The column is of particular interest because the author discusses erstwhile hot topics in light of subsequent bridge history.
* '''Bridgeworks''': Articles on bidding and play that are aimed at newer players.
* '''Classic Rewind''': Outstanding articles from TBW's early years, thus from issues that are now difficult to obtain.

==Features that appear irregularly==

Some features that do not appear according to a fixed schedule, or that have run their course:

* '''Appeals Committee''': A series of articles that discusses how a committee should apply the Laws and Proprieties to adjudicate rulings that have been appealed by the players.
* '''That's Ridiculous''': Collections of newspaper columns, submitted by the TBW readership, that mis-analyze hands. (The column title was adapted from a television program, ''[[That's Incredible!]]'', then-popular in the US.)
* Technical innovations first appearing in TBW: a highly abbreviated list includes the [[Grand Slam Force]], [[Stayman convention|Stayman]], [[lebensohl]], PLOB, suit-preference [[signal (bridge)|signals]], the [[unusual notrump]], Puppet Stayman, and [[CRASH convention|CRASH]]. ([[Blackwood convention|Blackwood]] is ''not'' included in this list: although [[Easley Blackwood Sr.]] submitted an article on his convention to TBW, it was rejected – presumably because it conflicted with the [[Culbertson 4-5 Notrump]] convention.) A technical innovation in the play of the cards is now rare: many advanced coups were known to whist players during the 19th century. However, Geza Ottlik's The Quest&lt;ref&gt;The Bridge World, December 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and The Way It Is&lt;ref&gt;The Bridge World, February through May 1974&lt;/ref&gt; advanced readers' awareness of card play, particularly in the areas of {{gcb|elope|elopement}} and [[squeeze play (bridge)|squeeze play]], well beyond levels previously discussed in the bridge literature.
* Several times each year, humorous, bridge-themed fiction appears in TBW. Authors such as [[Frank Vine]], [[Robert Gray (bridge writer)|Robert Gray]], [[Victor Mollo]], [[David Bird (bridge writer)|David Bird]], [[Danny Kleinman]] and [[Nick Straguzzi]], and E. S. Baer (a [[pseudonym]] of [[Edgar Kaplan]]'s), among many others, have contributed satirical short stories with points concerning bidding, the play of the cards, and bridge personalities.

==Bridge Hall of Fame==
The concept for a Bridge Hall of Fame was originated with Lee Hazen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last = Editors, The Bridge World Magazine |first =  |authorlink =   |author-mask =   |title = First Three Members Elected to Bridge Hall of Fame  |edition =  |publisher = The Bridge World  |location = New York, NY  |page = 2 |series =  |year = February 1964 |doi =  |lccn =  |oclc =  |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; an early Life Master, and undertaken by The Bridge World magazine by a ballet poll of 115 leading bridge columnists in the United States; the top three names receiving at least thirty percent of the cast votes were elected in the inaugural year. The magazine continued with elections in 1965 and 1966 but then discontinued sponsorship. The elected members to the Bridge World's Hall of Fame were:
* 1964: [[Ely Culbertson]], [[Charles Goren]] and [[Harold Vanderbilt]]
* 1965: [[Oswald Jacoby]], [[Sidney Lenz]] and [[Milton Work]]
* 1966  [[Howard Schenken]], [[Sidney Silodor]] and [[Waldemar von Zedtwitz]]

Subsequently in 1995, the [[American Contract Bridge League]] inaugurated their own [[List of contract bridge people#Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] and adopted the initial nine inducted in the Bridge World Hall of Fame.

==Bridge World Standard==
Since 1968, the magazine has periodically polled experts on various bidding treatments and conventions in order to develop a unified system of bidding known as Bridge World Standard. There have been five versions of the system with the latest revision being the 2017 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bridgeworld.com/indexphp.php?page=/pages/readingroom/bws/bwscompletesystem.html|title=The Bridge World|author=|date=|website=www.bridgeworld.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026002459/https://www.bridgeworld.com/indexphp.php?page=%2Fpages%2Freadingroom%2Fbws%2Fbwscompletesystem.html|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge World Standard has evolved with the practices of North American experts and, similar to the [[Standard American Yellow Card]] system promulgated by the [[American Contract Bridge League]], is offered as a system "for use by impromptu or casual partnerships, and as a basis for discussion by those who wish to formulate their own system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last = Editors, The Bridge World Magazine |first =  |authorlink =   |author-mask =   |title = The Pocket Guide to Bridge World Standard  |edition = 2001  |publisher = The Bridge World Books  |location = New York, NY  |page = 6 |series =   |year = |doi =  |lccn =  |oclc =  |isbn = 978-0-9753419-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Lucien Anton "Tony" Spaeth', Jr.''' (February 6, 1934 in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]) is a [[corporate identity]] planner, consultant, critic and teacher.

==Early years==
During his childhood, Spaeth's parents took in [[Anthony Bailey (author)|Anthony Bailey]] (then himself a child) as a war refugee; Bailey has since told the story of their shared childhood years in the books ''America, Lost &amp; Found''&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Anthony C., “America, Lost &amp; Found”  [Random House, 1981; Chicago, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''England, First &amp; Last''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Anthony C., “England, First &amp; Last”  [Viking, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Spaeths moved to Manhattan, ‘Tony S’ was schooled at Millbrook and Portsmouth Priory, then majored in architecture at [[Princeton University]]. After Navy service (as a corpsman, 2nd Marine Division) Spaeth learned market research and account management at Foote Cone &amp; Belding (now [[Draftfcb]]), then joined the [[Harvard Business School]] class of 1963.

In 1964, Spaeth was recruited by Lippincott &amp; Margulies (now [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|Lippincott]]), where “Corporate Identity” was first being thought through as a meaningful professional specialization. From that point on, “identity” became his primary window on marketing and management issues.

==Middle Years==
Two decades of diverse marketing work followed, including classic product management (at American Home Foods, on [[Jiffy Pop]] and [[Gulden's]] brands)… the creation of Controlled Brand Marketing Inc., in partnership with industrial designer Robert P. Gersin, to be product managers/designers for supermarket private labels… consultancy on [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]]’s marketing services team (including a key role in creation of the [[Absolut Vodka]] brand)… VP Marketing of the [[Levolor]] blinds company… and then marketing direction of several [[Citicorp]] business units.

==Identity Consulting==
Spaeth returned to undiluted identity focus in 1985, when he joined the consulting firm Anspach Grossman Portugal (whose partners he had known from Lippincott &amp; Margulies in the 60s) as director of marketing and a consulting principal. His first act was to change the firm’s descriptive tag from “Marketing Communications and Design” to “Identity Consultants,” thus naming the category in which the firm held a leadership position. Clients he served included [[American Express]] and [[Pfizer]]. He also restructured and directed the firm’s naming capability. In 1990, when AGP’s partners had sold the firm to [[WPP Group]], Spaeth established an independent consultancy.

==Tony Spaeth / Identity==
From a base in Rye, New York, since 1990 Spaeth has provided identity planning and creative counsel to scores of clients in diverse categories. He is credited with such corporate brands as [[Dow Jones]], [[Eastman Chemical]], [[Celera Genomics]], [[Flowserve]], [[Commonfund]], [[FIRST]] Robotics and [[Outward Bound USA]].

On the Web site ''[http://www.identityworks.com Identityworks.com]'' (no longer online), since 1998 Spaeth has reviewed noteworthy new identities of strategic or creative interest, with appropriate credit to chief executives and designers alike. The site also provides a variety of analytic and planning tools for branding and design students worldwide, and contains ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20091222051538/http://www.identityworks.com/forum/ Identity Forum]'', where a global panel of leading thinkers and practitioners address identity issues.

Since 1992, Spaeth’s annual rebrandings overview article has appeared in [http://www.tcbreview.com The Conference Board Review] magazine, thus providing a record covering nearly two decades (and counting) of significant identity change.

Spaeth also created and, in collaboration with consultant Tom Vanderbauwhede in Antwerp, maintains the [http://www.corporatebrandmatrix.com Corporate Brand Matrix], building a data base of rebranding case histories for students of identity change. The Matrix documents the leadership intentions in noteworthy corporate rebrandings, matched to the rebranding tools used to achieve them.

In addition to serving the identity community, Spaeth is active in alumni public service initiatives, as advisor to Princeton Project 55 and as a founding director of Partners of ’63 of the Harvard Business School, which seeks systemic improvements in America’s public education systems.

The '''U.S. Army Audit Agency''' (USAAA) provides objective and independent [[audit]]ing services to the [[United States Army]].

At the request of the Under Secretary of War, the Army Audit Agency was established on 12 November 1946 with the issuance of [[General Order No. 135]]. The Agency was placed under the jurisdiction of the Chief of Finance and tasked with maintaining appropriation and fund accounting, maintaining military property accountability, and auditing the accounts of the [[American Red Cross]].

With implementation of the DOD Reorganization Act of 1986, the Agency was placed under the sole jurisdiction of The Secretary of the Army. Subsequent General Orders made The Auditor General responsible for internal audit services throughout the Department of the Army, including audit policy, training, follow-up, and liaison with external audit organizations.

The Auditor General of the Army, The Principal Deputy Auditor General, and three Deputy Auditors General, each of whom is in charge of specific aspects of agency operations – Acquisition and Logistics Audits, Forces and Financial Audits, and Policy and Operations Management, lead the U.S. Army Audit Agency.

The Agency Headquarters is located in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Virginia and has 23 field offices—19 in the continental United States and 4 outside the continental United States (Alaska, Germany, Hawaii, and the Republic of Korea).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hqda.army.mil/aaaweb/USAAA_Strategic_Plan_FY11-15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the agency was selected to be a [[Government Performance and Results Act]] pilot agency.

The Agency is authorized 608 personnel (607 civilians and 1 military). For the most part, the audit teams are functionally aligned, but two teams have a geographic focus: Theater Operations, Europe and Theater Operations, Pacific. There is another team that works directly with deployed Army units in Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

'''William Q. Atwood''' (January 1, 1839 – December 21, 1910) was a lumber baron in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]. Born a slave in Alabama, he was freed in 1853 in the will of his white master and father, and moved to the free state of Ohio. He became active in the [[Underground Railroad]] in [[Ripley, Ohio]]. During the American Civil War, Atwood moved to the northwest, settling in [[East Saginaw, Michigan]] in 1863. There he became successful in real estate and lumber dealing.

Atwood opened a sawmill in 1874. Through his real estate and mills, he became one of the richest African Americans in Michigan. He was active in the Republican party, and served as a delegate to the [[1888 Republican National Convention]].

==Early life==
William Quincy Atwood was born a slave January 1, 1839 on the Shell Creek plantation in [[Wilcox County, Alabama]] near [[Prairie Bluff, Alabama|Prairie Bluff]]. His white father and master was Henry Styles Atwood, born March 26, 1798. His enslaved mother was born on the [[Maryland Eastern Shore]] and reared as a slave in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Alabama]]. William had a number of brothers, including Julius, John S. David, Olive, and Kossuth. Henry Atwood died in 1853 and freed his slaves in his will.

As a result, William and twenty-one other persons went north, settling in [[Ripley, Ohio]], where he attended a colored school. From 1856 to 1859 he went to Iberia school and later attended [[Berea College]]. In the fall of 1859 he went with his brother, John, to [[California]]. In California, he worked on steamboats, opened a restaurant, and did some gold mining. John returned to Ohio first, followed by William in the fall of 1861.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p651-655&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilar1990"&gt;Kilar, Jeremy W. ''Michigan's Lumbertowns: Lumbermen and Laborers in Saginaw, Bay City, and Muskegon, 1870-1905''. Wayne State University Press, 1990. p143&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley was on the Ohio River opposite [[Maysville, Kentucky]], a slave state. Atwood may have been involved in the Underground Railroad active in the area.&lt;ref name="Jezierski2000"&gt;Jezierski, John Vincent. ''Enterprising Images: The Goodridge Brothers, African American Photographers, 1847-1922''. Wayne State University Press, 2000. p221-222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career in Saginaw==
In the spring of 1862, Atwood visited [[East Saginaw, Michigan]], returning to Ripley in the fall. The ongoing [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865) made life difficult for a young African-American man who was not a soldier. In the summer of 1863, he returned to East Saginaw where he began land speculating. That year he bought and then sold sixteen hundred acres of land, profiting $4,000 on the deal. This was the start of his success in real estate in Michigan.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In winter 1868 Atwood began working in lumber, making a profit of $6,000 in the following year. He continued to cut one to five million feet of lumber until 1877.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He opened a sawmill along the Saginaw River in 1874.&lt;ref name="Kilar1990"/&gt; He took a short amount of time off, but lumbered in 1880-1882, 1885, and 1886. He marketed his lumber widely, selling wood in Toledo, Cleveland, Dayton, Cincinnati, Columbus, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, and elsewhere. He was the only black member of the Saginaw Board of Trade.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; Atwood may have played a role in preventing Saginaw African Americans from joining the [[Knights of Labor]], especially in 1885 when lumber workers in the area struck.&lt;ref&gt;Jezierski 2000, p230&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1893 Saginaw fire]], Atwood lost two houses.&lt;ref&gt;"Losses in Full", ''Detroit Free Press'' (Detroit, Michigan), 23 May 1893, p. 2, accessed November 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7461303/losses_in_full_detroit_free_press/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic and political activities==
Atwood was active in a number of civic and political activities. In 1866, Atwood was the treasurer of the East Saginaw Colored Debating Society. In May 1871, he was a supporter of the new library of the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] of East Saginaw.&lt;ref name="Jezierski2000"/&gt; In 1884, Atwood was elected at the Colored Men's State Convention to attend the [[Colored Conventions Movement|National Colored Convention]] at [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Colored Men of Michigan", ''Green Bay Advocate'' (Green Bay, Wisconsin) May 27, 1884, page 1, accessed November 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7461231/colored_men_of_michigan_green_bay/&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1886 he was a city ambassador to Grand Rapids.

He was frequently involved in Emancipation Day activities. He was a lifelong Republican&lt;ref name="Jezierski2000"/&gt; and in 1884 was nominated to be delegate-at-large from Michigan to the [[1884 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. But, only one black man was to be selected and the honor went to Detroit city councilman [[Samuel C. Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;"Political Gossip", ''Detroit Free Press'' (Detroit, Michigan) 6 September 1884, page 8, accessed December 13, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7841433/political_gossip_detroit_free_press/&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first president of the Michigan Protective League formed in 1888. With the support of the league, Atwood campaigned for presidential candidate William Henry Harrison and served as a Michigan delegate-at-large at the 1888 Republican National Convention in Chicago. The next year, the league put Atwood's name forward for the post of [[Washington, DC]] [[Recorder of Deeds]].&lt;ref&gt;Jezierski 2000, p232-233&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Atwood was again a delegate at a national convention of colored men meeting, this time, in Washington, DC&lt;ref&gt;Colored Men to Confer, Evening Star (Washington, DC) January 24, 1890, page 8, accessed November 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7461277/colored_men_to_confer_evening_star/&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1895 in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Politics Crept In, Detroit Free Press (Detroit, Michiga) December 14, 1895, page 6, accessed November 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7461336/politics_crept_in_detroit_free_press/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life, death, and legacy==
He married Charlotte Echols in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on May 15, 1872.  Charlotte was born in [[Wilkes County, Georgia]] and was a schoolteacher. They had five children, Willie, Freddie Stiles, Oliver Kossuth, Alice May, and Lottie.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; Charlotte died in 1895.&lt;ref name="Jezierski2000"/&gt;

Atwood died December 21, 1910 in at St. Mary's hospital in Saginaw of congestion of the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;"Saginaw Pioneer Dead", ''The Times Herald'' (Port Huron, Michigan) 21 December 1910, page 7, accessed November 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7461369/saginaw_pioneer_dead_the_times_herald/&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Saginaw.

*In 2002, Atwood was inducted into the Saginaw Hall of Fame&lt;ref&gt;White, Sue.
