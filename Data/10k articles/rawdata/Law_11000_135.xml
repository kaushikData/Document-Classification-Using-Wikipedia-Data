'''Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (15 October 1747 – 5 January 1813) was a Scottish advocate, judge, writer and historian who served as Professor of Universal History, and Greek and Roman Antiquities at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Life==
Tytler was born in [[Edinburgh]], the eldest son of [[William Tytler|William Tytler of Woodhouselee]] (author of ''Inquiry into the Evidence against [[Mary Queen of Scots]]'') and his wife, Ann Craig of Costerton.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1780 he was appointed joint professor of Civil History at Edinburgh University. In 1790 he became Judge Advocate of Scotland. In 1802 he became a Lord of Session in the Scottish Courts, with the judicial title Lord Woodhouselee.&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland, The Grampian Society, 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytler's other positions included [[Senator of the College of Justice]] and George Commissioner of Justiciary in Scotland.&lt;ref name="TytlerTitlePage"&gt;{{cite book

 |page= Title Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tytler was a friend of [[Robert Burns]], and prevailed upon him to remove lines from his poem [[Tam o' Shanter (Burns poem)|"Tam o' Shanter"]] which were insulting to the legal and clerical professions.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Robert Burns to Alexander Fraser Tytler, Esq., April 1791, ''The Complete Works of Robert Burns (Self-Interpreting),'' Volume IV, Gebbie &amp; Co., Philadelphia (1886), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811 he retired from his role as [[Senator of the College of Justice]] his place being filled by [[David Williamson, Lord Balgray]].

He died at his townhouse on [[Princes Street]] in [[Edinburgh]] and was buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The vault lies on the west side of the section known as the ''Covenanter's Prison'' which is generally closed to public view.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

==Family==

In 1776 he married Ann Fraser of Balnain. Their son was [[Patrick Fraser Tytler]], traveller and historian.

==Translation==
Tytler wrote a treatise that is important in the history of [[Translation#Western theory|translation theory]], the ''Essay on the Principles of Translation'' (London, 1791).&lt;ref&gt;Maymi, Protasio (1956). "General Concepts or Laws in Translation", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 13–21.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued in a 1975 book by Gan Kechao that [[Yan Fu]]'s famous translator's dictum of fidelity, clarity and elegance came from Tytler.

Tytler said that translation should fully represent the 1) ideas and 2) style of the original and should 3) possess the ease of original composition.

==Quotations on democracy==

In his Lectures, Tytler expressed a critical view of democracy in general and [[Representative democracy|representative democracies]] such as republics in particular. He believed that "a [[pure democracy]] is a chimera", and that "All government is essentially of the nature of a [[monarchy]]".&lt;ref name=Greece216&gt;Tytler, op. cit., Book 1, Chapter VI – ''Political reflections arising from the history of Greece,'' p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the [[Athenian democracy]], after noting that a great number of the population were actually enslaved, he went on to say, "Nor were the superior classes in the actual enjoyment of a rational liberty and independence. They were perpetually divided into factions, which servilely ranked themselves under the banners of the contending demagogues; and these maintained their influence over their partisans by the most shameful corruption and bribery, of which the means were supplied alone by the plunder of the public money".&lt;ref name=Greece216/&gt;

Speaking about the measure of freedom enjoyed by the people in a [[republic]] or democracy, Tytler wrote, "The people flatter themselves that they have the sovereign power. These are, in fact, words without meaning. It is true they elected governors; but how are these elections brought about? In every instance of election by the mass of a people—through the influence of those governors themselves, and by means the most opposite to a free and disinterested choice, by the basest corruption and bribery. But those governors once selected, where is the boasted freedom of the people? They must submit to their rule and control, with the same abandonment of their natural liberty, the freedom of their will, and the command of their actions, as if they were under the rule of a monarch".&lt;ref&gt;Tytler, op. cit., p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytler dismisses the more optimistic vision of [[democracy]] by commentators such as [[Montesquieu]] as "nothing better than an [[Utopia]]n theory, a splendid [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], descriptive of a state of society that never did, and never could exist; a republic not of men, but of angels", for "While man is being instigated by the love of power—a passion visible in an infant, and common to us even with the inferior animals—he will seek personal superiority in preference to every matter of a general concern".&lt;ref name=Greece219&gt;Tytler, op. cit., p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Or at best, he will employ himself in advancing the public good, as the means of individual distinction and elevation: he will promote the interest of the state from the selfish but most useful passion of making himself considerable in that establishment which he labors to aggrandize. Such is the true picture of man as a political agent”.&lt;ref name=Greece219/&gt;

However, Tytler does admit that there are individual exceptions to the rule, and that he is ready to allow "that this form of government is the best adapted to produce, though not the most frequent, yet the most striking, examples of virtue in individuals”, paradoxically because a "democratic government opposes more impediments to disinterested patriotism than any other form. To surmount these, a pitch of virtue is necessary which, in other situations, where the obstacles are less great and numerous, is not called in to exertion. The nature of a republican government gives to every member of the state an equal right to cherish views of ambition, and to aspire to the highest offices of the commonwealth; it gives to every individual of the same title with his fellows to aspire at the government of the whole”.&lt;ref&gt;Tytler, op. cit., p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytler believed that democratic forms of government such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] have a natural evolution from initial virtue toward eventual corruption and decline. In Greece, for example, Tytler argues that "the patriotic spirit and love of ingenious freedom ... became gradually corrupted as the nation advanced in power and splendour”.&lt;ref name=Greece221&gt;Tytler, op. cit., p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytler further states: "Patriotism always exists in the greatest degree in rude nations, and in an early period of society. Like all other affections and passions, it operates with the greatest force where it meets with the greatest difficulties ... but in a state of ease and safety, as if wanting its appropriate nourishment, it languishes and decays”. ... "It is a law of nature to which no experience has ever furnished an exception, that the rising grandeur and opulence of a nation must be balanced by the decline of its heroic virtues”.&lt;ref name=Greece221/&gt;

==Debatable attribution==

The following quotation has been attributed to Tytler, although it has also been occasionally attributed to [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]:&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/sorry-conservatives-de-tocqueville-did-not-call-2012-election/321393/&lt;/ref&gt;

:A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.

:The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage.

This text was popularized as part of a longer piece commenting on the [[2000 U.S. presidential election]], which began circulating on the Internet during or shortly after the election's controversial conclusion.&lt;ref name="SnopesAthenianRepublic"&gt;The Snopes.com Urban Legends Reference Pages, [http://www.snopes.com/politics/ballot/athenian.asp ''The Fall of the Athenian Republic''], accessed 21 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no reliable record of Alexander Tytler's having written any part of the text.&lt;ref name="SnopesAthenianRepublic"/&gt; In fact, it actually comprises two parts which didn't begin to appear together until the 1970s. The first paragraph's earliest known appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Tytler
|author=Loren Collins
|url=http://www.lorencollins.net/tytler.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in an op-ed piece by Elmer T. Peterson in the 9 December 1951 ''[[The Daily Oklahoman]]'', which attributed it to Tytler:

:Two centuries ago, a somewhat obscure Scotsman named Tytler made this profound observation: "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits with the result the democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing, always to be followed by a dictatorship, then a monarchy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The list beginning "From bondage to spiritual faith" is commonly known as the "Tytler Cycle" or the "Fatal Sequence". Its first known appearance was in a 1943 speech by [[Henning W. Prentiss, Jr.]], president of the Armstrong Cork Company and former president of the National Association of Manufacturers, delivered at the February 1943 convocation of the General Alumni Society of the University of Pennsylvania.  The speech was subsequently published under the titles "The Cult of Competency"&lt;ref&gt;Henning W. Prentis, [http://www.ergo-sum.net/literature/CultOfCompetency.pdf "The Cult of Competency"] (''The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle,'' University of Pennsylvania the General Alumni Society, Vol. XLV, Numb.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">An '''anti-plug molding law''' is a statute, usually a state law, that prohibits the use of an original product, such as a boat hull, as a "plug" for making a mold to use to make copies of the original product. The ''plug'' is the core around which the walls of the mold are formed and the contours of which the mold replicates in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://holoholo.org/canunews/paddle99/hullcopy.html Outrigger Hull Design Protection].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The Federal Circuit described plug molding technology in these terms, in its decision in the ''Interpart'' case, discussed below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The California plug molding statute ... proscribes use of the product itself for a pattern or "plug" in a direct molding process. In that process, the product is entirely coated with a mold-forming substance that sets and which is then removed from the product and used as the mold for making numerous replicas of the product. This process is substantially less expensive than developing a mold from scratch, something the original product manufacturer has to do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legal challenges==
[[Image:CarMirror.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Drawing from design patent on mirror involved in ''Interpart'' case]]

=== ''Interpart'' case ===
Plug molding statutes have been challenged as interfering with the federal patent system and therefore [[federal preemption|preempted]] by federal law. In 1985 in ''Interpart Corp. v. Italia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/414545 777 F.2d 678] (Fed. Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] upheld the California anti-plug molding law against a preemption challenge, when it was invoked to stop copying of an automobile rear view mirror. The court said that the law "prevents unscrupulous competitors from obtaining a product and using it as the 'plug' for making a mold." The Federal Circuit insisted that there is  no "right to copy." It therefore concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The California law does not "clash" with the federal patent law; the two laws have different objectives. ... [W]e see nothing in the federal patent statutes that conflicts with California's desire to prevent a particular type of competition which it considers unfair.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Bonito Boats'' case ===
Subsequently, in ''[[Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/489/141/case.html 489 U.S. 141 (1989)].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989 the [[United States Supreme Court]] held the Florida anti-plug molding law preempted because it partially duplicated and therefore interfered with federal patent law.&lt;ref&gt;At the time of the ''Bonito Boats'' decision there were some twelve state laws of this kind. See [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v03/03HarvJLTech167.pdf ''Preemption of Direct Molding Statutes''], 3 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 167, 175 n.3 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The decision reaffirmed the Supreme Court's earlier decision in ''[[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;376 U.S. 225 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; which held a state unfair competition law preempted on the same ground. The Supreme Court commented adversely on the ''Interpart'' decision. First, the Court brushed aside the Federal Circuit's characterization of the law as one preventing "unscrupulous" behavior:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appending the conclusionary label "unscrupulous" to such competitive behavior [i.e., copying] merely endorses a policy judgment which the patent laws do not leave the States free to make. Where an item in general circulation is unprotected by patent, reproduction of a functional attribute is legitimate competitive activity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court then turned to the Federal Circuit's rejection of a "right to copy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;For almost 100 years, it has been well established that, in the case of an expired patent, the federal patent laws do create a federal right to "copy and to use." ''Sears'' and ''Compco'' extended that rule to potentially patentable ideas which are fully exposed to the public. ... By offering patent-like protection for ideas deemed unprotected under the present federal scheme, the Florida statute conflicts with the "strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The defendant in an action in the [[High Court]] of England enters his appearance to the [[summons|writ of summons]] by delivering, either at the central office of the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]], or a [[High Court of Justice|district registry]], a written [[memorandum]] either giving his [[solicitor]]'s name or stating that he defends in person.

The ''[[Rules of the Supreme Court]]'', orders xii. and xiii., regulate the procedure with respect to the entering of an appearance, the giving of notice, the limit of [[time]], the setting aside and the general effect of default of appearance. In [[county court]]s there is no appearance other than the coming into court of the parties to the suit. In [[criminal]] cases the accused appears in person.  In [[civil cases]] infants appear by their guardians ''ad litem''; [[lunatics]] by their committee; companies by a solicitor; friendly societies by the [[trustee]] or other officer appointed to [[Lawsuit|sue]] or be sued on behalf thereof.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], a party may make a [[special appearance]] to contest the jurisdiction of the court in which a lawsuit has been brought, without thereby conceding the jurisdiction of that court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4177">In 1999, the final text of the  '''International Convention on Arrest of Ships''' was concluded, and the Convention (generally known as the '''"Arrest Convention 1999"''') came into force on 14 September 2011. 

The intent of the [[International Maritime Organization]] is that the 1999 Convention will come to replace the [[International Convention relating to Arrest of Sea-going Ships|1952 Convention]], but as of 2014 the 1999 Convention has only 11 state parties. Countries ratifying 1999 Convention to date include: Albania, Algeria, Benin, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Estonia, Latvia, Liberia, Spain, and Syria.

The new 1999 Convention follows the pattern of the 1952 Convention, but has a slightly less "Anglo-Saxon" bias.  Although a signatory in 1999 to the final text, as of May 2015, the UK has yet to ratify the convention.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeadvocate.com/ship_arrest/an_arresting_development.htm |title=An arresting development |publisher=Maritimeadvocate.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The convention broadly follows the scheme of the UK system currently enacted in the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]] (formerly the "Supreme Court Act 1981"), with some important additions. The  Senior Courts Act 1981 is broadly in line with the 1952 Brussels Convention.&lt;ref name="shlegal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shlegal.com/knowledge/publications/04_11_Arrest_Convention |title=04/11 Arrest Convention |work=shlegal.com |accessdate=11 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924101349/http://www.shlegal.com/knowledge/publications/04_11_Arrest_Convention |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While acknowledging the concept of [[maritime lien]], the 1999 Convention specifically creates no new maritime liens.

Article 1 adds new categories of "Maritime Claim".  These include "damage or threat of damage caused by the ship to the environment, coastline or related interests..." (Article 1(d)); and unpaid [[Marine Insurance|insurance premiums]] and unpaid [[Protection and indemnity insurance| P&amp;I Club calls]].&lt;ref name="shlegal.com"/&gt;

==UK arrest procedure==
Despite being a party to devising the text of the 1999 Convention, the UK has (as of April 2016) yet to ratify it, so the 1952 Convention still applies in Great Britain.

In the UK, a ship arrest is effected by an ''[[ex parte]]'' approach to the [[Admiralty court|Admiralty Court]] in the Rolls Building in Fetter Lane, London.  After an outline inquiry into the merits of the maritime claim, the Court would grant an Arrest Warrant to be executed by the [[Admiralty Marshal]].  Once appropriate security for the alleged debt, such as a Banker's Order or a  [[Protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I Club Letter of Guarantee]], was lodged, the Court could order its Marshal to release the ship.  The claim would then be examined some time later at a "hearing on the Merits", either in court or before an [[arbitrator]].  

One should distinguish between "arrest" and "detention"; the latter involves the detaining of a ship by a port  using pre-existing powers of Port State Control or, in the case of a marina, simple contractual rights of [[lien]].

The '''Australian Army Legal Corps''' (AALC)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.gov.au/our-people/corps/australian-army-legal-corps AALC]&lt;/ref&gt; consists of [[Australian Army|Regular]] and [[Australian Army Reserve|Reserve]] commissioned officers that provide specific legal advice to [[Commanding officer|commanders]] and general legal advice to all [[Military rank|ranks]]. They must be admitted to practice as Australian Legal Practitioners. 

Legal officers can specialise in operational law (such as the [[laws of war]] and [[international humanitarian law]], [[administrative law]]), and disciplinary law which is derived from the [[Defence Force Discipline Act]]. 

Legal officers can also appear on behalf of members of the [[Australian Defence Force]] charged with service offences, such as [[theft|stealing]] [[firearm]]s, although usually not those heard at [[Regimental]] or [[Battalion]] level.  They can also appear as prosecuting officers as well as assist boards of inquiry.  Promotion and level of pay is determined by experience as well as recognised levels of legal competency, which are closely associated with obtaining post-graduate qualifications, such as the [[Master of Laws]] specialising in military law through the [[Australian National University]].  Many members of the Legal Corps have been appointed as [[Queen's Counsel]] or [[Senior Counsel]], and a number have been elevated to various [[Australian court hierarchy|Australian courts]] (including county, district courts, and state supreme courts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Army Legal Corps|url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-people/Corps/Legal|website=Australian Army|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2018, [[Boeing]] and [[Embraer]] announced a [[joint venture]] for Embraer's [[airliner]]s, after [[Airbus]] acquired a majority of the competing [[Bombardier CSeries]] on October 16, 2017.

==History==

In December 2017, the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported [[Boeing]] has been in takeover talks with the 18,000 employee strong [[Embraer]], valuing it over its $3.7 billion [[market value]], awaiting [[Brazilian government]] approbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-held-takeover-talks-with-brazilian-aircraft-maker-embraer-1513874742 &lt;!-- alternate url: https://archive.is/20171221180220/https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-held-takeover-talks-with-brazilian-aircraft-maker-embraer-1513874742 --&gt; |title= Boeing Held Takeover Talks With Brazilian Aircraft Maker Embraer |author= Dana Mattioli,  Dana Cimilluca and Liz Hoffman |date= Dec 21, 2017 |work= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The two companies confirmed that a potential combination was being discussed, with a transaction subject to approval by the Brazilian government and regulators, the two companies’ boards and shareholders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= December 21, 2017 |title= Boeing and Embraer Confirm Discussions on Potential Combination}} [http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2017-12-21-Boeing-and-Embraer-Confirm-Discussions-on-Potential-Combination Boeing] and [https://embraer.com/global/en/news#/4113-boeing-and-embraer-confirm-discussions-on-potential-combination Embraer]&lt;/ref&gt;
The potential deal is seen as a reaction to the Airbus-Bombardier deal on the CSeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boeing Is in Talks for Combination With Regional-Jet Maker Embraer|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/boeing-is-said-in-talks-to-acquire-embraer-wsj-reports|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2017, Brazilian President [[Michel Temer]] said the sale of Embraer to Boeing was "out of the question", adding that the government is in favor of partnerships with the company, but warning that it will veto changes in stock control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/nao-ha-menor-cogitacao-de-transferir-controle-da-embraer-diz-temer-22221325 |author= Letícia Fernandes e Manoel Ventura |title= Capital estrangeiro na Embraer é ‘muito bem-vindo’, diz Temer |date= Dec 22, 2017 |work= O Globo Journal |language= pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 28, defense minister [[Raul Jungmann]] opposed transferring control of Embraer SA as its the defense business cannot be separated from its commercial operations, but would welcome a deal maintaining local control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/brazil-defense-ministry-opposes-giving-up-embraer-control-to-boeing-idUSKBN1EM1ET |date= Dec 28, 2017 |title= Brazil defense ministry opposes giving up Embraer control to Boeing |agency= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 2, 2018, Brazilian newspaper [[Valor Econômico]] reported that forming [[joint venture]]s, sharing costs and income in definite areas, was preferable to avoid changing control of Embraer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/boeing-talks-not-considering-change-of-control-at-embraer-paper-idUSKBN1ER0RB |date= Jan 2, 2018 |title= Boeing talks not considering change of control at Embraer: paper |agency= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embraer’s engineers could work on Boeing’s future developments, the [[Boeing New Midsize Airplane|New Midsize Airplane (NMA)]] or a [[New Small Airplane]], but it wants to control at least Embraer's airliners to avoid repeating the [[B787]] debacle: it partnered with major [[subcontractor]]s and handed them engineering work, but those weren’t up to the task, resulting in unprecedented delays, overruns of billions of dollars and Boeing was forced to buy out some.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes11jan2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeings-bid-to-buy-embraer-could-see-brazilian-engineers-work-on-the-797/ |title= Boeing’s bid to buy Embraer could see Brazilian engineers work on the 797 |date= January 11, 2018 |author= Dominic Gates |newspaper= The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2018, a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] was announced for a [[strategic partnership]]: for $3.8 billion Boeing will hold 80% of a [[joint venture]] for Embraers's [[airliner]]s and services, valued at $4.75 billion, and Embraer will own the remaining 20%.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;--&gt;
It should generate $150 million [[Corporate synergy|synergies]] by year three and add to Boeing's [[earnings per share]] from 2020.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;--&gt;
Boeing will control the new company, managed from [[Brazil]] and reporting to [[Dennis Muilenburg]], another [[Military|defense]] joint venture will market the [[KC-390]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;--&gt;
After [[negotiation]] of definitive details, [[shareholder]] and [[regulatory]] approval is expected by the end of 2019.&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;{{cite press release |title= Boeing and Embraer to Establish Strategic Aerospace Partnership to Accelerate Global Aerospace Growth |date= July 5, 2018 |author= [http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2018-07-05-Boeing-and-Embraer-to-Establish-Strategic-Aerospace-Partnership-to-Accelerate-Global-Aerospace-Growth Boeing], [https://embraer.com/global/en/news#/1206396-boeing-and-embraer-to-establish-strategic-aerospace-partnership-to-accelerate-global-aerospace-growth Embraer]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 5 memorandum [[News leak|leak]]ed in October, the deadline to finalise the transaction is set for December 5, for a closure by the end of 2019.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
Embraer would receive payments for five years before the joint venture would distribute 50% of its profits to shareholders.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
A [[Lock-up period|lock-up]] agreement would prevent Embraer or Boeing from selling their shares for 10 years.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
A [[put option]] would protect the minority stake value, allowing Embraer to sell its shares at the same price, inflation adjusted.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
The new company scope include the designs, manufacturing, certification and sales of the ERJs, E-Jets and E-Jets E2.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
Embraer will retain its executive [[business jet]] and its [[Defence industry|defence business]], but a joint venture for the KC-390 freighter will be explored.&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/embraer-boeing-agreement-lays-out-terms-of-proposed-452616/ |title= Embraer-Boeing agreement lays out terms of proposed joint venture |date= 11 Oct 2018 |author= Jon Hemmerdinger |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Political Constitution of the Republic of Bolivia''', approved on February 2, 1967, and promulgated on February 3, 1967, was the 16th constitution in the [[History of Bolivia|country's history]]. The text was drafted by the '''Bolivian Constituent Assembly of 1966-67''', which met from August 16, 1966 to February 3, 1967. The 102 assembly members included representatives of the Social Democratic Party ({{lang-es|Partido Social Demócrata}}; ''PSD'') led by Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas, the Popular Christian Movement ({{lang-es|Movimiento Popular Cristiano}}; ''MPC'') and the [[Bolivian Socialist Falange]] ({{lang-es|Falange Socialista Boliviana}}; ''FSB''). It operated under the shadow of the military dictatorship which took power in 1964.&lt;ref name=RBassemblies&gt;Rossana Barragán, "Ciudadanía y elecciones, convenciones y debates" in {{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6278">The '''China Centenary Missionary Conference''', held in 1907 in [[Shanghai, China]] commemorated 100 years of [[Protestant]] missionary work in [[China]] and debated future courses of action. Among other actions, the conference approved a resolution endorsing the exclusion from Chinese law given Chinese [[Christians]] in the [[Unequal treaty|"unequal treaties"]] imposed on China by [[Europe]]an countries, the [[United States]], and [[Japan]].  

==The Conference==

The Conference celebrated the centenary of the arrival of the first Protestant missionary to [[China]], [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]]. It was convened on April 25 and adjourned on May 8, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;The title page of the official record of the Conference states that the conference opened  5 Apr, but this is in error as the text of the report indicates. ''Chinese Centenary Missionary Conference Records'' (hereafter CCMCR). New York: American Tract Society, n.d., title page, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendees at the Conference totaled 1,170 persons, mostly missionaries from every province of China and with representatives from 25 countries. About 100 missionary organizations were operating in China, although not all were present at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;MacGillivray, D. ed. ''A Century of Protestant Missions in China''. Shanghai: American Tract Society, 1907, pp. v-vii&lt;/ref&gt; Most attendees were British and American. Despite the fact that the subject of the conference was the promotion of [[Christianity]] in China fewer than 10 Chinese can be identified among the delegates.    &lt;ref&gt;Yao, Kevin Xiyi. “At the turn of the century: a study of the China Centenary Missionary Conference of 1907". ''International Bulletin of Missionary Research''. Apr 2, 2008.,   http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-177816508.html, accessed 12 Apr 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, although missionary wives and single women missionaries outnumbered male missionaries in China, women were under-represented.  Several served on a committee related to women’s work.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton. ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur H Smith.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Congregationalist author-missionary Arthur Henderson Smith was elected co-Chairman of the Conference.]]

American missionary author and [[Congregational Church|Congregationalist]] [[Arthur Henderson Smith]] and British [[Presbyterian]] John C. Gibson were elected joint Chairmen for the Conference.  Eleven Committees presented resolutions on different subjects of interest to the delegates.

==Debate and Decisions==

The tenor of the Conference was optimistic.  The martyrdom of 189 Protestant missionaries – men, women, and children -- during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] seven years before was hardly mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Boxer Rebellion, the Chinese government had undertaken a large number of internal reforms and missionaries perceived a much greater openness by the Chinese to Western influences, including Christianity.

[[Image:1. Ament.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Missionary William Scott Ament, famous for his clash with [[Mark Twain]], headed a Committee at the Conference.]]

The missionaries celebrated their success in converting about 180,000 Chinese to Christianity during the previous 100 years.  However, a negative note was interjected into the conference by J.W. Lowrie who said that “the far larger part of this century’s sowing [i.e. spreading Christianity]... has been on fallow ground,” &lt;ref&gt;CCMCR, pp. 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; an acknowledgement that the missionaries had often been disappointed at the pace of their progress and their results.

A major objective of many at the Conference was to unite Protestant efforts into a single coordinated body rather than the diverse and often competitive efforts of many different missionary organizations.  [[William Scott Ament]] chaired the Committee of Federation and Comity which established a framework for united action.  The Conference also called for an expansion of resources devoted to education and medical work&amp;nbsp;– to the discomfort of evangelical missionaries who said that “education is not...a substitute for preaching."&lt;ref&gt;CCMCR, p.380&lt;/ref&gt;  

The most divisive and controversial issue at the Conference was the  privileges and exemptions from Chinese law given Chinese Christians under the unequal treaties.  Some missionaries wanted to forgo the protections of Chinese Christians as “a hated yoke upon the [Chinese] government” and an encouragement for unscrupulous Chinese to become Christians for personal advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Yao, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  But the majority disagreed and the resolution adopted by the Conference stated that “the time has not come when all the protection to Christian converts provided in the treaties can safely be withdrawn.”&lt;ref&gt; CCMCR, p. 743&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The missionaries at the 1907 Conference “did not see any need to make fundamental adjustments or to reorient the missionary movement in China.” Events soon proved they were short-sighted.   The optimism of the missionaries that Christianity would continue to progress in China was soon dashed as was the spirit in favor of “federation and comity.”   The [[Qing]] dynasty fell in 1911 and it was followed by an era of chaos and warlords and the increasingly hostile identification of Christianity with Western [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]]. Within 10 years the spirit of Protestant unity and cooperation coming out of the Conference was undermined by disagreement between fundamentalists and liberals. &lt;ref&gt;Yao, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26677">The '''Clean Water Rule''' is a 2015 regulation published by the [[Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)]] to clarify [[water resource management]] in the [[United States]] under a provision of the [[Clean Water Act|Clean Water Act of 1972]].&lt;ref name="CWR-FR Notice"&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). "Clean Water Rule: Definition of 'Waters of the United States'." Final Rule. ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|80|37053}}. 2015-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation defined the scope of federal water protection in a more consistent manner, particularly over [[stream]]s and [[wetland]]s which have a significant hydrological and ecological connection to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, and territorial seas. It is also referred to as the '''Waters of the United States''' rule, which defines all bodies of water that fall under U.S. federal jurisdiction. The rule was published in response to concerns about lack of clarity over its scope from legislators at multiple levels, industry members, researchers and other science professionals, activists, and citizens.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cleanwaterrule/what-clean-water-rule-does |title=What the Clean Water Rule Does |publisher=EPA |date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule has been contested in litigation. In 2017 the [[Trump administration]] announced its intent to review and rescind or revise the rule.&lt;ref name="Review-FR"&gt;USACE and EPA. "Intention To Review and Rescind or Revise the Clean Water Rule." Notice. ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|82|12532}}. 2017-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a Supreme Court ruling on January 22, 2018 that lifted a nationwide stay on the rule, the Trump administration formally suspended the rule until February 6, 2020, thereby giving EPA administrator [[Scott Pruitt]] more time to issue a draft proposal of replacement water regulations with looser regulatory requirements.&lt;ref name="Davenport-013118"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davenport |first=Coral |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/climate/trump-water-wotus.html |title=E.P.A. Blocks Obama-Era Clean Water Rule |date=2018-01-31 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key provisions==
The rule ensures that Clean Water Act (CWA) programs are more precisely defined and intends to save time and avoid costs and confusion in future implementation of the act. The rule intends to make it is easier to predict what action(s) will be taken by the EPA and what processes companies and other stakeholders may have to undergo for projects and permitting. There are no direct changes to the law under the Clean Water Rule. After analysis, the EPA and Department of the Army found that higher instance of water coverage would produce a 2:1 ratio of benefits to costs in implementation after the final rule.  Implementation of the rule will discern any implications for environmental justice communities, though it is clear that "meaningful involvement from minority, low-income, and indigenous populations, as well as other stakeholders, has been a cornerstone of development of the final rule." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/clean_water_rule_ej_report_0.pdf |title=Environmental Justice Report for the Clean Water Rule: Definition of "Waters of the United States" Under the Clean Water Act; Final Rule |date=May 2015 |publisher=EPA and USACE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Streams and Wetlands (16823822718).jpg|thumb|Infographic from the EPA, outlining the importance of extending coverage to wetlands and streams under the Clean Water Act.]]
Specific details that have been clarified by the rule are outlined below.&lt;ref name="EPA fact"/&gt;
* '''Defines more clearly the tributaries and adjacent waters that are under federal jurisdiction and explains how they are covered'''
A tributary, or upstream water, must show physical features of flowing water – a bed, bank, and ordinary high water mark – to warrant protection. The rule provides protection for headwaters that have these features and have a significant connection to downstream waters. Adjacent waters are defined by three qualifying circumstances established by the rule. These can include wetlands, ponds, impoundments, and lakes which can impact the chemical, biological or physical integrity of neighboring waters.
* '''Carries over existing exclusions from the Clean Water Act'''
All existing exclusions from longstanding agency practices are officially established for the first time. Waters used in normal agricultural, ranching, or silvicultural activities, as well as certain defined ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems continue to be excluded.
* '''Reduces categories of waters which are subject to case-by-case analysis'''
Before the rule, almost any water could be put through an analysis that remained case-specific, even if it would not be covered under CWA. The rule limits use of case-specific analysis by providing certainty and clarity of protected vs non-protected water. Ultimately the rule saves time and avoids further evaluation and the need to take the case to court.
* '''Protects US "regional water treasures"'''
Specific [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] have been shown to impact downstream water health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/46963ceebabd621905256cae0053d5c6/7724357376745f48852579e60043e88c!OpenDocument |title=Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters: A Review and Synthesis of the Scientific Evidence. |date=February 2013 |website=Science Advisory Board |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule protects [[Texas]] [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] wetlands, [[Carolina Bay|Carolina]] and [[Assawoman Bay|Delmarva]] bays, western [[vernal pool]]s in [[California]], [[pocosin]]s, and other [[prairie pothole]]s, when impacting downstream waterways.

==Background==
The Clean Water Act of 1972 is the primary piece of federal legislation regulating [[water pollution]] in the United States. Two [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions, in 2001 and 2006, interpreted a provision in the law involving non-navigable waters. The decisions casted doubt over the protection status of many streams and wetlands, which were originally thought by [[United States courts of appeals|lower courts]] and regulatory agencies to be subject to the Act. These decisions highlighted a need for the EPA and USACE to more precisely define the types of tributaries which fall under WOTUS.

=== Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers===
{{main article|Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. Army Corps of Engineers}}
The Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC), Illinois, was denied federal permits to develop an old gravel mine site into a landfill because migratory bird ponds had developed in abandoned excavation trenches on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000/99-1178 |title=Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States Army Corps of Engineers |date= |website=oyez.org |language=en-US |access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that the authority granted by CWA did not extend to abandoned gravel pits with seasonal ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. Army Corps of Engineers|531|159|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapanos v. United States ===
{{main article|Rapanos v. United States}}
In 1989, land developer John Rapanos filled {{convert|22| acres|ha|spell=on|sigfig=1}} of wetland areas on his property without a permit and against repeated warnings from his environmental consultant and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/18/us/michigan-landowner-who-filled-wetlands-faces-prison.html |title=Michigan Landowner Who Filled Wetlands Faces Prison |last=Barringer |first=Felicity |date=2004-05-18 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was convicted in 1995 of violating federal law, the conviction was later overturned and then reinstated, before ending up in the Supreme Court on appeal. In 2006 five justices agreed to void rulings against the plaintiffs, but no majority decision was reached on other aspects of the case, leaving guidelines for future wetlands jurisdiction unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Rapanos v. United States|547|715|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Following the ''SWANCC'' ruling, the EPA (then under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]) issued guidelines in 2003 restricting regulatory review of some 20 million acres of isolated wetlands and gave advance notice of proposed rulemaking which would substantially narrow the scope of WOTUS and weaken CWA protections.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II13/20160413/104791/HHRG-114-II13-Wstate-Goldman-CarterJ-20160413-SD003.pdf|title=Clean Water Rule Timeline: 2001-2016||date=|website=docs.house.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eenews.net/greenwire/stories/37257|title=Wetlands: EPA drops plan to issue new rule, opening door to more litigation|website=www.eenews.net|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After strong opposition from [[United States Congress|Congress]] the planned legislation was abandoned, to the relief of environmental advocates and disappointment of land development groups who sought a reduction in federal wetlands protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The lack of a majority opinion in the 2006 ''Rapanos'' case prompted a second set of EPA guidelines directing the agency to determine wetlands protection on a case-by-case basis. This contributed to an uptick in lawsuits for the next 8 years challenging the EPA's regulatory authority over streams and wetlands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Seeking to reduce confusion and to restore the original scope of WOTUS to pre-SWANCC levels, repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to pass the [[Clean Water Authority Restoration Act]] (CWRA) in each Congress from 2002 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Goeringer |first1=L. Paul |last2=Rumley |first2=Rusty W. |date=2011 |title=The Clean Water Authority Restoration Act: A Primer of Background Material |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/faculty/hall/EllisonChair/Water/cwara.pdf |website=National Agricultural Law Center |publisher=University of Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the EPA, under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Barack Obama administration]], proposed a new set of guidelines to replace the two issued under the Bush administration. These guidelines formed the basis of what became the Clean Water Rule. In contrast to the manner in which the 2003 and 2007 guidelines were issued, the EPA and the USACE conducted peer-reviewed hydrological studies, interagency reviews, and economic analyses before publishing a formal proposed rule on April 21, 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA and USACE (2014-04-21). "Definition of 'Waters of the United States' Under the Clean Water Act; Proposed Rule." ''Federal Register,'' {{Federal Register|79|22187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, 2015, after a public comment period and numerous meetings with state entities, public and private stakeholders, then-EPA Administrator [[Gina McCarthy]] along with Assistant Army Secretary [[Jo-Ellen Darcy]] signed the Clean Water Rule, set to become effective in August of that year.&lt;ref name="CWR-FR Notice"/&gt;

== Implications for stakeholders ==
The EPA ensures that this rule creates no additional burden for stakeholders working in agriculture since there was no change to the exemptions for activities necessary to forestry, ranching, or farming.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This rule provides clearer protection of many waters of the U.S. that, if polluted, could have detrimental effects on drinking water, habitats, and flood-prone areas. One U.S. water news organization stresses that, while this rule was an update to the CWA, there is still a need for more regulation since more than half of the nation's streams and rivers do not meet standards and most pollution issues come from [[nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint sources]], such as [[agricultural pollution|agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/2015/world/u-s-clean-water-law-needs-new-act-for-the-21st-century/ |title=U.S. Clean Water Law Needs New Act for the 21st Century |date=2015-08-20 |work=Circle of Blue |access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people, 117 million according to the EPA, rely on drinking water, in addition to many others who subside on fishing, from sources protected under the implementation of the rule.&lt;ref name="EPA fact"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/fact_sheet_summary_final_1.pdf |title=Fact Sheet: Clean Water Rule|date= |publisher=EPA |access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-income communities and communities of color are more often at risk of being affected by pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morello-Frosch |first=Rachel |last2=Zuk |first2=Miriam |last3=Jerrett |first3=Michael |last4=Shamasunder |first4=Bhavna |last5=Kyle |first5=Amy D. |date=2011-05-01 |title=Understanding The Cumulative Impacts Of Inequalities In Environmental Health: Implications For Policy |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/5/879 |journal=Health Affairs |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=879–887 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0153|issn=0278-2715 |pmid=21555471}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been evidenced that, "states conduct fewer regulatory enforcement actions in counties with higher levels of poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Konisky |first=David M. |date=2009-12-01 |title=Inequities in enforcement?

While there are no direct implications for [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]], tribal communities were consulted during the process of finalizing the Clean Water Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/clean_water_rule_tribal_summary.pdf|title=Final Summary of Tribal Consultation for the Clean Water Rule: Definition of "Waters of the United States" Under the Clean Water Act; Final Rule |date=May 2015|publisher=EPA |access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate, revised interpretive rule to the Clean Water Act, section 518, determined tribal lands should be treated as states and was made effective in May 2016. This amendment is important for giving people living on reservations access to EPA regulation and federal grants; tribes no longer need to "demonstrate inherent authority to regulate" their waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/16/2016-11511/revised-interpretation-of-clean-water-act-tribal-provision |title=Revised Interpretation of Clean Water Act Tribal Provision |date=2016-05-16 |work=Federal Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation at the state level is determined by the strength of federal coverage and some stakeholders consider the rule to be overreach by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wateronline.com/doc/how-the-clean-water-rule-flows-from-the-top-0001 |title=How The Clean Water Rule Flows From The Top |last= |first= |date= |website=Water Online |access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is concern from private landowners, including small business owners and farmers, that this "rule will lead to radical environmental groups suing homeowners and small businesses," and, ultimately, "increased regulatory costs, less economic development, fewer jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/in-the-news?ID=870AD2FF-CBFE-B71E-4C41-C44B7A8B4130 |title=Vitter Summary Statement for New Orleans Field Briefing on EPA's Proposed Waters Rule |work=U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works |access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal challenges and opposition ==
=== Partisan and industry opposition ===
Government regulation and protection of fresh water supplies and watershed health is frequently perceived on the political right as a burden on economic growth and an infringement of landowner rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/epa-waterways-wetlands-rule-118319 |title=Obama's water war |work=Politico |access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clean Water Rule was part of a larger mobilization by the Obama administration to ingrain the presidency with an environmental legacy, which Republicans have viewed as an “over-reach” of executive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/us/politics/obama-set-to-strengthen-federal-role-in-clean-water-regulation.html |title=Obama Plans New Rule to Limit Water Pollution |last=Davenport |first=Coral |date=2015-05-22 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pushback against the Clean Water Rule also include some Democrats from "farm and energy states".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some state and local governments also consider the Clean Water Rule an unconstitutional over-reach violating federalism principles and due process provisions outlined in the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] amendments respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/environment/video-epa-clean-water-rule-draws-fire-from-murkowski/ |title=Video: EPA Clean Water Rule Draws Fire From Murkowski |website=Indian Country Today |publisher=Indian Country Media Network |location=Verona, NY |date=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/246435-three-states-sue-to-stop-obama-water-rule |title=States sue to block Obama's water rule |last=Cama |first=Timothy |date=2015-06-29 |work=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal objections could also be raised on the principle that the Clean Water Act itself violates the [[Commerce Clause]] of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.stoel.com/controversial-new-clean-water-rule-unlikely-to-significantly-change-regulatory-status-quo |title=Controversial New Clean Water Rule Unlikely to Significantly Change Regulatory Status Quo |last1=Beaton |first1=Kevin J. |last2=Campbell |first2=Michael R. |last3=Miliband |first3=Wesley A. |date=2015-05-05 |website=Stoel Rives, LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2017, the [[Business Roundtable]] provided a list of federal regulations to the Trump administration which it wished to have reviewed for repeal or major reform; the Clean Water Rule was among the "wishlist" of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3480299-10-Examples-Industries-Push-Followed-by-Trump.html#document/p54/a341316 |title=Trump-Era Trend: Industries Protest.

Morgan Chase]], [[Honeywell]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and [[Dow Chemical Company]].

=== Federal stay ===
After thirteen states sued to block the rule, U.S. Chief District Judge for North Dakota [[Ralph R. Erickson]] issued a preliminary injunction in 2015, hours before the rule was to take effect, blocking regulation in those states.&lt;ref name=Cama1&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/252140-judge-blocks-obamas-water-rule |title=Federal judge blocks Obama’s water rule |last=Cama |first=Timothy |date=2015-08-27 |work=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate case, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court]] temporarily halted implementation of the 2015 Rule by issuing a nationwide stay on October 9, 2015, which was the day before the rule was supposed to come into effect.&lt;ref name=Cama2&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/256493-court-blocks-obamas-water-rule-nationwide|title=Court blocks Obama’s water rule nationwide |last=Cama |first=Timothy |date=2015-10-09 |work=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Circuit's decision was overturned on January 22, 2018 when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] issued a unanimous decision that the [[United States courts of appeals|appeals courts]] do not have original jurisdiction to review challenges to the [[Clean Water Act]] and, therefore, lack the authority to issue a stay. Rather, challenges to the 2015 Rule must be filed in [[United States district courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Petersen |first1=Rafe |last2=Heishman |first2=Aaron S. |url=https://www.hklaw.com/publications/supreme-court-makes-jurisdictional-determination-on-clean-water-act-rule-02-02-2018/ |title=Supreme Court Makes Jurisdictional Determination on Clean Water Act Rule |date=2018-02-02 |publisher=Holland &amp; Knight |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future under Trump administration ==
The selection of [[Scott Pruitt]] to head the EPA was widely viewed by both supporters and detractors as a signal of Trump's intent to dismantle key environmental regulation enacted under Obama.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/us/scott-pruitt-trump-epa-pick.html |title=Scott Pruitt, Trump’s E.P.A.

In January 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear [[National Association of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense]], a case that will determine which court will decide matters related to the definition of ''Waters of the United States''. Trump EPA nominee [[David Ross (lawyer)|David Ross]] represented Wyoming in an antecedent lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Dakota v.

On February 28, 2017, [[Donald Trump|President Trump]] signed an executive order directing EPA to review the Clean Water Rule for conflicts with his economic growth agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/28/presidential-executive-order-restoring-rule-law-federalism-and-economic|title=Presidential Executive Order on Restoring the Rule of Law, Federalism, and Economic Growth by Reviewing the "Waters of the United States" Rule |date=2017-02-28 |publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2017 the Trump administration announced its intent to review and rescind or revise the rule.&lt;ref name="Review-FR"/&gt; The Trump administration's choice for the EPA water chief, [[David Ross (lawyer)|David Ross]], represented the state of Wyoming in 2015 in a lawsuit against the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s interpretation of the ''Waters of the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Dakota v.

In January 2018 EPA formally suspended the 2015 regulation and announced plans to issue a new version later in 2018.&lt;ref name="Davenport-013118"/&gt; Fifteen states, two cities and several environmental organizations have challenged EPA's suspension in several lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gstalter |first=Morgan |date=2018-04-05 |title=15 AGs sue Trump EPA for not enforcing pollution controls |url= http://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/381824-15-state-ags-sue-trump-epa-for-not-enforcing-pollution-controls |work=The Hill |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Petersen |first=Bo |date=2018-04-06 |title=Clean water lawsuit to stay in Charleston, federal judge rules |url=https://www.postandcourier.com/news/clean-water-lawsuit-to-stay-in-charleston-federal-judge-rules/article_61292fb6-3908-11e8-a39a-ef7c0ecb1ac8.html |work=The Post and Courier |location=Charleston, SC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{canon law}}
The '''Defender of the Bond''', or '''Defensor Matrimonii''' in Latin, is a [[Catholic Church]] official whose duty is to defend the marriage bond in the procedure prescribed for the hearing of matrimonial causes which involve the validity or nullity of a marriage already contracted.

==History==
[[Benedict XIV]], by his [[papal bull|Bull]] ''Dei Miseratione'' of 3 November 1741, introduced this official into the marriage procedure to guard against abuses occurring from the ordinary procedure. An annulment of a marriage might result from the appearance of only the spouse who desired freedom to enter upon a new marriage, while the other was apathetic and conniving at the annulment, or at times unable or indisposed to incur expense to uphold the marriage, especially if it required an appeal to a higher court. Scandal arose from the frequency of dissolution of marriages with the freedom to enter new contracts.

==Qualifications and Obligations==
The Bull requires that in each [[diocese]], the ordinary appoint a defender of marriage, upright in character, and learned in the law, an ecclesiastic if possible, a layman if necessary. The bishop may suspend him or remove him for cause, and, if he is prevented from taking part in the procedure, substitute another with the requisite qualifications. 
===Proceedings in First Instance===
He must be summoned to any trial in which there is question, before a competent judge, of the validity or nullity of a marriage, and any proceeding will be null if he is not duly cited. He must have the opportunity to examine the witnesses, and, orally or in writing, to bring forward whatever arguments may favour the validity of the marriage. He must be cited even though the party interested in the defence of the marriage be present, and all the acts of the court are always to be accessible to him, and at any time he has a right to bring forward new documents or witnesses favourable to the marriage. On assuming his office he must take an oath to fulfill his duties and he is expected to renew the oath in each case. If the judge decides in favour of the marriage the defender takes no further action unless its opponent appeals to a higher court. Here a defender undertakes anew the defence of its validity. If the judge of the first instance decides against the validity of the marriage and no one else appeals, the defender of marriage has the right to appeal to the higher court. If he feels it his duty to appeal, a new marriage may not be contracted until his plea is heard. 

This canon legislation was extended and enforced in the United States by an Instruction of Propaganda in 1883, published with the ''Acts and Decrees of the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore#Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884)|Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]].'' Though the Bull does not require it, the practice of the Roman church extends the intervention of the defender to cases of [[ratum sed non consummatum|true marriages not consummated]] where the Holy See is requested to grant a [[dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]] for a new marriage.

===Proceedings in Second Instance===
The obligation of the defender to appeal from the decision of first instance adverse to the validity of a marriage has been modified by the [[Holy See]] in several cases where the invalidity depends upon facts indisputably proven. Where the decree "[[Tametsi]]" of the Council of Trent was binding, requiring the presence of the parish priest for the validity, if only a civil ceremony was used, the bishop may declare the marriage null without the participation of the defender. In view of new matrimonial law contained in the decree "Ne Temere" of [[Pius X]] this also holds anywhere if a marriage is attempted only before a civil authority or non-Catholic minister of religion. Yet if an ecclesiastical form had been used, and the nullity from clandestinity was questioned, the presence of the defender is required; but if the [[Clandestinity (in Canon Law)|impediment of clandestinity]] clearly appears he need not appeal. This is true also if, through absence of ecclesiastical dispensation, there is an impediment of [[Disparity of Worship|disparity of worship]], or of [[consanguinity]], or of [[Affinity (canon law)|affinity]] from lawful intercourse, or of spiritual relationship, or of certain previous legitimate marriage still existing. In these cases the ordinary may, with the participation of the defender, declare the marriage null, and the defender is not required to appeal. This, however, was declared by the [[Holy Office]] (27 May 1901) to be understood only of cases in which certainly and clearly the impediment is proven; otherwise the defender must proceed to the higher court. The defender is exhorted to exercise his office gratuitously, but he may be compensated from fees imposed by the court or from other diocesan resources.

Briefs submitted to the tribunal by the Defender of the Bond are considered part of the "acts" of the case and the parties have a right to view and comment on the acts before the decision is made by  the judge(s). (&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Art. 241 &amp; 242 and Art. 229§2&lt;/ref&gt;)

The '''Edict on Maximum Prices''' ([[Latin]]: ''Edictum	de Pretiis Rerum Venalium'', "Edict Concerning the Sale Price of Goods"; also known as the '''Edict on Prices''' or the '''Edict of Diocletian''') was issued in 301 by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]].

The Edict was probably issued from [[Antioch]] or [[Alexandria]] and was set up in [[inscription]]s in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. It now exists only in fragments found mainly in the eastern part of the empire, where Diocletian ruled. However, the reconstructed fragments have been sufficient to estimate many prices for goods and services for historical economists (although, it should be stressed, the Edict attempts to set maximum prices, not fixed ones).

The '''Edict on Maximum Prices''' is still the longest surviving piece of legislation from the period of the [[Tetrarchy]]. The Edict was criticized by [[Lactantius]], a [[rhetoric]]ian from [[Nicomedia]], who blamed the emperors for the inflation and told of fighting and bloodshed that erupted from price tampering.

By the end of Diocletian's reign in 305, the Edict was for all practical purposes ignored. The Roman economy as a whole was not substantively stabilized until Constantine's coinage reforms in the 310s.

== History ==
During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], [[Roman coins|Roman coinage]] had been greatly [[debasement|debased]] by the numerous emperors and [[Roman usurpers|usurpers]] who minted their own coins, using [[Base metal|base metals]] to reduce the underlying metallic value of coins used to pay soldiers and public officials.

Earlier in his reign, as well as in 301 around the same time as the Edict on Prices, Diocletian issued Currency Decrees, which attempted to reform the system of taxation and to stabilize the coinage.

It is difficult to know exactly how the coinage was changed, as the values and even the names of coins are often unknown or have been lost in the historical record. The Roman Empire was awash with other coins from outside of the Empire – especially in the Mediterranean. The implied coinage changeover time was at least a decade.

Although the decree was nominally successful for a short time after it was imposed, market forces led to more and more of the decree being disregarded and reinterpreted over time.

== Mechanics ==
The full mechanics of the decree have been lost. No full decree has been found, as it exists only in fragments. However, enough of the decree's text is known for the following to be understood to be true.

All coins in the Decrees and the Edict were valued according to the ''[[denarius]]'', which Diocletian hoped to replace with a new system based on the silver ''[[argenteus]]'' and its fractions (although some modern writers call this the "denarius communis", this phrase is a modern invention, and is not found in any ancient text). The ''argenteus'' seems to have been set at 100 ''denarii'', the silver-washed ''[[nummus]]'' at 25 ''denarii'', and the bronze radiate at 4 or 5 denarii. The copper laureate was raised from 1 ''denarius'' to 2 ''denarii''. The gold ''[[aureus]]'' was revalued at at least 1,200 ''denarii'' (although one document calls it a "solidus" it was still heavier  than the ''solidus'' introduced by [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] a few years later).

During the previous decades the decreasing amount of silver in the  billon  coins had fuelled [[inflation]]. This inflation is understood to be the reason the decree was issued. Issues of economic system feedback were not well understood at the time.

The first two-thirds of the Edict doubled the value of the copper and billon coins, and set the [[death penalty]] for [[profiteering (business)|profiteers]] and [[speculation|speculators]], who were blamed for the inflation and who were compared to the [[barbarian]] tribes attacking the empire. Merchants were forbidden to take their goods elsewhere and charge a higher price, and transport costs could not be used as an excuse to raise prices.

The last third of the Edict, divided into 32 sections, imposed a [[price ceiling]] – a list of ''maxima'' – for well over a thousand products. These products included various food items (beef, grain, wine, beer, sausages, etc.), clothing (shoes, cloaks, etc.), freight charges for sea travel, and weekly wages. The highest limit was on one pound of [[Tyrian_purple|purple]]-dyed [[silk]], which was set at 150,000 ''denarii'' (the price of a [[lion]] was set at the same price).

== Outcome ==
The Edict did not solve all of the problems in the economy. Diocletian's mass minting of coins of low metallic value continued to increase inflation, and the maximum prices in the Edict were apparently too low.

Merchants either stopped producing goods, sold their goods illegally, or used [[barter (economics)|barter]]. The Edict tended to disrupt trade and commerce, especially among merchants. It is safe to assume that a gray market economy evolved out of the edict at least between merchants.

Sometimes entire towns could no longer afford to produce trade goods. Because the Edict also set limits on wages, those who had fixed salaries (especially soldiers) found that their money was increasingly worthless as the artificial prices did not reflect actual costs.

Its origins came in the middle of the [[19th century]].

==Characteristics==

Euroslavists promote cooperation among Slavs on equal terms in order to resist [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] tendencies from [[Western Europe]] and the dominant position of [[Germany]] within the EU. Typical is strong encouragement of [[democracy]] and democratic values. Their view is that every state has the right to decide whether to become a member of the [[European Union]]. They oppose the exclusion of Russia from the European [[Culture of Europe|cultural area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lukeš| first = Igor| title = Czechoslovakia between Stalin and Hitler| publisher = Oxford University Press| place = New York| year = 1996| isbn = 0-19-510266-5| page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer term they believe it possible to create a united Slavic community without Russian dominance.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt;

The '''Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality''' is a post in the [[European Commission]]. The current commissioner is [[Věra Jourová]].

==Portfolio==

The post was created in 2010 by splitting the previous [[List of European Commission portfolios#Justice, Freedom and Security|Justice, Freedom and Security]] portfolio into a justice post (the subject covered here) and a security post: the [[List of European Commission portfolios#Home Affairs|Commissioner for Home Affairs]]. This split was made as a concession to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (European Parliament group)|liberals]] in the [[European Parliament]] to gain their support for the second [[Barroso Commission]].

A major innovation of the [[Juncker Commission]] is the nomination of a First Vice-President, [[Frans Timmermans]], for Better Regulation, Inter-Institutional Relations, Rule of Law and the [[EU Charter of Fundamental Rights]]. His role includes to "guide and coordinate all other Justice and Home Affairs(JHA)-related Commissioners, in particular those of the new DG Justice ([[Věra Jourová]]) and the DG Home Affairs ([[Dimitris Avramopoulos]])".&lt;ref name="Carrera"&gt;[http://www.ceps.eu/system/files/Essay%20S%20Carrera%20and%20E%20Guild%20A%20New%20Commission%20a%20New%20JHA%20Policy.pdf Carrera, S. and Guild, E. (2014) "The Juncker Commission: A New Start for EU Justice and Home Affairs Policy?", CEPS Essay]&lt;/ref&gt;

The portfolio of the Commissioner has evolved under the [[Juncker Commission]] and renamed into ''Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality''. Major changes are : 
*"The Commissioner for Justice no longer holds the title [of "Commissioner for EU Citizenship"] that was used in the previous Commission. [...] Other citizenship-related matters regarding ‘communication to citizens’ have been moved from DG Communication and attributed to the new [[European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Citizenship|Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Citizenship]]."&lt;ref name="Carrera"/&gt;
*"Issues related to non-discrimination in employment [and the rights of persons with disabilities] have been removed from DG JUST and placed back under DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. However, DG JUST still holds responsibility for the wider non-discrimination portfolio."&lt;ref name="Carrera"/&gt; 
*DG JUST gained competences on issues related to Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility, previously in DG Internal Market and Services (MARKT), and on issues related to Consumer Affairs. Regarding Consumer Affairs, the whole directorate has been transferred from DG Health and Consumers (SANCO) - now DG Health and Food Safety (SANTE), except for Health Technology and Cosmetics issues, for which DG Enterprise and Industry (ENTR) gained responsibility.&lt;ref name="Carrera"/&gt;
*The responsibility of Anti-Drug Policy has been transferred to DG Home Affairs (HOME).&lt;ref name="Carrera"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12352">'''Federal Indian policy''' establishes the relationship between the United States Government and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian Tribes]] within its borders. The Constitution gives the federal government primary responsibility for dealing with tribes. Some scholars divide the federal policy toward Indians in six phases: coexistence (1789–1828), removal and reservations (1829–1886), assimilation (1887–1932), reorganization (1932–1945), termination (1946–1960), and self-determination (1961–1985).&lt;ref&gt;David R. Wrone, "Indian Treaties and the Democratic Idea," ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' (1986) 70#2 pp. 83–106&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Trade and Intercourse era==
[[File:Gilbert Stuart Williamstown Portrait of George Washington.jpg|thumb|right|The original Nonintercourse Act was signed by President [[George Washington]].]]
[[File:Joseph Ferdinand Keppler01.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Indian policy was riddled with fraud. Here a peace commissioner offers torn ("ventilated") blankets, an empty rifle case, and 50 sides of spoiled beef, ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'' of 18 September 1873]]

The [[Nonintercourse Act|Indian Intercourse Act]] of 1790 marked the beginning of the Trade and Intercourse era. This act established that no sales of Indian lands were to be made between any persons or states unless the sale was authorized by the United States. The United States federal government was then granted management of trade and diplomatic relations that involved Indians and their lands. The main goal of establishing the Trade and Intercourse Act was to keep peace on the frontier and avoid war with the Natives.
During the Trade and Intercourse Era, the Natives were also included within the United States government, to some degree, by the establishment of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) within the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in 1824. However, land disputes and law jurisdiction cases began to appear frequently in the [[United States Supreme Court]].{{Which|date=March 2017}} It was concluded that "discovery also gave the discoverer the exclusive right to extinguish Indian title either by 'purchase or by conquest'."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Natives were recognized only as occupants of the land, and not owners.

==Treaties==
[[File:Indiana Indian treaties.svg|thumb|right|250px|Indiana Indian treaties]]
The federal government was in charge of relations with the Indians, and the procedure was to use the treaty making power of the president and the Senate to make formal arrangements. Over 200 treaties were agreed upon by 1840. Gatlin argues that treaties established a procedure that benefited both parties. The federal government was primarily interested in guaranteeing that Indian lands did not fall into private hands, and that it handled all negotiations with the tribes. These negotiations, says Gatlin, strengthened the tribes sense of unity and leadership. The land sales gave the Indians a steady flow of income, and guarantees of federal financial, medical, and educational aid.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Gatlin, Private Diplomacy to Private Property: States, Tribes and Nations in the Early National Period," ''Diplomatic History '' (1997) 22:1 pp 85-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the treaties remain in effect and are of special importance regarding federal recognition of tribal status, hunting and fishing rights, rights to protection of sacred properties, rights to water and minerals, and land claims.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Harmon, ed., ''The Power of Promises: Rethinking Indian Treaties in the Pacific Northwest'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Cleland, ''Faith in Paper: The Ethnohistory and Litigation of Upper Great Lakes Indian Treaties'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Faith-Paper-Ethnohistory-Litigation-Treaties/dp/0472117297/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal courts have a long, continuous history of litigation on these issues. The Supreme Court endorsed the procedure, with over 300 decisions making reference to Indian treaties after 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Bernholz, "American Indian treaties and the Supreme Court: A guide to treaty citations from opinions of the United States Supreme Court," ''Journal of Government Information'' (2004) 30#2/3 pp 318-431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Westward expansion and Indian relocation==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2018}}
During the early 19th century, as the eastern settlers of the United States felt the desire to explore westward, the natives were caught in the middle of things. Eastern Indian tribes were forced out of their homelands to barren areas that contained fruitless soils, though they had a prosperous relationship beforehand. The reason given to justify the Indian removal stated by [[Thomas Jefferson]] was to, "give them a space to live undisturbed by white people as they gradually adjust to civilized ways".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Though a problem occurred where westward expansion was on the rise and areas in the west were becoming full with settlers and the lands that Natives resided on (Nebraska and Kansas territories) ended up being taken from them by the government and given to settlers. Treaties were signed by the natives of the area, stating they accepted the downsized reservations or allotments, although their allotments were usually sold to the white settlers by force.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The outcome of this removal devastated the Natives, and cost them their tribal identity and independence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Allotment and assimilation era (1887–1943)==
{{see also|Cultural assimilation of Native Americans#Americanization and assimilation (1857–1920)}}
In 1887, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[General Allotment Act]], which is considered one of the earliest attempts aimed toward [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|assimilation]] of Native tribes. This act intended to give Natives a sense of land ownership as well as integrate an agricultural lifestyle with the tribes, much like that of the [[United States|Americans]] and [[European ethnic groups|European]]s. Under the General Allotment Act, tribal lands were no longer under the control of tribal governments; instead, the land was under the control of individual land owners.

This period of allotment over tribal lands became known as the "allotment and assimilation era", mainly because the main goal of allotting tribal land was to Americanize Native peoples into mainstream society. The notion that Native peoples could live their lives according to traditional practices and teachings on the reservation was forbidden; thus, assimilation became the [[epitome]] of federal Indian policy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The BIA was used during this time to keep a commanding hold of all aspects of Native life, thus upholding the goal of "civilizing" natives.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The Allotment era resulted in the loss of over two thirds of tribally entrusted lands from 138 million [[acres]] (558,000&amp;nbsp;km²) in 1871 to 48 million acres (190,000&amp;nbsp;km²) in 1934. This was mainly due to leasing, and eventually selling, tribal lands to white settlers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Allotment did not work, because it was not something Indians were used to.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} They did not view the land as something to own. Instead, they viewed it as their home.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Termination and relocation (1945–1960)==
{{main|Indian termination policy}}

Between the end of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] era and the beginning of the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, less traditional Native Americans, congressional leaders, and government administrators, developed a policy that they hoped would integrate the Indian population with mainstream America. To this end, they enacted laws to terminate the government's trusteeship of Indian lands and relocate Indians to the nation's cities. They believed that once Indians left the reservation, they would have opportunities for education, employment and assimilation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}..

==Tribal self-determination era==
In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy wanted the Indian tribes to be recognized as independent nations governing themselves. He promised the Indian tribes that treaties made prior to 1960 would be recognized by the federal government and that their rights as Indian people would be protected.

This was realized when the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) was passed in 1971. The ANCSA allowed for the Alaskan Natives to be given {{convert|40|e6acres|km2|abbr=unit}} of land, federal payments of 462.5 million dollars over eleven years, and another 500 million dollars to help with mineral development in Alaska. All this was in exchange for the Alaskans giving up their claim to the land. The act also allowed the Alaskan tribe to have freedom from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

In the 1960s, there were many acts passed, geared to helping the Indian tribes. Indian tribes benefited greatly from these because it gave them rights within both the tribal and federal government. In 1968, the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]] was passed. It recognized the Indian tribes as sovereign nations with the federal government.

In the 1970s, one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed through Congress. The [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975]] allowed tribes to have more tribal control over federally subsidized programs for Indians. Another important act passed by Congress was the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]], passed in 1978, which granted tribal government jurisdiction over child custody and adoption on the reservation.

The '''''Fordham Environmental Law Review''''' is a triannual [[law journal]] published by students at [[Fordham University School of Law]], addressing topics in [[environmental law]], [[legislation]], and [[public policy]]. It was established in 1989 as the '''''Fordham Environmental Law Report''''' and changed in 1993 to the '''''Fordham Environmental Law Journal'''''. In 2004, the journal obtained its current name and has established itself as one of the most prestigious journals at [[Fordham University School of Law]]. The journal sponsors an annual symposium. Notably, the [[law journal]] is the only [[law journal]] at [[Fordham University School of Law]] that allows first year law students to apply during their fall semester to become staff members of the [[law journal]]. This allows first year law students to gain a competitive advantage when seeking out internships, while learning the unique skills required of staff members of a [[law journal]]. The current Editor-in-Chief is Natalie Jensen, the Managing Editor is Vincent Nguyen, and the Executive Editor is Jenna Carroll.

The '''Gwangmu Reform''' (광무개혁,光武改革, ''Gwangmu Gaehyeok'') was a chain of events that was aimed at modernizing and westernizing the [[Korean Empire]] as a late starter in the [[industrial revolution]]. The reform that took place during the Gwangmu Era from 1897 to 1907 showed, in the long term, Korean potential for starting and continuing modernisation, even in the face of adversity. This sort of development was unseen until the [[Chang Myon|Myon Chang]]-era of the 1960s and 70s. The Gwangmu reform of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]] later staged the fundamental background for future Korean development by building infrastructure, reforming the economy and creating the nucleus of the modern [[bureaucracy]] and military.

==Reforms==

===Abolition of the status system===
Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]] proclaiming the abolition of the status system, the loyalists’ cabinet was formed in 1896. The new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One of these was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists’ cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894-1910''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most Koreans by that time had surnames and even [[bongwan]], a substantial number of [[cheonmin]], which mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Baekjeong|untouchables]] still did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters’ surnames, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''Inmin''(people) and later, ''Kungmin''(citizen).&lt;ref name="proper"/&gt;
[[Image:Koreansoldiers1898.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The modernised army of the Korean Empire.]]

===Lifestyle===
During the Gwangmu period, Western-style official [[uniform]]s were introduced in Korea. At the start, the Korean Emperor had begun to wear [[Prussian]]-style royal attire along with Korean diplomats, who wore Western suits. In 1900, Western attire became the official uniform for the Korean civil officials. Several years later, all Korean soldiers and policemen were required to wear Western style uniforms.

===Military===

In the military sphere, the Korean army as it existed in the early 1890s consisted of about 5,000 soldiers and was increased to an immense amount of 28,000 right before the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Training by Russian officers beginning in 1896 led to the organization of a 1,000-strong royal bodyguard armed with [[Berdan rifle]]s that served as the core of an improved army. From this core unit, soldiers were sometimes transferred to other units, which included five regiments of about 900 men each.{{sfn|Keltie|1900|p=791}}

===Finance===
[[File:Office of Crown Property.jpg|thumb|160px|left|The building of Office of Crown Property under Imperial Household Ministry of the Korean Empire.]]
In 1897, the [[cadastral]] survey project was launched by the Gwangmu government, aiming at modernizing the [[landownership]] system. In order to apply Western surveying methods, U.S. surveyors were hired. After the survey, a property title “Jigye”, showing the exact dimension of the land, were supposed to be issued by the authorities concerned. That reform was closely involved to the reform of land tax system, which was conducted under the leadership of Yi Yong-ik, who also carried out the monetary reforms in Korea. The project was interrupted due to the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1904 and 1905, after having finished about two-thirds of the whole land.

===Infrastructures===
[[Image:Chongno1905.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Seoul, capital city of the Korean Empire in 1905, showing contrast between tradition and modernity.]]
[[File:Streetcar1903.jpg|thumb|160px|left|A streetcar in Seoul, 1903.]]
In that time, modern urban [[infrastructures]] were built by the Gwangmu government. In 1898, Gwangmu Emperor authorized the creation of a [[joint venture]] with American businessmen. In consequence, [[Hanseong Electric Company]], operating a public electrical lightning network and an electric [[streetcar]] system was founded. And Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company had an American connection as well. In 1902, six years after the first introduction of telephone in Korea, the first long-distance public phone was installed.

===Industries===

During the Gwangmu period, the industrial promotion policy was also conducted by the Korean government. It gave support to found technical and industrial schools. In that time, along with modernized weaving factories which were established to meet demand for [[textiles]] on the domestic market, technological innovations in the field of weaving industry occurred in Korea. For instance, spinning and weaving machines were made for producing [[silk]], so as to be substituted for high-cost machines from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Jae-gon Cho ''The Industrial Promotion Policy and Commercial Structure of the Taehan Empire.'' Seoul: Jimoondang Publishing Company (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

[[File:Severance Hospital in 1904.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The building of Jejungwon (Severance) Hospital in 1904.]]
After [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]] proclaimed a new education law, elementary schools were established by the government. Along with these modern [[state school|public schools]], a number of Western-style schools, consisting of elementary and/or [[secondary education]] section(s), were established by Western missionaries.

During the Gwangmu period, modern secondary schools were opened by the Korean government as well, along with private secondary schools established by rich Korean civilians or Korean modern intellectuals. And several years later, modern [[higher education]] was first introduced to Korea: In 1904, the [[Jejungwon]](Severance Hospital) in Seoul, added Severance Hospital Medical School and the attached School of Nursing. In 1905, [[Korea University#Bosung College|Bosung College]] was established under [[Yi Yong-ik]], Chief of the Imperial Treasury: the Commerce Department and the Law Department were the first two departments of the college. The Soongsil Academy, started at Pyongyang in 1897, had opened a college section in 1905 and was authorized as the [[Soongsil University]] by the Korean government in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Hiroshi (1971), ''Higher Learning in Korea under Japanese Rule'' The Developing Economies, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Education Ordinance of 1911 issued by Japanese [[Governor-General of Korea]], however, these institutions lost college status.
During the period of 1885-1910, a total of 796 schools, from elementary to college levels, were established and maintained by the Western missionaries. This is a significant number in that it comprises about thirty-five percent of the entire number of formal schools (2,250) in the Korean Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Insoo Sohn, ''History of Korean Education'', 2 vols. (Seoul Muneumsa,1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hospital during the Korean Empire.jpg|thumb|210px|left|The Taehan Hospital built in 1907 by order of the [[Japanese Resident-General of Korea]] [[Itō Hirobumi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=서울대병원-연세대병원 '역사 전쟁' 시작됐다 |trans-title=Seoul National University Hospital, Yonsei hospital 'history wars' began. |date=August 21, 2006 |publisher=Pressian Coop. |url=http://www.pressian.com/news/article.html?no=33163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East meets West in downtown architecture - Foreigner-designed buildings |date=May 2, 2011 |publisher=JoongAng Ilbo |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2935570}} Yabashi Genji is incorrect. [[:ja:矢橋賢吉Yabashi Kenkichi]] is correct.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Health care system===

The modern [[health care system]] in Korea had been formed for about 30 years since opening the country in 1876. Most of the system had been achieved during the Gwangmu Reform period directed by the Emperor and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Shin, S.I. Hwang (1996). ''The Historical Interpretation on the Formation of the Modern Health Care System in Late Choson.''&lt;/ref&gt; The new system consisted of three sectors: public health, medical care, and monitoring of private practitioners and drug-sellers. The Sanitary Board was set to provide systematic public health care such as [[vaccination]], [[sanitation]] and [[quarantine]] and the police were created to enforce many sanitary affairs. Hospitals for Western medicine were established in the medical care sector. Licensing for herbal doctors and pharmacists was taken in order to control the quality of private practitioners.

This article concerns the '''history of [[British nationality law]]'''.

== Early English and British nationality law ==
{{See also|British subject|History of citizenship#Great Britain}}
British nationality law has its origins in medieval England. There has always been a distinction in [[English law]] between the subjects of the monarch and aliens: the monarch's subjects owed him allegiance, and included those born in his dominions (natural-born subjects) and those who later gave him their allegiance (naturalised subjects or [[denization|denizens]]). 

A summary of early English common law is provided by [[Sir William Blackstone]], who wrote about the law in 1765–69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch10.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural-born subjects were originally those born within the dominion of the crown ([[jus soli]]).  Blackstone describes how various statutes extended the rights of the children of subjects born abroad, until "all children, born out of the king's ligeance, whose fathers were natural-born subjects, are now natural-born subjects themselves, to all intents and purposes, without any exception; unless their said fathers were attainted, or banished beyond sea, for high treason; or were then in the service of a prince at enmity with Great Britain."

In 1603 the crowns of England and Scotland were united in the individual of [[James VI and I]], in what is known as the [[Union of the Crowns]]. In 1701, following some disagreement about the rules of succession to the crown, the English parliament passed the [[Alien Act 1705]], providing that Scottish nationals would have [[Alien (law)|alien]] status in the realm of England. However, this was superseded by the [[Act of Union 1707]], which united the realms of England and Scotland.

When the [[British Empire]] came into existence, the dominion of the crown expanded.  British subjects included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the British Empire (the British Dominion).  This included both the colonies and the self-governing [[dominion]]s, including Australia, [[New Zealand]], South Africa, Canada and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Note that the "dominions" of the Crown include not only Dominions but also [[crown colony|colonies]].

Individuals born in the dominion were citizens regardless of the status of their parents: children born to visitors or foreigners acquired citizenship (see [[Jus soli]]). This reflects the rationale of natural-born citizenship: that citizenship was acquired because British-born subjects would have a ‘natural allegiance’ to the crown as a ‘debt of gratitude’ to the crown for protecting them through infancy.  Therefore, citizenship by birth was perpetual and could not be, at common law, removed or revoked regardless of residency.   

By the same reasoning, an ‘alien’, or foreign born resident, was seen as unable to revoke their relationship with their place of birth.  Therefore, at English common law foreign-born individuals could not become citizens through any procedure or ceremony.  Some exceptions to this general principle existed in the common law, to recognise the situation of children born on foreign soil to English (or British after the [[Act of Union 1707]]) subjects.  The earliest exception was the children of the King's ambassadors, who acquired English citizenship even if not born in England.  A later, broader, exception was enacted by the [[De natis ultra mare|Status of Children Born Abroad Act 1350]] (25 Edw. 3 Stat. 1) to allow children born abroad to two English parents to be English.  Later, the [[British Nationality Act 1772]] (13 Geo. 3 c. 21), made general provision allowing natural-born allegiance (citizenship) to be assumed if the father alone were British. 
 
Generally then, there was no process by which a 'foreigner' not of British parents could become a British citizen.  However, two procedures existed by which the individual could become a British subject with some of the rights of citizenship.  Firstly, 'naturalisation' granted all the legal rights of citizenship except political rights (e.g. holding office).  Naturalisation required an act of parliament be passed.  Alternatively, [[denization]] allowed a person to gain the rights of citizenship other than political rights.  Denization was granted by [[letters patent]], and was granted by the monarch as an exercise of [[royal prerogative]].

Denization was therefore an exercise of [[executive power]], whereas naturalisation was an exercise of [[legislative power]].  An example of the latter is the granting of English nationality to the Electress [[Sophia of Hanover]], the [[heir to the throne]] under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].  Naturalisation occurred by the passing, in 1705, of the [[Sophia Naturalization Act]].  This act granted English nationality to the Electress and to the Protestant "issue of her body", allowing all her future descendants a claim to English nationality. In 1957 [[Ernest Augustus IV, Prince of Hanover|Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover]] successfully claimed citizenship of the UK &amp; Colonies under this Act. Although the Act was repealed from 1 January 1949 by the British Nationality Act 1948, some descendants can still claim citizenship based on their parent's rights under the law as it existed prior to 1949. However, the Home Office believes that the Act does not generally give claimants a right of abode in the United Kingdom.  Successful claims will normally be granted to only British Overseas Citizen status unless entitled to a right of abode in the UK under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] as in force prior to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/laws___policy/policy_instructions/nis/e-i/hanover__electress.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905134714/http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/laws___policy/policy_instructions/nis/e-i/hanover__electress.html |date=5 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denization remained the usual form by which foreign-born subjects swore allegiance to the crown until general naturalisation acts were passed. Naturalisation Acts were passed in 1844, 1847 and 1870.  The 1870 act preserved the process of denization.  However, by introducing administrative procedures for naturalising non-British subjects naturalisation became the preferred process.  

The 1870 legislation also introduced the concept of renunciation of British nationality, and provided for the first time that British women who married foreign men should lose their British nationality.  This was a radical break from the common law doctrine that citizenship could not be removed, renounced, or revoked.  

The loss of nationality at marriage was changed with the adoption of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914.  This codified for the first time the law relating to British nationality.  However, it did not mark a major change in the substantive content of the law.  This was to wait until 1948.

==British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914==

This legislation came into force on 1 January 1915 as 4&amp;5 Geo. c.17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1914/17/pdfs/ukpga_19140017_en.pdf legislation.gov.uk: "British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914"] (original as printed)&lt;/ref&gt; British subject status was acquired as follows:

* birth within His Majesty's dominions
* naturalisation in the United Kingdom or a part of His Majesty's dominions which had adopted Imperial naturalisation criteria
* descent through the legitimate male line (child born outside His Majesty's dominions to a British subject father).  This was limited to one generation although further legislation in 1922 allowed subsequent generations born overseas to be registered as British subjects within one year of birth.
* foreign women who married British subject men
* former British subjects who had lost British subject status on marriage or through a parent's loss of status could resume it in specific circumstances (e.g. if a woman became widowed, or children immediately upon turning 21).

British subject status was normally lost by:
* naturalisation in a foreign state, such as the United States of America or France
* in the case of a woman, upon marriage to a foreign man.  Prior to 1933, British subject status was lost even if the woman did not acquire her husband's nationality.
* a child of a father who lost British subject status, provided the child also had the father's new nationality.
* renunciation.

== British Nationality Act 1948 ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Citizenship]] --&gt;
{{Main|British Nationality Act 1948}}

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Heads of Government decided in 1948 to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth, following Canada's decision to enact its own [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|citizenship law]] in 1946. Until then all Commonwealth countries, with the exception of the Irish Free State (see [[Irish nationality law]]), had a single nationality status: ''British subject'' status. It was decided at that conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate national citizenships, but retain the common status of British subject.

Thus the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] provided for a new status of ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'' (CUKC), consisting of all those British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. Each other Commonwealth country did likewise, and also established its own citizenship (with the exception of Newfoundland which became part of Canada on 1 April 1949, Newfoundlanders hence becoming Canadian citizens).

The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title ''Commonwealth citizen''.

It was originally envisaged that all British subjects would get one (or more) of the national citizenships being drawn up under the Act, and that the remainder would be absorbed as CUKCs by the British Government. Until they acquired one or other of the national citizenships, these people continued to be ''British subjects without citizenship''. However, some British subjects never became citizens of any Commonwealth country.

Because the nationality laws of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] did not provide for citizenship for everyone who was born in their countries (see [[Indian nationality law]]), the British Government refused to "declare" their nationality laws for the purposes of the Act, and therefore those British subjects from these countries who did not become Indian or Pakistani citizens were never absorbed as CUKCs by the British Government. They remained British subjects without citizenship.

Due to the imminent withdrawal of the [[Republic of Ireland]] from the Commonwealth (which took effect 18 April 1949), special arrangements were made in s.2 of the Act to allow British subjects from Ireland to apply to continue to hold British subject status independently of the citizenship of any Commonwealth country.  

Until 1983 the status of British subjects without citizenship was not affected by the acquisition of the citizenship of a non-Commonwealth country.

=== Acquisition of Citizenship of the UK and Colonies ===

Under the 1948 Act, [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|CUKC]] status was acquired by:

* birth in the UK or a colony (which does not include birth in the [[Dominion]]s or children of 'enemy aliens' and diplomats).  The immigration status of the parents was irrelevant.
* naturalisation or registration in the UK or a colony or protectorate
* legitimate descent from a CUKC father for children born elsewhere.  Only the first generation acquired British nationality automatically.  Second and subsequent generations could do so only if born outside the Commonwealth (or Ireland) and registered within 12 months of birth or if the father was in ''Crown Service''.
* incorporation of territory (no persons ever acquired CUKC this way from 1949)
* declaration
* marriage

Provisions for acquisition of CUKC by adoption were not included in the 1948 Act itself but were added soon after.

==== Requirements for Naturalisation or Registration ====

Citizens of Commonwealth countries, British subjects and Irish citizens were entitled to register as citizens of the UK and Colonies after one year's residence in the UK &amp; Colonies.  This period was increased to five years in 1962.

Other persons were required to apply for ''naturalisation'' after five years residence.

==== Citizenship by Descent ====

Prior to 1983, as a general rule, British nationality could be transmitted from only the father, and parents were required to be married.  

Children born in Commonwealth countries or the Republic of Ireland could not normally access British nationality if the father was British ''by descent''.  

Those born in non-Commonwealth countries of second and subsequent generations born overseas could be registered as British within 12 months of birth.  However, many such children did not acquire a UK Right of Abode before 1983 and hence became British Overseas citizens in 1983 rather than British citizens.

On 8 February 1979 the Home Office announced that overseas-born children of British mothers would generally be eligible for registration as UK citizens provided application was made before the child reached age 18.  Many eligible children were not registered before their 18th birthday due to the fact this policy concession was poorly publicised.  Hence it was effectively reintroduced by the [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] for those aged under 18 on the date of the original announcement. 

With effect from 30 April 2003, a person born outside the UK to a British mother (who was born or naturalised in the UK) may be entitled to register as a British citizen ''by descent'' if that person was born between 8 February 1961 and 31 December 1982.  However those with permanent resident status in the UK, or entitled to Right of Abode, may instead prefer to seek ''naturalisation'' as a British citizen which gives transmissible British citizenship ''otherwise than by descent''.

==== Citizenship by Declaration ====

A person who was a British Subject on 31 December 1948, of United Kingdom &amp; Colonies descent in the male line, and was resident in the UK &amp; Colonies (or intending to be so resident) was entitled to acquire CUKC by declaration under s12(6) of the Act.  The deadline for this was originally 31 December 1949, but was extended to 31 December 1962 by the ''British Nationality Act 1958''.

==== Citizenship by Marriage ====

Women married to CUKCs had the right to register as CUKCs under section 6(2) of the 1948 Act.

==== Citizenship by Adoption ====

Before 1950 there was generally no provision to acquire UK citizenship by adoption:

* between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1982, a person adopted in the UK by a citizen of the UK &amp; Colonies (CUKC) acquired CUKC automatically if the adopter, or in the case of a joint adoption, the male adopter, was a CUKC.
* children adopted in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man on or after 1 April 1959 acquired CUKC on the same basis as UK adoptees on 16 July 1964, or the date of the adoption order, if later.

In general a person acquiring CUKC by virtue of adoption in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man, became a British citizen on 1 January 1983

== Independence Acts ==
{{See also|:Category:Independence acts in the Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
Many ''colonies'' became independent between 1949 and 1982.  Under the independence legislation passed in the United Kingdom, a person connected with a particular colony generally lost CUKC on a specified date (which was normally that particular colony's date of attaining independence) if:

* they had acquired, or would acquire, citizenship of that country upon or after independence; and
* they did not have specified bloodline connections to the UK itself or a place which remained a colony (e.g., having a parent or a grandparent born in the UK or a place that remained a colony)

Therefore, it was possible for CUKCs to lose the status even if they had migrated to the UK and acquired the right of abode.  Only through naturalisation or registration could they regain CUKC (and the right of abode in some cases).

Specific exceptions to the loss of CUKC on independence included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical background information on nationality|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/650994/Background-information-on-nationality-v1.0EXT.pdf|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* persons from the Malayan states of [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]] who, because of the wording of [[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957]], did not lose CUKC at independence on 31 August 1957, as the law only provided for "the Malay States" for nationality purposes, whereas Penang and Malacca, at the time, were parts of the [[Straits Settlement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=31 July 1957 |title=Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957 |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=5 and 6 Eliz 2 |pages=Schedule 1 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/60/schedule/FIRST/enacted |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These persons, together with those born between 31 August 1957 and 31 December 1982 with a CUKC father, form the largest group of [[British Overseas citizen]]s today.  Most also hold Malaysian citizenship.
* CUKCs connected with [[South Yemen]] normally lost their CUKC status on 14 August 1968. However, those ordinarily residing in the UK, a colony or another protectorate on or before that date were exempted from the loss.
* CUKCs from Cyprus retained CUKC if habitually resident elsewhere in the Commonwealth (except Cyprus) immediately before 16 August 1960. These people would become British Overseas Citizens after 1983 if they did not acquire the right of abode.
* In 1981 the Independence Acts dealing with Belize and Antigua/Barbuda exempted persons who had acquired a [[Right of abode]] in the UK from loss of CUKC.  Such persons would have become British citizens in 1983 due to their Right of abode status.

The only British dependent territory that gained independence after 1982 is [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], which became an independent Commonwealth country on 19 September 1983. British Dependent Territories citizenship was withdrawn unless there was a connection with a remaining dependent territory. Those that had acquired British citizenship before independence and became also Saint Kitts and Nevis citizens upon independence, however, would no longer lose their British citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-instructions-volume-2|title=[Withdrawn] Nationality instructions: volume 2 - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases (Singapore and the [[Federation of Malaya]]), citizenship statuses were created before independence was achieved.  This resulted in unusual endorsements like "British subject: citizen of the State of Singapore" in British passports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=209&amp;secid=204 |title=History of Travel Documents &amp; Passes |publisher=ICA |accessdate=13 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225062053/http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=209&amp;secid=204 |archivedate=25 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Indeed, treaties signed by the United Kingdom around this time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1961/TS0083.pdf |title=Exchange of Notes between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Finland regarding the Abolition of Visas for travel between the United Kingdom and certain British Territories, and Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0005355/1960-04-10|title=Notawisseling tussen de Nederlandse en de Britse Regering inzake de afschaffing van de visumplicht en de erkenning van reisdocumenten, Londen, 01-04-1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; reveal the existence of at least the following citizenship statuses:

* British Subject, Citizen of the United Kingdom, Islands and Colonies 
* British Subject, Citizen of the United Kingdom, Associated States and Colonies 
* British Subject, Citizen of the State of Singapore
* British Subject, Citizen of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland 
* British Protected Person

==British Nationality Acts of 1958, 1964 and 1965==

British Nationality Acts were passed in 1958, 1964 (twice) and 1965:

* The ''British Nationality Act 1958'' legislation dealt with Rhodesia, Ghana independence and reinstating temporarily some lapsed transitional registration entitlements
* The ''British Nationality Act 1964'' provided for resumption of CUKC where it was renounced to obtain another Commonwealth citizenship.  It was no longer possible for a renuciation of CUKC to take effect if the person did not have another nationality.
* The ''British Nationality (No 2) Act 1964'' provided for British mothers to transmit CUKC status in cases of statelessness of an overseas born child.  It also repealed section 20(4) of the 1948 legislation which allowed ''naturalised'' CUKCs resident for more than seven years outside the UK &amp; Colonies to be deprived of CUKC in certain circumstances.
* The ''British Nationality Act 1965'' made provision for women married to ''British subjects without citizenship'' to acquire British subject status by registration

== Commonwealth Immigrants Acts ==
{{Main|Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968}}

Until the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]], all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 made [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKCs) whose passports were not directly issued by the United Kingdom Government (i.e. passports issued by the Governor of a colony or by the Commander of a British [[protectorate]]) subject to immigration control. Those with passports issued at a British High Commission in an independent Commonwealth country or British Consulate remained free from immigration control. 

The 1962 Act also increased the residence period for Commonwealth citizens (plus British subjects and Irish citizens) applying for registration as Citizens of the UK and Colonies from one year to five years.

The [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] sharpened the distinction between citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs) who had close ties with the United Kingdom and were free to enter, and those citizens who had no such ties and were therefore subject to immigration control. Particularly in the newly independent Commonwealth countries of East Africa, the result was that there were now citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had the right of residence nowhere.

==Immigration Act 1971==
{{Main|Immigration Act 1971}}

The [[Immigration Act 1971]] developed this distinction by creating the concept of ''patriality'' or ''[[right of abode]]''. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents, or their grandparents were connected to the United Kingdom and Islands (the UK, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]). This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. (One consequence of this has been the inability of the United Kingdom to ratify the Fourth Protocol to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantees the right of abode for nationals, a right which is widely recognised in [[international law]].)

Prior to 1983. the following people had the right of abode under the Act:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nationality: right of abode|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/633230/Right-of-Abode-v2_0.pdf|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was born, [[adoption|adopted]], [[naturalisation|naturalised]] or registered in the United Kingdom.
* A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was born to, or legally adopted by, a parent who, at the time of the birth or adoption, was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies born, adopted, naturalised or registered in the United Kingdom.
* A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was born to, or legally adopted by, a parent who, at the time of the birth, was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. That parent must have a parent who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth, adoption, naturalisation or registration in the United Kingdom.
* A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who by 1 January 1983 had been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for five years or more (all conditions of stay must have been removed prior to the end of the 5-year period).
* A Commonwealth citizen who was born to, or legally adopted by, a parent who, at the time of the birth or adoption, was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth in the United Kingdom.
* A female Commonwealth citizen or citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was, or had been, the wife of a man with the right of abode.
* A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was registered in an independent Commonwealth country by the British High Commissioner.

The Act did not specifically mention the status of former CUKCs who were holding right of abode in the UK and who lost their CUKC status solely because their own country's independence, although it was implied that if the person had no claim to right of abode as a Commonwealth citizen, then these persons would no longer have right of abode unless they have reacquired their CUKC status.

The following people did not have the right of abode simply by virtue of registration as a CUKC (but could hold it through United Kingdom descent or residence, or if a woman, marriage to a man with Right of Abode):
* A woman who was registered under section 6(2) of the British Nationality Act 1948 on or after 28 October 1971, unless she got married before that date and her husband has the right of abode.
* A minor child who was registered under section 7 of the British Nationality Act 1948 in an independent Commonwealth country by the British High Commissioner on or after 28 October 1971.

The reason for these limitations is that under the 1948 Act, High Commissioners in independent Commonwealth nations had the right to register persons as CUKC.  This was treated for the purpose of the 1971 Act as "registration in the United Kingdom" and hence without the special limitations on Right of Abode, that status would have been held by some CUKCs with no other qualifying ties to the United Kingdom.

The most notable group over whom control was sought were the Ugandan Indians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiansfromuganda.org/ |title=Business Software |publisher=Asiansfromuganda.org |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were expelled from Uganda by [[Idi Amin]] between 1968 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiansfromuganda.org/1972/chronology/chronology.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050902235213/http://www.asiansfromuganda.org/1972/chronology/chronology.html |date=2 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As CUKCs who had passports issued by a British [[High Commissioner]] they were arriving in the United Kingdom in large numbers. A number of 'resettlement' options were looked at, including settling Indians on a suitable island in the dependent territories such as the [[Falkland Islands]] or [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiansfromuganda.org/1972/secret/secret.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050415080434/http://www.asiansfromuganda.org/1972/secret/secret.html |date=15 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lester, Baron Lester of Herne Hill|Lord Lester of Herne Hill]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], has written a detailed paper, "East African Asians versus The United Kingdom: The Inside Story", setting out the difficulties faced by the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odysseustrust.org/lectures/221_east_african_asians-sharma.pdf |title=East African Asians Versus The United Kingdom: The Inside Story |format=PDF |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2619049.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK 'did not want Ugandan Asians' |publisher=BBC News |date=1 January 2003 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the concept of patriality was recognised as only a temporary solution, so the British government embarked on a major reform of the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act 1981.

== British Nationality Act 1981 ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Commonwealth of Nations]] --&gt;
{{Main|British Nationality Act 1981}}

The British Nationality Act 1981 abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of citizenship on 1 January 1983:
*''British citizenship'',
*''[[British dependent territory|British Dependent Territories]] citizenship'' (BDTC), which was renamed ''[[British overseas territory|British Overseas Territories]] citizenship'' (BOTC) by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 (''see below'') and
*''British Overseas citizenship'' (BOC).

British Citizens are those former CUKCs who had a close relation with the United Kingdom and Islands (i.e. those who possessed right of abode under the Immigration Act 1971); BOTCs are those former CUKCs with a close relationship with one of the remaining colonies, renamed Overseas Territories; while BOCs are those former CUKCs who did not qualify for either British citizenship or British Dependent Territories citizenship.

The law distinguishes between British citizen or British Overseas Territories citizen ''by descent'' and those who hold those statuses ''otherwise than by descent''. Citizens ''by descent'' cannot automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or its Overseas Territories (though in some situations the child can be registered as a citizen). 

British Overseas citizens cannot generally pass on British Overseas citizenship, except in limited cases to avoid statelessness or other hardship.

It is possible to hold more than one of these citizenships simultaneously.  In fact, since the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]] granted British citizenship to all the Overseas Territories (except the [[UK sovereign base|Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas]]), most British overseas territories citizens also hold British citizenship.  Additionally, a British Overseas citizen who acquires British citizenship will not lose British Overseas citizenship, although there is generally no added benefit from retaining this status.

Those Commonwealth citizens and British subject already entitled to Right of Abode under the Immigration Act 1971 retained this status provided they did not cease to be Commonwealth citizens or British subjects after 1983. However, countries that joined the Commonwealth after 1 January 1983 are exempt from this scheme. These are South Africa, Pakistan, Namibia, Cameroon and Mozambique. Those who come to the UK under this scheme may claim state benefits if they can show that they intend to make the UK their permanent home. 
Commonwealth citizens who have the right of abode need to apply for a certificate of entitlement if they want to enter the UK. The certificate is a sticker which is placed inside a non-British passport. After five years living in the UK, a person who has moved to the UK under the Right of Abode can apply to naturalise as British citizen and obtain a British passport.

=== British Subject and British Protected Person ===

The 1981 Act retained the category of British subject without citizenship as ''British subject''. British subjects are mainly people from the Indian sub-continent and Ireland. It ended the use of the term for those British subjects who had one of the various national citizenships, though the term ''Commonwealth citizen'' continues to be used in that regard.

Persons who held British subject status based on connections with what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] before 1949 remain entitled to resume that status if they wish.

The status of British subject under the 1981 Act cannot be transmitted to children, although the [[Home Secretary]] has discretion to register a child as a British subject.  This discretion is very rarely exercised.

British subject status can be renounced, but cannot be resumed for any reason.  British subjects (except those connected with Ireland) lose their British subject status automatically if they acquire any other nationality.

For further information on the present use of the term "British subject", see [[British subject]].

The 1981 Act also retained another category, that of ''[[British protected person]]'' (BPP), which is not a form of nationality as such (BPPs were never British subjects), but a status conferred on citizens of states under British protection. It has been argued that since BPPs are not considered [[stateless person|stateless]], they must hold some form of nationality, and that nationality must be a form of British nationality.

British Protected Persons are those who had a connection with a former British Protectorate, Protected State, [[League of Nations mandate]] or [[United Nations trust territory]]. These were mainly in Asia and Africa. British Overseas Citizens, by contrast, are those who have such a relationship with former British colonies. (Protectorates, Protected States, Mandates and Trust Territories were never, legally speaking, British colonies.) A British Protected Person will lose that status upon acquiring any other nationality or citizenship.

=== British National (Overseas) ===

{{main|British nationality and Hong Kong}}

The Hong Kong handover resulted in yet another nationality: ''British National (Overseas)'' or BN(O). There were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong who held British Dependent Territories citizen (BDTC) status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong. Another 2 million other Hong Kong residents are believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. Upon handover, they would lose this status and became solely [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationals]]. Uncertainty about the future of Hong Kong under Chinese rule led to the United Kingdom creating a new category of nationality for which Hong Kong BDTCs could apply. Any Hong Kong BDTC who wished to do so was able to acquire the (non-transmissible) status of British National (Overseas).

=== British Citizenship Legislation for Hong Kong ===

The handover of Hong Kong also resulted in:

* the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990 and the associated [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]]; and
* the Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996 which gave certain women in Hong Kong the right to register as British citizens based on their husband's or former husband's war service in defence of Hong Kong during the Second World War; and
* the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 which gave non-Chinese ethnic minorities in Hong Kong access to British citizenship

In February 2006, British authorities announced that 600 British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused. The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards. Where the applicant in such cases confirms that he or she still wishes to receive British citizenship the decision will be reconsidered on request. No additional fee will be payable by the applicant in such cases.

Recent changes to India's Citizenship Act 1955 (see [[Indian nationality law]]) provide that Indian citizenship by descent can no longer be acquired automatically at the time of birth. This amendment will also allow some children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong after 3 December 2004 who have a British National (Overseas) or British Overseas citizen parent to automatically acquire British Overseas citizenship at birth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/ |title=British nationality – children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong |publisher=Britishcitizen.info |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the provisions for reducing statelessness in article 6(2) or 6(3) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |title=britishcitizen.info |publisher=britishcitizen.info |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to register for full British citizenship with [[right of abode]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds04/text/41220w04.htm#column_WA123 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221211536/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds04/text/41220w04.htm#column_WA123 |date=21 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== British Overseas Territories Act 2002 ==
The [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]] changes the British Dependent Territories to ''British Overseas Territories'', and British Dependent Territories Citizenship to ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship''. This change is supposed to reflect the no longer "dependent" status of these territories, but may create confusion due to the close similarity between the terms "British Overseas Citizen" and "British Overseas Territories Citizen".

The [[Act of Parliament|Act]] also extends British citizenship to all British Overseas Territories Citizens the right to register as British Citizens, and thus acquire the right of abode, except those whose connection is solely with the military outposts known as the Sovereign Base Areas in [[Cyprus]].

A distinction of terminology is made between British Overseas Territories Citizens born before 1 January 1983, introduction of British Dependent Territories, Citizenship, who would previously have been Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and those born after, and therefore who had not ever held righte to freely enter and remain in the UK before 2002 (unless they also separately qualified as British Citizens or had "right to remain" stamped into their passports, to which they were entitled after five years legal residence in the UK).

* Those persons who held British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC) on 21 May 2002 (except those solely connected with the Sovereign Base Areas) ''automatically'' acquired British citizenship on that date if they did not already possess it.  Most people from [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] already held full British citizenship under earlier legislation, or had the right to register as British.
* Persons who acquire BOTC after 21 May 2002 and do not already have British citizenship (mainly those ''naturalised'' as BOTCs after that date) may register as British citizens if they wish under s4A of the 1981 Act.

Until their successful claim against the British Government in the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]] over [[Depopulation of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago|their eviction from their Territory]], those connected to the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] which houses the United States military base of [[Diego Garcia]] were to be excluded as well, but are now included. The accession of the whole island of Cyprus to the European Union would possibly have made the sole exclusion of the Sovereign Base Areas untenable, as they would become the only Cypriots (as well as the only British Overseas Territories citizens) not to have the right to live and work in the United Kingdom. However, in 2004, only the Greek part of the island was admitted, and the issue has not surfaced.

== Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ==
{{Main|Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002}}
This Act created a number of changes to the law including:

=== British Nationals with no other citizenship ===

The [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] has also granted British Overseas Citizens, British Subjects and British Protected Persons the right to register as British citizens if they have no other citizenship or nationality and have not after 4 July 2002 renounced, voluntarily relinquished or lost through action or inaction any citizenship or nationality. Previously such persons would have not had the right of abode in any country, and would have thus been ''de facto'' stateless. Despite strong resistance from Senior Officials at the Home Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/60503wa1.pdf |title=PDF Viewing archiving 300 dpi |format=PDF |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the then Home Secretary, [[David Blunkett]], said on 3 July 2002 that this would "right a historic wrong" which had left stateless tens of thousands of Asian people who had worked closely with British colonial administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2088560.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK to right 'immigration wrong' |publisher=BBC News |date=5 July 2002 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of India]] has also issued [[Indian nationality law#Citizenship clarifications issued by the Authorities|clarifications in respect of people with these citizenships]] to assist with consideration of applications under the [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]].

=== Overseas born children of British mothers ===

The Act has also conferred a right to registration as a British citizen on persons born between 8 February 1961 and 31 December 1982 who, but for the inability (at that time) of women to pass on their citizenship, would have acquired British citizenship automatically when the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] came into force. A person is entitled to registration if:

*the person was born after 7 February 1961 but before 1 January 1983;
*the person was born to a mother who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies at the time and the person would have been a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by descent if it had been possible for women to pass on citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies to their children in the same way as men could; and
*had the person been a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, they would have had the right of abode in the United Kingdom under the Immigration Act 1971 and would have become a British citizen on 1 January 1983.

Registration under '''both''' these categories confers British citizenship '''by descent''' and hence those with permanent residence in the United Kingdom, or those with the right to take up permanent residence in the United Kingdom, may prefer to apply for ''naturalisation'' or ''section 4 registration'' instead.  Both of these registration categories give British citizenship ''otherwise than by descent''.

===Deprivation of British nationality===
Under amendments made by the Act, British nationals can be deprived of their citizenship if the Secretary of State is satisfied they are responsible for acts seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an Overseas Territory. This provision applied to only dual nationals-—it is not applicable if deprivation would result in a person's statelessness.

Prior to this law, British nationals who acquired that status by birth or descent (as opposed to registration or naturalisation) could not be deprived of British nationality.

=== Citizenship ceremonies ===

All new applicants for British citizenship from 1 January 2004 who are aged 18 or over must attend a citizenship ceremony and take an Oath of Allegiance and a Pledge to the United Kingdom before their grant of British citizenship can take effect

* the requirement for a citizenship ceremony applies to applicants for ''registration'' as well as naturalisation
* prior to 1 January 2004, British overseas territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, British subjects and British Nationals (Overseas), as well of citizens of countries sharing the Queen as Head of State (such as Australia and Canada) were exempt from taking the oath of allegiance.  This exemption was abolished.

Similar requirements are imposed on applicants for British overseas territories citizenship, with the exception that the Pledge is based on the relevant territory rather than the United Kingdom.   

It is unusual for adults to acquire British Overseas citizenship or British subject status (application must be made before age 18 and is very rarely granted); however, in such a case only an Oath of Allegiance would be required.

=== English language requirements ===

From 28 July 2004, English (or Welsh or Scottish Gaelic) language requirements for naturalisation applicants were increased:

* the language competency requirement was extended to those applying for naturalisation as the spouse of a British citizen
* evidentiary requirements were increased.

=== Life in the United Kingdom test ===
{{Main|Life in the United Kingdom test}}

From 1 November 2005, all new applicants for ''naturalisation'' as a British citizen must (unless exempted) prove they have passed the [[Life in the United Kingdom test]].

* The test must be passed before application is made to the Home Office
* Those who pass the test do not need to provide separate evidence of language competency
* Those aged 65 or over may be able to claim exemption
* Those who attend combined citizenship and English (or Welsh) classes may be exempted from the test

Neither the language nor ''Life in the UK'' test requirements apply to those seeking ''registration'' (as opposed to naturalisation) as a British citizen.

Note that passing the test is also required for anyone wishing to remain indefinitely in the UK, whether or not they apply for citizenship. E.g., a husband or wife of a British citizen will be deported if they do not pass the test in time.

=== Children of unmarried British fathers===
With effect from 1 July 2006, children may acquire British citizenship automatically from an unmarried British father (or a British permanent resident if the child is born in the United Kingdom).   Proof of paternity must be shown.

Children born to unmarried British fathers before 1 July 2006 are not included in this provision.  However they can be registered as British citizens upon application to the Home Office (if not British some other way), provided the child is aged under 18 and would have been British had the father been married to the mother. However, the agreement of the mother is needed. If the mother refuses then policy is for the home office to enquire of her reasons for refusal. If her reasons are deemed unreasonable registration may still be granted. Also, the minor can apply in his own right on reaching the age of 17.

==Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006==
The [[Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006]] made a number of changes to the law including:

* allowing the Secretary of State to deprive a British national of his or her nationality on the basis of it being "conducive to the public good".   This is a less stringent test than the requirement of the 2002 Act and came into force on 16 June 2006.
* allowing [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|Right of Abode]] to be revoked on the same basis
* introducing a ''good character'' requirements for all acquisitions of British citizenship, with the exception of section 4B registration, registration on the grounds of statelessness and cases where the applicant is under 10 years old.   This came into force on 4 December 2006.

'''HFW''' is a global, sector-focused [[law firm]] providing services to businesses in [[aerospace]], [[commodities]], [[construction]], [[Energy industry|energy]] and [[Natural resource|resources]], [[insurance]] and [[reinsurance]], and shipping. The firm was founded in 1883 and now has more than 600 lawyers, including 170 partners, based in 20 offices across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. The firm prides itself on its deep industry expertise and its entrepreneurial, creative and collaborative culture.

==History==
HFW was founded in 1883, and its early expertise was representing maritime clients following shipwrecks and collisions.&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Ashby |date=2008-12-10 |title=Pirate Attacks Keep Law Firm Buzzing |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122886821440893125 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2018-07-29 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/2XXjW |archivedate=2018-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since broadened its practice to focus on six core sectors globally: aerospace, commodities, construction, energy and resources, insurance and reinsurance, and shipping. In June 2017, the firm changed its name from Holman Fenwick Willan to HFW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfw.com/We-are-now-HFW|title=We are now HFW|website=HFW|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HFW was one of the first London-based law firms to expand internationally, opening its first international office in 1977, in Paris. A year later, it became one of the first international law firms to open an office in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Daughenbaugh |first1=Mia |last2=Bell |first2=David |date=2014-06-16 |title=UK Country Report: Industry focus distinguishes award-winning law firm in Asia |url=https://www.scmp.com/article/1533906/industry-focus-distinguishes-award-winning-law-firm-asia |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |accessdate=2018-07-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71GWp93Yu |archivedate=2018-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HFW then launched in Singapore in 1990, Piraeus in 1993 and Shanghai in 1999. It moved into Australia and the Middle East in 2006, opening offices in Melbourne and Dubai. HFW subsequently expanded its Australia presence, launching offices in Sydney in 2009 and Perth in 2011. It also opened offices in Brussels in 2009, Geneva in 2010 and São Paulo in 2011.

HFW now has one of the fastest-growing international networks of any law firm, opening in eight new markets between January 2016 and October 2018.

In June 2016, HFW became only the second international law firm to enter into a formal association with a Chinese law firm under the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone|Shanghai Free Trade Zone]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leadersleague.com/en/news/hfw-wintell-the-second-foreign-sino-tie-up-in-shanghai-ftz|title=HFW &amp; Wintell: the second foreign-sino tie-up in Shanghai FTZ - Leaders League|work=www.leadersleague.com|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the firm merged with US law firm Legge, Farrow, Kimmitt, McGrath &amp; Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202773287233/|title=Houston's Legge Farrow Inks Merger With Leading UK Firm {{!}} The American Lawyer|work=The American Lawyer|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was notable for being a fully integrated merger, whereas most transatlantic law firm combinations at the time used the [[Swiss verein|Swiss Verein]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202476305944/|title=Mergers: A Swiss Twist {{!}} The American Lawyer|work=The American Lawyer|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, HFW expanded its Latin America presence by entering into a cooperation arrangement with a new Brazilian law firm, Costa, Albino &amp; Lasalvia (CAL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/legal-week/2018/06/19/hfw-expands-latin-american-presence-with-brazilian-firm-association/|title=HFW expands Latin American presence with Brazilian firm association {{!}} LegalWeek|work=LegalWeek|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the firm opened its 20th international office, in Abu Dhabi, with the hire of two partners from [[Reed Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/legal-week/2018/10/01/hfw-launch-abu-dhabi-office-with-reed-smith-duo/|title=HFW launches Abu Dhabi office with Reed Smith duo {{!}} LegalWeek|work=LegalWeek|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move meant HFW had 19 partners and more than 50 lawyers - including 28 Arabic speakers - in five offices across the Middle East, making it one of the largest practices of any international law firm in the region. HFW also has offices in Riyadh and Beirut, and is one of only two international law firms with a base in Kuwait City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globallegalpost.com/big-stories/hfw-launches-in-abu-dhabi-as-part-of-regional-expansion-22303534/|title=HFW launches in Abu Dhabi as part of regional expansion|website=www.globallegalpost.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
HFW featured in the 2018 Social Mobility Employer Index, which lists the 50 UK organisations taking the most action to tackle [[social mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ministry-of-justice-trumps-law-firms-in-social-mobility-rankings-t90l9m95k |title=Ministry of Justice trumps law firms in social mobility rankings |website=thetimes.co.uk |date=2018-07-11 |accessdate=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; HFW was also ranked in the index, which is produced by UK charity the [http://www.socialmobility.org.uk/ Social Mobility Foundation], in 2017.

'''Increment value duty''' was a UK tax based on [[The Finance (1909-1910) Act (10 Edw. VII, c.8)]] - the [[People's Budget]] - in response to
the unequal ownership of land in the early 20th century. The tax was based on the increase in value of property due to public expenditure on roads, drainage, building of parks etc., described as [[unearned increment]].

The tax was based on the difference between the amount of two valuations. Section 26(1) of the Act required the Board of Inland Revenue to ascertain the site value of all land in the United Kingdom as on 30 April 1909. This value constituted the "datum line" for the purposes of increment value duty. Any subsequent sale or grant of a lease, or transfer of an interest in a piece of land, or the subsequent death of a land-owner, provided the occasion for a potential payment of increment value duty; the site value at that date had then to be determined. It was repealed by the [[Finance Act 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/valuation-office-survey-land-value-ownership-1910-1915/|title=Valuation Office survey: land value and ownership 1910-1915 - The National Archives|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A valuable offshoot of this tax and the Act was the [[1910-15 Valuation Office maps and field books]]

Resulting from this, [[The Valuation Office]] was set up to assess and record the value of each property. The result was a nationwide survey of all workshops, houses, farms etc., which recorded details such as the owner, occupier, value and the number of rooms of each property. The surveyors used [[Ordnance Survey]] maps to identify each property and then enter the detailed information into 'Field Books'. These records are useful for exploring land values, land ownership and land occupancy.

Sweden's '''Constitution of 1772''' ({{lang-sv|regeringsform}}, "Instrument of Government") took effect through a bloodless [[coup d'état]], the [[Revolution of 1772]], carried out by King [[Gustav III]], who had become king in 1771. It established once again a division of power between the parliament and the king. The period came to be known as the [[Gustavian era]]. This was a response to a perceived harm wrought upon Sweden by a half-century of [[parliamentarism]] during the country's [[Age of Liberty]]&lt;ref name=NF/&gt; practiced according to the [[Instrument of Government (1719)]], as many members of the Swedish parliament then used to be bribed by foreign powers.

==History and effects==
The 1772 Constitution was partly inspired by the current [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of [[separation of powers]] by [[Montesquieu]],&lt;ref name=B/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg412&gt;{{cite book |last=Borg |first=Ivan |last2=Nordell |first2=Erik |last3=Rodhe |first3=Sten |last4=Nordell |first4=Erik |title=Historia för gymnasiet. Årskurs 1 |edition=4th |year=1967 |publisher=AV Carlsons |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|10259755}} |pages=412-413}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also based on earlier traditions in Sweden, especially from the era of King [[Gustav II Adolf]],&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Bäcklin |editor-first=Martin |title=Historia för gymnasiet: allmän och nordisk historia efter år 1000 |edition=3rd |year=1965 |publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|1610850}} |pages=283-284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg412/&gt; and two of the offices of the ancient [[Great Officers of the Realm]] were revived. King Gustav III also cherished other Enlightenment ideas (as an [[Enlightened absolutism|enlighted despot]]) and repealed torture, liberated agricultural trade, diminished the use of death penalty etc.&lt;ref name=Borg/&gt; The somewhat later [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|Freedom of the Press Act of 1774]], a part of the constitutional law and largely edited by Gustav III, was actually commended by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref name=Borg&gt;{{cite book |last=Borg |first=Ivan |last2=Nordell |first2=Erik |last3=Rodhe |first3=Sten |last4=Nordell |first4=Erik |title=Historia för gymnasiet. Årskurs 1 |edition=4th |year=1967 |publisher=AV Carlsons |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|10259755}} |page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier first Freedom of the Press Act of 1766 was repealed by the Constitution in 1772.

The outcome of the constitution and its deliberately vague formulations,&lt;ref name=NF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg412/&gt;&lt;ref name=B/&gt; partly attributable to it being written in haste,&lt;ref name=B/&gt; was however a more or less [[authoritarian]] political system more weighted in favour of the King's power.&lt;ref name=NF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg412/&gt; In 1789 it was amended in a still more [[autocratic]] direction by the [[Union and Security Act]].

Formally, the 1772 Constitution was adopted by the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Parliament]] (''Riksdag'') on 21 August 1772, but this took place as members of the Parliament and the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Privy Council]] were under threat by the royal garrison on order by King Gustav III outside of [[Stockholm Palace]], where the Parliament and Privy Council were assembled in different parts of the palace. Leading members of the [[Caps (party)|Caps party]] who sat in the Privy Council (as well as in Parliament) were arrested,&lt;ref name=NF&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbj/0369.html Gustaf III], ''[[Nordisk Familjebok]]'' (1909) {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they were locked up in the Privy Council Room and released shortly after the adoption of the constitution.&lt;ref name=NF/&gt;

The 1772 Constitution replaced the [[Swedish Constitution of 1720]] (which was fundamentally similar to the [[Swedish Constitution of 1719|1719 Constitution]]) and was in turn replaced by the [[1809 Instrument of Government]] following the defeat in the [[Finnish War]] and the removal of King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] from the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfcb/0624.html Regeringsformen], ''[[Nordisk Familjebok]]'' (1915) {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details===
Largely the content of the Constitution was the following:
*The king governed the civil service and Parliaments were assembled only at the king's will when the king had to raise taxes and legislate (legislation was regulated in [[:s:sv:Regeringsform 1772#§ 40.|articles 40-43]]). An offensive war also had to be approved by Parliament ([[:s:sv:Regeringsform 1772#§ 48.|article 48]]) and also new taxation ([[:s:sv:Regeringsform 1772#§ 45.|articles 45-46]]).&lt;ref name=B/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg412/&gt; 
*The Privy Council's justice department ({{lang-sv|Justitierevisionen}}), functioned as a fairly independent [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]&lt;ref name=B/&gt; (the king had two votes in this Court's judgements, as in all decisions by the Council in the Age of Liberty). The Privy Council did not however function so much as a political institution as in the Age of Liberty,&lt;ref name=B/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg412/&gt; and in these matters the king could put it aside and listen to other advisors and councillors as the king also often did.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;
*The king however, had to listen to the advice of the Privy Council in cases concerning treaties about peace, armistice and alliances with foreign powers&lt;ref name=B/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg412/&gt;&lt;ref name=RF1772/&gt; and [[State visits|(state) visits]] to other countries.&lt;ref name=RF1772/&gt; In these cases the Council also could veto the king, if all members of the Council shared this view unanimously.&lt;ref name=RF1772&gt;[[:s:sv:Regeringsform 1772#§ 6.|Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution (Instrument of Government or ''Regeringsform'').]] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Finland after 1809===
In the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], created in 1809 from the eastern third of Sweden as part of the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]], the 1772 Constitution had a peculiar status. While the Russian Tsars, reigning in Finland as Grand Dukes, never gave any indication that they considered their autocratic powers limited by any constitution, a theory was developed in Finland that the old Instrument of Government remained in force, ''mutatis mutandum'', with Finland's position as part of the Empire having the nature of a [[personal union]]. This theory was, however, never put forward officially and never accepted in St. Petersburg. It did gain considerable popular currency in Finland, so that [[Russification of Finland|Russification]] measures instituted from the 1890s onwards were commonly decried as an "unconstitutional" assault on the country's autonomy. The "Constitutionals" (''perustuslailliset'') were an important political faction in Finland at this time, and their legacy of constitutional legalism has had a significant effect on later Finnish politics.

The matter remained officially uncontested and arguably unresolved for more than a century, but after the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1917, the [[Parliament of Finland]], as successor to the old Estates of the Realm, moved to assume sovereign power in Finland, based on the old Swedish provisions in case of a [[interregnum|vacancy on the throne]]. This led to a power struggle with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government of Russia]], as well as within Finland, culminating, after the [[October revolution]], in the [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finnish declaration of independence]].

The Instrument of Government was finally superseded when Finland adopted a [[Constitution of Finland|republican form of government]] in 1919.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1714">The '''''Le Chapelier Law''''' ({{lang-fr|Loi Le Chapelier}}) was a piece of legislation passed by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] during the first phase of the [[French Revolution]] (14 June 1791), banning [[guild]]s as the early version of [[trade unions]], as well as ''[[compagnonnage]]'' (by organizations such as the [[Compagnons du Tour de France]]) and the [[Labor rights|right to strike]], and proclaiming [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] as the norm. It was advocated and drafted by [[Isaac René Guy le Chapelier]]. Its promulgation enraged the ''[[sans-culottes]]'', who called for an end to the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], which nonetheless continued through the second phase of the Revolution. The law was annulled on 25 May 1864, through the ''[[:fr:Loi Ollivier|loi Ollivier]]'' (proposed by [[Émile Ollivier]] and acceded to by [[Napoleon III]]), which reinstated the right to associate and the right to strike.

The '''Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia''' is the oldest and largest [[Legal aid in the United States#Civil legal aid|civil legal aid]] organization in [[Washington, D.C.]]. 

Created in 1932, the Legal Aid Society provides representation and legal services to indigent residents of the District of Columbia in areas like domestic violence (including [[restraining orders]]), housing, public benefits, and consumer law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalaiddc.org/who-we-are/ Who We Are], Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Recession in the United States|recession of 2008 to 2009]], the Legal Aid Society managed to expand legal services even as gifts from lawyers and law firms declined 15 to 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Susan |last = Kinzie |title = 5 Nonprofit-Group Leaders Honored for Hard Work in Downturn |date = October 5, 2009 |work = Washington Post |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/04/AR2009100402741.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it provided legal services to approximately 8,800 indigent Washingtonians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfp-dc.org/cfpdc/nonprofit-detail.php?urllocal2014=1365/Legal-Aid-Society-of-the-District-of-Columbia Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia], Catalogue for Philanthropy&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging widespread problems with the District’s food stamp program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Marimow |first = Ann E. |title = Lawsuit alleges widespread problems in District-run food stamp program |work = Washington Post |date = August 28, 2017 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/widespread-problems-in-district-run-food-stamp-program-alleged-in-new-lawsuit/2017/08/28/d4cb6c9c-8bf5-11e7-84c0-02cc069f2c37_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime impostors and spies===

Many women in history have presented themselves as men in order to advance in typically male-dominated fields. There are many documented cases of this in the military during the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shearer|first1=Lee|title=Brothers in arms?: Civil War reality predates transgender debate|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/news/20180414/brothers-in-arms-civil-war-reality-predates-transgender-debate|website=Athens Banner-Herald|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However their purpose was rarely for fraudulent gain. They are listed in the [[List of wartime cross-dressers]].

Spies have often pretended to be people other than they were. One of the famous was [[Chevalier d'Eon]] (1728–1810), a French diplomat who successfully infiltrated the court of Empress Elizabeth of Russia by presenting as a woman.

'''Militarization of police''' refers to the use of [[military equipment]] and [[Military tactics|tactics]] by [[law enforcement officer]]s. This includes the use of [[armored personnel carrier]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteukforces.info/special-air-service/weapons/stun-grenade.php |title=SAS - Weapons - Flash Bang &amp;#124; Stun Grenade (The British Army's SAS developed flashbang grenades) |publisher=Eliteukforces.info |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The flash from a flashbang grenade detonation momentarily activates all [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the [[human eye|eye]], making vision impossible for approximately five seconds, until the eye restores itself to its normal, unstimulated state. The loud blast is meant to cause temporary loss of hearing, and also disturbs the [[Perilymph|fluid in the ear]], causing loss of balance. The concussive blast of the detonation can still injure, and the heat created can ignite flammable materials.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grenade launcher]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, [http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/indexfirst.htm Branch Davidian Evidence], Investigative Report No. 1, September 1999; Investigative Report No. 2, January 2000 (PDFs available at Texas Rangers website). The Rangers found that the FBI used grenade launchers to fire two 40 mm M651 grenades. The Army considers the M651 a pyrotechnic device and that it is known to cause fires. The Army Tech Manual for the M651 warns that it can penetrate 3/4" plywood at 200 meters and "projectile may explode upon target impact." During inventory of the Waco evidence the Texas Rangers also found flashbang grenades.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sniper rifle]]s, and [[Special Weapons and Tactics]] (SWAT) teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/militarization-of-police/| author=James Joyner| title=Militarization of Police| publisher=Outside the Beltway| date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-and-the-shocking-nature-of-us-police-militarization| author=Paul D.

Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of [[protest]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo21636470.html|title=Crisis and Control|website=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/10/senate-police-militarization.html|title=Congress scrutinizes police militarization before planned Ferguson protest|website=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, [[riot police]] have fired at protesters using guns with [[rubber bullet]]s or [[plastic bullet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet] "A solid PVC cylinder, 10 cm long and 38 mm in diameter, fired by police or military forces to regain control in riots."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tear gas]], which was developed by the [[United States Army]] for [[riot control]] in 1919, was widely used against protesters in the 2000s. The use of tear gas in [[war]]fare is prohibited by various international treaties&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the [[Geneva Protocol]] of 1925: 'Prohibited the use of "asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials"'&lt;/ref&gt; that most states have signed; however, its law enforcement or [[military]] use for [[domestic policy|domestic]] or non-[[combat]] situations is permitted.

Concerns about the militarization of police have been raised by both ends of the political spectrum in the [[United States]], with both the right-of-center/libertarian [[Cato Institute]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] voicing criticisms of the practice. The [[Fraternal Order of Police]] has spoken out in favor of equipping law enforcement officers with military equipment, on the grounds that it increases the officers' safety and enables them to protect members of the public and other [[first responder]]s (e.g., [[firefighter]]s and [[emergency medical services]] personnel). However, a 2017 study showed that police forces which received military equipment were more likely to have violent encounters with the public, regardless of local crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/30/does-military-equipment-lead-police-officers-to-be-more-violent-we-did-the-research/| author=Ryan Welch and Jack Mewhirter| title=Does military equipment lead police officers to be more violent?

Canadian legal expert Michael Spratt wrote, "... there's no question that Canadian police sometimes look more like post-apocalyptic military mercenaries than protectors of the peace. Our police services have been acquiring more and more military toys — a dangerous trend that's gotten little in the way of critical analysis in the mainstream media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ipolitics.ca/2014/08/15/the-creeping-militarization-of-the-police/| author=Michael Spratt| title=The creeping militarization of the police| publisher=iPolitics| date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing numbers of [[Canada|Canadian]] police agencies have acquired armored vehicles in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/08/21/we-call-it-a-rescue-vehicle-growing-number-of-canadian-police-forces-bulking-up-with-armoured-vehicles/| author=Douglas Quan| title='We call it a rescue vehicle': Growing number of Canadian police forces bulking up with armoured vehicles| work=National Post| date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Ottawa Police Service bought a [[Lenco BearCat|Lenco G3 BearCat]] armored personnel carrier for $340,000, which has "half-inch-thick military steel armoured bodywork, .50 caliber-rated ballistic glass, blast-resistant floors, custom-designed gun ports and... a roof turret."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelspratt.com/law-blog/police-militarization|title=Canadian Police Militarization|work=Michael Spratt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests|G20 protests]] in Toronto in 2010 showed that the militarization of protest policing is not only occurring in the United States. Police in Toronto used a sound cannon, or [[Long Range Acoustic Device]] (LRAD) -- a [[weapon]] that was developed for use in conflicts in the Middle East, as well as barricades, pre-emptive arrests and riot units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/views-expressed/2014/09/canadian-police-agencies-innovators-militarization|title=Canadian police agencies: Innovators in militarization?|work=rabble.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kevin Walby, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the [[University of Winnipeg]], "the more interesting aspect of the militarization of the police is actually on the strategy side"; police are "increasingly training with military-style tacticians, especially when it comes to situations like [[crowd control]] and, increasingly, [[surveillance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/news/police-militarization-is-already-in-canada-as-surveillance-on-the-rise | author=Ashley Csanady| title=Police militarization is already in Canada as surveillance on the rise| publisher=Canada.com| date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2015 it was reported that "RCMP officers have started openly carrying [[MP5]] submachine guns on [[Parliament Hill]] as part of a visible increase to Parliament Hill security following last [[2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa|October's terrorist attack]]" in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/rcmp-brings-out-the-big-guns-to-the-dismay-of-some|title=Mounties now toting submachine guns for Hill security|author=Lee Berthiaume, Ottawa Citizen More Lee Berthiaume, Ottawa Citizen|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative senator [[Vern White]], a former RCMP officer and a former Ottawa police chief states that "...some RCMP officers guarding Parliament Hill against potential terrorist attacks should be armed with rifles similar to those carried by Canadian troops in Afghanistan [,]" the "...more powerful Colt [[C8 carbine|C8]] [which is] popular with police tactical teams and Canadian and other NATO alliance troops." White argues that the C8 carbines would give officers a much longer shooting range than the short-barreled [[MP5|MP5 submachine guns]]. "The RCMP is issuing more than 2,200 C8 carbines to its officers [,]" but the RCMP has not indicated whether the C8s will be issued to Parliament Hill officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/boost-firepower-of-rcmp-guards-on-parliament-hill-says-senator|title=Boost firepower of Mounties guarding Parliament Hill, says senator|author=David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
In 2013 "...Brazil saw countrywide demonstrations protesting a lack of basic services while the country was spending billions on the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The unprepared and overreacting police forces responded in a way that shocked the largely middle-class protesters. The police, using "non-lethal" weapons like pepper spray and rubber bullets while dressed from head to toe in ninja-like full battle gear, indiscriminately arrested both violent "[[black bloc]]" demonstrators, known for their confrontational tactics and anarchist views, along with non-violent protestors marching peacefully." As a result, "...calls for de-militarization of the police—from social movements, non-governmental organizations, and even segments of the police itself—became widespread and remain one of the legacies of the World Cup." The Brazilian "...Military Police today, while not officially a wing of the Armed Forces, remains an institution with a strict military hierarchy, training that retains a military ideology, and practices that frequently resemble occupying forces conquering enemy territories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wola.org/commentary/police_militarization_similarities_between_ferguson_and_brazil|title=Police Militarization: Similarities Between Ferguson and Brazil|publisher=wola.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The units that responded to the protests were Shock Police, units specialized in [[riot control]]. The Military Police is an ancillary and reserve force of the Army, under the General Inspectorate of Military Police, being that a part of Land Operations Command. But, in time of peace, the state governor act as commander-in-chief of the Police and Firefighting Corps, according to the [[Constitution of Brazil]], article 144, 6th paragraph, where it is said that the "Military Police and Firefighter Corps, ancillary and reserve forces of the Army, subordinate themselves, with the Civil Police, to the state and Federal District governors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coter.eb.mil.br/igpm/index.php/2013-03-19-15-57-34|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317105455/http://www.coter.eb.mil.br/igpm/index.php/2013-03-19-15-57-34|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-17|title=Legislação|website=www.coter.eb.mil.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==
"Since 1999, an eight-billion-dollar programme in [[Colombia]] has seen "the mass deployment of military troops and militarized police forces to both interdict illegal drugs and counter left-wing guerrilla groups". This assistance "promote[s] militarization to address organized crime".&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2014/08/despite-current-debate-police-militarisation-goes-beyond-u-s-borders/|title=Despite Current Debate, Police Militarisation Goes Beyond U.S. Borders|publisher=ipsnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these U.S. policies, "civilian forces... have increasingly received military training, leading to concerns over human rights violations and excessive use of force, as well as a lack of knowledge over how to deal with local protests – concerns startlingly similar to those now coming out of Ferguson, Missouri."&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt;

===History===

====19th Century====
Following the [[Reconstruction Era]] (1865–1877) in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the 1878 [[Posse Comitatus Act]], in response to the allegation of [[civil liberties]] abuse under [[military occupation]] of the former [[Confederacy (American Civil War)|Confederate States]] by members of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] during Reconstruction. Still in force, the law prohibits the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]] (as amended in 1956) for being used as [[domestic policy|domestic]] [[law enforcement]] except when authorized by the [[President of the United States|President]] under certain circumstances; similar limitation also applies to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]] by [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] policy. The Act does not apply to the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and [[state defense force]]s while under the authority of their respective [[Governor (United States)|state governors]] nor the [[United States Coast Guard]], which is both an [[armed service]] and a [[maritime law enforcement]] agency and is not under authority of the [[United States Department of Defense]] (which was formed in 1947 out of the [[United States Department of War]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/docs/10-16/ch_12.asp|title=Domestic Operational Law: The Posse Comitatus Act and Homeland Security|website=army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=706794 THE POSSE COMITATUS ACT: A HINDRANCE TO NATIONAL SECURITY IN NEED OF A CHANGE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/04autumn/felicett.pdf|title=The Posse Comitatus Act: Liberation from the Lawyers|website=army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the law was passed, it allowed [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Local government in the United States|local authorities]] to regain control of their affairs, with their police departments typically equipped with [[handguns]], [[shotguns]], and [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], which were suitable for law enforcement purposes.

====20th Century====
[[File:Thompsonad1sm.jpg|thumb|upright|The "Anti-Bandit Gun": a 1920s advertisement of the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921]] for United States [[Police|law enforcement]] forces]]
Throughout the 20th century, the United States has faced large and heavily armed [[criminal organizations]], in which law enforcement officers were clearly outperformed. In the 1920s during the [[Prohibition Era]] and in the early 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], criminal syndicates and individual bank robbers such as [[John Dillinger]] and [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were frequently armed with [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and [[Browning Automatic Rifles]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Bearse, "The Thompson Submachine Gun: Weapon of War and Peace", in Murtz, ''Gun Digest Treasury'' (DBI Books, 1994), p.210 {{ISBN|0873491564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), as well as police departments in cities such as [[Kansas City, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article1337845.html|title=Police armored vehicles have long history|work=kansascity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenoshapolice.com/history-department|title=History of Department|work=Kenosha Police Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; began deploying automatic weapons, including the Thompson submachine gun, and armored cars in the 1920s and 1930s.
[[File:Firearms practice, 1936.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An FBI officer firing a [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] in 1936.]]

[[George Fletcher Chandler]], a veteran of the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] and the first Superintendent of the [[New York State Police]], was an early advocate of law enforcement officers wearing their weapons exposed on the outside of their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wilbur R.|title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412988766|page=1230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYME6Z35nyAC&amp;pg=PA1230&amp;dq=george+fletcher+chandler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiz_zxr6_TAhVD64MKHUkkChwQ6AEIVjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20fletcher%20chandler&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Social issues of the 1920s in the United States|the late 1920s through the early 1930s]], gunmen from criminal gangs in the United States began wearing [[bulletproof vest]]s made from thick layers of cotton padding and cloth. These early vests could absorb the impact of handgun rounds such as [[.22 Long Rifle]], [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 S&amp;W Long]], [[.32 S&amp;W]], [[.380 ACP]], [[.38 Special]] and [[.45 ACP]] traveling at speeds of up to {{convert|300|m/s|abbr=on}}. To overcome these vests, law enforcement agents such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] began using the newer and more powerful [[.38 Super]], and later the [[.357 Magnum]] cartridge.

Experts believes that police militarization was escalated in the 1950s and 1960s, an era in which [[race riot]]s were common in many U.S. cities. Some believe that the seeming success of officers armed with military-style weapons and deployed to curtail the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], a six-day race riot sparked by conflicts with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) that killed 34 people, gave way to the trend of arming and equipping law enforcement officers with battlefield weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/police-militarization-history-stretches-back-civil-rights-movement-photos-1926956|title=Police Militarization History Stretches Back To Civil Rights Movement [PHOTOS]|author=Aaron Morrison|date=May 18, 2015|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Rohde, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Ford School of Public Policy]], has published research indicating that "militarization is a mindset...is a tendency to see the world through the lens of national security, a tendency to exaggerate existing threats." Rohde traces "the origins of modern militarized policing" to the [[Cold War]]-era [[anti-communist]] paranoia, and the idea that domestic civil rights activists were similar to foreign enemies, as manifested in activities such as the CIA's [[Operation CHAOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-is-a-relic-of-cold-war-paranoia-2016-8| author=Joy Rohde| title=Police militarization is a relic of Cold War paranoia| publisher=Business Insider| date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things have changed over the last 100 years and due to the rise of acts of terrorism and the easy access to high-powered weapons; special weapons and tactics teams have been implemented and are being utilized across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J|date=2000|title=Training SWAT teams: Implications for improving tactical units.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235200000556|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|doi=10.1016/S0047-2352(00)00055-6|pmid=|access-date=|volume=28|pages=407–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s to 1990s, encounters with the sophisticated weapons of narcotics trafficking groups such as the [[Medellín Cartel]] and street gangs such as the [[Gangster Disciples]], with organized, violent left-wing protesters at such events as the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]] and the 1999 [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Conference]] in [[Seattle]],&lt;ref name="ew1"&gt;{{Cite news|first = Kera|last = Abraham|title = Flames of Dissent|newspaper = Eugene Weekly|date = November 22, 2006|url = http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|accessdate = June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[urban riots]] such as the 1965 Watts riots in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[1967 Detroit Riot]] in [[Detroit]] led law enforcement to reconsider their standard [[side arm]]s.

The 1981 [[Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act]] allows the U.S. military to cooperate with domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies. Operations in support of law enforcement include assistance in counter-drug operations, assistance for civil disturbances, special security operations, [[counter-terrorism]], explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), and similar activities. Constitutional and statutory restrictions and corresponding directives and regulations limit the type of support provided in this area. This allows the U.S. military to give law enforcement agencies access to [[List of United States military bases|its military bases]] and [[Equipment of the United States Armed Forces|its military equipment]].&lt;ref name=balko&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balko|first1=Radley|title=A Decade After 9/11, Police Departments Are Increasingly Militarized|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/12/police-militarization-9-11-september-11_n_955508.html|accessdate=November 29, 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was promoted during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]] in the context of the [[War on drugs]], and is considered a part of a general trend towards the militarization of police.&lt;ref name=balko /&gt; The Act is cited in the 1992 essay ''[[The Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012]]'' as having set a precedent that the author, a [[United States Air Force]] officer, considered dangerous.

The 1997 [[North Hollywood shootout]] had a profound effect on law enforcement agencies. Local patrol officers at the time were typically armed with their standard issue [[9×19mm]] or [[.38 Special]] pistols, with some having a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun available in their cars. The North Hollywood bank robbers carried fully automatic [[AK-47]]-style weapons with high capacity [[drum magazine]]s and ammunition capable of penetrating vehicles and police Kevlar vests. With these weapons, two bank robbers fired approximately 1,100 rounds at officers and civilians before being killed. The robbers wore [[ballistic vest|body armor]] which successfully protected them from bullets and shotgun pellets fired by the responding patrolmen. Police noted that the service pistols carried by the first responding officers had insufficient range and relatively poor accuracy, although a SWAT team eventually arrived with sufficient firepower.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The ineffectiveness of the standard police patrol pistols and shotguns in penetrating the robbers' body armor led to a trend in the United States toward arming selected police officers, not just SWAT teams, with heavier firepower such as semi-automatic [[5.56×45mm NATO]] [[AR-15]] type rifles.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} SWAT teams, whose close quarters battle weaponry usually consisted of [[submachine gun]]s that fired pistol cartridges such as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], began supplementing them with AR-15 type rifles and carbines.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====21st Century====
Under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], law enforcement officers must receive written permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified [[magistrate]], to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the 2001 [[Patriot Act]] gave law enforcement officers permission to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge, amongst other provisions, if terrorist activities were suspected. The Act was criticized for its perceived violation of civil liberties and has generated a great deal of controversy since its enactment. In ''[[United States v. Antoine Jones]]'', the court found that increased monitoring of suspects caused by the Patriot Act directly put the suspects' [[Constitutional right#United States|constitutional rights]] in jeopardy. For a time, the Act allowed for agents to undertake "sneak and peek" searches. Critics such as the ACLU strongly criticized the law for violating the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/patriot/16745prs20030903.html|title=Uncle Sam Asks: "What the hell is going on here?" in New ACLU Print and Radio Advertisements|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|date=September 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FactCheckOnACLUAdv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/aclu_ad_on_sneak-and-peek_searches_overblown.html|title=ACLU Ad On "Sneak-and-Peek" Searches: Overblown|publisher=FactCheck.org|date=September 21, 2004|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714102208/http://www.factcheck.org/aclu_ad_on_sneak-and-peek_searches_overblown.html|archivedate=July 14, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2015, President [[Barack Obama]] announced limits on the types of military equipment which can be transferred to police departments and the implementation of training programs to assure the appropriate use of other items. The military can no longer transfer some weapons, such as grenade launchers, weaponized vehicles, and bayonets to police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-military-equipment-gravy-train-is-ending-for-local-police-departments| author=Colleen Curry| title=The Military Equipment Gravy Train Is Ending for Local Police Departments| publisher=Vice| date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama stated that "We've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like it's an [[military occupation|occupying force]] as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them,...So we're going to prohibit equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments."&lt;ref name="politico.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/white-house-limiting-military-equipment-for-police-118041.html|title=Police union accuses White House of politicizing cop safety|work=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Obama's announcement, the United States' largest police union, the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], reacted negatively, pledging to push back against the new restrictions, and accusing the administration of politicizing officers' safety.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; The executive director of the FOP, James Pasco, stated that his group "...(would) be at (their) most aggressive in asserting the need for officer safety and officer rights in any police changes that are to be effected", and objected to a requirement that would require police departments to obtain permission from city governments to acquire certain equipment, including riot batons, helmets and shields, through federal programs.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; Pasco stated "We need to only look back to [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] (the location of the 2015 protests following the [[death of Freddie Gray]]) to see what happens when officers are sent out ill-equipped in a disturbance situation...[;] Because you don't like the optics (of militarization), you can't send police officers out to be hurt or killed."&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt;

In July 2016, the Obama Administration announced that it would revisit the 2015 ban on some types of military equipment for police forces, and begin a process of case-by-case review.&lt;ref name=td20160722&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160722/07570135041/administrations-one-year-experimentation-with-reining-police-militarization-apparently-over.shtml |title=Administration's One-Year Experimentation With Reining In Police Militarization Apparently Over |work=TechDirt |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ruby Ridge====
In 1992, there was a deadly confrontation and a 12-day [[siege]] at [[Ruby Ridge]] in [[northern Idaho]] between [[Randy Weaver]], his family and his friend Kevin Harris, and agents of the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). USMS and FBI agents were armed with M16s and sniper rifles, and they used an armored personnel carrier. It resulted in the deaths of two Weaver's son Sammy, his wife Vicki, and Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan. At the subsequent federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney [[Gerry Spence]] made accusations of "criminal wrongdoing" against every agency involved in the incident: the FBI, USMS, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (BATFE), and the [[United States Attorney's Office]] (USAO) for Idaho. At the completion of the trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] formed a Ruby Ridge Task Force to investigate Spence's charges. The 1994 Task Force report was released in redacted form by Lexis Counsel Connect and raised questions about the conduct and policy of all the agencies. Public outcry over Ruby Ridge led to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information holding 14 days of hearings and issuing a report calling for reforms in [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement]] to prevent a repeat of Ruby Ridge and to restore public confidence in federal law enforcement.

====Branch Davidian siege====

Referring to the 2011 [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests in [[New York City]], Glen Greenwald wrote, "The police response was so excessive, and so clearly modeled after battlefield tactics, that there was no doubt that deterring domestic [[dissent]] is one of the primary aims of police militarization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/| author=Glenn Greenwald| title=The Militarization of U.S. Police: Finally Dragged Into the Light by the Horrors of Ferguson| publisher=The Intercept| date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oakland Police Department]] (OPD) used excessive force while breaking up [[Occupy Oakland]] demonstrations in 2011. Several protesters successfully sued the city of [[Oakland, California]] for their injuries; Scott Olsen was severely injured after being hit in the head with a police projectile and was awarded $4.5 million. The city paid $1.17 million to a group of protesters, and $645,000 to Kayvan Sabeghi, who was clubbed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thenation.com/article/179351/did-occupy-actually-make-police-departments-more-accountable| author=Amity Paye |title=Did Occupy Actually Make Police Departments More Accountable?| work=The Nation| date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2014, a SWAT team looking for drugs in a [[Cornelia, Georgia]] home threw a [[flashbang grenade]] into the house. The grenade landed in the playpen of a 19-month-old baby boy, and the detonation severely burned and mutilated the baby's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/toddler-critically-injured-by-flash-bang-during-po/nf9XM/ | title=Toddler critically injured by 'flash bang' during police search | date=May 29, 2014 | accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, concerns about the militarization of police arose after the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] occurred on {{nowrap|August 9}}, 2014, in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a [[suburb]] of {{nowrap|[[St. Louis]]}}. The display of military gear by area police agencies dealing with the protests received significant criticism from the media and politicians.

===Concerns and responses===
====Community policing====
The drift toward militarization concerns police officers and police policy analysts themselves. U.S. [[community policing]] grew out of the [[Peelian Principles]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]] which emphasizes the relationship between the police and the community they serve. Police academy education patterned after a military boot camp, military-type [[battle dress uniform]]s and black color by itself may produce aggression, as do the missions named wars on crime, on drugs, and on terrorism.&lt;ref name=dispatch&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Karl Bickel|title=Will the Growing Militarization of Our Police Doom Community Policing?|journal=Daily Dispatch|date=December 2013|volume=6|issue=12|publisher=Community Oriented Policing Services, US Dept of Justice |url=http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp#two|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 piece in the newsletter of the DOJ's [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] (COPS), COPS Senior Policy Analyst Karl Bickel warned that police militarization could seriously impair [[Community policing|community-oriented policing]]. Bickel wrote that accelerating militarization was likely to alienate police relationship with the community, and pointed to a variety of factors that contribute to militarization, including the growth of SWAT; the increase prevalence of dark-colored military-style battle dress uniforms for patrol officers (which research suggests has a psychological effect of increasing aggression in the wearer), and "warrior-like" stress training in policing training, which fosters an "us versus them" approach.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bickel, [https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp Will the Growing Militarization of Our Police Doom Community Policing?], ''Community Policing Dispatch'', [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] (Vol. 6, Issue 12), December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of force====
A report by [[The Marshall Project]] looking at data from the early 2010s investigated the mindset of "guardian" versus "warrior" by calculating the rate of complaints for excessive use of force against police officers who had served in the military versus police officers in general.  It found higher rates for veterans in Boston (28% vs. 17%) and Miami (14% vs. 11%), but found no difference for [[Massachusetts State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/03/30/when-warriors-put-on-the-badge |title=When Warriors Put On The Badge |date=3 March 2017 |publisher=[[The Marshall Project]] |authors=Simone Weichselbaum, Beth Schwartzapfel, Tom Meagher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national survey in August 2016 by the [[Pew Research Center]] found police officers who had served in the military were more likely to have fired their weapon while doing police work (32% vs. 26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A closer look at police officers who have fired their weapon on duty | url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/08/a-closer-look-at-police-officers-who-have-fired-their-weapon-on-duty/ |authors=Rich Morin, Andrew Mercer |date=8 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viewpoints====
The ACLU has stated that local police use these "wartime weapons in everyday policing, especially to fight the wasteful and failed drug war, which has unfairly targeted people of color."&lt;ref name="aclu.org"/&gt; Travis Irvine from ''The Huffington Post'' referred to how "local police forces now roll tank-like vehicles through our streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/travis-irvine/a-new-christmas-truce_b_6370476.html|title=A New Christmas Truce|work=The Huffington Post|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Pruett from ''The Huffington Post'' raised concerns about "Military [[Humvee]]s, still in camouflage and mounted with [[machine gun]]s, in the hands of municipal police [and] SWAT teams of police in full [[riot gear]], bristling with automatic weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-pruett/what-have-we-become_1_b_6308324.html|title=What Have We Become?|work=The Huffington Post|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former "...Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper published an essay arguing that the current epidemic of [[police brutality]] is a reflection of the militarization...of our urban police forces, the result of years of the "war on drugs" and the "war on terror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1103039|title=Militarization Of Campus Police|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Rand Paul]] has proposed a demilitarization of U.S. police departments, stating that "The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slumz.boxden.com/f5/aug-20-database-shows-what-military-equipment-your-local-police-department-has-been-stockpiling-2111318/|title=Aug 20 - Database Shows What Military Equipment Your Local Police Department Has Been Stockpiling|publisher=boxden.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck Canterbury, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argued that the equipment received from the federal government had been properly de-militarized, and that it was being used to protect civilians from [[violent crime]]. He further stated that the use of the equipment by law enforcement was necessary to protect civilians, since [[mass shootings]] have taken place across the United States, even in small towns. Responding to claims that law enforcement officers were being given tanks, Canterbury argued that the vehicles being used by law enforcement were not armed, and that they were being used across the United States to protect other officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Becky|title=Fraternal Order of Police defends 'militarization'|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=370&amp;sid=31391932|website=KSL TV|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2015, a Department of Justice investigation into [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|use of deadly force]] by the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] in the period from 2007-2013 found that the way officers are trained may be a contributing factor to excessive use of deadly force. The report found that a) many officers have the mistaken assumption that being "in fear of their life" is justification for the use of deadly force, but fear should not be a factor - it's a reasonable belief that deadly force is necessary to avoid death or serious injury; b) instruction about policies on the use of force is confusing; c) most training scenarios end in some type of use of force and officers are rarely, if ever, trained how to resolve confrontations peacefully; d) 80% of suspects shot by police were black - black suspects were also more than twice as likely to be shot due to a "threat perception failure"; and e) no consistent procedure was in place for shooting investigations, no audio or video recordings of officer interviews were being made, and officers are often interviewed months after the incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fusion.net/story/108190/the-new-doj-report-on-philadelphia-police-shootings-is-mandatory-reading/| author=Daniel Rivero| title=The new DOJ report on Philadelphia police shootings is mandatory reading| publisher=Fusion| date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/crime/article/Justice-Department-to-release-use-of-deadly-force-6152555.php|author1=SEAN CARLIN  |author2=MICHAEL R.

====Intelligence-gathering and surveillance====
In a January 2017 report [[Cato Institute]] criminal justice policy analyst Adam Bates argues that in the United States, "an increasingly militarized domestic police force" is characterized by "[[mission creep]] [that] has not been limited to weapons and tactics. What the War on Drugs has done for police militarization, the War on Terror is now doing for police intelligence gathering, and the privacy of millions of Americans is at risk."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Bates, Policy Analysis No. 809, [https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa-809-revised.pdf Stingray: A New Frontier in Police Surveillance], Cato Institute (January 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has raised concerns about military involvement in surveillance of peaceful protesters. The ACLU pointed, for example, to [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD) issuance of [[TALON (database)|Threat and Local Observation Notices]] (TALON) depicting [[Veterans for Peace]] and other anti-war groups as "terrorist threats." The ACLU also raised concerns about military involvement in "[[fusion center]]s."&lt;ref name="ACLUReport"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Spyfiles_2_0.pdf| title=POLICING FREE SPEECH: Police Surveillance and Obstruction of First Amendment-Protected Activity| publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil liberties====
The federal [[Posse Comitatus Act]] of 1878 forbids the U.S. military from conducting domestic law enforcement activities, embodying "the traditional American principle of separating civilian and military authority."&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;Matthew Carlton Hammond, [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1576&amp;context=law_lawreview The Posse Comitatus Act: A Principle in Need of Renewal], ''Washington University Law Review'', Vol. 75, issue 2 (January 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been exceptions made, however: in 1981, Congress enacted legislation allowing military involvement in drug interdiction at U.S. borders, and eight years later "designated the Department of Defense as the 'single lead agency' in drug interdiction efforts."&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt; In the late 1990s, following the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], there were proposals to further limit the act to allow military participation in law enforcement activities in chemical/biological weapon and terrorism cases.&lt;ref name="KopelOlson"&gt;David B. Kopel &amp; Joseph Olson, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=10476 Preventing a Reign of Terror: Civil Liberties Implications of Terrorism Legislation], 21 ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' 247 (summer/fall 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; These anti-terrorism proposals were criticized by some commentators on the basis that they were a threat to civil liberties.&lt;ref name="KopelOlson"/&gt; Writers such as [[U.S. Air Force]] officer [[Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.]] critiqued proposals to use the military for internal security, on the basis that "No one should suffer the illusion that military forces could ever execute the laws with the same sensitivity to civil liberties as regular police forces." Dunlap argued that "the central imperatives of military service" was "destroying targets and undermining enemy command and control"&amp;mdash;a skill that did not necessary carry over into intelligence-gathering and investigation. Under this view, "a successful policization of the armed forces may well render it incapable of defeating authentic external military threats."&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Dunlap, Jr., [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6040&amp;context=faculty_scholarship The Police-ization of the Military], ''Journal of Political and Military Sociology'' Vol. 27 (Winter 1999), pp. 217-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerating militarization of regular law enforcement during the [[War on Drugs]] and post-[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] [[War on Terror]], however, prompted some commentators to express alarm at the blurring of the distinction between civil and military functions, and the potential to erode constraints on governmental power in times of perceived crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail R. Hall &amp; Christoper J. Coyne, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2122384 The Militarization of U.S. Domestic Policing], ''Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy'', vol. 17, no. 4 (spring 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 paper published in the journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'' examined "role convergence, that is, evidence that significant segments of police operations in the United States have taken on military characteristics; and evidence indicating that many U.S. military initiatives have taken on policing characteristics."&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell"&gt;Donald J. Campbell &amp; Kathleen M. Campbell, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249775935_Soldiers_as_Police_Officers_Police_Officers_as_Soldiers_Role_Evolution_and_Revolution_in_the_United_States Soldiers as Police Officers/Police Officers as Soldiers: Role Evolution and Revolution in the United States], ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 36(2), pp. 347-48 (January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that "for individual citizens and for society as a whole, at least one aspect of role convergence—the militarization of the police—is potentially troublesome. If this convergence results in the police adopting not only military-type tactics and procedures but also military attitudes and orientations, the convergence may seriously threaten traditional civil rights and liberties."&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell"/&gt;

A 2014 report by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], ''War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing'', concluded that "American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized...," citing an increase in the use in unnecessarily aggressive SWAT raids, "tactics designed for the battlefield"; and military equipment such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s, and [[battering ram]]s, as well as a lack of transparency and oversight.&lt;ref name="WarComesHome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf| title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Ilya Shapiro]] have argued that military leads to "extreme constitutional violations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cato.org/blog/police-militarization-leads-extreme-constitutional-violations| author=Ilya Shapiro and Randal John Meyer| title=Police Militarization Leads to Extreme Constitutional Violations| publisher=Cato Institute| date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SWAT teams and military-style raid tactics====
Peter Kraska, a criminal justice professor at [[Eastern Kentucky University]], found that the prevalence of SWAT teams, among police agencies serving populations of at least 50,000 people, doubled from the mid-1980s to the late-1990s, rising to 89% of police agencies by the end of this time period. Among smaller police agencies (covering areas  with between 25,000 and 50,000 people), the proportion with SWAT teams rose from 20% in the mid-198-s to 80% in the mid-2000s. Kraska states that: "When people refer to the militarization of police, it's not in a pejorative or judgmental sense.Contemporary police agencies have moved significantly along a continuum culturally, materially, operationally, while using a [[Navy SEALs]] model. All of those are clear indications that they're moving away from a civilian model of policing."&lt;ref name="Sanburn"&gt;Josh Sanburn, [http://time.com/2907307/aclu-swat-local-police/ This Is Why Your Local Police Department Might Have a Tank], ''Time'' (June 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 ACLU report, ''War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing'', concluded that "American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized..."&lt;ref name="WarComesHome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf| title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examined 818 uses of SWAT teams by more than 20 law enforcement agencies in 11 U.S. states from the period of July 2010 to October 2013.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"&gt;Ed Pilkington, [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/24/military-us-police-swat-teams-raids-aclu US police departments are increasingly militarised, finds report], ''The Guardian'' (June 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Military-style tactics used by such teams include nighttime raids, use of [[battering ram]]s, use of [[flashbang]]s, overwhelming displays of force, and the wearing of helmets and masks.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers Paramilitary police: Cops or soldiers? America's police have become too militarised], ''The Economist'' (March 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of SWAT teams became especially common for [[Drug crime|drug]] searches.

==Types of teams and weapons==

===SWAT teams===
[[File:Falls SWAT team member.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A member of the Wichita Falls SWAT team conducts a rifle drill.]]
{{main|SWAT}}
[[SWAT]] (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams are law enforcement units in the United States that use specialized or military equipment and tactics. First created in the 1960s for [[riot control]] or violent confrontations with [[crime|criminals]], the number and usage of SWAT teams increased in the 1980s and 1990s during the [[War on Drugs]], and in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In the United States today, SWAT teams are deployed 50,000-80,000 times every year, 80% of the time in order to serve search warrants, most often for narcotics. SWAT teams are increasingly equipped with military-type hardware and are trained to deploy against threats of [[terrorism]], for [[crowd control]], and in situations beyond the capabilities of ordinary law enforcement, sometimes deemed "high-risk." Other countries have developed their own [[paramilitary]] police units (PPU)s that are also described as or compared to SWAT police forces. SWAT units are often equipped with specialized firearms including [[submachine gun]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, [[breaching round|breaching shotguns]], [[sniper rifle]]s, [[riot control agent]]s, and stun grenades. They have specialized equipment including heavy body armor, ballistic shields, entry tools, armored vehicles, advanced night vision optics, and motion detectors for covertly determining the positions of hostages or hostage takers, inside enclosed structures.

The increased use of SWAT teams is a hallmark of increased police militarization. The Cato Institute's [[Radley Balko]] wrote that during the 1970s, there were about 300 SWAT raids a year and as of 2005 there were 40,000 a year. SWAT teams being used for gambling crackdowns and serving a search warrant are routine in some places, like Fairfax, VA.&lt;ref name = "Balko"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balko|first=Radley|title=Overkill: The Latest Trend in Policing|work=The Washington Post|date=February 5, 2006|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;"There has been a more than 1400% increase in the amount of SWAT deployments between 1980 and 2000, according to estimates...by [[Eastern Kentucky University]] professor Peter Kraska."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri |title=Ferguson police: a stark illustration of newly militarised US law enforcement |last1=Swaine |first1=Jon|last2=Holpuch|first2=Amanda |date=August 14, 2014 |work=The Guardian |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balko states that in 2007, "...a Dallas SWAT team raided a Veterans [organization's]... charity poker games. In 2010, a team of heavily armed Orange County, Florida, sheriff's deputies raided several barbershops, holding barbers and customers at gunpoint while they turned the shops inside out. Of the 37 people arrested, 34 were taken in for "barbering without a license."&lt;ref&gt;[http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/catosletter-v11n4.pdf http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/catosletter-v11n4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Orlando barbershop raids were subsequently challenged in court, and in 2014, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] ruled that it violated "[[Qualified immunity|clearly established]] Fourth Amendment rights" for the government to conduct "a run-of-the-mill administrative inspection as though it is a criminal raid."&lt;ref&gt;Radley Balko, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/09/19/federal-appeals-court-stop-using-swat-style-raids-for-regulatory-inspections/ Federal appeals court: Stop using SWAT-style raids for regulatory inspections], ''Washington Post'' (September 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU has stated that "... heavily armed SWAT teams are raiding people's homes in the middle of the night, often just to search for drugs", causing people to "needlessly di[e] during these raids," in which neighborhoods are turned into "warzones".&lt;ref name="aclu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing|title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snipers===


[[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement]] [[sniper]]s, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. [[Police]] forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in [[hostage]] scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a SWAT team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: "Be prepared to take a life to save a life."&lt;ref name="cbssniper"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/25/60II/main267184.shtml |title=The Sniper, SWAT Teams Grow In Number |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=May 4, 2008| date=January 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under {{convert|100|m|yd|0|sp=us}} and sometimes even less than {{convert|50|m|yd|0|sp=us}}. Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills.
[[File:Secret Service on White House roof.jpg|thumb|left|A [[U.S. Secret Service]] sniper on the roof of the [[White House]]]]

Police units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team, which may have a dedicated sniper. Police snipers placed in vantage points, such as high buildings, can provide security for events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2007/09/06/2025679.htm |title=Police sniper watches from roof, Sydney |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |date= September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one high-profile incident, Mike Plumb, a SWAT sniper in [[Columbus, Ohio Division of Police|Columbus, Ohio]], prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual's hand, leaving him unharmed.&lt;ref name="nasta"&gt;{{cite web|ref = harv|year = 2010|url = http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|title = The Columbus Ohio Police|publisher = The Columbus Ohio Police|accessdate = May 7, 2010|last = Scanlon|first = James J.|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031206083809/http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|archivedate = December 6, 2003|df = }} - [https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cold_blooded/badass-sniper-cleanly-shoots-the-gun-out-of-a-crazy-mans-hand-291329.php?autoplay=true News footage of sniper shooting gun out of a persons hand]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USCG TACLET Airborne Use of Force.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Coast Guard [[Law Enforcement Detachments|TACLET]] marksman uses an M107 from a helicopter.]]

The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the [[Munich massacre]] when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all of the [[Israel]]i hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of snipers of the German army in the scenario was impossible due to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]'s explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of police trained snipers was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]], which subsequently became a widely copied model for a police special forces unit.

In September 2015, a San Bernardino Sheriff's Department sniper shot a suspect in a fast-moving car from a helicopter. The suspect leapt from his car and died on the side of the road, but his vehicle continued forward, striking another vehicle and critically injuring three civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/09/18/suspect-injured-in-deputy-involved-shooting-along-215-freeway/| title=Suspect Dies After Deputy Opens Fire From Helicopter Along 215 Freeway| publisher=CBS Los Angeles| date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest policing===
[[Image:Mótmæli vörubílstjóra 1.jpg|thumb|Rank of [[Icelandic National Police]] officers in full riot gear during the [[2008 Icelandic lorry driver protests]]]]
Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of [[protest]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[Riot police]] are [[police]] who are organized, deployed, trained or equipped to confront [[crowd]]s, [[protests]] or [[riot]]s. Riot police may be regular police who act in the role of riot police in particular situations or they may be separate units organized within or in parallel to regular police forces. Riot police are used in a variety of different situations and for a variety of different purposes. They may be employed to [[riot control|control riots]] as their name suggests, to disperse or [[crowd control|control crowds]], to maintain [[public order]] or discourage [[criminal]]ity, or to protect people or property. In some cases, riot police may function as a tool of [[political repression]] by violently breaking up protests and suppressing [[dissent]] or [[civil disobedience]].
[[File:WTO protests in Seattle November 30 1999.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A riot policeman sprays [[pepper spray]] at seated protesters during the [[Battle for Seattle|WTO protests in Seattle in 1999.]]]]
Riot police often use special equipment termed [[riot gear]] to help protect themselves and attack protesters or rioters. Riot gear typically includes [[personal armor]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], [[riot shields]] and [[riot helmet]]s. Many riot police teams also deploy specialized [[less-than-lethal]] weapons, such as [[pepper spray]], [[tear gas]], rifles that fire [[rubber bullets]] or [[plastic bullet]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s, and [[Long Range Acoustic Device]]s (sound cannons).

The police tactics used during the 2001 [[Quebec City protest]] serve as an example of the approaches used by North American riot police. During the protest, riot police fired [[tear gas]] canisters, [[water cannon]], and [[rubber bullets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|title=Direct Action: An Ethnography|publisher=[[AK Press]]|year=2009|page=185|ISBN=978-190485979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; dispersing large groupings of protesters both violent and peaceful, including teach-ins and teams of medics providing first aid to other protesters.

Some U.S. SWAT teams have adopted the [[AR-15]] carbine. Some U.S. police departments are using the [[M4 carbine]], which will replace the M16 as the main U.S. Army combat [[assault rifle]]. "After the [[North Hollywood shootout]] in 1997, the Department of Defense gave 600 surplus [[M16 rifle|M16]] [[assault rifle]]s to LAPD, which were issued to each patrol sergeant. Various U.S. SWAT teams are armed with the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], a [[submachine gun]].

U.S. law enforcement agencies such as the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), and the [[Pittsburgh Bureau of Police]] (PBP) use the [[Barrett M82]]. Police use the M82 to breach barriers, because the large-calibre [[.50 BMG]] round it fires will penetrate most commercial brick walls and [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete blocks]]. It is an [[anti-materiel rifle]] designated as a Special Application Sniper Rifle and designed for use against military equipment (materiel), rather than against other [[combatant]]s ("[[Anti-personnel weapon|anti-personnel]]"). It is used by many armies around the world both in regular forces and in special forces units. As it uses a .50 BMG round, this has led to some debates in the U.S. armed forces about the legality of using such a large anti-materiel rifle round against a human. There have been persistent reports that some U.S. military personnel believe that the use of .50 BMG in a direct antipersonnel role is prohibited by the [[Laww of war|laws of war]]. However, Maj. Hays Parks states that "No treaty language exists (either generally or specifically) to support a limitation on [the use of .50 BMG] against personnel, and its widespread, longstanding use in this role suggests that such antipersonnel employment is the customary practice of nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/killing-myth |title=Killing A Myth |last1=Parks |first1=Maj W.

In October 2011, a Downey, California police officer shot an unarmed suspect named Michael Nida, who had been mistaken for an armed robber, in the back with a submachine gun, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff writers|title=No charges against Downey officer who shot unarmed man, D.A. says|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/michael-nida-shooting-downey-officer-no-charges.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 24, 2012|access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The 2015 video game ''[[Battlefield Hardline]]'' depicts a militarized police, and it depicts both police and criminals wielding military equipment including rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers. The developer's insistence on "fantasy" while meticulously recreating LA areas and loosely basing crimes in the game on real-life crimes has subsequently been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/battlefield-hardline-reviewcop-out.html|title=Battlefield Hardline Review: Cop Out|work=Paste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/soldier-cops-are-giving-games-like-battlefield-an-image-1620511782|title=Soldier Cops Aren't So Fun Now, Video Games|author=Luke Plunkett|work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmi.kotaku.com/why-2014s-battlefield-is-just-avoiding-uncomfortable-to-1593412680|title=Why 2014's Battlefield Is 'Just Avoiding' Uncomfortable Topics|author=Nathan Grayson|work=TMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''Do Not Resist'' by Craig Atkinson is also critical of the phenomenon of police militarization, as exemplified by law enforcement training courses taught by retired military officer [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]], who tells police officers, "You are men and women of violence."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1387">The '''National Service Act (1951)''' was [[Australia]]n federal legislation providing for the compulsory call-up of males turning 18 on or after 1 November 1950, for service training of 176 days. Trainees were required to remain on the [[military reserve force|Reserve]] of the Commonwealth Military Forces (CMF) for five years from initial call up. Men could nominate the service in which they wished to be trained. Those nominating the [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]] or the [[Royal Australian Air Force|Air Force]] were considered only if they volunteered for service outside Australia. The first call-up notice was issued on 12 April 1951. 

Between 1951 and 1959 over 500,000 men registered, 52 intakes were organised and some 227,000 men were trained. 

In 1957 National Service with the Navy and the Air Force was discontinued. Registration remained compulsory but the intake to the [[Australian Army|Army]] was cut to almost a third (12,000 trainees) by instituting a ballot for selection. On 24 November 1959 Cabinet decided that National Service call-ups should be terminated and that arrangements for the January 1960 intake would be cancelled

Sattlekau used false representations to get a woman to loan him money that he never intended to repay. Sattlekau's false representations included false statement about actual facts, and other false sttements that were promises and intentions about the future. The false statements included that he owned a hotel, that there was a fire, a promise to return the loan, and that he intended to marry her.

# the right to use the good
# the right to earn income from the good
# the right to transfer the good to others
# the right to enforce property rights

In economics, property is usually considered to be ownership ([[Property income|rights to the proceeds generated by the property]]) and control over a resource or good. Many economists effectively argue that property rights need to be fixed and need to portray the relationships among other parties in order to be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12021/full|title=Private Property Rights, Investment Patterns, and Asset Structure|first=Zhiyong|last=An|date=1 November 2013|publisher=|journal=Econ Polit|volume=25|issue=3|pages=481–495|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/ecpo.12021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regimes ==
Property rights to a good must be defined, their use must be monitored, and possession of rights must be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Community-Based Natural Resource Management in Southern Africa: An Introduction|journal=AuthorHouse|date= 2013|first=K. et al.|last=Mulale}}&lt;/ref&gt;The costs of defining, monitoring, and enforcing property rights are termed [[transaction costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Measurement Costs and the Organization of Markets|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date= April 1982|first=Yoram|last=Barzel|volume=25|issue=1|pages=27–48|id= |doi=10.1086/467005|issn=0022-2186|jstor=725223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas Allen, |title=What are Transaction Costs? (Research in Law and Economics) |publisher=Jai Pr |location= |year=1991 |isbn=0-7623-1115-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of transaction costs, various forms of property rights institutions will develop. Each institutional form can be described by the distribution of rights.

The following list is ordered from no property rights defined to all property rights being held by individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Daniel W. Bromley, |title=Environment and Economy: Property Rights and Public Policy |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year= 1991|isbn=1-55786-087-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-access property (''[[res nullius]]'') is not 'owned' by anyone. It is non-excludable (no one can exclude anyone else from using it) but may be [[rivalry (economics)|rival]] (one person's use of it reduces the quantity available to other users). Open-access property is not managed by anyone, and access to it is not controlled. There is no constraint on anyone using open-access property (excluding people is either impossible or prohibitively costly). Examples of open-access property are the upper atmosphere (navigable airspace) or ocean fisheries (navigable waterways).

{{quote|text=Open-access property may exist because ownership has never been established, granted, by laws within a particular country, or because no effective controls are in place, or feasible, i.e., the cost of exclusion outweighs the benefits. The government can sometimes effectively convert open access property into private, common or public property through the land grant process, by legislating to define public/private rights previously not granted.|sign=Kevin Guerin|source=&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;Guerin, K. (2003). ''Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective''. Wellington, New Zealand: NZ Treasury&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Public property]] (also known as [[state property]]) is property that is owned by all, but its access and use are controlled by the state or community. An example is a national park or a state-owned enterprise.&lt;ref name="NZ"/&gt;
* [[Common property]] or collective property is property that is owned by a group of individuals. Access, use, and exclusion are controlled by the joint owners. True commons can break down, but, unlike open-access property, common property owners have greater ability to manage conflicts through shared benefits and enforcement.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;
* [[Private property]] is both excludable and rival. Private property access, use, exclusion and management are controlled by the private owner or a group of legal owners.

== The environment ==
Implicit or explicit property rights can be created by regulating the environment, either through prescriptive [[Command and control (government)|command and control]] approaches (e.g. limits on input/output/discharge quantities, specified processes/equipment, audits) or by [[market-based instruments]] (e.g. taxes, transferable permits or quotas),&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt; and more recently through cooperative, self-regulatory, post-regulatory and reflexive law approaches.&lt;ref&gt;See literature on post-regulatory approaches and reflexive law, especially literature from Gunther Teubner. See also the example of the 'conservation property right'&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Conservation Property Right]]

It has been proposed by [[Ronald Coase]] that clearly defining and assigning property rights would resolve environmental problems by internalizing externalities and relying on incentives of private owners to conserve resources for the future.  At common law nuisance and tort law allows adjacent property holders to seek compensation when individual actions diminish the air and water quality for adjacent landowners.
Critics of this view argue that this assumes that it is possible to internalize all environmental benefits, that owners will have perfect information, that scale economies are manageable, transaction costs are bearable, and that legal frameworks operate efficiently.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;

== Literature ==
In 2013 researchers&lt;ref&gt;Mike Denison and Robyn Klingler-Vidra, October 2012, Annotated Bibliography for Rapid Review on Property Rights, Economics and Private Sector Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services (EPS PEAKS)https://partnerplatform.org/?tcafmd80&lt;/ref&gt; produced an annotated bibliography on the property rights literature concerned with two principal outcomes: (a) reduction in investors risk and increase in incentives to invest, and (b) improvements in household welfare; the researchers explored the channels through which property rights affect growth and household welfare in developing countries. They found that better protection of property rights can affect several development outcomes, including better management of natural resources.

Despite the overwhelming evidence on the economic relevance of property rights however, only recently economists have begun to study their determinants by looking at the trade-off between the dispersed coercive power in a state of anarchy and the predation by a central authority. To illustrate, incomplete property rights allow agents with valuation lower than that of the original owners of economic value to inefficiently expropriate them distorting in this way their investment and effort exertion decisions. When instead, the state is entrusted the power to protect property, it might directly expropriate private parties if not sufficiently constrained by an efficient political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Development Economics|last=Besley, Timothy|first=and Maitreesh Ghatak|publisher=Elsevier|year=2010|isbn=|location=Amsterdam|pages=4525–4595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The necessity of strong protection of property for efficiency has been however criticized by a vast legal scholarship, originated from the seminal contribution by [[Guido Calabresi]] and [[Douglas Melamed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calabresi, Guido|first=and Melamed, A. Douglas|date=1972|title=Property Rules, Liability Rules and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=85 |pages=1089–1128|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors argue that in the face of transaction costs sufficiently sizeable to prevent consensual trade, legalized private expropriation in the form of, for instance, liability rules can be welfare-increasing. [[Carmine Guerriero]] blends these two different strands of literature by linking property rights protection, transaction costs, and preference heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerriero|first=Carmine|date=2016|title=Endogenous Property Rights|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/686985|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=59 |issue=2|doi=10.1086/686985|pmid=|access-date=|pages=313–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; To elaborate, when property is fully protected, some agents with valuation higher than that of the original owners will be unable to legally acquire value because of sizable transaction costs. When the protection of property is weak instead, low-valuation potential buyers inefficiently expropriate original owners. Hence, a rise in the heterogeneity of the potential buyers' valuations makes inefficient expropriation by low-valuation potential buyers be more important from a social welfare point of view than inefficient exclusion from trade and so induces stronger property rights.  Crucially, this prediction survives even after considering production and investment activities and it is consistent with a novel dataset on the rules on the acquisition of ownership through adverse possession and on the use of government takings to transfer real property from a private party to another private party prevailing in 126 jurisdictions. These data measure “horizontal property rights” and thus the extent of protection of property from “direct and indirect private takings,” which are ubiquitous forms of expropriation that occur daily within the rule of law and are thus different from predation by the state and the elites, which is much less common but has been the focus of the economics literature. To capture preference diversity, the author uses the contemporary genetic diversity, which is a primitive metric of the genealogical distance between populations with a common ancestor and so of the differences in characteristics transmitted across generations, such as preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Geography of Human Genes|last=Cavalli-Sforza, Luca L.|first=Paolo Menozzi, and Alberto Piazza|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regression analysis reveals that the protection of the original owners' property rights is the strongest where contemporary genetic diversity is the largest. Evidence from several different identification strategies suggests that this relationship is indeed causal.

== Property rights approach to the theory of the firm ==
The property rights approach to the theory of the firm based on the [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] paradigm was developed by [[Sanford J. Grossman|Sanford Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]], and [[John Hardman Moore|John Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261404|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1986|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 691–719|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261729|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1990|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 1119–1158|volume = 98|issue = 6|doi = 10.1086/261729|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors argue that in the real world, contracts are incomplete and hence it is impossible to contractually specify what decisions will have to be taken in any conceivable state of the world. There will be renegotiations in the future, so parties have insufficient investment incentives (since they will only get a fraction of the investment's return in future negotiations); i.e., there is a [[hold-up problem]]. Hence, property rights matter, because they determine who has control over future decisions if no agreement will be reached. In other words, property rights determine the parties' future bargaining positions (while their bargaining powers, i.e. their fractions of the renegotiation surplus, are independent of the property rights allocation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bargaining position, bargaining power, and the property rights approach|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517651300030X|journal = Economics Letters|date = 2013|pages = 28–31|volume = 119|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.econlet.2013.01.011|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach to the theory of the firm can thus explain pros and cons of integration in the context of private firms.

== The role of property rights in economic and political development ==
Classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[Karl Marx]] generally recognize the importance of property rights in the process of economic development, and modern mainstream economics agree with such a recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Besley|first= Timothy|last2= Maitreesh|first2= Ghatak|date= 2009|editor-last= Rodrik|editor-first= Dani|editor2-last= Rosenzweig|editor2-first= Mark R|title= Property Rights and Economic Development|url= |journal= Handbook of Development Economics|publisher= New York: Elsevier|volume= V|pages= 4526–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely-accepted explanation is that well-enforced property rights provide incentives for individuals to participate in economic activities, such as investment, innovation and trade, which lead to a more efficient market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James|date= 2005|title= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth|url= |journal= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= 1|pages= 397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of property rights in Europe during the Middle Ages provides an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James A.|date= 2005|title= Chapter 6 Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|journal= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= Volume 1|pages= 385–472|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 978-0-444-52041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this epoch, full political power came into the hands of hereditary monarchies, which often abused their power to exploit producers, to impose arbitrary taxes, or to refuse to pay their debts. The lack of protection for property rights provided little incentive for landowners and merchants to invest in land, physical or human capital, or technology. After the [[First English Civil War| English Civil War]] of 1642-1646 and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, shifts of political power away from the Stuart monarchs led to the strengthening of property rights of both land and capital owners. Consequently, rapid economic development took place, setting the stage for [[Industrial Revolution]].

Property rights are also believed to lower transaction costs by providing an efficient resolution for conflicts over scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Alchian|first= Armen|last2= Demsetz|first2= Harold|date= 1973|title= The Property Right Paradigm|url= |journal= The Journal of Economic History|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 16–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirically, using historical data of former European colonies, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson find substantial evidence that good economic institutions – those that provide secure property rights and equality of opportunity – lead to economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James|date= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ4JBwLsz8cC|title= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= 1|pages= 385–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property rights might be closely related to the evolution of political order, due to their protections of an individual's claims on economic rents.{{cn|date=August 2018}} North, Wallis and Weingast argue that [[origin of property rights | property rights originate]] to facilitate elites' rent-seeking activities. Particularly, the legal and political systems that protect elites' claims on rent revenues form the basis of the so-called "limited access order", in which non-elites are denied access to political power and economic privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= North|first= Douglass C|last2= Wallis|first2= John J|last3= Weingast|first3= Barry R|date= 2006|title= A conceptual framework for interpreting recorded human history|url= |journal= National Bureau of Economic Research|volume= 12795|pages= 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a historical study of medieval England, for instance, North and Thomas find that the dramatic development of English land laws in the 13th century resulted from elites' interests in exploiting rent revenues from land ownership after a sudden rise in land price in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= North|first= Douglass C|last2= Thomas|first2= Robert P|date= 1971|title= The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Theoretical Model|url= |journal= The Journal of Economic History|volume= 31|issue= 4|pages= 777–803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the modern "open access order", which consists of a democratic political system and a free- market economy, usually features widespread, secure and impersonal property rights. Universal property rights, along with impersonal economic and political competition, downplay the role of rent-seeking and instead favor innovations and productive activities in a modern economy.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Redirect-distinguish|Revenue rule|revenue ruling}}
The '''rule against foreign revenue enforcement''', often abbreviated to the '''revenue rule''', is a general legal principle that the courts of one country will not enforce the tax laws of another country.&lt;ref name=Mallinak&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallinak |first1=Brenda |date= |title=The Revenue Rule: A Common Law Doctrine for the Twenty First Century |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&amp;context=djcil |journal=Duke Journal of Comparative &amp; International Law |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=79-124 |doi= |access-date=16 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Curl&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://9stonebuildings.com/publications/jc_purposive_approach.pdf |title=A purposive approach to the rule against foreign revenue enforcement|last1=Curl |first1=Joseph |journal=International Corporate Rescue  |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=137-139 |access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=A.N.

In ''State of Colorado v. Harbeck'' 133 N.E. 357, 360 (N.Y. 1921) the court referred to :
{{Cquote|The ... well-settled  principle  of  private  international law which precludes one state from acting as a collector of taxes for a sister state and from enforcing its penal or revenue laws as such.  The rule is universally recognized that the revenue laws of one state have no force in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniset.ca/other/cs3/133NE357.html|title=''Colorado v. Harbeck''|publisher=Uniset|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rule has been repeatedly applied in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Government of India v Taylor]]'' [1955] AC 491&lt;/ref&gt; the USA,&lt;ref&gt;''Moore v. Mitchell'', 30 F.2d 600, 600 (2d Cir. 1929)&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;''United States v.

==History of the rule==

The earliest reported case on the rule is believed to be ''Attorney General v Lutwydge'' (1729) Bumb 280, 145 ER 674.  In that case the English courts refused to enforce a bond for Scottish tobacco duties.  In 1775 [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield CJ]] famously pronounced in ''[[Holman v Johnson]]'' (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343, 98 ER 1120 at 1121 that "no country ever takes notice of the revenue laws of another."  In 1779 he repeated that position in ''Planche v Fletcher'' (1779) 1 Douglas 251, 99 ER 164.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniset.ca/other/css/99ER164.html|title=''Planche v Fletcher|publisher=Uniset|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English law==

Although the rule had been referred to an applied in a number of English cases from as early as 1729,&lt;ref&gt;Cases where the rule was applied or referred to include: ''Municipal Council of Sydney v Bull'' [1909] 1 KB 7; ''King of the Hellenes v Brostrom'' [1923] 16 Lloyd’s List LR 190; ''Queen of Holland v Drukker'' [1928] 1 Ch 877 and ''Re Visser'' [1928] Ch 877.&lt;/ref&gt; the rule itself was not considered beyond doubt in England until the decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Government of India v Taylor]]'' [1955] AC 491.&lt;ref name=Cheshire&gt;{{cite book|title=Cheshire &amp; North's Private International Law|author=P.M. North and J.J. Fawcett |publisher=Butterworths |edition=12th |year=1992 |isbn=0406530815 |page=114 |quote=Although it has been generally accepted, at any rate since the time of Lord Mansfield, that no action lies in England for the enforcement of a foreign revenue law, authority for the proposition long remained a little nebulous ... All doubts were, however, stilled in 1955 by the decision of the House of Lords in ''Government of India v Taylor''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case the House of Lords unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal (who had in turn unanimously upheld the trial judge) that the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] of an English company could not pay out sums to a foreign Government because the tax claim was not justiciable in England.

The rule as it applies under [[English law]] is summarised in [[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins]] at Rule 3:
{{cquote|''RULE 3 - English courts have no jurisdiction to entertain an action (1) for the enforcement, either directly or indirectly, of a penal, revenue or other public law of a foreign State; or (2) founded upon an act of state.''&lt;ref name=Dicey&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins|Dicey Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws]]|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |edition=14th |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-421-88360-4|at=para 5R-019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Re State of Norway's Application (No 2)'' [1990] 1 AC 723 the Norwegian government sought the assistance from the English courts in collecting evidence in relation to a tax claim.  The respondent resisted the application on the basis that it violated the revenue rule, but the House of Lords held that assisting with the collection of evidence would not violate the rule.  [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] said "It is of importance to observe that that rule is limited to cases of direct or indirect enforcement in this country of the revenue laws of a foreign state. It is plain that the present case is not concerned with the direct enforcement of the revenue laws of the State of Norway. Is it concerned with their indirect enforcement? I do not think so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniset.ca/other/cs6/1990AC723.html|title=''Re State of Norway's Application (No 2)''|publisher=Uniset|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''QRS 1 Aps v Frandsen'' [1999] 1 WLR 2169 it was held that to uphold a contractual provision between two private contracting parties for an indemnity against the payment of foreign taxes would not constitute an indirect enforcement of a foreign tax claim, and so was enforceable.

==United States==

The revenue rule has been repeatedly applied by courts in the United States.&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silver |first1=Barbara |url=http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1524&amp;context=gjicl |title=Modernizing the Revenue Rule: The Enforcement of Foreign Tax Judgments |journal=Georgia Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law |volume=22 |issue=3 |year=1933 |pages=609-633 |accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule was first applied in the United States in 1806 in ''Ludlow v. Van Rensselaer'' 1 Johns. R. 94 (N.Y. 1806).&lt;ref name=Mallinak /&gt;

Initially the rule was also applied to claims for taxes made by other states within the USA.  In ''Maryland v. Turner'' 132 N.Y. 173, 174 (1911) the courts of New York state refused to enforce a judgment debt relating to taxes due in Maryland.  In ''Colorado v. Harbeck'' 133 N.E. 357, 360 (N.Y. 1921) it was held that there was a "well-settled  principle  of  private  international law which precludes one state from acting as a collector of taxes for a sister state and from enforcing its penal or revenue laws as such.  The rule is universally recognized that the revenue laws of one state have no force in another."&lt;ref name=Mallinak /&gt;  However in ''Moore v. Mitchell'' 30 F.2d 600, 600 (2d Cir. 1929) the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] limited the application of the rule in the interstate context.

In ''Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co.'' 296 U.S. 268, 268 (1935) the Supreme Court was asked to consider whether revenue laws of other states should be enforced under the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]].  The Supreme Court declined to extend the full faith and credit provision to revenue statutes themselves, but limited its ruling to enforcement of tax judgments handed down in the courts of other states.&lt;ref name=Mallinak /&gt;

==Canada==

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has upheld and applied the revenue rule in ''United States v. Harden'' [1963] SCR 366.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7322/index.do|title=''United States v. Harden'' |publisher=Lexum |accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law jurisdictions==

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] (as opposed to [[common law jurisdictions|common law]]) jurisdictions will not generally entertain foreign tax claims on the basis that they are public laws, and therefore cannot be enforced outside of the state or territory.&lt;ref name=Krishnan&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lakshmisri.com/News-and-Publications/Publications/Articles/Tax/the-revenue-rule-international-taxation|title=The Revenue Rule and International Taxation|publisher=Lakshmikumaran &amp; Sridharan|author=Sumitha Krishnan|date=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Swedish case of ''Bulgariska Staten v Takvorian'' (NJA 1954 s.268)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svjt.se/svjt/1956/22|title=FOLKRÄTTSFRÅGOR I DEN INOMSTATLIGA RÄTTSSKIPNINGEN|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court held "a state cannot use a Swedish court to collect taxes or to have other contributions made to a foreign state".&lt;ref name=Krishnan /&gt;

==Criticism==

The rule has been subjected to criticism.  Professor Adrian Briggs of [[Oxford University]] has criticised it on the basis that it promotes the evasion of tax liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs |first1=Adrian |title=The Revenue Rule in the Conflict of Laws: Time for a Makeover|year=2001 |journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies |volume=96 |pages=280-295}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another commentator has called it "anachronistic and destructive".&lt;ref name=Silver /&gt;  But other commentators have defended it, both as a matter of practice and principle.&lt;ref name=Mallinak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Philip|title=Changing the Norm on Cross-border Enforcement of Debts |volume=30 |journal=Intertax|year=2002|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrogation==

Nations can, and do, abrogate the rule on a bilateral basis by treaty.  In {{cite bailii|litigants=Ben Nevis (Holdings) Limited v HMRC|year=2013|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=578}} the English courts enforced a claim for South African taxes under a bilateral treaty between the countries.  

However, whilst treaties to share information relating to taxable liabilities are common, or for relief from double taxation, treaties empowering nations to enforce each other's tax law are relatively uncommon.  Brenda Mallinak records that in 2006 the USA had only five such treaties, despite having a large number of international treaties for tax information exchange.&lt;ref name=Mallinak /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">{{Expert-subject|Law|date=April 2015}} '''''Scienter''''' is a legal term for [[intent (law)|intent]] or [[knowledge]] of [[wrongdoing]]. An offending party then has knowledge of the "wrongness" of an act or event prior to committing it.

For example, if a man sells a car with brakes that do not work to his friend, but the seller does not know about the brake problem, the seller then has no ''scienter''. If he sells the car and knew of the problem before he sold the car, he has ''scienter''.

The word has the same [[etymology|root]] as ''[[science]]'', the [[Latin]] ''scienter'' (knowingly), from ''scire'' (to know, to separate one thing from another).

==Scienter action in tort law==
The scienter action is a category within [[tort]] law in some [[common law]] jurisdictions that deals with the damage done by an animal directly to a human. It had a long history in [[English law]] until it was abolished by the [[Animals Act 1971]]. An action in the [[common law jurisdictions]] in which it has not been extinguished by statute is in addition to the torts of [[negligence]] and [[nuisance]] or more bespoke torts like [[cattle trespass]]. If an animal is known to behave in a certain way and is expressed on a person causing injury, an action can be taken in this tort, which also is not available in [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[South Australia]] or [[New Zealand]]. In those jurisdictions, the actions involving animals need to be in nuisance or negligence. 

To be successful, the plaintiff needs to take action against the person in control of the animal. It is [[strict liability]], requiring no more than proof of injury, the animal's having a problematic trait, and the knowledge of the person in control about the trait in the animal. Strict liability means that there is no need to argue fault in the form of wilful intent or negligence on the part of the animal or its controller. The only defence is if it can be proved the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of injury by their actions, or if the plaintiff was the cause of the injury. 

It is common to distinguish between harmless animals and wild animals, as no scienter is needed for wild animals. Animals are classed as wild or harmless on the basis of species or kind, not on the basis of being a tame individual. An elephant is considered wild regardless of its use. The scienter action is referred to in ''[[Rylands v. Fletcher]]'' in that one who keeps a wild thing "must keep it at his peril" to make reference to part of Justice [[Colin Blackburn]]'s comment.

==General use==

Scienter is generally used as a necessary condition of certain causes of civil action and as a standard for civil liability or criminal [[guilt (law)|guilt]]. For instance, Section 1960 of Title 18 of the [[United States Code]] provides a ''scienter'' condition, requiring that the accused "knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns" a prohibited type of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of scienter is uniformly expressed in the text of the U.S. Code as the word ''know'', appearing as "knowingly", "actual knowledge", "known", "knowledge fairly implied", etc.  The word ''scienter'' is not used in the text of the U.S. Code, although it appears once in a section title.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|7706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This use reflects the development of American law speaking plainly instead of employing Latin phrases of [[legal English]].

==In contract law==

''Scienter'' is also an element of the [[contract law]] [[cause of action]] for [[breach of contract]] in which the aggrieved party alleges some destruction of the [[meeting of the minds]], also known as mutual assent, because of [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]] or duress [[per minas]].

''Scienter'' can also be used as a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to a breach of contract [[lawsuit]].

==Element of claim of securities fraud==
In the [[United States]], to prevail in a securities fraud claim under Section 10(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant acted with ''scienter''.

The [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] of 1995 added the requirement that a plaintiff must plead facts giving rise to a "strong inference" of ''scienter''. The meaning of ''scienter'' under the 1995 law has been very controversial since its enactment. The [[United States Supreme Court]] issued a decision that clarified what was to be understood as a "strong inference." In ''Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, LTD'' (21 June 2007), an 8-1 ruling of the Court defined the standard that the plaintiff had to meet to proceed with a securities fraud litigation. A complaint must show "cogent and compelling evidence" of ''scienter''.

'''Self-defence''' is a legal doctrine which says that a person may use reasonable force in the defence of themselves or another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Law Act 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt; This defence arises both from common law and the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]. Self-defence is a [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] rather than an [[excuse]], that is, the defence says that the person's actions were not a crime at all.{{efn|For the rationale of self-defence see: Boaz Sangero, Self-Defence in Criminal Law 11 - 106 (Hart Publishing, 2006)}}

==Discussion==

===Common law (self defence)===

Self-defence in English law is a complete defence to all non-sexual offences involving the unlawful use of force (i.e. anything from [[battery (crime)|battery]] to murder). In other words, it results in a complete acquittal of the defendant. Generally speaking, the rationale is that the defendant is not guilty of the offence because the force used was not unlawful.

Because the defence results in a complete acquittal, the courts have interpreted the defence in a restrictive way so as to avoid acquitting too easily. For example, the courts will not usually acquit the defendant just because he thought the force used was reasonable – whether or not the force used was reasonable will be objectively assessed by the jury and not simply according to what the defendant thought at the time.

{{cquote|''A defendant is entitled to use reasonable force to protect himself, others for whom he is responsible and his property. … It must be reasonable.''|source=Beckford v The Queen [1988] AC 130&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarb.co.uk/beckford-v-the-queen-pc-15-jun-1987/ Beckford v The Queen] {{square bracket open}}1988{{square bracket close}} AC 130&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lord Morris in ''Palmer v R''&lt;ref name="Palmer1971"&gt;[http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-palmer-pc-1971/ ''R v Palmer''] PC 1971&lt;/ref&gt; stated the following about someone confronted by an intruder or defending himself against attack:

{{cquote|''If there has been an attack so that defence is reasonably necessary, it will be recognised that a person defending himself cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his defensive action. If the jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought necessary that would be the most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken…''|source=''Palmer v R'' [1971] AC 814}}

===Reasonable force===
Opinions differ as to what constitutes "reasonable force" but, in all cases, the defendant does not have the right to determine this because they would always maintain that they had acted reasonably and thus would never be guilty. The [[jury]], as ordinary members of the [[community]], must decide the amount of force reasonable in the circumstances of the case. It is relevant that the defendant was under pressure from imminent attack and may not have had time to make entirely rational decisions, so the test must balance the objective standard of a [[reasonable person]] by attributing some of the subjective knowledge of the defendant, including what he had believed about the circumstances, even if they were mistaken. However, even allowing for mistakes made in a crisis, the amount of force must be proportionate and reasonable given the value of the interests being protected and the harm likely to be caused by use of force. The classic test comes from the Australian case of ''Palmer v The Queen'', on appeal to the [[Privy Council]] in 1971:

{{cquote|''The defence of self-defence is one which can be and will be readily understood by any jury. It is a straightforward conception. It involves no abstruse legal thought. … Only common sense is needed for its understanding. It is both good law and good sense that a man who is attacked may defend himself. It is both good law and good sense that he may do, but may only do, what is reasonably necessary. But everything will depend upon the particular facts and circumstances. … It may in some cases be only sensible and clearly possible to take some simple avoiding action. Some attacks may be serious and dangerous. Others may not be. If there is some relatively minor attack it would not be common sense to permit some action of retaliation which was wholly out of proportion to the necessities of the situation. If an attack is serious so that it puts someone in immediate peril then immediate defensive action may be necessary. If the moment is one of crisis for someone in imminent danger he may have [to] avert the danger by some instant reaction. If the attack is all over and no sort of peril remains then the employment of force may be by way of revenge or punishment or by way of paying off an old score or may be pure aggression. There may no longer be any link with a necessity of defence… If a jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary that would be most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken.''|source=''Palmer v The Queen'' [1971] A.C. 814, 832}}

In ''R v Lindsay'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Lindsay'' (2005) AER (D) 349&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant, who picked up a sword in self-defence when attacked in his home by three masked intruders armed with loaded handguns, killed one of them by slashing him repeatedly. The prosecution case was that, although he had initially acted in self-defence, he had then lost his self-control and demonstrated a clear intent to kill the armed intruder. The Court of Appeal confirmed an eight-year term of imprisonment. It would not be expected that an ordinary householder who "went too far" when defending against armed intruders would receive such a long sentence.

The [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]] inserted a new section 76(6A) into the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] to clarify that there is no duty to retreat, although an opportunity to retreat may still be taken into account. In April 2013, the [[Crime and Courts Act 2013]] further amended section 76. This amended the law to allow homeowners to use disproportionate force, up to but not including ''grossly'' disproportionate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/76 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; This was further clarified by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in January 2016. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/home-owners-can-beat-up-burglars-using-disproportionate-force-rules-high-court-a6815626.html&lt;/ref&gt; Section 76 also clarified that the use of reasonable force may still be acceptable even if it was based on an honestly held belief, even if it was mistaken.

===Beliefs===
The modern law on belief is stated in ''R v Owino'':

{{cquote|''A person may use such force as is [objectively] reasonable in the circumstances as he [subjectively] believes them to be.''|source=''R v Owino'' (1996) 2 Cr. App. R. 128 at 134&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-owino-cacd-1996/ ''R v Owino''] (1996) 2 Cr. App. R. 128 at 134&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To gain an acquittal, the defendant must fulfil a number of conditions. The defendant must ''believe'', rightly or wrongly, that the attack is imminent. Lord Griffith said in ''Beckford v R'':

{{cquote|''A man about to be attacked does not have to wait for his assailant to strike the first blow or fire the first shot; circumstances may justify a pre-emptive strike.''|source=''R v Beckford'' (1988) 1 AC 130&lt;ref name=beckford&gt;[http://swarb.co.uk/beckford-v-the-queen-pc-15-jun-1987/ ''R v Beckford''] (1988) 1 AC 130&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The time factor is important. If there is an opportunity to retreat or to obtain protection from the police, the defendant should do so, thereby demonstrating an intention to avoid being involved in the use of violence. However, the defendant is not obliged to leave a particular location even if forewarned of the arrival of an assailant (see [[duty to retreat]]). Furthermore, a defendant does not lose the right to claim self-defence merely because they instigated the confrontation that created the alleged need for self-defence. A person who kills in the course of a quarrel or even crime they started might still act in self-defence if the 'victim' retaliates or counterattacks. In ''Rashford'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://lexisweb.co.uk/cases/2005/december/r-v-rashford ''R v Rashford''] [2005] EWCA Crim 3377&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant sought out the victim, intending to attack him in revenge for an earlier dispute, but the victim and his friends responded out of proportion to the defendant's aggression. At this point, the defendant had to switch from aggression to defence. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant will only lose the defence by being the aggressor throughout. The question is whether the defendant feared that he was in immediate danger from which he had no other means of escape, and if the violence he used was no more than appeared necessary to preserve his own life or protect himself from serious injury, he would be entitled to rely on self-defence. On the facts, the jury's decision to convict was not unsafe.

''R v Williams'' (Gladstone) (1984) also states reasonable force may still be used lawfully if mistaken. This case covered the use of force for self-defence when used mistakenly but under a genuine and honestly held belief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawteacher.net/cases/criminal-law/self-defence.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drink and drugs===
The issue of belief is more complicated when the defendant has consumed alcohol or [[Recreational drug use|drugs]]. In ''R v Letenock'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Letenock'' (1917) 12 Cr. App. R. 221&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant claimed mistakenly to believe that the victim was about to attack him. The judge directed the jury that his drunkenness was irrelevant unless he was so drunk as to be incapable of knowing what he was doing. The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed his conviction for murder and substituted a verdict of manslaughter. Lord Reading CJ said at 224:

{{cquote|''The only element of doubt in the case is whether there was anything which might have caused the applicant, in his drunken condition, to believe that he was going to be struck.''|source=''R v Letenock'' (1917) 12 Cr. App. R. 221}}

This suggests that the question is whether there was any intelligible basis for the defendant’s belief. ''Hatton''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawreports.co.uk/WLRD/2005/CACRIM/oct0.2.htm ''R v Hatton'' (2005) AER (D) 308]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130421021518/http://www.lawreports.co.uk/WLRD/2005/CACRIM/oct0.2.htm |date=2013-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; held that a defendant who raised the issue of self-defence was not entitled to rely on a mistaken belief induced by voluntary intoxication, regardless of whether the defence was raised against a charge of murder or one of manslaughter. This applied the ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' in ''R v O' Grady''&lt;ref&gt;''R v O' Grady'' (1987) 1 QB 995&lt;/ref&gt; for murder and ''R v Majewski''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Majewski'' (1987) AC 443&lt;/ref&gt; for manslaughter. It follows that, if the defendant is voluntarily drunk and kills in what he mistakenly imagines to be self-defence because he imagines (as in ''Hatton'') that the deceased was attacking him with a sword, he has no defence to a charge of murder; but if he claims to be so intoxicated that he is experiencing hallucinations and imagines that he is fighting giant snakes (as in ''Lipman'')&lt;ref&gt;''R v Lipman'' (1969) 3 AER 410&lt;/ref&gt; then he can be guilty only of manslaughter.

The House of Commons Library compiled a list of people who have acted in self-defence as part of its briefing on the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Householder Protection) Bill 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP05-10.pdf |first=Sally |last=Broadbridge |title=Research Paper 05/10 Criminal Law (Amendment) (Householder Protection) Bill |date=31 January 2005 |pages=12–18 |format=PDF |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory provision===
Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] provides that:
{{quote|(1) A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.}}

{{quote|(2) Subsection (1) above shall replace the rules of the common law on the question when force used for a purpose mentioned in the subsection is justified by that purpose.}}

This abolished common law rules on what was "reasonable," such as the [[duty to retreat]]. The definition of what constitutes a 'crime' was clarified under R v Jones (Margaret), R v Milling et al: HL 29 MAR 2006 which stated it covered any domestic criminal offence under English/Welsh law&lt;ref&gt;http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-jones-margaret-regina-v-milling-and-others-hl-29-mar-2006/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, reasonable force can be used in the prevention of any crime or in making an arrest to:
#allow the defendant to defend himself from any form of attack so long as the attack is criminal.
#prevent an attack on another person, e.g. in ''R v Rose'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Rose'' (1884) 15 Cox 540&lt;/ref&gt; a young son shot dead his father to protect his mother from a serious assault, believing that this was the only practical way of defending her given his small physical size.
#defend his property against criminal attack in the widest sense, i.e. it can be physical possessions like a watch or credit cards demanded by a [[Robbery|mugger]] (where there would also be physical danger to the owner) or, at the other extreme, possession of land.

The [[common law]] decision under ''R v Griffiths'' (1988) affirms the common law use of force as "an honestly held
belief that you or another, are in imminent danger, then you may use such force as is reasonable and necessary to
avert that danger".&lt;ref&gt;http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb5-l1g76 Section 76] of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] codifies English case law on self-defence. It made no changes to the law. However, the section was amended on 25 April 2013 by section 43 of the [[Crime and Courts Act 2013]] to allow people to use greater force in defence of their homes against burglars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; In those circumstances, force need no longer be reasonable as long as it is not "grossly disproportionate."

The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates into English law article 2 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which defines the right to life as follows:

# Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.
# Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:
#: (a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
#: (b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
#: (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.

==Arrest and private citizens==
{{main|Self-defence in English law}}
{{see also|Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms#United_Kingdom}}
{{see also|Right of self-defense}}

A private citizen does have a power to [[any person arrest]] ([[Citizen's arrest]]) under s24A [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE1984]] and the [[common law]] [[breach of the peace]] power to arrest and, where it is lawfully exercised, may use [[reasonable force]] and other reasonable means to effect it. In ''R v Renouf'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Renouf'' (1986) 2 AER 449&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal ruled that s3(1) was available against a charge of reckless driving where the defendant had used his car to chase some people who had assaulted him and had manoeuvred his car to prevent their escape. Lawton LJ said:

{{cquote|''This case has to be considered in the light of the evidence, which was said to have amounted to reckless driving. This evidence had two facets: one was what the prosecution alleged to be the acts of recklessness; and the other was that these same acts amounted to the use of reasonable force for the purpose of assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders.''|source=''R v Renouf'' (1986) 2 AER 449}}

==== Self defence = crime prevention = Palmer v R 1971 AC 814 &amp; Criminal Law Act 1967 s3 ====
The right to self defence is provided by the [[Common law]]; the right to prevent crime comes from statute ([[Criminal Law Act 1967|S3 Criminal Law Act 1967]]: reasonably necessary self defence&lt;ref&gt;Palmer v R 1971 AC 814&lt;/ref&gt;, and reasonable force to prevent crime and arrest suspected offenders&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Act 1967 s3&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ‘self defence’ and ‘prevention of crime’ tests are identical&lt;ref&gt;Clegg [1995] 1 AC 482; Beckford v Queen [1988] AC 130&lt;/ref&gt;, the only difference are that the two rights come from different sources but the standard of force is the same: meaning in practice S3 CLA1967 prevention of crime covers most things and common law is superflous. The definition of what constitutes a "crime" was clarified in R v Jones (Margaret)[2005] QB 259&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales.

A shopkeeper may also use common law rights to eject trespassers&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jun/08/yourrights.legal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mylawyer.co.uk/trespassing-a-A76076D34460/#link2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.compactlaw.co.uk/free-legal-information/private-housing/trespassers.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_in_English_law&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLA1967 covers persons, property, crime prevention and arrest. Defence of another excludes anyone you don’t have a nexus with so is arguably not a right to defend strangers&lt;ref&gt;Devlin v Armstrong [1971] NI 13&lt;/ref&gt;, instead that comes under prevention of crime. Defence of property must be to ward off an unlawful crime or act&lt;ref&gt;DPP v Bayer [2004] 1 WLR 2856&lt;/ref&gt;.

Common law has added a necessity test, so force must be necessary and reasonable. Necessity is relevant to reasonableness, but just because some force is necessary doesn’t prove the actual force used was reasonable&lt;ref&gt;R v Clegg 1995 1 AC 482 HL&lt;/ref&gt;. Necessity and reasonableness is judged on the basis of your honest belief of the circumstances&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice &amp; Immigration Act 2008 s76&lt;/ref&gt; (including the danger&lt;ref&gt;Shaw v Queen [2001] 1 WLA 1519; Harvey [2009] EWCA Crim 469&lt;/ref&gt;). The reasonableness of your belief is relevant to whether you held it honestly, but not whether it was a mistake. The jury would then decide whether, if they were in the situation you subjectively believed yourself to be, the force was objectively reasonable. You are not expected to weigh force to a nicety, and instinctive reaction is good evidence of reasonableness&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice &amp; Immigration Act 2008 s76(7)&lt;/ref&gt;. An allowance is made for the emotional strain and stresses of being attacked&lt;ref&gt;Shannon (1980) 71 Cr App R 192&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This is harder to get wrong as the test is whether:

* subjectively you honestly believed there was an imminent crime AND
* objectively you used reasonable force in the circumstances as you believed them to be

So there might only be a summary offence or no offence; you don’t have to tell them anything; you don’t have to wait for the police. But like arrest, it does have to be to prevent crime or escape. You don’t have to retreat&lt;ref&gt;R v Bird 81 Cr App R 110&lt;/ref&gt; (although that is a factor in assessing reasonableness&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice &amp; Immigration Act 2008 s76(6); McInnes [1971] 3 All ER 295&lt;/ref&gt;), or wait for the first blow&lt;ref&gt;R v Deana 2 Cr App R 75&lt;/ref&gt;, but must not take revenge. Revenge is evidence of unreasonableness&lt;ref&gt;R v Rashford 2005 EWCA Crim 337&lt;/ref&gt; and seeking confrontation removes the defence&lt;ref&gt;R v Balogun 2000 1 Archbold News 3&lt;/ref&gt;. No force might be reasonable if a threat would have sufficed&lt;ref&gt;Beckford v Queen [1988] AC 130&lt;/ref&gt;. A witness to violent crime with a continuing threat of violence may well be justified in using extreme force to remove a threat of further violence (CPS guidance). Physical characteristics can be relevant to reasonableness&lt;ref&gt;R Martin (Anthony) [2002] 1 Cr App R 27&lt;/ref&gt;, eg in a fist fight a man twice the size should take it easy or resist provocation. Injuries are relevant to reasonableness and public interest once unreasonableness has been found. CPS say that leeway should be given to those who have to confront in their job such as bouncers. It would be different if the court thought volunteers went out looking for confrontations. The CPS are told not to prosecute if the accused acted reasonably in preventing crime or apprehending offenders, but a factor is whether self defence was more vigilantism and violence than preserving law and order. They are supposed to allow leeway for excessive force that is not far from reasonable. 

The CPS first have to check they can probably rebut self-defence beyond reasonable doubt, and even if they can then they have to check if prosecution is in the public interest. To prove assault despite a claim of self-defence CPS must prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was not defence of person or property or crime prevention or lawful arrest, or that force was excessive. Serious injury or use of weapons or ambush usually requires prosecution due to public interest if the force is unreasonable whereas minor injuries can suggest the public interest does not require prosecution. In case the CPS are dubious of your claim that force was reasonable, only using your bare hands, protecting the suspect from injury and only intervening in unexpected incidents rather than laying in wait are ways to try to prevent prosecution. CPS should be slow to prosecute where the public interest is affected by the complainant having been committing crime at the time; factors then include the damage or injury caused by the complainant and whether overzealous force was used to honestly uphold the law without revenge or vigilantism. CPS guidance is that violence is to be discouraged but responsible public spirited crime prevention is to be encouraged and they are to carefully balance the two.

==== Prevention of breach of peace = Common law = Regina v Howell [1982] QB 416 ====
You can use reasonable force to stop a likely breach of the peace, ie likely injury or damage to a witness’s property (but not mere abuse or disturbance unless it makes you fear such injury or damage). This potentially gets around the problem that assault and threatening behaviour are summary offences. Breach of the peace is not a crime but is arrestable and can lead to binding over. Uniquely the power of arrest comes from a duty to prevent breach of the peace&lt;ref&gt;Laporte v CC Gloucestershire [2006] UKHL 55&lt;/ref&gt;. (There is a wider duty to preserve the public peace on request by the police&lt;ref&gt;R v Brown (1841) C &amp; Mar 314&lt;/ref&gt;, failure without lawful excuse is indictable if able bodied). The courts accept that this is an ‘imperfect’ obligation so is no longer enforced. The risk of breach of the peace breaking out must be more than a real possibility but you are not expected to wait until crisis management is the only option. The police have more power as they can give a warning to cease disturbance then arrest for obstruction before breach of the peace is imminent. An example of a valid citizens arrest to prevent breach of the peace was where an off duty constable bundled a man off a bus who barged ahead of the queue at the bus stop which he feared would provoke an affray.

==Law enforcement by police officers==
The use of force to prevent crime including crimes against property should be considered justifiable because of the [[utilitarianism|utility]] to [[society]], i.e. a police officer using reasonable force to restrain or arrest a criminal or suspect maximizes net utility. But, where the officers make mistakes, the law can be unpredictable. In ''R v Dadson'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Dadson'' (1850) 2 Den 35; 169 ER 407&lt;/ref&gt; a police officer shot and wounded an escaping thief. At the time, any degree of force could be used to arrest a fleeing felon but, when he fired the gun, he did not know who the thief was. He was convicted of intentionally causing [[grievous bodily harm]] because the thief was shot and the gun was fired by a man not caring whether the shot was lawful or not. That the thief was later proved to be a felon did not prevent a [[concurrence]] between ''[[actus reus]]'' and ''[[mens rea]]'' at the instant the shot was fired, i.e. no retrospective justification is allowed. It is noted that the [[death of Jean Charles de Menezes]] at the Stockwell tube station, south London, on July 22, 2005 resulted from the use of a then secret shoot-to-kill policy called [[Operation Kratos]]. English law has no general defence of superior orders and the conduct of every police officer has to be judged on the facts as they believed them to be.

In ''R v Pagett'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Pagett'' (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279&lt;/ref&gt; to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a pregnant girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen who returned fire as permitted under their rules of engagement, killing the girl. It is a proportionate response to shooting, to shoot back. In balancing the harms, the greater harm to be avoided is a violent suspect firing and killing a police officer or any other bystander. On the issue of whether the defendant [[causation (law)|caused]] the victim's death, the Court of Appeal held that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in self-defence and defence of others could not be regarded as a ''novus actus interveniens'' because self-defence was a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.

In ''Beckford v R''&lt;ref name=beckford/&gt; the defendant police officer was told that a suspect was armed and dangerous. When that man ran out of a house towards him, the defendant shot him because he feared for his own life. The prosecution case was that the victim had been unarmed and thus presented no threat to the defendant. Lord Griffiths approved a model direction to juries, laid down by Lord Lane in ''R. v Williams'':

{{cquote|''Whether the plea is self-defence or defence of another, if the defendant may have been labouring under a mistake as to facts, he must be judged according to his mistaken belief of the facts: that is so whether the mistake was, on an objective view, a reasonable mistake or not.''|source=''R. v Williams''}}

The defendant, therefore, had a defence of self-defence because the killing was not unlawful if, in the circumstances, as he perceived them to be, he had used reasonable force to defend himself.

==Law enforcement by soldiers==
Since the "war on terrorism" began in 2001, the UK has seen a substantial increase in the use of armed police officers. The issue of the extent to which soldiers may be allowed to shoot a suspect in defence of themselves and others has therefore become more relevant to English law, although it has always been highly relevant given the role of the military in the policing of [[Northern Ireland]]. In ''AG for Northern Ireland's Reference'',&lt;ref&gt;''AG for Northern Ireland's Reference (No 1 of 1975)'' (1977) AC 105&lt;/ref&gt; a soldier on patrol in Northern Ireland shot and killed an unarmed man, who ran away when challenged. The trial judge held that the prosecution had failed to prove that the soldier intended to kill or cause serious bodily harm, and that the homicide was justifiable under section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 (identical wording to the English section). The Lords decided that the judge's ruling was purely one of fact, and therefore declined to answer the legal question of justification. But Lord Diplock commented:

{{cquote|''There is little authority in English law concerning the rights and duties of a member of the armed forces of the Crown when acting in aid of the civil power; and what little authority there is relates almost entirely to the duties of soldiers when troops are called upon to assist in controlling a riotous assembly. Where used for such temporary purposes it may not be inaccurate to describe the rights and duties of a soldier as being no more than those of an ordinary citizen in uniform. But such a description is in my view misleading in the circumstances in which the army is currently employed in aid of the civil power in Northern Ireland. In theory it may be the duty of every citizen when an arrestable offence is about to be committed in his presence to take whatever reasonable measures are available to him to prevent the commission of the crime; but the duty is one of imperfect obligation and it does not place him under any obligation to do anything by which he would expose himself to risk of personal injury, nor is he under any duty to search for criminals or seek out crime. In contrast to this a soldier who is employed in aid of the civil power in Northern Ireland is under a duty, enforceable under military law, to search for criminals if so ordered by his superior officer and to risk his own life should this be necessary in preventing terrorist acts. For the performance of this duty he is armed with a firearm, a self-loading rifle, from which a bullet, if it hits the human body, is almost certain to cause serious injury if not death.''|source=''AG for Northern Ireland's Reference (No 1 of 1975)'' (1977) AC 105}}

In ''[[Lee Clegg|R v Clegg]]'' Lord Lloyd of Berwick said at 497:
{{cquote|''In the case of a soldier in Northern Ireland, in the circumstances in which Private Clegg found himself, there is no scope for graduated force. The only choice lay between firing a high-velocity rifle which, if aimed accurately, was almost certain to kill or injure, and doing nothing at all.''|source=''R v Clegg'' (1995) 1 AC 482}}

One interpretation would be that, when a [[government]] deploys highly armed soldiers, equipped and trained to kill, in a civilian area, the law must give the armed forces greater licence to kill than would be granted to any other person including, presumably, a less lethally equipped police officer. In the event, Private Clegg was convicted of murder. He had been on patrol to catch [[joyride (crime)|joyriders]], and fired three shots at the windscreen of a speeding car as it approached the checkpoint. He fired a fourth shot, killing a passenger, after the car had passed him and was speeding away. The first three shots were fired in self-defence, or in defence of fellow soldiers, but the fourth shot was not a response to imminent danger. The judge dismissed the evidence of bruising to a fellow soldier's leg as a fabrication to suggest injury to that soldier from the car. The Lords observed that army [[Rules of Engagement]] given to every soldier on a "yellow card" entitled "[i]nstructions for opening fire in Northern Ireland" could, on a literal reading, justify firing on a car where a person had been injured by it, irrespective of the seriousness of the injury. But, in any event, the Lords said that the card had no legal force because English law does not have a general defence of superior orders. Lord Lloyd of Berwick cited with approval the Australian High Court in ''A v Hayden (No 2)''&lt;ref&gt;''A v Hayden (No 2)'' (1984) 156 CLR 532&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the Privy Council in ''Yip Chiu-Cheung v The Queen''&lt;ref&gt;''Yip Chiu-Cheung v The Queen'' (1995) 1 AC 111&lt;/ref&gt; where the "good" motive of the undercover drug enforcement officer was irrelevant (the accused conspired to take drugs from Hong Kong to Australia - as the officer intended the agreement to be carried out to break a drugs ring, a conspiracy between the two was proved. In ''A v Hayden'', Murphy J. stated:

{{cquote|''In Australia it is no defence to the commission of a criminal act or omission that it was done in obedience to the orders of a superior or the government. Military and civilians have a duty to obey lawful orders, and a duty to disobey unlawful orders.''|source=''A v Hayden (No 2)'' (1984) 156 CLR 532}}

==Defence of property==

==Reform==
The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]]'s report on ''Partial Defences to Murder''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=6 August 2004 |accessdate=August 4, 2016 |title=Partial Defences to Murder |format=PDF |url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/lc290_Partial_Defences_to_Murder.pdf |publisher=Law Commission |pages=78–86 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426034959/http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/lc290_Partial_Defences_to_Murder.pdf |archivedate=April 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rejects the notion of creating a mitigatory defence to cover the use of excessive force in self-defence, but accepts that the "all or nothing" effect can produce unsatisfactory results in murder cases. For example, a [[battered woman defence|battered woman]] or abused child using excessive force because they are physically at a disadvantage and not under imminent attack, would be denied a defence. Further, an occupant not sure if violence to defend their property against invasion is reasonable, may feel forced to do nothing. It was always possible the same set of facts could be interpreted as either self-defence or [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] where there was a loss of control resulting in death. Thus, the Commission recommends a redefinition of provocation to cover situations where a person acts lethally out of fear. This reflects the present view of psychiatrists that most people act in violent situations with a combination of fear and anger in their minds, and to separate the two emotions is not legally constructive.

A '''show trial''' is a [[public trial]] in which  the [[judicial]] authorities have already determined the [[guilt (law)|guilt]] of the [[defendant]].  The actual trial has as its only goal the presentation of both the accusation and the verdict to the public so they will serve as both an impressive example and a warning to other would-be dissidents or transgressors. Show trials tend to be [[retributive justice|retributive]] rather than [[correctional justice|corrective]] and they are also conducted for [[Propaganda|propagandistic]] purposes.

During this time, many thousands of people classified as elements of the [[bourgeois]] like wealthy [[landlord]]s were rounded up, given show trials, with some receiving executions.

Show trials were a significant{{quantify|date=September 2018}} part of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime. The [[Moscow Trials]] of the [[Great Purge]] period (1937–38) in the [[Soviet Union]] are characteristic.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The Soviet authorities staged the actual trials meticulously. If defendants refused to "cooperate"—i.e., to admit guilt for their alleged and mostly fabricated crimes—they did not go on public trial, but suffered execution nonetheless. This happened, for example during the prosecution of the so-called {{ill|Labour Peasant Party|ru|Трудовая Крестьянская Партия}}, a party invented in the late 1920s by the [[OGPU]], which, in particular, assigned the notable economist [[Alexander Chayanov]] (1888-1937, arrested in 1930) to it.

Some solid public evidence of what really happened during the Moscow Trials came to [[Western world | the West]] through the [[Dewey Commission]] (1937). After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] (1991), more information became available.  This discredited the ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Walter Duranty]], who claimed at the time that these trials were actually fair.

According to declassified Soviet archives, with documents dating to 1937 and 1938, the [[NKVD]] arrested more than one and a half million people, resulting in 681,692 executions.&lt;ref&gt;

Following some dissent within ruling [[Communist party|communist parties]] throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], especially after the 1948 [[Tito–Stalin split]],&lt;ref name="bideleux476"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crampton261"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; several party [[purge]]s occurred, with several hundred thousand members purged in several countries.&lt;ref name="bideleux476"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crampton262"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to rank-and-file member purges, prominent communists were purged, with some subjected to public show trials.&lt;ref name="crampton262"/&gt;  These were more likely to be instigated, and sometimes orchestrated, by the [[Kremlin]] or even Stalin himself, as he had done in the earlier Moscow Trials.&lt;ref name="crampton263"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such high-ranking party show trials included those of [[Koçi Xoxe]] in Albania and [[Traicho Kostov]] in Bulgaria, who were purged and arrested.&lt;ref name="crampton261"/&gt; After Kostov was executed, Bulgarian leaders sent Stalin a telegram thanking him for the help.&lt;ref name="crampton263"/&gt; In Romania, [[Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu]], [[Ana Pauker]] and [[Vasile Luca]] were arrested, with Pătrăşcanu being executed.&lt;ref name="crampton262"/&gt;

===Yugoslavia===

===Hungary===
Stalin's NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary [[Mátyás Rákosi]] and his [[ÁVH]] head the way the show trial of Hungarian Foreign Minister [[László Rajk]] should go, and he was later executed.&lt;ref name="crampton263"/&gt; 

===Czechoslovakia===
The Rajk trials in Hungary led Moscow to warn Czechoslovakia's parties that enemy agents had penetrated high into party ranks, and when a puzzled [[Rudolf Slánský]] and [[Klement Gottwald]] inquired what they could do, Stalin's NKVD agents arrived to help prepare subsequent trials.

The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Communist party]] subsequently arrested Slánský himself, [[Vladimír Clementis]], Ladislav Novomeský and [[Gustáv Husák]] (Clementis was later executed).&lt;ref name="crampton262" /&gt; The [[Slánský trial|Slánský show trial]] began. Slánský and eleven others were convicted together of being "Trotskyist-zionist-titoist-bourgeois-nationalist traitors" in one series of show trials, after which they were executed and their ashes were mixed with material being used to fill roads on the outskirts of Prague.&lt;ref name="crampton262" /&gt; By the time of the Slánský trials, the Kremlin had been arguing that Israel, like Yugoslavia, had bitten the Soviet hand that had fed it, and thus the trials took an overtly [[anti-Semitic]] tone, with eleven of the fourteen defendants tried with Slánský being Jewish.&lt;ref name="crampton265"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets generally directed show trial methods throughout the Eastern Bloc, including a procedure in which confessions and evidence from leading witnesses could be extracted by any means, including threatening to torture the witnesses’ wives and children.&lt;ref name="crampton264"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher-ranking the party member, generally the more harsh the torture that was inflicted upon him.&lt;ref name="crampton264"/&gt; For the show trial of Hungarian Interior Minister [[János Kádár]], who one year earlier had attempted to force a confession of Rajk in his show trial, regarding "Vladimir" the questioner of Kádár:&lt;ref name="crampton264"/&gt;{{cquote|Vladimir had but one argument: blows. They had begun to beat Kádár. They had smeared his body with mercury to prevent his pores from breathing. He had been writhing on the floor when a newcomer had arrived. The newcomer was Vladimir’s father, Mihály Farkas. Kádár was raised from the ground. Vladimir stepped close. Two henchmen pried Kádár’s teeth apart, and the colonel, negligently, as if this were the most natural thing in the world, urinated into his mouth.}}

The evidence was often not just non-existent but absurd, with Hungarian [[George Paloczi-Horváth]]’s party interrogators delightedly exclaiming "We knew all the time—we have it here in writing—that you met professor Szentgyörgyi not in [[Istanbul]], but in [[Constantinople]]."&lt;ref name="crampton265"/&gt;  In another case, the Hungarian [[ÁVH]] secret police also condemned another party member as a Nazi accomplice with a document that had actually been previously displayed in glass cabinet of the Institute of the Working Class Movement as an example of a Gestapo forgery.&lt;ref name="crampton265"/&gt; The trials themselves were "shows", with each participant having to learn a script and conduct repeated rehearsals before the performance.&lt;ref name="crampton265"/&gt;  In the Slánský trial, when the judge skipped one of the scripted questions, the better-rehearsed Slánský answered the one which should have been asked.&lt;ref name="crampton265"/&gt;

The '''Silent Sentinels''' were a group of women in favor of women's [[suffrage]] organized by [[Alice Paul]] and the [[National Woman's Party]]. They protested in front of the [[White House]] during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency starting on January 10, 1917.&lt;ref name="Stillion1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stillion Southard|first1=Belinda|title=The National Woman's Party and the Silent Sentinels|location=University of Maryland|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silent Sentinels started to protest after a meeting with the president on January 9, 1917, during which he told the women to "concert public opinion on behalf of women's suffrage."&lt;ref name="Stillion2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillion Southard|first1=Belinda A.|title=Militancy, power, and identity: The Silent Sentinels as women fighting for political voice|journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs|date=2007|volume=10|issue=3|pages=399–417|doi=10.1353/rap.2008.0003|jstor=41940153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters served as a constant reminder to Wilson of his lack of support for suffrage. At first the picketers were tolerated, but they were later arrested on charges of obstructing traffic.The women protested for six days a week until June 4, 1919 when the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was passed both by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

The name Silent Sentinels was given to the women because of their silent protesting. Using silence as a form of protest was a new principled, strategic, and rhetorical strategy within the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|national suffrage movement]] and within their own assortment of protest strategies.&lt;ref name="Stillion2"/&gt;

Throughout this two and a half year long vigil many of the nearly 2,000 women&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/tactics-and-techniques-of-the-national-womans-party-suffrage-campaign/|title=Tactics and Techniques of the National Woman's Party Campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who picketed were harassed, arrested, and unjustly treated by local and US authorities, including the torture and abuse inflicted on them before and during the November 14, 1917 Night of Terror.

==Background==
The Silent Sentinels' protests were organized by the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), a militant women's suffrage organization. The NWP was first founded as the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] (CUWS) in 1913 by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] following the Congressional Committee's woman suffrage parade in 1913.&lt;ref name="Stillion3" /&gt; CUWS by definition was an organization that took a militant approach to women's suffrage and broke away from the more moderate [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).&lt;ref name=Stillion3&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUWS only lasted for three years until its founders merged it with the Woman's Party to form the [[National Woman's Party]].&lt;ref name=Stillion3/&gt; The [[National Woman's Party]] boasted fewer members than [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]](having 50,000 members to NAWSA's 2 million),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but its tactics were more attention-grabbing and harnessed more media coverage. The NWP's members are known primarily for picketing the White House and going on hunger strikes while in the workhouses.

==The Suffragist==
''[[The Suffragist]]'' was the [[National Woman's Party]] weekly newsletter. ''The Suffragist'' acted as a voice for the Silent Sentinels throughout their vigil. It covered the Sentinels' progress and included interviews with protesters, reports on President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s (non) reaction, and political essays.&lt;ref name ="Stillion1" /&gt; While the Sentinels were in prison, a few meters wrote about their experiences which were later posted in ''The Suffragist''. "Although The Suffragist was intended for mass circulation, its subscription peaked at just over 20,000 issues in 1917. Further, most copies went to party members, advertisers, branch headquarters, and NWP organizers, which strongly suggests that the [[suffragists]] themselves were a key audience of the publication."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

==Banners==
[[File:Suffragette banner carried in picket of the White House.jpg|thumb|A Sentinel with a banner]]

The following are examples of banners held by the women:
* "Mr. President, what will you do for woman suffrage?"&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;
* "Mr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?"&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;
* "We shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Woodrow. Address to Joint Session of Congress. Congress. Washington D.C.. 2 April 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Democracy Should Begin at Home"
* "The time has come to conquer or submit, for us there can be but one choice. We have made it." (another quotation from Wilson)
* "Kaiser Wilson, have you forgotten your sympathy with the poor Germans because they were not self-governed? 20,000,000 American women are not self-governed. Take the beam out of your own eye." (comparing Wilson to [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany, and to a famous quote of [[Jesus]] regarding hypocrisy)
* "Mr. President, you say liberty is the fundamental demand of the human spirit."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt; 
* "Mr. President, you say we are interested in the United States, politically speaking, in nothing but human liberty."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

The Sentinels all wore purple, white, and gold sashes which are the NWP's colors. Their banners were also usually colored this way.&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

==Responses==
The public's responses to the Silent Sentinels were varied.

Some people wholeheartedly approved of the work Silent Sentinels were performing. Men and women present at the scene of the [[White House]] showed their support for the Sentinels by bringing them hot drinks and hot bricks to stand on. Sometimes, women would even assist in holding up the banners. Other ways of showing support included writing letters praising the Sentinels to The Suffragist and donating money.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Woman's Crusade: Alice Paul and the Battle for the Ballot|last=Walton|first=Mary|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-61175-7|location=New York, NY|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some disapproved of Silent Sentinels' protests. This included some of the more moderate suffragists. For example, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]- then the leader of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] believed that the best way to realize women's suffrage was to gain the vote through individual states first, upon which women could vote for a pro-suffrage majority in Congress. She thus opposed advocating for a national amendment to grant women's suffrage, as the Sentinels did.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Members of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] feared that pickets would create a backlash from male voters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Anti-suffragists also opposed the Silent Sentinels' protest. Mobs sometimes attempted to deter the Silent Sentinels through violence (which increased after US entry into [[World War I]]). For example, some attacked the Silent Sentinels and tore their banners to shreds. This occurred especially with the more provocative banners, such as banners calling [[Woodrow Wilson]] "Kaiser Wilson."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The New York Times called the protests "silent, silly, and offensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Sentinels|url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/3/2/silent-sentinels |website=The Attic|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men hurled insults or rotten fruit.

At first President Wilson was not very responsive to the women's protest. At points he even seemed amused with it by tipping his hat and smiling. It was said that at one point Wilson even invited them in for coffee.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson: A Portrait : Women's Suffrage|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wilson/portrait/wp_suffrage.html|website=PBS|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other points in time, he ignored the protests altogether, such as when the Sentinels protested on the day of his second inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Sentinels continued to protest, the issue became bigger and Wilson's opinion began to change. Although he continued to dislike the Silent Sentinels, he began to recognize them as a group seriously presenting him with an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occoquan Workhouse and the Night of Terror==
[[File:F B Hilles152007v.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Bayard Hilles]], chairman of the Delaware Branch of the [[National Woman's Party|NWP]] and member of the national executive committee, was arrested picketing the [[White House]] July 13, 1917, sentenced to 60 days in [[Occoquan Workhouse]]. She was pardoned by President Wilson after serving three days of her term.]]

On June 22, 1917, police arrested protesters [[Lucy Burns]] and Katherine Morey on charges of obstructing traffic because they carried a banner quoting from Wilson's speech to Congress: "We shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments." On June 25, 12 women were arrested, including [[Mabel Vernon]] and [[Annie Arniel]] from [[Delaware]], again on charges of obstructing traffic. They were sentenced to three days in jail or to pay a $10 fine. They chose jail because they wanted to show commitment to their cause and their willingness to sacrifice their physical bodies. On July 14, 16 women, including [[Florence Bayard Hilles]], [[Alison Turnbull Hopkins]], and [[Elizabeth Selden Rogers]] (of the politically powerful Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family) were arrested and sentenced to 60 days in jail or to pay a $25 fine.&lt;ref name="Freedom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Doris|title=Jailed for Freedom|date=1920|publisher=Liverright Publishing|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the women chose jail. Lucy Burns argued that the women should be treated as political prisoners, but Wilson denied this request.

When the women arrived at the [[Occoquan Workhouse]] (now the [[Lorton Correctional Complex]]) they were asked to give up everything except for their clothing. They were then taken to a showering station where they were ordered to strip naked and bathe. There was only one bar of soap available for everyone in the workhouse to use, so all of the suffragists refused to use it. Afterwards they were given baggy, unclean, and uncomfortable prison clothes and taken to dinner. They could barely eat dinner because it was so sour and distasteful.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;
 
The conditions of the Occoquan Workhouse were very unsanitary and unsafe. Prisoners had to share cells and many other things with those who had [[syphilis]], and worms were frequently found in their food.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

After serving three days in the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia, Wilson pardoned the women. At first they refused to be pardoned because they were innocent and had nothing to be pardoned for, but they were eventually forced out.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; After a heated debate, the House of Representatives created a committee to deal with women's suffrage in September 1917. Massachusetts Representative [[Joseph Walsh (Massachusetts)|Joseph Walsh]] opposed the creation of the committee, thinking the House was yielding to "the nagging of iron-jawed angels." He referred to the Silent Sentinels as "bewildered, deluded creatures with short skirts and short hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HOUSE MOVES FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE; Adopts by 181 to 107 Rule to Create a Committee to Deal with the Subject.

As the suffragists kept protesting, the jail terms grew longer. Finally, police arrested [[Alice Paul]] on October 20, 1917, while she carried a banner that quoted Wilson: "The time has come to conquer or submit, for us there can be but one choice. We have made it." She was sentenced to seven months in prison. Paul and many others were again sent to the Occoquan Workhouse, where Paul was placed in [[solitary confinement]] for two weeks, with nothing to eat except bread and water. She became weak and unable to walk, so she was taken to the prison hospital. There, she began a [[hunger strike]], and others joined her.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

In response to the hunger strike the prison doctors force fed the women by putting tubes down their throats.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; They force fed them substances that would have as much protein as possible, like raw eggs mixed with milk. Many of the women ended up vomiting because their stomachs could not handle the protein. One physician reported that Alice Paul had "a spirit like [[Joan of Arc]], and it is useless to try to change it. She will die but she will never give up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nardo|first1=Don|title=The Split History of the Women's Suffrage Movement: A Perspective Flip Book|date=1947|publisher=Capstone|location=Stevens Point, WI|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Burns suffered injuries from force feeding, so after the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, she was unable to continue to work with Paul.

On the night of November 14, 1917, known as the "Night of Terror", the superintendent of the Occoquan Workhouse, W.H. Whittaker, ordered the nearly forty guards to brutalize the suffragists. They beat [[Lucy Burns]], chained her hands to the cell bars above her head, then left her there for the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mickenberg|first1=Julia L.|title=Suffragettes and Soviets: American Feminists and the Spector of Revolutionary Russia|journal=Journal of American History|date=2014|volume=100|issue=4|page=1041|doi=10.1093/jahist/jau004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They threw [[Dora Lewis]] into a dark cell and smashed her head against an iron bed, which knocked her out. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, who believed Lewis to be dead, suffered a heart attack. [[Dorothy Day]], who later co-founded the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], was slammed repeatedly over the back of an iron bench. Guards grabbed, dragged, beat, choked, pinched, and kicked other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|title=Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten|journal=Public Policy|date=2004|volume=415|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers carried stories about how the protesters were being treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E5D7113AE433A25756C2A9679D946696D6CF|title=Move Militants from Workhouse|date=November 25, 1917|work=The New York Times|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories angered some Americans and created more support for the suffrage amendment. On November 27 and 28, all the protesters were released, including Alice Paul after spending five weeks in prison. Later, in March 1918, the [[D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] vacated six suffragists' convictions.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hunter_v._District_of_Columbia ''Hunter v. District of Columbia''], 47 App. D.C. 406 (D.C. Cir. 1918).&lt;/Ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459608 Collins, Representing Injustice: Justice as an Icon of Woman Suffrage]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the [[Information (formal criminal charge)|informations]] on which the women's convictions were based were overly vague.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;

==Decision==
On January 9, 1918, Wilson announced his support of the women's suffrage amendment. The next day, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the amendment but the Senate refused to even debate it until October. When the Senate voted on the amendment in October, it failed by two votes. And in spite of the ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arrests of White House protesters resumed on August 6, 1918.

To keep up the pressure, on December 16, 1918, protesters started burning Wilson's words in watch fires in front of the White House. On February 9, 1919, the protesters burned Wilson's image in [[effigy]] at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Phillip Edward|title=Prison Narratives from Boethius to Zena|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillian|location=New York, NY|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another front, the National Woman's Party, led by Paul, urged citizens to vote against anti-suffrage senators up for election in the fall of 1918. After the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1918|1918 election]], most members of Congress were pro-suffrage. On May 21, 1919, the House of Representatives passed the amendment, and two weeks later on June 4, the Senate finally followed. With their work done in Congress, the protesters turned their attention to getting the states to ratify the amendment.

It was ratified on August 18, 1920, upon its ratification by Tennessee, the thirty-sixth state to do so by the single vote of a legislator ([[Harry T. Burn]]) who had opposed the amendment but changed his position after his mother sent him a telegram saying "Dear Son, Hurrah! and vote for suffrage. Don't forget to be a good boy and help [[Carrie Chapman Catt|Mrs. Catt]] put the 'rat' in ratification."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5005">'''Statute law revision''' may refer to the printing of, or the editorial process of preparing, a [[revised edition of the statutes]], or to the process of [[repeal]]ing obsolete enactments to facilitate the preparation of such an edition, or to facilitate the [[Consolidation bill|consolidation]] of enactments.

==United Kingdom==

'''History'''

Revision of the statutes was regarded by the [[Parliament of England]] as desirable as early as 1563 (see the preamble to the 5 Eliz 1 c 4). It was demanded by a petition of the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] in 1610. Both Coke and Bacon were employed for some time on a commission for revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |first=James |last=Williams |wstitle=Statute |volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halsbury's Laws said that the first Act for statute law revision (in the sense of repealing enactments which are obsolete, spent, unnecessary or superseded, or which no longer serve a useful purpose) was the [[Repeal of Obsolete Statutes Act 1856|19 &amp; 20 Vict c 64]] (1856).&lt;ref&gt;[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]. Fourth Edition. Reissue. Butterworths. London. 1995. Volume 44(1). Note 3 to paragraph 1227 at page 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preparation etc. of revised editions of the statutes'''

O. Hood Phillips defined statute law revision as "the reprinting of statute law with the omission of obsolete matter".&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. [[A First Book of English Law]]. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation.gov.uk uses the terms "revise", "revised" and "revision" to refer to the editorial process of incorporating amendments and carrying through other effects into legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legislation.gov.uk]]. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/help#glossary Glossary].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repeal of obsolete enactments'''

The Law Commission said that statute law revision originally referred to the repeal of enactments which had become inoperative, in order to facilitate the preparation of a revised edition of the statutes. They said that they intended to adopt a more forceful approach by also repealing enactments which no longer served a substantial purpose, and that they hoped that this would also facilitate consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]]. [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/2.pdf Law Commission's First Programme on Consolidation and Statute Law Revision]. HMSO. London. 1966. Paragraph 14 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duty to prepare programmes of statute law revision'''

It is the duty of the Law Commission to prepare from time to time at the request of the [[Lord Chancellor]] comprehensive programmes of statute law revision, and to undertake the preparation of draft [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] pursuant to any such programme approved by the Lord Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Law Commissions Act 1965]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1965/22/section/3 section 3(1)(d)] (as read with [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1965/22/section/6 section 6(2)])&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the duty of the [[Scottish Law Commission]] to prepare from time to time at the request of the [[Scottish Ministers]] comprehensive programmes of statute law revision, and to undertake the preparation of draft Bills pursuant to any such programme approved by the Scottish Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commissions Act 1965, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1965/22/section/3 section 3(1)(d)] (as read with section 6(2) as amended by articles 1(2) and 4 of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/1820/schedule/2/paragraph/36/made paragraph 36(6)] of Part I of Schedule 2 to, the Scotland Act 1998 (Consequential Modifications) (No. 2) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1820)).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What legislation effects statute law revision'''

In 1971, the Law Commission said that not all statute law revision was being done by [[Statute Law Revision Bills]] or [[Statute Law (Repeals) Bills]]. They said that an example of this was the statute law revision effected by the [[Theft Act 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1971/44.pdf Law Commission's Second Programme on Consolidation and Statute Law Revision]. Law Com 44. HMSO. London. Ordered to be printed 20 April 1971. Paragraph 16 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
In the [[Law Reform Commission Act 1975]], the expression "[[Law reform|reform]]" includes the revision of [[statute law]], and kindred words must be construed accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Reform Commission Act 1975, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1975/en/act/pub/0003/sec0001.html section 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Statute law revision Bills are prepared by the [[Statute Law Revision Programme]] in the [[Department of Public Expenditure and Reform]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5898">The '''Student Non-Discrimination Act''' {{USBill|112|H.R.|998}}, {{USBill|112|S.|555}}) is proposed United States federal legislation that aims to protect [[LGBT]] students against [[bullying]] and discrimination in school. It is modeled after [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], which addressed discrimination on the basis of sex.&lt;ref name=blade /&gt;

The legislation was first introduced in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] (2010-2011) and it died in committee.&lt;ref name=keen&gt;Keen News Service: [http://www.keennewsservice.com/2011/03/09/student-anti-bullying-non-discrimination-bills-face-uncertain-path/ Dana Rudolph, "Student anti-bullying, non-discrimination bills face uncertain path," March 9, 2011], accessed March 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2011, Rep. [[Jared Polis]] (D-CO) introduced the legislation in the House of Representatives and Sen. [[Al Franken]] (D-MN) introduced it in the Senate.&lt;ref name=blade&gt;''Washington Blade'': [http://www.washingtonblade.com/2011/03/10/polis-reintroduces-student-non-discrimination-act/ Chris Johnson, "Polis reintroduces Student Non-Discrimination Act, March 10, 2011], accessed March 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Its prospects for passage were uncertain. Polis hoped the bill could become part of the annual re-authorization of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA).&lt;ref name=keen/&gt; It has 99 co-sponsors in the House and 27 co-sponsors in the Senate.&lt;ref name=blade /&gt; Franken cited the 2010 suicide of Justin Aaberg, a 15-year-old Minnesota high school student, and appeared the same day at a press conference with Aalberg's mother, a critic of the record of the Minnesota [[Anoka-Hennepin School District 11|Anoka-Hennepin Public School District]] on LGBT harassment.&lt;ref&gt;MinnPost: [http://www.minnpost.com/learning-curve/2011/03/franken-says-bill-would-clarify-how-schools-must-respond-anti-lgbt-bullying Beth Hawkins, "Franken says bill would clarify how schools must respond to anti-LGBT bullying," March 11, 2011], accessed March 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the legislation was part of a week of events that focused on the problem of bullying, including a White House conference on bullying prevention and the introduction of two related bills, the Safe Schools Improvement Act (SSIA) by Sens. [[Bob Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey]] (D-PA) and [[Mark Kirk]] (R-IL) and the [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]] Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act by Sen. [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-N.J.) and Rep. [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.|Rush Holt]] (D-N.J.).&lt;ref name=keen/&gt;

The legislation provides a federal prohibition on discrimination against LGBT students in public schools.

Neal McCluskey of the [[Cato Institute]] warned that "The definition of harassment could be so broadly interpreted that anybody who expressed a totally legitimate opinion about homosexual behavior could be made illegal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10549">A '''sustainable development reserve''' ({{lang-pt|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentável}}, RDS) in Brazil is a type of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area]] inhabited by a traditional population that seeks to preserve nature while maintaining and improving the life of the population through [[sustainable development]].

==Background==

The concept of Sustainable Development Reserves originated in the Projeto Mamirauá launched in the early 1990s by the Sociedade Civil Mamirauá.
The project followed the principle of management based on scientific research and controlled use of natural resources.
The local population participates actively in the planning process and in responsible for managing and monitoring the area.
Key aspects are that the strategy can adapt to changes in the market, private property is maintained, plans are implemented to improve living conditions, and the local people partner with government agencies and NGOs to develop proposals for sustainable use.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

The [[Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1996, the first such reserve in Brazil.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}
The adjacent [[Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1998 after the successful implementation of the Mamirauá reserve, and was fully supported by the local people.
They already recognized the importance of preserving the vegetation and animals that they depend upon for their livelihood.{{sfn|Luiz Claudio Marigo|1999}}
The new category of protected area was included in the National Protected Areas System (SNUG), which defined types of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area of Brazil]] in 2000.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

==Structure==

A Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) holds traditional populations that live by sustainable exploitation of natural resources, developed over generations and adapted to the local ecology, and that protect nature and maintain biological diversity.
The goals are to preserve nature while preserving and improving the quality of life of the traditional populations, and to advance scientific knowledge and understanding of traditional techniques for managing the environment.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

The land in an RDS is in the public domain, and may be expropriated.
Land use is regulated according to Law 9985 article 23 (2000) and in specific regulations.
A board of directors is chaired by the administrative agency and includes representatives of public bodies, civil society organizations and traditional populations living in the area.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}
A management plan is created by the administrative agency, which recognises the dynamic balance between conservation goals and the size of the population.
Natural ecosystems may be exploited sustainably, and cultivation of introduced species is allowed, subject to the management plan.
The plan defines areas where the ecology is fully protected, buffer zones, zones of sustainable use and ecological corridors.
Public visits to the RDS are allowed and encouraged where compatible with local interests and the management plan.
Scientific research and education with focus on conservation of nature are also encouraged.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

'''Thavie's Inn''' was a former [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]], associated with [[Lincoln's Inn]], established at Holborn, near the site of the present side street and office block still known as '''Thavies Inn Buildings'''. ''Thavie's Inn'' is one of the earliest Inns of Chancery on record, both by date of establishment and dissolution. It remains a well-known [[City of London]] landmark, where Lloyd's Bank is situated, on the opposite side of [[Holborn Circus]] from [[Ely Place]].

==Origin of property==
In 1349 John Thavie, an armourer based in the parish of [[St Andrew's, Holborn]], "left a considerable Estate towards the support of the fabric forever" of that church, a legacy which survived the [[English Reformation]]. It has been invested carefully through the centuries, and still provides for the church's current upkeep.&lt;ref&gt;"London:the City Churches" Pevsner,N/Bradley,S : New Haven, Yale, 1998 {{ISBN|0-300-09655-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name has been transcribed as 'Thavy', 'Tavy' and 'Davy', i.e. the Welsh surname ('dd' in Welsh is pronounced 'th', when Anglicised as a single 'D' the pronunciation is lost).

In his will, the property is described as an inn "wherein the apprentices used to dwell" (note the past tense) and the assumption is that these were "Law Apprentices" who were known to lodge along Holborn, to be near the chancellor's court, i.e. at the [[Bishop of Lincoln]]'s establishment there. The property in question is best located by the present Bartlett's Buildings on the south-side of Holborn.

Thavie's original property, which was left for his endowment of the church, may still have been let to 'lawyers' by Thavie's executors for income, and may have been the original home of [[Lincoln's Inn]] before it relocated to its present site on Chancery Lane.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wards of Farringdon'' Tony Sharp FWC 2000&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, considerable confusion as to just how the names of both the [[Inn of Chancery]] and the [[Inn of Court]] are derived.

The will's statement uses the past tense and we know from the records of the inn that the community of clerks had moved to the neighbouring house of John de Besvile; it is this site that is associated with the title of 'Thavie's Inn' and the assumption is that the transfer of that name indicates the later lawyers association as having started in the original Thavy premises.

Research by the Librarian at Lincoln's Inn in 2016 into the relationship between it and the property of John Thavy, St Andrew's benefactor, has cast doubt on the assumption that the later Inn of Chancery was based there. The reference in the Will of Thavie to his property is to 'his apprentices' and therefore these would have been armourers rather than lawyers. It seems that a Clerk of Chancery, John Davy, had neighbouring property at Besvile's Inn near Thavies Inn and these different individuals and their properties became confounded retrospectively. Besvile's Inn owned by John Davy was named after him as was [[Barnard's Inn]] named after its first Principal. The Inn of Chancery was not that of the benefactor of St Andrew's but its near neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/index.php/library/the-inns-archives/archive-of-the-month&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a reference, after the relocation but before 1400, to the clerks at Besvile's house being addressed as "treshonorable, tresage compagne de David Inn in Holborn" ''ie.'' the 'Right Honourable and Learned Company of David's Inn in Holborn'. A deed of 1419 referring to "Davesynne" is extant. All of these references are important because they are the first record of any formal establishment of lawyers. Lincoln's Inn's own records, the 'Black Books', themselves start in 1422.&lt;ref&gt;''The Parish of St Andrew Holborn'' pp. 14–22 Caroline Barron, London 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bishops, Earls, and Thomas called 'of Lincoln' ==

The Templar Order had its first house in Holborn street from sometime in the reign of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]], building one of their characteristic round churches on the site, located at what is now Southampton Buildings, next to Chancery Lane. The Templars relocated to the present Temple area in 1161, selling the first property to Robert de Chesney [[Bishop of Lincoln]] as his 'London' palace. Bishops were then also senior government officers of the Crown and those of Lincoln where often the chancellor, the king's most senior officer.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or 'Black Friars' arrived at Holborn in 1224, extending and developing their estate in [[Holborn]] and southwards to [[Fleet Street]]. It is alleged that the Archbishop of Canterbury induced them to relocate to the nearby Thames side and eastern side of the Fleet in 1279, to an area better known since then as 'Blackfriars'. They sold their old property to [[Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln]] in that year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Parish of St Andrew Holborn'' pp. 11–12 Caroline Barron, London 1979&lt;/ref&gt; It is the claim of Lincoln's Inn that it derives its name from the Earl&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''A Portrait of Lincoln's Inn'' 3rd Millennium 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as its patron.

In 1369, the Benedictine cleric, the Abbot of Malmesbury, also required a London establishment for his affairs and the [[Benedictine Order]] acquired "Lyncolnesynne", that of one Thomas of Lincoln, who was a [[Serjeant at law]], and thus a local landlord unrelated to the ecclesiastical or lay magnates bearing a similar title/name. The Abbot did not occupy all of the buildings himself, instead letting them out to various tenants, perhaps some of them law apprentices and their masters. Thomas of Lincoln's property is located at what is now Furnivall Street, on the south-side of Holborn.&lt;ref&gt;Barron ibid p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This former site of "Lyncolnesynne" was close to the Thavie's Inn and Furnival's Inn sites.

The derivation of the present Lincoln's Inn name could simply be in reference to the group who migrated to the present 'Chichester Inn' site of Lincoln's Inn, in Chancery Lane, from this earlier Thomas's inn. At the latest, this was done by 1442, so that the group must have occupied at some time before something called 'Lincoln's Inn'. The Black Books start some twenty years before this move. Thavy's property itself was, however, a sub-division of Earl Henry de Lacy's manor so that the association of lawyers may have acquired their collective name from any informal affinity with the leading magnate's local interests.

As to why the Inns of Chancery became subject to the Inns of Court is a moot point; it is, however, notable that the two subject to Lincoln's Inn (Thavie's and [[Furnival's Inn|Furnival's]]) were not adjacent to its present site, unlike the dispositions of the other Chancery Inns to their patron Inns, but further east actually closer to the Thomas de Lincoln site.

Lincoln's Inn sold Thavie's Inn for redevelopment in 1785, the proceeds being used to erect 'Stone Buildings'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum, Jamieson has performed on ''[[Top of the Pops|Top of The Pops]]'' and has the backing of a record label to help with his next release. Now that he’s had one hit, the pressure is on - his second single will decide whether he has a future in music, or should go back to working behind the counter in a high street bank.

In December 1991, preliminary talks began between the Salvadoran government and the [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] guerrilla militia, the [[FMLN|Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), with UN secretary-general [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] overseeing the negotiations. The agreement was finalized and signed by both parties on 16 January 1992, at what is known as the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords|Chapultepec Peace Agreements]].

[[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] appointed three lead commissioners, with the agreement of both the Salvadoran government and the FMLN, to head the investigation. Unlike preceding restorative justice initiatives, the Salvadoran commission was composed entirely of international commissioners.

==History of Salvadoran Civil War==
{{Main|Salvadoran Civil War}}

===Military Regime===
[[File:Hernandez Martinez.jpg|thumb|General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez served as President from 1935-1944.]]
Since its independence in 1838,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Salvador experienced years of political strife mostly due to the unequal spread of wealth throughout the country, a long term effect of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]]. Despite this unrest however, political violence was relatively low until 1931 with the emergence of military dictatorship. In 1931, President [[Pío Romero Bosque]] permitted the country's first free elections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This however resulted in a military coup led by [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez|General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]].

[[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez|Hernández Martínez]] was elected to a four-year term as president in 1935 and re-elected in 1939 to a six-year term.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1944 legislation was passed to allow Hernández Martínez to serve another five years yet this proved too much for the Salvadoran people. In May 1944 revolution broke out forcing him to resign from office and allowing the military to seize control of the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; General Andrés Menéndez assumed the presidency, however after only five months another revolt took place leaving [[Osmín Aguirre y Salinas|Colonel Osmín Aguirre y Salinas]] in control, marking another period of unrest in the country.

This cycle of instability and military intervention plagued the country until January 1961 when a [[Military junta|junta]] of conservative military officers, led by [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo|Lieutenant Colonel Julio Adalberto Rivera]], executed a countercoup. The new administration demonstrated their progressive ideologies, introducing over 300 new laws within nine months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1962, Rivera resigned from the junta in order to seek the presidency. He was elected and served a full term which concluded in 1967. His successor [[Fidel Sánchez Hernández|Colonel Fidel Sánchez Hernández]] was elected in March 1967, what was considered the most honest presidential election up to that point.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Formation of the FMLN===
In January 1932, labour leader [[Farabundo Martí|Agustín Farabundo Martí]] led a peasant revolt in the western countryside of El Salvador. The revolt was in opposition to the military dictatorship and what is known as the [[Fourteen Families]], the oligarchy which controls a disproportionate share of wealth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The two-day revolt was opposed and suppressed by Hernández Martínez, who authorized the execution of thousands of Salvadorans, in what is commonly referred to as ''la matanza''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web

Clashes between the right-wing military government and left-wing guerrillas continued virtually incessantly until the 1970s. Throughout the 1970s guerrillas faced constant antagonization from paramilitary [[death squad]]s, leading to increasing violence. In October 1979 the government was ousted by the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador|Revolutionary Government Junta]] (JRG) promising reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

On 24 March 1980, Salvadoran [[Óscar Romero|Archbishop Óscar Romero]], an outspoken human rights advocate was [[Assassination|assassinated]] during a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] ceremony in San Salvador.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1980 the FMLN was officially created as an amalgamation of five leftist guerrilla groups backed by Cuba.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Their main opposition was D'Aubuisson, and he is assumed to have been the main organizer behind an attempted coup against the JRG.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Twelve Years of Civil War===
By late 1979 tensions once again rose in El Salvador, with the government of [[Carlos Humberto Romero|General Carlos Romero]] committing various human rights abuses, leading [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[clergy]]men to speak out against the injustices. In October 1979 Romero was ousted in yet another military coup. The coup compounded with the assassination of Archbishop Óscar Romero was ultimately the tipping point, marking the beginning of civil war.

In late 1980 the [[United States]] began to show an increasing interest in Salvadoran affairs, fearing the country was susceptible to [[Communism|Communist]] control leading to "another Nicaragua" situation.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government continued to finance the war in El Salvador throughout the 1980s, providing approximately $4.5 billion in military and other aid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The United States provided elite training and organization, sophisticated weaponry, and helicopters to the Salvadoran military.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Benjamin Schwarz, America's involvement in El Salvador was the most "prolonged and expensive military endeavour in the period between the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Persian Gulf war|Persian Gulf]] conflict".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
[[File:ERP combatants Perquín 1990 17.jpg|thumb|Guerrilla combatants in Perquín, El Salvador in 1990.]]
In September 1981, Roberto D'Aubuisson formed a new [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political party, known as the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (Arena), to combat the FMLN. One of the most violent markers of the civil war was the [[El Mozote massacre]], in which nearly 1,000 civilians were killed during a military counterinsurgency operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decade would continue to see violent clashes between the opposing parties.

The presidential election of 1989 saw the victory of Arena candidate [[Alfredo Cristiani]], who continued to enforce severe offences against the FMLN. In November 1989 the FMLN organized a major offensive against multiple urban cities, including the capital city.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The military was taken by surprise and had to fight vehemently for weeks before the guerrillas were forced to retreat. The battle employed egregious indiscriminate violence throughout [[San Salvador]], leading to one of 16 November 1989 [[1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador|murder of six Jesuit priests]] and two women were executed by soldiers who entered their residence under the pretense that they were aiding leftist fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

By the conclusion of the war, an estimated 75,000 Salvadorans had been killed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chavez|first=Joaquin M.|date=December 2015|title=How Did the Civil War in El Salvador End?|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/5/1784|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=120|issue=5|pages=1784–1797|doi=10.1093/ahr/120.5.1784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==End of the Civil War==
[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|UN intervention led to the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Agreements ending the twelve year civil war.]]

===United Nations Intervention===
With increasing international pressure and Cristiani's doubt over the military's abilities to stifle the FMLN, UN-mediated peace talks began in July 1990 when both signed the Agreement on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2 March 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accord was tasked with establishing a United Nations mission that would monitor human rights issues in the country, thus [[ONUCA and ONUSAL|ONUSAL]] was founded.

In December 1991 the Salvadoran government and FMLN representatives met at the United Nations headquarters in New York City to sign the Act of New York, which effectively combined several agreements signed up until that date, including the Mexico Agreement of 1991 that called for the establishment of a truth commission.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2 March 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties also agreed to sign a final Peace Agreement on 16 January 1992 in [[Mexico City]], what is known as the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]].

==The Commission on the Truth for El Salvador==
===Formation and Structure===
The commission was established in accordance with the Mexico Agreement of 1991, assigned to investigate "serious acts of violence that had occurred between January 1980 and July 1991" that required "public knowledge of the truth".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Three international public figures were appointed as commissioners by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]]: 
* [[Belisario Betancur]], former president of [[Colombia]]; 
* [[Thomas Buergenthal]], former president of the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]]; and 
* Reinaldo Figueredo Planchart, former [[foreign minister]] of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
The commission opened offices throughout the country in Chalatenango, Santa Ana and San Miguel.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The commission's final report with conclusions and recommendations was to be transmitted to the Secretary-General who would make the report public. In the commission's mandate, both parties agreed to comply with its final recommendations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Lastly, the commission was granted for a period of only six months to perform its investigation, although this was later extended by two months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Betancur, Belisario, Thomas Buergenthal and Reinaldo Figueredo Planchart. ''From Madness to Hope: Report of the Commission on the Truth for El Salvador''. 11-13. 1993. PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectives===
The commission's official mandate stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The commission shall have the task of investigating serious acts of violence that have occurred since 1980 and whose impact on society urgently demands that the public should know the truth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ambiguity of the wording gave the commission the authority to decide which incidents they would investigate, as not every account could be heard. The commission had to take the importance and social impact affiliated with each event into consideration in order to pursue further investigation. The mandate however did not distinguish large-scale acts of violence from smaller ones, it simply emphasized "serious acts of violence" which often outraged the Salvadoran public or potentially garnered international attention.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The commission understood that the purpose of its formation was to "find and publicize the truth about the acts of violence committed by both sides during the war".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Furthermore, they agreed that the necessity of a public report on their findings was an urgent matter.

The mandate also entrusted the commission with producing "legal, political or administrative" recommendations, however it failed to specify the principles of law applicable to it.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Moreover, during the time the commission took place, El Salvador was obligated by international law to adjust its domestic judicial system, and constrained to observe international human rights laws as the ONUSAL mission was underway.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
[[File:Victims Of The Mozote Massacre, Morazán, El Salvador, January 1982.jpg|thumb|Victims Of The Mozote Massacre, El Salvador, January 1982. On 11 December 1981, units from the Salvadoran Army killed 800 civilians, over half of them children, in the village of El Mozote.]]

===Activities===
====Collection of Data====
The commission heard approximately 2,000 witness testimonies on the scope of atrocities committed. Additionally it collected data from national and international human rights groups, detailing the accounts of over 20,000 additional witnesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of this painstaking research was conducted by the three lead commissioners and a support staff of twenty members, as well as an additional twenty five short-term staff in the concluding months of the commission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The commission staff did not include any Salvadorans.

&lt;blockquote&gt;They realized that the Secretary-General... had not been wrong in seeking to preserve the Commission's credibility by looking beyond considerations of sovereignty and entrusting this task to three scholars from other countries, in contrast to what had been done in Argentina and Chile after the military dictatorships there had ended.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====External Assistance====
The commission contracted the assistance of the [[Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team]] to investigate the controversial [[El Mozote massacre|massacre]] in the town of [[El Mozote]], and exhume the remains of victims from this particular massacre in an attempt to figure out how many casualties were recorded. Exhumation took place from 13 to 17 November 1992 under the supervision of Dr. Clyde Snow, Dr. Robert H. Kirschner, Dr. Douglass Scott, and Dr. John Fitzpatrick of the Santa Tecla Institute of Forensic Medicine and of the Commission for the Investigation of Criminal Acts.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In the exhumation the doctors worked alongside Patricia Bernardi, Mercedes Doretti and Luis Fondebrider of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The process discovered skeletal remains of at least 143, however they noted that there may have been a greater number of casualties. The forensic report supported victim testimonies that "victims were summarily executed," and that at least 24 people participated in the shootings.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==The Final Report==
===Conclusions and Recommendations===
The commission concluded that approximately 95% of the abuses committed between 1980 and 1991 were committed by government forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Controversially, the commission named over 40 senior members of the military, judicial system, and armed opposition in the report for their involvement in the conduction of the mass atrocities. Furthermore, from the 22,000 testimonies documented, at least 60% involved murders, 25% involved disappearances, and 20% involved torture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Truth Commission: El Salvador|url = http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-el-salvador|website = United States Institute of Peace|access-date = 15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the commission's mandate, its recommendations were legally binding. These recommendations urged the dismissal of any military officers or civil servants that were involved in the atrocities from government employment, as well as disqualifying them from holding positions in public office.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The commission also proposed an overhaul of El Salvador's judicial and legal system. Furthermore, it called for reparations and monetary compensation to victims and survivors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, the commission recommended the creation of a forum to oversee the implementation of its recommendations.

===Impact and Criticisms===

With the release of ''From Madness to Hope'' in March 1993, human rights advocates in El Salvador and the United States accepted and applauded the commission for its analysis of the atrocities, and for its recommendations. However it was criticized for failing to scrutinize the involvement of the United States, as well as the activity of Salvadoran [[death squads]]. The high commander of the Salvadoran military publicly responded to the report on national television, through a statement read by the defense minister.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The statement claimed that the report was "unfair, incomplete, illegal, unethical, biased, and insolent." Furthermore, the Salvadoran president, [[Alfredo Cristiani]], claimed that the report did not fulfill the desires of the Salvadoran people who wanted to "forget this painful past."

Many of the commission's recommendations were not accepted or implemented by the government. Approximately 200 senior members of the military were removed from their positions; they retired with full honours and benefits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1996, a new Criminal Procedure Code was introduced into the judicial system in accordance with the commission's recommendation, one of the few recommendations implemented. On 20 March 1993, five days after the release of the UN commission's report, the government passed a blanket [[amnesty]] law, modifying an amnesty law passed on 23 January 1992, a week after the singing of the peace agreement ending the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://elliott.gwu.edu/sites/elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/acad/lahs/el-salvador-amnesty-2013.pdf | title= El Salvador's Amnesty Law: A Monument to Impunity? | accessdate = 9 June 2017 | date= 2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the government has yet to adopt the recommendation to award reparations to victims or survivors.

In 2010, President [[Mauricio Funes]] established special commissions to address reparations, which have yet to result in the payment of reparations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nacla.org/news/2012/1/17/%25E2%2580%2598removing-veil%25E2%2580%2599-el-salvador-apologizes-state-violence-20th-anniversary-peace-accords|title='Removing the Veil': El Salvador Apologizes for State Violence on 20th Anniversary of Peace Accords|website=NACLA|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funes is the first president to official apologize and acknowledge the abuses of the civil war.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-elsalvador-idUSTRE60F26M20100116|title=El Salvador's Funes apologizes for civil war abuses|date=16 January 2010|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the El Salvador Supreme Court ruled that the amnesty law was unconstitutional and that the El Salvador government could prosecute war criminals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coha.org/el-salvadors-1993-amnesty-law-overturned-implications-for-colombia/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sites of Memory===
In recent years there has been a push to create [[monument]]s and [[Les Lieux de Mémoire|sites of memory]] in an attempt to nationally recognize the atrocities of the war.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/28/world/fg-monument28|title=An incomplete monument in El Salvador|last=Ellingwood|first=Ken|date=28 July 2008|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Salvadoran sculptor Ruben Martinez was commissioned to create a monument dedicated to "the birth of an era of peace in El Salvador."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitelsalvador.net/en/monuments-in-el-salvador.php|title=Monuments of interest Historical {{!}} Visit EL Salvador|website=www.visitelsalvador.net|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Accords, [[Carlos Henríquez Consalvi|Carlos "Santiago" Henriquez Consalvi]], a Venezuelan journalist, proposed an initiative to preserve and commemorate Salvadoran history. The result was the foundation of the [[Museo de la Palabra y la Imagen]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museo.com.sv/2013/05/museum-information/|title=Museum Information: MUSEO DE LA PALABRA Y LA IMAGEN|website=museo.com.sv|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in 2003, the Monument of Memory and Truth was erected in San Salvador. The tribute is a granite wall engraved with the names of those killed or disappeared during the country's civil war. However at the time the project began, a list of victims' names was incomplete, thus as of 2008 the wall had engraved 30,000 names and was an ongoing project.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
