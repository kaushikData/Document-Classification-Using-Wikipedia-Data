The '''Aerodynamic Park''' ({{lang-de|Aerodynamischer Park}}) of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] in [[Adlershof|Berlin-Adlershof]] was once part of the German [[Johannisthal Air Field]].

Laboratories, motor test beds, wind tunnels and hangars, erected in the 20s and 30s, are historical landmarks of the Aerodynamic Park today. On the grassy areas of the park is the [[site-specific art|site-specific]] [[sound art]] "Air Borne" ([[Office of Integrative Art|Stefan Krüskemper]] with the collaboration of [[Karlheinz Essl]]) located,  in a loose spatial relation to the monuments of the [[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt|German Experimental Institute for Aviation]] and the exceptional university buildings (Architects: Volker Staab with Alfred Nieuwenhuizen, Georg Augustin and Ute Frank, a.o.). The park is the green center of the Campus Berlin-Adlershof.

A '''chip scale package''' or '''chip-scale package''' ('''CSP''') is a type of [[integrated circuit]] package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maximintegrated.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/4002 |title=Understanding Flip-Chip and Chip-Scale Package Technologies and Their Applications |work=Application Note 4002 |publisher=Maxim Integrated Products |date=April 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally, CSP was the acronym for ''chip-size packaging.'' Since only a few packages are chip size, the meaning of the acronym was adapted to ''chip-scale packaging''. According to [[IPC (electronics)|IPC]]'s standard J-STD-012, ''Implementation of Flip Chip and Chip Scale Technology'', in order to qualify as chip scale, the package must have an area no greater than 1.2 times that of the [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] and it must be a single-die, direct surface mountable package. Another criterion that is often applied to qualify these packages as CSPs is their ball pitch should be no more than 1&amp;nbsp;mm. 

The concept was first proposed by Junichi Kasai of [[Fujitsu]] and Gen Murakami of [[Hitachi Cable]] in 1993. The first concept demonstration however came from [[Mitsubishi Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Karl J. |last1=Puttlitz |first2=Paul A. |last2=Totta |title=Area Array Interconnection Handbook |date=December 6, 2012 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-1-4615-1389-6 |page=702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The die may be mounted on an [[interposer]] upon which pads or balls are formed, like with [[flip chip]] [[ball grid array]] (BGA) packaging, or the pads may be etched or printed directly onto the [[silicon wafer]], resulting in a package very close to the size of the silicon die: such a package is called a [[wafer-level package]] (WLP) or a wafer-level chip-scale package (WL-CSP). WL-CSP had been in development since 1990s, and several companies begun volume production in early 2000, such as [[Advanced Semiconductor Engineering]] (ASE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edn.com/electronics-news/4356671/Wafer-Scale-Emerging |title=Wafer Scale Emerging |first=Brandon |last=Prior |work=[[EDN (magazine)|EDN]] |date=January 22, 2001 |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-news/4348976/ASE-Ramps-Wafer-Level-CSP-Production |title=ASE Ramps Wafer Level CSP Production |work=EDN |date=October 12, 2001 |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Chip scale packages can be classified into the following groups:
# Customized leadframe-based CSP (LFCSP)
# Flexible substrate-based CSP
# Flip-chip CSP (FCCSP)
# Rigid substrate-based CSP
# Wafer-level redistribution CSP (WL-CSP)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18810">[[Nucleation]] is the first step in the formation of either a new thermodynamic phase or a new structure with lower free energy via [[self-assembly]] or [[self-organisation]]. Nucleation is typically defined to be the process that determines how long we have to wait before the new phase or self-organised structure appears. '''Classical nucleation theory''' ('''CNT''') is the most common theoretical model used to understand why nucleation may take hours, years, or never happen at all.&lt;ref name="pruppacher_book"&gt;H. R. Pruppacher and J. D. Klett, ''Microphysics of Clouds and Precipitation'', Kluwer (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debenedetti_book"&gt;P.G. Debenedetti, ''Metastable Liquids: Concepts and Principles'', Princeton University Press (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = sear_review/&gt;

== Outline of classical nucleation theory ==

This is the standard simple theory for nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase, such as a liquid or a crystal. It should be borne in mind that it is approximate. The basic CNT  nucleation  of a new phase provides an approximate but physically reasonable prediction for the rate at which nuclei of a new phase form, via nucleation on a set of identical nucleation sites. This rate, ''R'' is the number of, for example, water droplets nucleating in a uniform volume of air supersaturated with water vapour, per unit time. So if a 100 droplets
nucleate in a volume of 0.1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 1s, then the rate ''R''=1000/s. The description here follows modern
standard CNT.&lt;ref name=sear_review/&gt; The prediction for the rate ''R'' is

::&lt;math&gt;R\ =\ N_S Zj\exp \left( \frac{-\Delta G^*}{k_BT} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:*&lt;math&gt;\Delta G^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]]  cost of the nucleus at the top of the nucleation [[Activation energy#Relationship with Gibbs energy|barrier]], and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T is the thermal energy with ''T'' the absolute temperature and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]].
:*&lt;math&gt;N_S&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nucleation sites.
:*&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which molecules attach to the nucleus causing it to grow.
:*&lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is what is called the Zeldovich factor Z. Essentially the Zeldovich factor is the probability that a nucleus at the top of the barrier will go on to form the new phase, not dissolve.

This expression for the rate can be thought of as a product of two factors: The first, &lt;math&gt; N_S \exp \left( -\Delta G^*/k_BT \right)&lt;/math&gt;, is the number of nucleation sites multiplied by the probability that a nucleus of critical size has grown around it. It can be interpreted as the average, instantaneous number of nuclei at the top of the nucleation barrier. Free energies and probabilities are closely related in general, by definition.&lt;ref name=frenkel_book&gt;{{cite book |last= Frenkell|first=Daan |last2=Smit | first2=Berent |date=2001 |title=Understanding Molecular Simulation, Second Edition: From Algorithms to Applications |publisher= |page=Academic Press |isbn=0122673514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The probability of a nucleus forming at a site is proportional to &lt;math&gt; \exp[-\Delta G^*/kT]&lt;/math&gt;. So if &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^*&lt;/math&gt; is large and positive the probability of forming a nucleus is very low and nucleation will be slow. Then the average number will be much less than one, i.e., it is likely that at any given time none of the sites has a nucleus.

The second factor in the expression for the rate is the dynamic part, &lt;math&gt;Zj&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt; j&lt;/math&gt; expresses the rate of incoming matter and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a nucleus of critical size (at the maximum of the energy barrier) will continue to grow and not dissolve. The Zeldovich factor is derived by assuming that the nuclei near the top of the barrier are effectively diffusing along the radial axis. By statistical fluctuations, a nucleus at the top of the barrier can grow diffusively into a larger nucleus that will grow into a new phase, or it can lose molecules and shrink back to nothing. The probability that a given nucleus goes forward is &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

To see how this works in practice we can look at an example. Sanz and coworkers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1312.0822|doi=10.1021/ja4028814|title=Homogeneous Ice Nucleation at Moderate Supercooling from Molecular Simulation|year=2013|last1=Sanz|first1=Eduardo|last2=Vega|first2=Carlos|first3=J. R.|last3=Espinosa|first4=R.|last4=Cabellero-Bernal|first5=J. L. F.|last5=Abascal|first6=Chantal|last6=Valeriani|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=135|issue=40|pages=15008–15017|pmid=24010583}}&lt;/ref&gt;
have used computer simulation to estimate all the quantities in the above equation, for the nucleation of ice in liquid water. They did this for a simple but approximate model of water called TIP4P/2005. At a supercooling of 19.5&amp;#8239;°C, i.e., 19.5&amp;#8239;°C below the freezing point of water in their model, they estimate a free energy barrier to nucleation of ice of &lt;math&gt; \Delta G^*=275k_BT&lt;/math&gt;. They also estimate a rate of addition of water molecules to an ice nucleus near the top of the barrier of ''j'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;/s and a Zeldovich factor ''Z'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (note that this factor is dimensionless because it is basically a probability). The number of water molecules in 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;. Putting all these numbers into the formula we get a nucleation rate of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−83&lt;/sup&gt;/s. This means that on average we would have to wait 10&lt;sup&gt;83&lt;/sup&gt;s (10&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt; years) to see a single ice nucleus forming in 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water at -20&amp;#8239;°C!

This is a rate of homogeneous nucleation estimated for a model of water, not real water—in experiments we cannot grow nuclei of water and so cannot directly determine the values of the barrier ''&amp;Delta;G*'', or the dynamic parameters such as ''j'', for real water. However, it may be that indeed the homogeneous nucleation of ice at temperatures near -20&amp;#8239;°C and above is ''extremely'' slow and so that whenever we see water freezing temperatures of -20&amp;#8239;°C and above this is due to heterogeneous nucleation, i.e., the ice nucleates in contact with a surface.

=== Homogeneous nucleation ===

Homogeneous nucleation is much rarer than heterogeneous nucleation.&lt;ref name=pruppacher_book/&gt;&lt;ref name=sear_review14&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sear |first=Richard  P. |year=2014 |title=Quantitative Studies of Crystal Nucleation at Constant Supersaturation: Experimental Data and Models|url=http://personal.ph.surrey.ac.uk/~phs1rs/crys_eng_review.pdf |format=PDF |journal=CrystEngComm |volume=16 |issue=29 |pages=6506–6522 |doi=10.1039/C4CE00344F}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, homogeneous nucleation is simpler and easier to understand than heterogeneous nucleation, so the easiest way to understand heterogeneous nucleation is to start with homogeneous nucleation. So we will outline the CNT calculation for the homogeneous nucleation barrier &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^*&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Plot of classical nucleation theory prediction for the free energy of a nucleus as a function of radius.png|thumb|The green curve is the total (Gibbs if this is at constant pressure) free energy as a function of radius. Shown is the free energy barrier, &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^*&lt;/math&gt;, and radius at the top of the barrier, 
&lt;math&gt;r*&lt;/math&gt;. This total free energy is a sum of two terms. The first is a bulk term, which is plotted in red. This scales with volume and is always negative. The second term is an interfacial term, which is plotted in black. This is the origin of the barrier. It is always positive and scales with surface area.]]

To understand if nucleation is fast or slow, &lt;math&gt;\Delta G(r)&lt;/math&gt; needs to be calculated. The classical theory&lt;ref&gt;F. F. Abraham (1974) ''Homogeneous nucleation theory'' (Academic Press, NY).&lt;/ref&gt; assumes that even for a microscopic nucleus of the new phase, we can write the free energy of a droplet &lt;math&gt; \Delta G&lt;/math&gt; as the sum of a bulk term that is proportional to the volume of the nucleus, and a surface term, that is proportional to its surface area

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \Delta g + 4 \pi r^2 \sigma&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is the volume term, and as we are assuming that the nucleus is spherical, this is the volume of a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in free energy per unit volume between the thermodynamic phase nucleation is occurring in, and the phase that is nucleating. For example, if water is nucleating in supersaturated air, then &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy per unit volume of the supersaturated air minus that of water at the same pressure. As nucleation only occurs when the air is supersaturated, &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt; is always negative. The second term comes from the interface at surface of the nucleus, which is why it is proportional to the surface area of a sphere. &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface tension]] of the interface between the nucleus and its surroundings, which is always positive.

For small &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the second surface term dominates and &lt;math&gt;\Delta G(r)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The free energy is the sum of an &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r^3&lt;/math&gt; terms. Now the &lt;math&gt;r^3&lt;/math&gt; terms varies more rapidly with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; than the &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt; term, so
as small &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt; term dominates and the free energy is positive while for large &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;r^3&lt;/math&gt; term dominates and the free energy is negative. This shown in the figure to the right. Thus at some intermediate value of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the free energy goes through a maximum, and so the probability of formation of a nucleus goes through a minimum.
There is a least-probable nucleus occurs, i.e., the one with the highest value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta G&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dG}{dr} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Addition of new molecules to nuclei larger than this [[critical radius]] decreases the free energy, so these nuclei are more probable. The rate at which nucleation occurs is then limited by, i.e., determined by the probability, of forming the critical nucleus. This is just the exponential of minus the free energy of the critical nucleus &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^*&lt;/math&gt;, which is
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta G^* = \frac{16 \pi \sigma ^3}{3(\Delta g)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
This is the free energy barrier needed in the [[#Outline of classical nucleation theory|CNT]] expression for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; above.

From an experimental standpoint, this theory grants tuning of the critical radius through the dependence of &lt;math&gt; \Delta G&lt;/math&gt; on temperature. The variable &lt;math&gt; \Delta g&lt;/math&gt;, described above, can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{H_f(T_m) - T}{T_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; T_m &lt;/math&gt; is the melting point and &lt;math&gt;H_f&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of formation for the material. Furthermore, the critical radius can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; r_c\ =\ \frac{-2\sigma T_m}{\Delta H_f}\frac{1}{T_m -T}&lt;/math&gt;

revealing a dependence of reaction temperature. Thus as you increase the temperature near &lt;math&gt; T_m &lt;/math&gt;, the critical radius will increase.

=== Heterogeneous nucleation ===

Heterogeneous nucleation is the second of the two nucleations as discussed in the classical nucleation theory. Unlike homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation occurs when the nucleus is on the surface. As previously stated, heterogeneous nucleation is more common than homogeneous nucleation. This is due to the different factors within a single system. These factors may include a lower level of supersaturation or being more kinetically favorable than homogeneous nucleation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=X. Y.|title=Heterogeneous nucleation or homogeneous nucleation?|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=31 May 2000|volume=112|issue=22|pages=9949–9955|doi=10.1063/1.481644|url=https://doi.org/10.1063/1.481644|accessdate=16 November 2017|issn=0021-9606|bibcode=2000JChPh.112.9949L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterogeneous nucleation is more kinetically favorable than homogeneous nucleation because the nucleation barrier for the heterogeneous nucleation, &amp;Delta;G*, is much lower at the surface in contrast to the nucleation barrier for homogeneous nucleation. This is because the nucleation barrier comes from the positive term in the free energy &amp;Delta;G, which is the surface term. For homogeneous nucleation the nucleus is approximated by a sphere and so has a surface term containing the surface area of a sphere and so has a free energy equal to the surface area of a sphere, 4πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, times the [[surface tension]] &amp;sigma;. However, because heterogeneous nucleation is the nucleation of a nucleus on a surface, it is important to take into account of more factors that go into a heterogeneous nucleation.

[[File:Surface Interactions of a Droplet (Heterogeneous Nucleation).svg|thumb|left|A diagram featuring all of the factors that affect heterogeneous nucleation]]

As shown in a diagram on the lefthand side, the factors are the size of the droplet, the contact angle at which the particle is making contact on the surface, and the interactions at three different phases(the interaction between the liquid interface and the solid surface, the interaction between the solid surface and the air, and the interaction between the liquid interface and the air). A schematic on the righthand side shows that the macroscopic droplets are not complete spheres. Therefore, the area of the interface between the droplet and the surrounding fluid is less than &lt;math&gt; 4\pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;. This geometrical factor reduces the interfacial area and so the interfacial free energy, which also reduces the nucleation barrier.&lt;ref name = sear_review&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sear|first=R. P.|title=Nucleation: theory and applications to protein solutions and colloidal suspensions|journal=J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|year=2007|volume=19|page=033101|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/19/3/033101|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/19/3/033101|issue=3|bibcode = 2007JPCM...19c3101S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this simple theory treats the microscopic nucleus just as if it is a macroscopic droplet.

[[Image:Surface tension.svg|thumb|right|Three droplets on a surface, illustrating decreasing contact angles. The [[contact angle]] the droplet surface makes with the solid horizontal surface decreases from left to right.]]

In the schematic to the right the [[contact angle]] between the droplet surface and the surface decreases from left to right (A to C). In this schematic, the surface area of the droplet decreases as the contact angle decreases. This geometrical effect reduces the barrier which will increase the rate of nucleation as opposed to having a surface with a larger contact angle. Also, if instead of the surface being flat it curves like a fluid, then this also reduces the interfacial area and the nucleation barrier. There are expressions for this reduction for simple surface geometries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sholl|first=C. A.|author2=N. H. Fletcher |title=Decoration criteria for surface steps|journal=Acta Metall.|year=1970|volume=18|issue=10|pages=1083–1086|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001616070900064|doi=10.1016/0001-6160(70)90006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this means we expect nucleation to be fastest on any imperfections in the surface such that the nucleus forms a small contact angle on its surface.

==Comparison between CNT, computer simulation and experiment==

The classical nucleation theory makes a number of assumptions, for example it treats a microscopic nucleus as if it is a macroscopic droplet with a well defined surface whose free energy is estimated using an equilibrium property: the interfacial tension &amp;sigma;. For a nucleus that may be only of order ten molecules across it is not always clear that we can treat something so small as a volume plus a surface. Also nucleation is an inherently out of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] phenomenon so it is not always obvious that its rate can estimated using equilibrium properties.

For simple model systems, modern computers are powerful enough to calculate numerically exact nucleation rates. One such example is the nucleation of the crystal phase in the model of hard spheres. This is a simple model of some [[colloids]] consisting of perfectly hard spheres in thermal motion. The agreement of CNT with the calculated rates for this system confirms that the classical theory is a very reasonable approximate theory.&lt;ref name=auer04&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auer|first=S.|author2=D. Frenkel |title=Numerical prediction of absolute crystallization rates in hard-sphere colloids|journal=J. Chem. Phys.|year=2004|volume=120|issue=6|page=3015|doi=10.1063/1.1638740|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/120/6/10.1063/1.1638740|bibcode = 2004JChPh.120.3015A }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the simple models CNT works quite well, however it is unclear if it describes complex (e.g. molecular) systems equally well. Jones ''et al.'' computationally explored the nucleation of small [[Water cluster]] using classical [[water model]]. It was found that CNT could describe the nucleation of clusters of 8-50 water molecules well, but failed to describe smaller clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merikanto|first1=Joonas|last2=Zapadinsky|first2=Evgeni|last3=Lauri|first3=Antti|last4=Vehkamäki|first4=Hanna|title=Origin of the Failure of Classical Nucleation Theory: Incorrect Description of the Smallest Clusters|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=4 April 2007|volume=98|issue=14|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.145702|bibcode=2007PhRvL..98n5702M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrections to CNT, obtained from higher accuracy methods such as quantum chemical calculations, can provide necessary interactions for accurate nucleation rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Temelso|first1=Berhane|last2=Morrell|first2=Thomas E.|last3=Shields|first3=Robert M.|last4=Allodi|first4=Marco A.|last5=Wood|first5=Elena K.|last6=Kirschner|first6=Karl N.|last7=Castonguay|first7=Thomas C.|last8=Archer|first8=Kaye A.|last9=Shields|first9=George C.|title=Quantum Mechanical Study of Sulfuric Acid Hydration: Atmospheric Implications|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|date=22 February 2012|volume=116|issue=9|pages=2209–2224|doi=10.1021/jp2119026|bibcode=2012JPCA..116.2209T}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the CNT fails in describing experimental results of vapour to liquid nucleation even for model substances like Argon by several orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fladerer, R. Strey: „Homogeneous nucleation and droplet growth in supersaturated argon vapor: The cryogenic nucleation pulse chamber.“ in: The Journal of Chemical Physics 124(16), 164710 (2006).

The '''Computer Measurement Group (CMG)''', founded in 1974, is a worldwide [[non-profit organization]] of [[data processing]] professionals whose work involves measuring and managing the performance of computing systems. In this context, ''performance'' is understood to mean the ''[[response time (technology)|response time]]'' of [[application software|software applications]] of interest, and the overall ''capacity'' (or ''throughput'') characteristics of the system, or of some part of the system.

CMG members are primarily concerned with evaluating and maximizing the performance of existing [[computer systems]] and [[computer networks|networks]], and with [[capacity management]], in which planned enhancements to existing systems or the designs of new systems are evaluated to find the necessary [[Resource (computer science)|resources]] required to provide adequate performance at a reasonable cost.

==Mission and activities==
CMG's purpose is to promote the exchange of technical information among [[Information technology|Information Technology (IT)]] professionals through regional groups, technical publications, and an annual conference. In common with other [[user group]]s devoted to a broad range of products or technologies (for example [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] or [[DECUS]]), CMG provides education, networking, and leadership opportunities for its members.

The association's activities provide:

*Extensive introductory education for new professionals
*Information on emerging technology as well as methodology for existing performance professionals
*Forums for the exchange of information, promotion of new ideas, and discussions of management information requirements
*Focus on practical applications and results oriented methodologies
*Encouragement for educational institutions to focus on the IT curriculum.

==CMG groups==
With over thirty regional and international [http://www.cmg.org/groups/ groups], CMG's wide reaching structure emphasizes an extensive information and peer network. Regional groups hold local educational meetings, typically three or four times a year, and many publish informational newsletters. Regional meetings may span a half-day, a full day (the most common), or occasionally two days. International CMG groups also hold their own annual conferences and publish their own conference [[proceedings]].

In the US, [http://www.cmg.org/groups/us-regions.html Regional CMG groups] cover the following areas: Boston, Connecticut, Florida, Greater Atlanta, Kansas City, Midwest, Minneapolis, National Capital Area, New York, Northern California,  Northwest, Ohio Valley,  Philadelphia, Rocky Mountain, St Louis, Salt Lake City, Southern, Southern California, and South West.

'''Copernicus''' is [[European Union]]'s Earth observation programme coordinated and managed by the [[European Commission]] in partnership with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the EU Member States and EU Agencies.&lt;ref name="CopernicusWhat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copernicus.eu/main/overview |title=What is Copernicus?|publisher=Copernicus.eu|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Copernicus Programme''' has been established by the Regulation (EU) No 377/2014&lt;ref name="CopernicusRegulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/976616e8-cb7c-11e3-b74e-01aa75ed71a1|title=Regulation (EU) No 377/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 establishing the Copernicus Programme and repealing Regulation (EU) No 911/2010|publisher=European Union|date=2014-04-03|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014, building on the previous EU's Earth monitoring initiative '''GMES''' (est. by Regulation (EU) No 911/2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/7b511d06-becf-4a8b-b2fa-adc08c1a79d9|title=Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the European Earth monitoring programme (GMES) and its initial operations (2011 to 2013)|publisher=European Union|date=2010-09-22|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

It aims at achieving a global, continuous, autonomous, high quality, wide range Earth observation capacity. Providing accurate, timely and easily accessible information to, among other things, improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, and ensure civil security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Overview3 |title=ESA, Copernicus, Overview|publisher=ESA|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The objective is to use vast amount of global data from satellites and from ground-based, airborne and seaborne measurement systems to produce timely and quality information, services and knowledge, and to provide autonomous and independent access to information in the domains of environment and security on a global level in order to help service providers, public authorities and other international organizations improve the quality of life for the citizens of Europe. In other words, it pulls together all the information obtained by the Copernicus environmental [[satellite]]s, air and ground stations and sensors to provide a comprehensive picture of the "health" of [[Earth]]. 

One of the crucial benefits of the Copernicus Programme is that the data and information produced in the framework of Copernicus are made available on a '''full, open and free-of-charge basis'''&lt;ref name=CopernicusRegulation /&gt; (subject to appropriate conditions and limitations) to all its users and public in general, thus allowing many new downstream services to be developed.

The value-adding services offered by Copernicus cover six main interacting themes: atmosphere, marine, land, climate, emergency and security&lt;ref name="CopernicusBrief"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copernicus.eu/main/copernicus-brief|title=Copernicus In Brief|publisher=Copernicus.eu|access-date=2018-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Copernicus builds upon three components:
* the space component (observation satellites and associated [[ground segment]] with missions observing land, atmospheric and oceanographic parameters) This comprises two types of satellite missions, ESA's five families of dedicated [[Sentinel (satellite)|Sentinel (space missions)]] and missions from other space agencies, called Contributing Missions,
* in-situ measurements (ground-based and airborne data gathering networks providing information on oceans, continental surface and atmosphere),
* services developed and managed by Copernicus and offered to its users and public in general.

Its cost during 1998 to 2020 are estimated at 6.7 billion euros with around €4.3bn spent in the period 2014 to 2020 and shared between the EU (66%) and ESA (33%) with benefits of the data to the EU economy estimated at roughly 30 billion euros through 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-251_en.htm |title=ESA, Earth observation: first Copernicus satellite Sentinel 1A|publisher=European Commission|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESA as a main partner has performed much of the design and oversees and co-funds the development of [[Sentinel (satellite)|Sentinel mission]] 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5 and&amp;nbsp;6 with each sentinel mission consisting of at least 2 satellites and some like sentinel 1 consisting of 4 satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/32707-earth-observation-satellite-and-einstein-challenging-physics-experiment-launch-into-space.html |title=Earth-Observation Satellite and Einstein-Challenging Physics Experiment Launch Into Space|publisher=Space.com|date=26 April 2016|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also provide the instruments for [[Meteosat Third Generation|MTG]] and [[MetOp-SG]] weather satellites of [[EUMETSAT]] where ESA and EUMETSAT will also coordinate the delivery of data from upwards of 30 satellites that form the contributing satellite missions to Copernicus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copernicus.eu/main/satellites|title=Earth Observation Satellites|publisher=Copernicus website|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
{{cleanup list|section|date=April 2017}}
Over a few decades European and national institutions have made substantial R&amp;D efforts in the field of Earth observation. These efforts have resulted in tremendous achievements but the services and products developed during this period had limitations that were inherent to R&amp;D activities (e.g. lack of service continuity on the long-term). The idea for a global and continuous European earth observation system was developed under the name of '''Global Monitoring for Environment and Security''' ('''GMES''') which was later re-branded into '''Copernicus''' after the EU became directly involved in financing and development. It follows and greatly expands on the work of the previous 2.3 billion euros European [[Envisat]] program which operated from 2002 to 2012.

Copernicus moved from R&amp;D to operational services following a phased approach:
* '''2008 – 2010''': Copernicus pre-operational services (FTS and Pilot services)
* '''2011 – 2013''': Copernicus initial operations
* '''From 2014''': Copernicus fully operational services

===Chronology===
*'''19 May 1998:''' institutions involved in the development of space activities in Europe give birth to GMES through a declaration known as "The Baveno Manifesto". At that time, GMES stands for "Global Monitoring for Environmental Security"
*'''Year 1999:''' the name is changed to "Global Monitoring for Environment and Security", thus illustrating that the management of the environment also has security implications.
*'''2001:''' at the occasion of the Gothenburg Summit, the Heads of State and Government request that "''the Community contribute to establishing by 2008 a European capacity for Global Monitoring for Environment and Security''".
*'''October 2002:''' the nature and scope of the "Security" component of GMES are defined as addressing prevention of and response to crises related to natural and technological risk, humanitarian aid and international cooperation, monitoring of compliance with international treaties for conflict prevention, humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and surveillance of EU borders.
*'''February 2004:''' the Commission Communication "''GMES: Establishing a GMES capacity by 2008''" introduces an Action Plan aimed at establishing a working GMES capacity by 2008. In 2004, a Framework Agreement is also signed between EC and ESA, thus providing the basis for a space component of GMES.

==Earth Observation missions==

===Sentinel missions===
ESA is currently developing seven missions under the Sentinel programme. The Sentinel missions include radar and super-spectral imaging for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring. Each Sentinel mission is based on a constellation of two satellites to fulfill and revisit the coverage requirements for each mission, providing robust datasets for all Copernicus services. The Sentinel missions will have the following objectives:
* [[Sentinel-1]] will provide all-weather, day and night radar imaging for land and ocean services. The first [[Sentinel-1A]] satellite was successfully launched on 3 April 2014, by an [[Arianespace Soyuz]], from the [[Guyana Space Center]];.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2014/4-3-2014-VS07-launch-success.asp|title=Arianespace boosts Sentinel-1A Earth observation satellite into orbit|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second [[Sentinel-1B]] satellite was launched on 25 April 2016 from same spaceport.
* [[Sentinel-2]] will provide high-resolution optical imaging for land services (e.g. imagery of vegetation, soil and water cover, inland waterways and coastal areas). Sentinel-2 will also provide information for emergency services. The first Sentinel-2 satellite has successfully launched on 23 June 2015.&lt;ref name="prelaunch-2A"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceref.com/earth/earth-observation-satellite-sentinel-2a-ready-to-launch.html |title=Earth Observation Satellite Sentinel-2A Ready to Launch |work=European Space Agency |publisher=SpaceRef |date=9 June 2016 |accessdate=2015-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sentinel-3]] will provide ocean and global land monitoring services. The first [[Sentinel-3A]] satellite was launched on 16 January 2016 by a Eurockot [[Rokot]] vehicle from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in Russia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3_stacks_up|title=Sentinel-3 stacks up|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=24 April 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3A_on_its_way|title=Sentinel-3A on its Way}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''In-Situ'' Coordination==
GMES In-Situ Coordination (GISC). GISC is a FP7 funded initiative, will last for three years (January 2010 – December 2012) and is coordinated by the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA).

''In-situ'' data are all data from sources other than Earth observation satellites. Consequently, all ground-based, air-borne, and ship/buoy-based observations and measurements that are needed to implement and operate the Copernicus services are part of the in-situ component. In-situ data are indispensable; they are assimilated into forecasting models, provide calibration and validation of space-based information, and contribute to analysis or filling gaps not available from space sources.

GISC objectives will be achieved by:
* documenting the in-situ data needs and data requirements
* cooperating with the users, stakeholders, and service providers
* exploring and determining methods to enable networks to provide the required in-situ data for Copernicus
* exploring approaches to the integration of in-situ assets and networks into long-term sustainable frameworks for Copernicus services
* providing 'quick-wins'

GISC is undertaken with reference to other initiatives, such as [[INSPIRE]] (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe) and SEIS (Shared Environmental Information System) as well as existing coordination and data exchange networks. The coordinated access to data will retain the capacity to link directly data providers and the service providers because it is based on the principles of SEIS and [[INSPIRE]]. The implementation of INSPIRE is embedded in the synergies and meta-data standards that are used in GISC. Data and information will aim to be managed as close as possible to its source in order to achieve a distributed system, by involving countries and existing capacities that maintain and operate the required observation infrastructure.

== Services component==
Copernicus services are dedicated to the monitoring and forecasting of the Earth's subsystems. They contribute directly to the monitoring of climate change. Copernicus services also address emergency management (e.g. in case of natural disaster, technological accidents or humanitarian crises) and security-related issues (e.g. maritime surveillance, border control).

Copernicus services address six main thematic areas:
* '''[[Copernicus Emergency Management Service|Emergency Management Service]]''' (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: [http://www.copernicus.eu/main/emergency-management Copernicus Emergency Management Service]). The service was declared operational on 1 April 2012.
* '''Land Monitoring''' (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: [http://www.copernicus.eu/main/land-monitoring Copernicus Land Monitoring Service]). The service was declared operational on 1 April 2012.
* '''Marine Environment Monitoring''' (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: [http://www.copernicus.eu/main/marine-monitoring Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service]). The service was declared operational on 1 May 2015.
* '''[[Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service|Atmosphere Monitoring]]''' (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: [http://www.copernicus.eu/main/atmosphere-monitoring Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service]). The service was declared operational in July 2015.
* '''Security''' (See [http://www.copernicus.eu/main/security Copernicus Service for Security Applications])
* '''[[Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)|Climate Change]]''' (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: [http://www.copernicus.eu/main/climate-change Copernicus Climate Change Monitoring Service])

The development of the pre-operational version of the services has been realised by a series of projects launched by the European Commission and partly funded through the EU's 7th Framework Programme (FP7). These projects were geoland2 (land), [[MyOcean]] (marine), SAFER (emergency response), MACC and its successor MACC II (atmosphere) and [[G-MOSAIC]] (security). Most of these projects also contributed to the monitoring of Climate Change.
* '''geoland2''' started on 1 September 2008. The project covered a wide range of domains such as land use, land cover change, soil sealing, water quality and availability, spatial planning, forest management, carbon storage and global food security.
* '''MyOcean''' started on 1 January 2009. It covered themes such as maritime security, oil spill prevention, marine resource management, climate change, seasonal forecast, coastal activities, ice survey and water pollution.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090718231434/http://www.emergencyresponse.eu/ '''SAFER'''] started on 1 January 2009. The project addressed three main domains: civil protection, humanitarian aid and Security crises management.
* [http://www.gmes-atmosphere.eu/ '''MACC'''] started on 1 June 2009. The project continued and refined the products developed in the projects [http://gems.ecmwf.int/ GEMS] and [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100604181907/http://www.gse-promote.org/ PROMOTE]. A second phase of funding for the pre-operational Copernicus atmospheric monitoring and forecasting service provided by MACC (MACC II) had been secured until July 2014.
* [http://www.gmes-gmosaic.eu/ '''G-MOSAIC'''] started on 1 January 2009. Together with the [[LIMES Project|LIMES project]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20100124033856/http://www.fp6-limes.eu/] (co-funded by the European Commission under FP6), [[G-MOSAIC]] specifically dealt with the Security domain of Copernicus addressing topics such as Support to Intelligence &amp; Early Warning and Support to Crisis Management Operations.

==Interaction==

===Users===

"The information provided by the Copernicus services can be used by end users for a wide range of applications in a variety of areas. These include urban area management, sustainable development and nature protection, regional and local planning, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, health, civil protection, infrastructure, transport and mobility, as well as tourism."&lt;ref name="CopernicusBrief" /&gt;

Copernicus is the [[European Union]]'s contribution to the [[Global Earth Observation System of Systems]] (GEOSS) thus delivering geospatial information globally.

Some Copernicus services make use of [[OpenStreetMap]] data in their maps production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CopernicusEMS/status/768787888993607680|title=@OpenStreetMapIt @Ale_Zena_IT Indeed, last OSM shapefile used in our maps production is from 11am today. Thank you for your precious help.|author=Copernicus EMS|date=2016-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other relevant initiatives==
Other initiatives will also facilitate the development and functioning of Copernicus services:
* [http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ INSPIRE]: this initiative aims at building a European spatial data infrastructure beyond national boundaries.
* Urban Atlas: Compiled from thousands of satellite photographs, the Urban Atlas provides detailed and cost-effective digital mapping, ensuring that city planners have the most up-to-date and accurate data available on land use and land cover. The Urban Atlas will enable urban planners to better assess risks and opportunities, ranging from threat of flooding and impact of climate change, to identifying new infrastructure and public transport needs. All cities in the EU will be covered by the Urban Atlas by 2011.

A '''Duluth pack''' is traditional [[canoe pack|portage pack]] used in [[canoe]] travel, particularly in the [[Boundary Waters]] region of northern [[Minnesota]] and the [[Quetico Provincial Park]]  of [[Ontario]].  A specialized type of [[backpack]], Duluth packs are made of heavy [[canvas]], leather, and/or cordura nylon, and are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe.

Originally known as the Poirier pack or Poirier pack-sack (for its inventor, Camille Poirier), as its primary manufacturer was located in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], the pack style later became known as the "Duluth pack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cave |first1=Edward |title=The Boy Scout's Hike Book: The First of a Series of Handy Volumes of Information and Inspiration |date=1913 |publisher=Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=furtman1992&gt;{{cite book |last1=Furtman |first1=Michael |title=Canoe Country Camping: Wilderness Skills for the Boundary Waters and Quetico |date=1992 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |isbn=9781452906676}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
[[File:Number3DuluthPackBack.jpeg|right|thumb|Canvas and leather pack produced by Duluth Pack. Their #3 has no "set out" and so is envelope-shaped.]]
A Duluth pack is a specialized type of [[backpack]] made of heavy [[canvas]], leather, and/or cordura nylon. The packs are a traditional [[portage]] pack which are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a [[canoe]]. The simplest and most traditional Duluth pack consists of a single large envelope which is closed by [[strap]]s and roller [[buckle]]s. The pack is carried by two shoulder straps, and sometimes a [[tumpline]] worn over the top of the head.

Their key attributes make them well adapted to wilderness canoe camping where travel is largely by water (where the packs and gear do not need to be carried) punctuated by portages where the packs and gear need to be carried over land: 

*They are generally larger than other packs, accommodating a larger quantity of gear. Canoe camping typically involves carrying more and heavier gear than, for example, backpacking.   
*They must be built strong, carrying heavy loads even when exposure to the elements can weaken certain pack materials such as by saturation of leather. 
*Their shape accommodates large volumes while remaining compact, and their design has few protuberances. This allows better fitting into canoes, less snagging during loading and unloading, less "catching" of the wind when traveling, and packing lower in canoes to lower the center of gravity to enhance canoe stability. 
*They are not tall above the wearer's shoulders (such as backpacking packs typically are) allowing the wearer to also carry a canoe.  
*Some have a tumpline which assists weight distribution with heavy loads.   

Conversely, they lack many features and attributes of long distance backpacking type backpacks, and so are generally not used for such.

An '''electronic flight instrument system''' ('''EFIS''') is a [[Cockpit|flight deck]] instrument display system that displays flight data electronically rather than electromechanically. An EFIS normally consists of a [[primary flight display]] (PFD), [[multi-function display]] (MFD), and an [[engine indicating and crew alerting system]] (EICAS) display. Early EFIS models used [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays, but [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCD) are now more common. The complex electromechanical [[attitude indicator|attitude director indicator]] (ADI) and [[horizontal situation indicator]] (HSI) were the first candidates for replacement by EFIS. Now, however, few flight deck instruments cannot be replaced by an electronic display.

== Overview ==
EFIS installations vary greatly. A light aircraft might be equipped with one display unit that displays flight and navigation data. A large, commercial aircraft is likely to have six or more display units. Typical EFIS displays and controls can be seen at this [http://www.b737.org.uk/flightinsts.htm B737 technical information] web site. The equivalent electromechanical instruments are also shown here.

EFIS installation follows the sequence:
* Displays
* Controls
* Data processors
A basic EFIS might have all these facilities in the one unit.

== Display units ==

=== Primary flight display (PFD) ===
On the flight deck, the display units are the most obvious parts of an EFIS system, and are the features that lead to the term ''[[glass cockpit]]''. The display unit that replaces the ADI is called the [[primary flight display]] (PFD). If a separate display replaces the HSI, it is called the navigation display. The PFD displays all information critical to flight, including [[calibrated airspeed]], altitude, heading, attitude, vertical speed and yaw. The PFD is designed to improve a pilot's situational awareness by integrating this information into a single display instead of six different analog instruments, reducing the amount of time necessary to monitor the instruments. PFDs also increase situational awareness by alerting the aircrew to unusual or potentially hazardous conditions&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; for example, low airspeed, high rate of descent&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; by changing the color or shape of the display or by providing audio alerts.

The names Electronic Attitude Director Indicator and Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator are used by some manufacturers.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;Primary flight display and navigation display are the names used in the Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circulars and also in ARINC Specification 725&lt;/ref&gt; However, a simulated ADI is only the centerpiece of the PFD. Additional information is both superimposed on and arranged around this graphic.

Multi-function displays can render a separate navigation display unnecessary. Another option is to use one large screen to show both the PFD and navigation display.

The PFD and navigation display (and multi-function display, where fitted) are often physically identical. The information displayed is determined by the system interfaces where the display units are fitted. Thus, spares holding is simplified: the one display unit can be fitted in any position.

LCD units generate less heat than CRTs; an advantage in a congested instrument panel. They are also lighter, and occupy a lower volume.

=== Multi-function display (MFD) ===
[[file:Navigation Display (ND) on Boeing 747-400.jpg|thumb|The Navigation Display (ND) of a [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737NG]] Aircraft.]]
The MFD (multi-function display) displays navigational and weather information from multiple systems. MFDs are most frequently designed as "chart-centric", where the aircrew can overlay different information over a map or chart. Examples of MFD overlay information include the aircraft's current route plan, weather information from either on-board radar or lightning detection sensors or ground-based sensors, e.g., NEXRAD, restricted airspace and aircraft traffic. The MFD can also be used to view other non-overlay type of data (e.g., current route plan) and calculated overlay-type data, e.g., the glide radius of the aircraft, given current location over terrain, winds, and aircraft speed and altitude.

MFDs can also display information about aircraft systems, such as fuel and electrical systems (see EICAS, below). As with the PFD, the MFD can change the color or shape of the data to alert the aircrew to hazardous situations.

=== Engine indications and crew alerting system (EICAS) / electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM)===
[[EICAS]] (Engine Indications and Crew Alerting System) displays information about the aircraft's systems, including its fuel, electrical and propulsion systems (engines). EICAS displays are often designed to mimic traditional round gauges while also supplying digital readouts of the parameters.

EICAS improves situational awareness by allowing the aircrew to view complex information in a graphical format and also by alerting the crew to unusual or hazardous situations. For example, if an engine begins to lose oil pressure, the EICAS might sound an alert, switch the display to the page with the oil system information and outline the low oil pressure data with a red box. Unlike traditional round gauges, many levels of warnings and alarms can be set. Proper care must be taken when designing EICAS to ensure that the aircrew are always provided with the most important information and not overloaded with warnings or alarms.

[[Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor|ECAM]] is a similar system used by Airbus, which in addition to providing EICAS functions also recommend remedial action.

[[File:737-800 EIS After Landing.jpg|300px|thumb|A 737NG EICAS after landing, showing outside air temperature, N1 RPM, exhaust gas temperature, N2 RPM, Fuel Flow/Fuel Used indications, fuel on the tanks, oil pressure, oil temperature, oil quantity, engine vibration, hydraulic pressure and hydraulic quantity.]]

== Control panels ==
EFIS provides pilots with controls that select display range and mode (for example, map or compass rose) and enter data (such as selected heading).

Where other equipment uses pilot inputs, [[ARINC 429|data buses]] broadcast the pilot's selections so that the pilot need only enter the selection once. For example, the pilot selects the desired level-off altitude on a control unit. The EFIS repeats this selected altitude on the PFD, and by comparing it with the actual altitude (from the air data computer) generates an altitude error display. This same altitude selection is used by the automatic flight control system to level off, and by the altitude alerting system to provide appropriate warnings.

== Data processors ==
The EFIS visual display is produced by the symbol generator. This receives data inputs from the pilot, signals from sensors, and EFIS format selections made by the pilot. The symbol generator can go by other names, such as display processing computer, display electronics unit, etc.

The symbol generator does more than generate symbols. It has (at the least) monitoring facilities, a graphics generator and a display driver.&lt;ref name="driver"&gt;This driver is hardware, not software!&lt;/ref&gt; Inputs from sensors and controls arrive via data buses, and are checked for validity. The required computations are performed, and the graphics generator and display driver produce the inputs to the display units.

=== Capabilities ===

Like personal computers, flight instrument systems need power-on-self-test facilities and continuous self-monitoring. Flight instrument systems, however, need additional monitoring capabilities:
*Input validation&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; verify that each sensor is providing valid data
*Data comparison&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; cross check inputs from duplicated sensors
*Display monitoring&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; detect failures within the instrument system

=== Former practice ===

Traditional (electromechanical) displays are equipped with [[synchro]] mechanisms that transmit the pitch, roll, and heading shown on the captain and [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer's]] instruments to an instrument comparator. The comparator warns of excessive differences between the Captain and First Officer displays. Even a fault as far ''downstream''&lt;ref name="term1"&gt;Downstream and upstream refer to the direction of data flow: from sensor, to processor, to display&lt;/ref&gt; as a jam in, say, the roll mechanism of an ADI triggers a comparator warning. The instrument comparator thus provides both comparator monitoring and display monitoring.

=== Comparator monitoring ===
With EFIS, the comparator function is simple: Is roll data (bank angle) from sensor 1 the same as roll data from sensor 2? If not, display a warning caption (such as '''CHECK ROLL''') on both PFDs. Comparison monitors give warnings for airspeed, pitch, roll, and altitude indications. More advanced EFIS systems have more comparator monitors.

=== Display monitoring ===

In this technique, each symbol generator contains two display monitoring channels. One channel, the internal, samples the output from its own symbol generator to the display unit and computes, for example, what roll attitude should produce that indication. This computed roll attitude is then compared with the roll attitude input to the symbol generator from the [[Inertial guidance system|INS]] or [[Attitude and Heading Reference Systems|AHRS]]. Any difference has probably been introduced by faulty processing, and triggers a warning on the relevant display.

The external monitoring channel carries out the same check on the symbol generator on the other side of the flight deck: the Captain's symbol generator checks the First Officer's, the First Officer's checks the Captain's. Whichever symbol generator detects a fault, puts up a warning on its own display.

The external monitoring channel also checks sensor inputs (to the symbol generator) for reasonableness. A spurious input, such as a radio height greater than the radio altimeter's maximum, results in a warning.

== Human factors ==

=== Clutter ===
At various stages of a flight, a pilot needs different combinations of data. Ideally, the avionics only show the data in use—but an electromechanical instrument must be in view all the time. To improve display clarity, ADIs and HSIs use intricate mechanisms to remove superfluous indications temporarily—e.g., removing the glide slope scale when the pilot doesn't need it.

Under normal conditions, an EFIS might not display some indications, e.g., engine vibration. Only when some parameter exceeds its limits does the system display the reading. In similar fashion, EFIS is programmed to show the glideslope scale and pointer only during an [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] approach.

In the case of an input failure, an electromechanical instrument adds yet another indicator—typically, a bar drops across the erroneous data. EFIS, on the other hand, removes invalid data from the display and substitutes an appropriate warning.

A de-clutter mode activates automatically when circumstances require the pilot's attention for a specific item. For example, if the aircraft pitches up or down beyond a specified limit—usually 30 to 60 degrees—the attitude indicator de-clutters other items from sight until the pilot brings the pitch to an acceptable level. This helps the pilot focus on the most important tasks.

=== Color ===
Traditional instruments have long used color, but lack the ability to change a color to indicate some change in condition. The electronic display technology of EFIS has no such restriction and uses color widely. For example, as an aircraft approaches the glide slope, a blue caption can indicate glide slope is armed, and capture might change the color to green. Typical EFIS systems color code the navigation needles to reflect the type of navigation. Green needles indicate ground based navigation, such as VORs, Localizers and ILS systems. Magenta needles indicate GPS navigation.

== Advantages ==
EFIS provides versatility by avoiding some physical limitations of traditional instruments. A pilot can switch the same display that shows a course deviation indicator to show the planned track provided by an area navigation or flight management system. Pilots can choose to superimpose the weather radar picture on the displayed route.

The flexibility afforded by software modifications minimises the costs of responding to new aircraft regulations and equipment. Software updates can update an EFIS system to extend its capabilities. Updates introduced in the 1990s included the [[ground proximity warning system]], and [[traffic collision avoidance system]].

A degree of redundancy is available even with the simple two-screen EFIS installation. Should the PFD fail, transfer switching repositions its vital information to the screen normally occupied by the navigation display.

== Advances in EFIS ==
In the late 1980s, EFIS became standard equipment on most [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]] [[airliner]]s, and many business aircraft adopted EFIS in the 1990s.

Recent advances in computing power and reductions in the cost of liquid-crystal displays and navigational sensors (such as GPS and [[attitude and heading reference system]]) have brought EFIS to [[general aviation]] aircraft. Notable examples are the [[Garmin]] G1000 and [[Chelton Flight Systems]] EFIS-SV.

Several EFIS manufacturers have focused on the [[experimental aircraft]] market, producing EFIS and EICAS systems for as little as [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000-2000. The low cost is possible because of steep drops in the price of sensors and displays, and equipment for experimental aircraft doesn't require expensive [[Federal Aviation Administration]] certification. This latter point restricts their use to experimental aircraft and certain other aircraft categories, depending on local regulations. Uncertified EFIS systems are also found in Sport Pilot category aircraft, including factory built, microlight, and ultralight aircraft. These systems can be fitted to certified aircraft in some cases as secondary or backup systems depending on local aviation rules.

'''Elevator:2010''' was an [[inducement prize contest]] with the purpose of developing [[space elevator]] and space elevator-related technologies. Elevator:2010 organized annual competitions for climbers, ribbons and power-beaming systems, and was operated by a partnership between Spaceward Foundation and the [[NASA]] [[Centennial Challenges]].

== History ==
[[File:Space elevator structural diagram--corrected for scale+CM+etc.svg|thumb|200px|A conceptual image of a future [[space elevator]].]]
On March 23, 2005 [[NASA]]'s [[Centennial Challenges]] program announced a partnership with the Spaceward Foundation regarding Elevator:2010, to raise the amounts of monetary prizes and to get more teams involved in the competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA - NASA Announces First Centennial Challenges' Prizes|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/mar/HQ_m05083_Centennial_prizes.html|publisher=nasa.gov|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership was not renewed after its initial 5-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA, the Space Elevator Challenges and the Kansas City Space Pirates|url=http://www.spaceelevatorblog.com/?p=1544 |publisher=www.spaceelevatorblog|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two (out of an intended seven) competitions of the NASA [[Centennial Challenges]] which fell under the Elevator:2010 banner: The Tether Challenge and the Beam Power Challenge. There were also the two original competitions.

=== Tether Challenge ===
This competition presented the challenge of constructing super-strong tethers, a crucial component of a [[space elevator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Elevator:2010's annual climber competition |url=http://www.spaceward.org/elevator2010-ts |publisher=spaceward.org |accessdate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201135351/http://spaceward.org/elevator2010-ts |archivedate=2008-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 contest was to award US$50,000 to the team which constructed the strongest [[tether]], with contests in future years requiring that each winner outperform that of the previous year by 50%. No competing tether surpassed the commercial [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] baseline and the prize was increased to $200,000 in 2006.

Of the four teams competing, three were disqualified for not following length rules—one of these cases by a fraction of a millimeter. Ultimately, the 'House Tether' won against the remaining team. The 'House Tether' is composed of Zylon fiber and M77 adhesive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceward.org/elevator-when How close is the Space Elevator? How expensive will it be?- Data Point References]&lt;/ref&gt; It was stronger than the machine used to test the tether itself: it began to fail at {{convert|1600|lbf|N}}, forcing the test to be called off.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=== Beam Power Challenge ===
The '''Beam Power Challenge''' was a competition to build a wirelessly-powered ribbon-climbing robot. The contest involves having the robot raise a specified [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] to a specific height within a limited period of time. The first competition in 2005 would have awarded {{currency|50,000|US}}, US$20,000, and US$10,000 to the three best-performing teams meeting the minimum benchmark of {{convert|1|m/s}}. However no team met the minimum standard in 2005.

In 2006 the prize for first place increased to $150,000 with the goal of climbing 50 meters in under 1 minute. It was held October 20–21, 2006 at the [[Las Cruces International Airport]] at the [[Wirefly X PRIZE Cup]]. 13 teams entered the competition. Only one team,  [[University of Saskatchewan]], was able to climb the tether in under 1 minute, reaching the top in {{nowrap|58 s}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Challenge had $500,000 in prize money for the 2007 competition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

At the 2009 Challenge, on November 6, 2009, [[LaserMotive]] successfully used lasers to drive a {{convert|abbr=on|4.8|kg|lb}} device up a {{convert|abbr=on|900|m|ft|-1}} cable suspended from a helicopter.&lt;ref name="day_2_results"&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://www.spaceelevatorgames.org/second-day-results/  | title=Second Day Results  | accessdate=2009-11-07  | date=2009-11-05  | work=Space Elevator Games  | publisher=The Spaceward Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com" /&gt;  Energy is transmitted to the climber using a high-power infrared beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://www.lasermotive.com/blog/  | title=Main  | accessdate=2009-11-07  | work=Blog  | publisher=LaserMotive  | deadurl=yes  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018103923/http://www.lasermotive.com/blog/  | archivedate=2009-10-18  | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  LaserMotive's entry, which was the only climber to top the cable, reached an average speed of {{convert|13|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and earned a $900,000 prize.  This marked both a performance record, and the first award of a cash prize at the Challenge.&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.space.com/news/091106-space-elevator-games-results.html  | title=Seattle Team Wins $900,000 in Space Elevator Contest   | accessdate=2009-11-07  | author=Moskowitz, Clara  | date=2009-11-06  | publisher=Space.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaserMotive won the {{currency|900000|US}} prize for the Level 1 power beaming prize in 2009 with the achievement of {{convert|2|m/s}} climber speed over a sub-kilometer climb.  The Level 2 power beaming prize, for a {{convert|5|m/s}} climb, remains available for future competitions.&lt;ref name=swf20110314/&gt;

== Future competitions ==
After LaserMotive claimed the {{currency|900000|US}} prize for the Level 1 power beaming prize in 2009, the Space Elevator games being conducted by Elevator:2010 planned to offer a prize purse for future competitions of {{currency|4000000|US}}, for both the Power Beaming (Climber) Competition and the Tether Strength Competition.&lt;ref name=swf20110314&gt;

'''Elizabeth Riddle Graves''' (25 January 1916 – 6 January 1972) was a pioneer in the physics of [[neutron]]s and the detection and measurement of fast neutrons. During [[World War II]], she worked in the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] and at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], becoming a group leader there after the war.

==Biography==
Elizabeth Riddle was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on 23 January 1916 to James Marion Riddle from [[South Carolina]] and Georgia Clymetra Boykin from [[Arkansas]]. She had two brothers, James Marion Riddle Jr. and John Burwell Boykin Riddle. Around 1921, the Riddle family moved to Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United States Census, 1930 |publisher=FamilySearch |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XSGM-XVS |accessdate=15 August 2015}} Elizabeth B Riddle in household of James M Riddle, Chicago (Districts 0751-1000), Cook, Illinois, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 0765, sheet 12A, family 145, line 4, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 449; FHL microfilm 2,340,184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riddle entered the [[University of Chicago]], where she was known as "Diz".&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howes |first=Ruth H. |year=1999 |first2=Caroline L. |last2=Herzenberg |title=Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project |publisher=Temple University |isbn=978-0-585-38881-6 |oclc=49569088 |pp=48–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned her [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[physics]] in 1936,&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; and developed a keen interest in the physics of [[neutrons]], particularly the detection and measurement of [[fast neutrons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=25 |issue=4 p=67 |pages=67 |date=April 1972 |title=Elizabeth R. Graves |doi=10.1063/1.3070831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned her [[PhD]] in 1940, writing her thesis on the "Energy Released from Be 9 (d, α) Li 7 and the Production of Li 7" under the supervision of [[Samuel K. Allison]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical dictionary of women in science : pioneering lives from ancient times to the mid-20th century |first=Marilyn |last=Ogilvie |first2=Joy |last2=Harvey |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pp=522–523 |isbn=9780415920407 |oclc=803021974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thesis"/&gt;

While there, she met and married [[Alvin C. Graves]], a fellow physics major.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Becker |first=Bill |title=The Man Who Sets Off Atomic Bombs |newspaper=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |date=April 19, 1952| pages=32–33, 185–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs were hard to find during the [[Great Depression]]. Alvin remained at the University of Chicago as a research fellow and an assistant professor until 1939, when he moved to the [[University of Texas]],&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; but Elizabeth was unable to secure a job there as well due to its anti-[[nepotism]] rules, which tended to discriminate against women.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;

In 1942 Alvin was invited back to the University of Chicago by [[Arthur H. Compton]] to join the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]].
&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; Elizabeth found employment there as well, working with [[Enrico Fermi]] on the calculations involved in determining the feasibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]], which eventually led to the development of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

In 1943 they joined the Manhattan Project's  [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]]. With Texas in mind, Alvin made it a condition of his going there that Elizabeth also be given a job. As it turned out, she almost certainly would have been recruited anyway. She was one of the few scientists who knew about fast neutron scattering, which was crucial to [[nuclear weapon design]], and who knew how to operate the [[Cockcroft–Walton accelerator]] that had been brought from the [[University of Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;

At the time of the [[Trinity nuclear test]] in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. They therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and using [[Geiger counter]]s, they monitored the test's [[radioactive fallout]], which took until the afternoon to reach them. Elizabeth finished an experiment while in labor, timing her contractions with a stopwatch.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt; The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; Alvin and Elizabeth had two more children, Alvin Palmer and Elizabeth Anne.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

They remained in Los Alamos after the war. Elizabeth became a group leader in the experimental physics division in 1950, and researched neutron interactions with matter and material.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colleen Coyne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=honorsprojects |last=Coyne |first=Colleen |date=29 April 2013 |title=Female Scientists, the Military, and Informing Policy |publisher=Bowling Green State University |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died of cancer at Bataan Memorial Hospital in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]],&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; on 6 January 1972, and was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery, Los Alamos, Los Alamos County, New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVK6-YN89 |publisher=Family Search |accessdate=15 August 2015 |title=Elizabeth Riddle Graves}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave |grid=39395345 |title=Elizabeth Riddle Graves |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thesis====
{{quote| The α-particles from Be9(d,α)Li7 have been investigated with a variable air pressure absorption cell, ionization chamber and linear amplifier. It has been established that there are two groups of α-particles differing at 760 mm pressure and 15°C by 3.08±0.10 mm range reduced to zero bombarding voltage. The groups have been shown to be associated with the production of Li7 in the ground state and in an excited state. At 239 kv bombarding voltage, the excited state is formed 1.7 times as often as the ground state. The energy balance, Q, associated with the production of the ground state has been determined to be 7.093±0.022 Mev. The energy of the excited level has been determined to be 494±16 kev. The total yield curve for α-particles has been investigated from 235 kv to 390 kv bombarding voltage. The measured value for the energy of the excited level in Li7 is discussed in connection with values from other reactions in which Li7 is an end product and with γ-ray measurements of the level.&lt;ref name="Thesis"/&gt; }}

'''Enumeral''' was a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]-based [[biotechnology]] company which developed [[monoclonal antibody]] immunotherapies through an 'immunoprofiling' platform that allowed it to scan the human immune microenvironment and identify and validate potential drug candidates. The company filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] and arranged to sell its assets to Xoma Corporation in January 2018.

== The company ==

Enumeral was founded in 2009 to bring together various immunoprofiling technologies from [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the [[Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research]] and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10-Q: Enumeral Biomedical Holdings Inc|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-q-enumeral-biomedical-holdings-inc-2015-11-10|publisher=Marketwatch.com|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's Scientific Founder was Christopher Love, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT; the Executive Chairman is John Rydzewskand and its CEO is Arthur Tinkelenberg. In 2014 the company was taken public through a [[reverse takeover]] into a shell called Cerulean Group. Its stock is traded [[OTC Markets Group|OTC]] in the US, with trading in the OTCQB marketplace tier commencing on 4 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/pr-2014-08-04.php|title=Enumeral Biomedical Raises $21.5 Million from New and Current Investors, Begins Public Trading|last=|first=|date=August 4, 2014|work=|accessdate=December 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322141209/http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/pr-2014-08-04.php|archive-date=January 5, 2016|publisher=Enumeral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock code is ENUM.

== Platform ==

Enumeral's platform consists of various proprietary cellular libraries derived from target-specific immunized sources or from human patient donors. The platform has three main parts:

*'''Microengraving.''' This platform has its origins in work which Love et al. published in the journal ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' in 2006. Their foundational paper showed that it was possible to quickly capture a large mass of antibody-producing cells through engraved microarrays based on [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing, where those arrays were carrying the secreted products of single cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the first they applied it to [[Peripheral blood mononuclear cell|PBMCs]] from a [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type I diabetic]] patient and reported that a small percentage of [[CD19]]+ B cells were secreting [[proinsulin]]-reactive antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Anti PD-1 antibodies ==

An early commercial interest of Enumeral has focused on PD-1, currently targeted by two FDA-approved monoclonal antibody drugs - [[Pembrolizumab|Keytruda]], from  [[Merck &amp; Co.]], and [[Nivolumab|Opdivo]], from [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]. In 2015 Enumeral reported that it had used its platform to raise anti-PD-1 antibodies that did not compete with Keytruda or Opdivo for binding to PD-1, nor did they appear to compete with PD-1's [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]], [[PD-L1]]. These potentially [[allosteric]] antibodies also produced more [[interferon gamma]] and showed dose-dependent increases in T cell [[CD25]] expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Enumeral Announces Identification of Anti-PD-1 Antibodies with Potential for Differentiated Mechanism of Action|date=September 24, 2015|publisher=Enumeral|url=http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-09-24.php|accessdate=December 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105104109/http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-09-24.php|archive-date=January 5, 2016}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Enumeral's antibodies caused higher T cell activation in ''ex vivo'' human assays than the currently marketed anti-PD-1 antibodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Enumeral Reports That Its Novel Class of Anti-PD-1 Antibodies Elicits Higher T Cell Activation in Ex Vivo Human Assays than Currently Marketed Anti-PD-1 Antibodies|date=November 3, 2015|publisher=Enumeral|url=http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-11-03.php|accessdate=28 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105111315/http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-11-03.php|archive-date=January 5, 2016}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in that same setting, in combination with one of the marketed antibodies, could elicit an additive effect on T cell activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Enumeral Reports That Its Novel Class of Potentially Allosteric Anti-PD-1 Antibodies Can Elicit an Additive Effect on T Cell Activation in Ex Vivo Human Assays When Used in Combination With A Currently Marketed Anti-PD-1 Antibody|url=http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-11-18.php|accessdate=27 December 2015|publisher=Enumeral|date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105040218/http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-11-18.php |archive-date=January 5, 2016 }}{{self-published source|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enumeral expects to take an anti-PD-1 antibody into clinical testing in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Enumeral Expands Scientific Advisory Board to Support Development of Novel Immunomodulators|url=http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-06-04.php|accessdate=28 December 2015|publisher=Enumeral.com|date=June 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105111857/http://www.enumeral.com/news-events/news-events-press-release-2015-06-04.php |archive-date=January 5, 2016 }}{{self-published source|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">'''Equivalent input''' (also '''input-referred''' or '''input-related'''), is a method of referring to the signal or noise level at the output of a system as if it were an input to the same system. This is accomplished by removing all signal changes (e.g. [[amplifier]] [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[transducer]] [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], etc.) to get the units to match the input.&lt;ref name="IEC61000-4-3"&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/Artnum_PK/39224 IEC61000-4-3], Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 4-3: Testing and measurement techniques - Radiated, radio-frequency, electromagnetic field immunity test&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aes.org/par/e/#ein|title=AES Pro Audio Reference - EIN|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aes.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Equivalent Input Noise (EIN) ===
A [[microphone]] converts [[acoustical]] [[energy]] to [[electrical]] energy. Microphones have some level of electrical [[noise]] at their output. This noise may have contributions from random [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] movement, [[thermal noise]], or a dozen other sources, but those can all be thought of as an imaginary acoustic noise source injecting sound into the (now noiseless) microphone. The units on this noise are no longer [[volts]], but units of sound pressure ([[pascals]] or [[dBSPL]]), which can be directly compared to the desired sound pressure inputs.

=== Input-Related Interference Level (IRIL) ===
A device which uses a [[microphone]] may be susceptible to [[electromagnetic interference]] which causes [[sonic artifact]]s. The problem is not in the microphone, but the interference level can be ''related'' back to the input to compare to the level of typical inputs to see how [[Hearing|audible]] the artifact is.

[[Image:OstrichFeatherDuster.jpg|thumb|150px|Ostrich feather duster]]
A '''feather duster''' is an implement used for cleaning.  It consists typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers from either the male or female [[ostrich]] bird that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire. Dusters vary in size but are most often between {{convert|14|to|32|inch|cm}} in total length. Some dusters have a retractable casing instead of a dowel handle. These dusters are typically used by [[Rack Jobber|rack-jobbers]] and [[truck driver]]s who need to dust store shelves, and like to retract the feathers into the handle to avoid damage.

Feather dusters are effective in dusting tight areas, or areas where there are a lot of odds and ends to dust around. The individual feathers are able to penetrate through the knick-knacks and pull the dust out of the area without disturbing items. On large open surfaces or walls, or in trying to get [[spider web]]s in the ceiling, either a feather duster or other dusters like [[lambswool]] or synthetic dusters will work.

==History==
In 1870, the original idea for the feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in [[Jones County, Iowa]], U.S.A. farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking if they could be used to assembly a brush. E.E. Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather duster. Using a short [[broom stick]] and splitting the feathers with a [[pocket knife]], the duster was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of [[Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Jones County, Iowa: past and present, Volume 1|publisher=S. J. Clarke publishing co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5gUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA477&amp;sig=2uybIHwg7E7Gwmg_1kwb2NC-1L4&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, Susan Hibbard of [[Geneva Lake]], [[Wisconsin]], U.S. used discarded turkey feathers to invent a feather duster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Experience|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/telephone/sfeature/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hibbard filed a patent (U.S. patent #177,939) on November 13, 1874 which was issued on May 30, 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improvement in Feather Dusters|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url= http://www.google.com/patents?id=roBWAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a hard fought legal battle against her husband, George Hibbard, and the National Feather Duster Company in December 1881, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] in [[Chicago]] ruled in favor of Susan Hibbard giving her [[Priority right|priority]] of invention of the feather duster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cases argued and determined in the Circuit and District courts of the United States: for the Seventh judicial circuit.|publisher=Callaghan &amp; co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9C63AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=Susan+Hibbard+and+feather+duster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b1cuxrFpMm&amp;sig=7oIDYEdfe4DnKd9qtxE3eiT5-rA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Mdb-TdHUEsiCtgeyz8S8Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South African ostrich feather dusters were developed in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa by missionary, broom factory manager, Harry S. Beckner in 1903. He felt that the Ostrich feathers made a convenient tool for cleaning up the machines at the broom factory. His first ostrich feather dusters were wound on broom handles using the foot powered kick winders and the same wire used to attach broom straw. 
The Chicago Feather Duster Company was established in 1875. They received a patent for the head of the duster on September 17, 1907 along with a patent for the cuff on December 22, 1906.

The first ostrich feather duster company in the United States was formed in 1913 by Harry S. Beckner and his brother George Beckner in [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]], [[Massachusetts]] and has survived till this day as the Beckner Feather Duster Company under the care of George Beckner's great granddaughter, Margret Fish Rempher. Today the largest manufacturer of Ostrich Feather Dusters is Klein Karoo International (Feathers) which is located in [[Oudtshoorn]], South Africa.

The feather duster was considered a status symbol in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Types==
[[File:Feather dusters.jpg|thumb|A common Asian feather duster made of chicken feathers attached to a bamboo stick]]
There are several types of feathers used in feather dusters, but [[ostrich]] feathers are most often used. Feathers for dusters are the ostrich family's most valuable industrial commodity.

Black ostrich feathers come from the male ostrich and are very soft with feathers that are more "stringy" in nature. Gray ostrich feathers are more stark than the black feathers and are often sold at [[grocery store]]s. Floss ostrich feathers are the most soft and delicate feathers and come from underneath the bird's wings. Floss ostrich feathers are more expensive. Chick feathers are more pointed and stark than ostrich feathers, are usually sold at very low prices.

Throughout China, feather dusters are normally made of chicken feathers. They are attached to a length of bamboo, and unlike Western dusters, are commonly present along most of the stick rather than just the end.

== Mechanics of function ==
[[Ostrich]] feather dusters are effective by means of the tiny [[barbule]]s on the feathers themselves that act as fingers to collect the dust. They are often used around electronics because of their resistance to [[static electricity]].{{reference needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Image:Feu-de-paille-couverture.ogg|thumb|Extinguishing of a fire with a fire blanket]]
A '''fire blanket''' is a safety device designed to extinguish incipient (starting) [[fires]]. It consists of a sheet of a [[Fire-retardant material|fire retardant material]] which is placed over a fire in order to smother it.

Small fire blankets, such as for use in kitchens and around the home are usually made of [[fiberglass]] and sometimes kevlar, and are folded into a quick-release contraption for ease of storage.

Fire blankets, along with fire extinguishers, are fire safety items that can be useful in case of a fire. These nonflammable blankets are helpful in temperatures up to 900 degrees and are useful in smothering fires by not allowing any oxygen to the fire. Due to its simplicity, a fire blanket may be more helpful for someone who is inexperienced with fire extinguishers.

Larger fire blankets, for use in [[laboratory]] and industrial situations, are often made of [[wool]] (sometimes treated with a flame retardant fluid). These blankets are usually mounted in vertical quick-release container so that they can be easily pulled out and wrapped round a person whose clothes are on fire.

==Dangers==

=== Asbestos in old blankets ===
Some older fire blankets were made of woven [[asbestos]] fibers and are not [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] rated. This can pose a hazard during the decommissioning of old equipment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Extinguishing oil/fat fires ===
After initial investigation in 2013, and later in 2014, the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority issued a statement that fire blankets should never be used to extinguish an oil/fat fire such as a chip pan fire, even if the icons or text on the blanket indicates the blanket may be used in such a case.

&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nvwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2204607{{dead link|date=September 2017|fix-attempted = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the investigation out of the 22 tested fire blankets, 16 of the fire blankets themselves caught fire. In the other 6 the fire reignited when the blanket was removed after 17 minutes. The Dutch Fire Burn foundation reported
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandwondenstichting.nl/nieuws/vlam-de-pan-niet-blussen-met-een-blusdeken/|title=Vlam in de pan: niet blussen met een blusdeken|work=Nederlandse Brandwonden Stichting|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107132628/http://brandwondenstichting.nl/nieuws/vlam-de-pan-niet-blussen-met-een-blusdeken/|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; several accidents involving the use of fire blankets when extinguishing oil/fat fires. Consumers may send in their existing fire blankets, which will then receive a sticker stating 'niet geschikt voor olie- en vetbranden' ("not suitable for oil- and fat fires"). New products will have this text printed, rather than stickered.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vwa.nl/actueel/mededelingen-consumentenartikelen/nieuwsbericht/2056082/nvwa-controleert-etikettering-blusdekens|title=NVWA - NVWA controleert etikettering blusdekens|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141107112933/https://www.vwa.nl/actueel/mededelingen-consumentenartikelen/nieuwsbericht/2056082/nvwa-controleert-etikettering-blusdekens|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
For a fire to burn, all three elements of the [[fire triangle]] must be present: heat, fuel and oxygen. The fire blanket is used to cut off the oxygen supply to the fire, thereby putting it out. The fire blanket must be sealed closely to a solid surface around the fire. Fire blankets usually have two pull down tails visible from outside the packaging. The user should place one hand on each tag and pull down simultaneously removing the blanket from the bag.  The tails are located near the top of the fire blanket which allows the top lip of the fire blanket to fold back over the users' hands, protecting them from heat and direct contact burns.

==Maintenance==
The [[Fire_Industry_Association|Fire Industry Association ("FIA")]] publish a "Code of Practice for the Commissioning and Maintenance of Fire Blankets Manufactured to BS EN 1869"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fia.uk.com/resourceLibrary/cop-commissioning&amp;maintenance-of-fire-blankets.html |title=Code of Practice for the Commissioning and Maintenance of Fire Blankets Manufactured to BS EN 1869 |publisher=Fire Industry Association |date=May 2016 |website=Fire Industry Association Website |access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Annual Maintenance by Service Provider ===
The [[Fire_Industry_Association|FIA]]'s code of practice recommends that the responsible person ensures that such fire blankets are subject to annual maintenance by a competent service provider.

=== Service-life expectancy of fire blankets ===
It also recommends that consideration should be given to the replacement of fire blankets after seven years from the date of commissioning (or as otherwise specified by the fire blanket's manufacturer).

A '''grid network''' is a [[computer network]] consisting of a number of (computer) systems connected in a grid topology.

In a regular grid topology, each node in the network is connected with two neighbors along one or more [[dimension]]s.  If the network is one-dimensional, and the chain of nodes is connected to form a circular loop, the resulting topology is known as a ring.  Network systems such as [[Fiber distributed data interface|FDDI]] use two counter-rotating [[token-passing]] rings to achieve high reliability and performance.  In general, when an ''n''-dimensional grid network is connected circularly in more than one dimension, the resulting network topology is a [[torus]], and the network is called "toroidal".  When the number of nodes along each dimension of a toroidal network is 2, the resulting network is called
a [[hypercube]].

A [[parallel computing]] cluster or [[multi-core]] processor is often connected in regular interconnection network such as a
[[de Bruijn graph]],&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/860/1/Spadavecchia_thesis.pdf "A Network-based Asynchronous Architecture for Cryptographic Devices"]
by Ljiljana Spadavecchia 2005.
section "5.6.1.2 De Bruijn graphs", and section "5.6.2.2 Randomised routing in de Bruijn graphs".
&lt;/ref&gt;
a [[hypercube graph]],
a [[hypertree network]],
a [[fat tree]] network,
a [[torus]], or [[cube-connected cycles]].

Note that a grid network is not the same as a grid computer (or [[computational grid]]) (even though the nodes in a grid network are usually computers, and [[grid computing]] obviously requires some kind of [[computer network]] or "universal coding" to interconnect the computers).

'''Hard infrastructure''' is the physical [[infrastructure]] of roads, bridges etc., as opposed to the [[soft infrastructure]] of human capital and the institutions that cultivate infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stateimpact.npr.org/new-hampshire/2011/10/26/infrustructure-soft-and-hard/|title=The Difference Between Soft And Hard Infrastructure, And Why It Matters|work=StateImpact New Hampshire|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article delineates both the [[fixed assets]], and the [[control systems]], [[software]] required to operate, manage and monitor the systems, as well as any accessory buildings, plants, or vehicles that are an essential part of the system. Also included are fleets of vehicles operating according to schedules such as public transit buses and garbage collection, as well as basic energy or communications facilities that are not usually part of a physical network, such as [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[radio]], and [[television]] [[broadcasting]] facilities.

== Attributes ==
Hard infrastructure in general usually has the following attributes:{{according to whom|date=March 2017}}

=== Capital assets that provide services ===
These are physical assets that provide services. The people employed in the hard infrastructure sector generally maintain, monitor, and operate the assets, but do not offer services to the clients or users of the infrastructure. Interactions between workers and clients are generally limited to administrative tasks concerning ordering, scheduling, or billing of services.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== Large networks ===
These are large networks constructed over generations, and are not often replaced as a whole system. The network provides services to a geographically defined area, and has a long life because its service capacity is maintained by continual refurbishment or replacement of components as they wear out.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== Historicity and interdependence ===
The system or network tends to evolve over time as it is continuously modified, improved, enlarged, and as various components are rebuilt, decommissioned or adapted to other uses. The system components are interdependent and not usually capable of subdivision or separate disposal, and consequently are not readily disposable within the commercial marketplace. The system interdependency may limit a component life to a lesser period than the expected life of the component itself.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== Natural monopoly ===
The systems tend to be [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]], insofar that [[economies of scale]] means that multiple agencies providing a service are less efficient than would be the case if a single agency provided the service. This is because the assets have a high initial cost and a value that is difficult to determine. Once most of the system is built, the marginal cost of servicing additional clients or users tends to be relatively inexpensive, and may be negligible if there is no need to increase the peak capacity or the geographical extent of the network.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

In [[public economics]] theory, infrastructure assets such as highways and railways tend to be [[public goods]], in that they carry a high degree of [[non-excludability]], where no household can be excluded from using it, and [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rivalry]], where no household can reduce another from enjoying it. These properties lead to [[externality]], [[free rider problem|free ridership]], and [[spillover effect|spillover]] effects that distort perfect competition and market efficiency. Hence, government becomes the best actor to supply the public goods.&lt;ref&gt;Myles, G. D. (1995) Public Economics. Cambridge University Press. 263-264 pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
In 1990, Grübler discussed the history and importance of transportation infrastructures like canals, railroads, highways, airways and pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Grübler | first1 = Arnulf | author1-link = | title = The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures: Dynamics of Evolution and Technological Change in Transport | year = 1990 |publisher=Physica-Verlag |location= Heidelberg and New York |isbn= |pages= | url = http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1948, there were 14 [[rail transport|railroad]]s in [[North America]] with more than 1000 locomotives in service each.  Twelve were located in the US and two were in Canada.  The total number of steam locomotives and the number of route miles for each railroad in 1948 are given by Bruce (1952).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13662">'''Hydrogen fuel''' is a [[zero-emission]] [[fuel]] when burned with oxygen. It can be used in [[electrochemical cell]]s or [[internal combustion engine]]s to power vehicles or electric devices. It has begun to be used in commercial [[fuel cell vehicles]] such as passenger cars, and has been used in [[fuel cell bus]]es for many years. It is also used as a fuel for the propulsion of spacecraft.

[[Hydrogen]] is found in the first group and first period in the [[periodic table]], i.e. it is the first element on the periodic table, making it the lightest element. Since hydrogen gas is so light, it rises in the atmosphere and is therefore rarely found in its pure form, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Altork, L.N. &amp; Busby, J. R. (2010 Oct). Hydrogen fuel cells: part of the solution. Technology &amp; Engineering Teacher, 70(2), 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In a flame of pure hydrogen gas, burning in air, the hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reacts with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and releases energy.

:2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) + energy

If carried out in atmospheric air instead of pure oxygen, as is usually the case, hydrogen combustion may yield small amounts of [[nitrogen oxide]]s, along with the water vapor.

The energy released enables hydrogen to act as a fuel. In an electrochemical cell, that energy can be used with relatively high efficiency. If it  is used simply for heat, the usual [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)#Applicability to fuel cells and batteries|thermodynamics]] limits on the [[thermal efficiency]] apply.

Hydrogen is usually considered an energy carrier, like electricity, as it must be produced from a primary energy source such as solar energy, biomass, electricity (e.g. in the form of solar PV or via wind turbines), or hydrocarbons such as natural gas or coal.&lt;ref name="FSEC"&gt;Florida Solar Energy Center. (n.d.). Hydrogen Basics. Retrieved from: http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/hydrogen/basics/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional hydrogen production using natural gas induces significant environmental impacts; as with the use of any hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide is emitted.&lt;ref name="Zehner 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|pages=1–169, 331–42|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
{{Main|Hydrogen production}}
Because pure hydrogen does not occur naturally on Earth in large quantities, it usually requires a [[primary energy]] input to produce on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Feng|title=Thermodynamic analysis of high-temperature helium heated fuel reforming for hydrogen production|journal=[[International Journal of Energy Research]]|date=March 2015|volume=39|issue=3|pages=418–432|doi=10.1002/er.3263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common production methods include [[electrolysis]] and [[Steam reforming|steam-methane reforming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=J.C.|title=Energy-return-on-energy-invested for hydrogen fuel from the steam reforming of natural gas.|journal=Fuel|date=March 2015|volume=143|page=631|doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2014.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; In electrolysis, electricity is run through water to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This method can use wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, fossil fuels, biomass, nuclear, and many other energy sources.&lt;ref name="FSEC" /&gt; Obtaining hydrogen from this process is being studied as a viable way to produce it domestically at a low cost. Steam-methane reforming, the current leading technology for producing hydrogen in large quantities,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy. (2007 Feb). Potential for hydrogen production from key renewable resources in the United States. (Technical Report NREL/TP-640-41134). National Renewable Energy Laboratory Golden, CO: Milbrandt, A. &amp; Mann, M. Retrieved from: http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/41134.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; extracts hydrogen from [[methane]]. However, this reaction releases fossil [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]] into the atmosphere which are [[greenhouse gas]]es exogenous to the natural carbon cycle, and thus contribute to [[global warming]] which is rapidly heating the Earth's oceans and atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Energy==
Hydrogen is locked up in enormous quantities in water, hydrocarbons, and other organic matter. One of the challenges of using hydrogen as a fuel comes from being able to efficiently extract hydrogen from these compounds.  Currently, steam reforming, which combines high-temperature steam with natural gas, accounts for the majority of the hydrogen produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of hydrogen production occurs at temperatures between 700-1100°C, and has a resultant efficiency of between 60-75%.&lt;ref name="Steam reforming"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrogen Production Technologies: Current State and Future Developments|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cpis/2013/690627/|website=hindawi.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen can also be produced from water through electrolysis, which is less carbon intensive if the electricity used to drive the reaction does not come from fossil-fuel power plants but rather renewable or nuclear energy instead. The efficiency of water electrolysis is between about 70-80%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stolten|first1=Detlef|title=Hydrogen Science and Engineering: Materials, Processes, Systems and Technology|date=Jan 4, 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn= 9783527674299 |page=898|url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=we5bCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITM - Hydrogen Refuelling Infrastructure - February 2017|url=http://www.level-network.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ITM-Power.pdf|website=level-network.com|accessdate=17 April 2018|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a goal set to reach 82-86% efficiency by 2030 using proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost reduction and performance increase of PEM electrolysers|url=http://www.fch.europa.eu/sites/default/files/Nov22_Session3_Panel%205_Slot%202_NOVEL-MEGASTACK_Thomassen%20%28ID%202891376%29.pdf|website=fch.europa.eu|publisher=Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking|accessdate=17 April 2018|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once produced, hydrogen can be used in much the same way as natural gas - it can be delivered to fuel cells to generate electricity and heat, used in a combined cycle gas turbine to produce larger quantities of centrally produced electricity or burned to run a combustion engine; all methods producing no carbon or methane emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ono|first1=Katsutoshi|title=Fundamental Theories on a Combined Energy Cycle of an Electrostatic Induction Electrolytic Cell and Fuel Cell to Produce Fully Sustainable Hydrogen Energy.|journal=Electrical Engineering in Japan|date=January 2015|volume=190|issue=2|pages=1–9|doi=10.1002/eej.22673}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case hydrogen is combined with oxygen to form water. The heat in a hydrogen flame is a radiant emission from the newly formed water molecules. The water molecules are in an excited state on initial formation and then transition to a ground state; the transition releasing thermal radiation. When burning in air, the temperature is roughly 2000 °C (the same as natural gas). Historically, carbon has been the most practical carrier of energy, as hydrogen and carbon combined are more volumetrically dense, although hydrogen itself has three times the [[energy density]] per weight as methane or gasoline. Although hydrogen is the smallest element and thus has a slightly higher propensity to leak from venerable natural gas pipes such as those made from iron, leakage from plastic (polythylene PE100) pipes is expected to be very low at about 0.001%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Thoughts and Surprises|url=https://energy-surprises.blogspot.hu/2016/11/converting-gas-grid-to-hydrogen.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sadler|first1=Dan|title=“100% hydrogen unlocks everything”|url=https://medium.com/@cH2ange/dan-sadler-100-hydrogen-unlocks-everything-dd725ef6aa70|website=medium.com|publisher=cH2ange|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reason steam methane reforming has traditionally been favoured over electrolysis is because whereas methane reforming directly uses natural gas, electrolysis requires electricity. As the cost of producing electricity (via wind turbines and solar PV) falls below the cost of natural gas, electrolysis becomes cheaper than SMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philibert|first1=Cédric|title=Commentary: Producing industrial hydrogen from renewable energy|url=https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2017/april/producing-industrial-hydrogen-from-renewable-energy.html|website=www.iea.org/|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{Main|Hydrogen economy}}
Hydrogen fuel can provide [[motive power]] for [[liquid-propellant rocket]]s, cars, boats and airplanes, [[portable fuel cell applications]] or [[stationary fuel cell applications]], which can power an electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colella|first1=W.G.|title=Switching to a U.S. hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleet: The resultant change in emissions, energy use, and greenhouse gases.|journal=Journal of Power Sources|date=October 2005|volume=150|issue=1/2|pages=150–181|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.092|bibcode=2005JPS...150..150C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems of using hydrogen fuel in cars arise from the fact that hydrogen is [[Hydrogen_storage|difficult to store]] in either a high pressure tank or a cryogenic tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Zubrin |year=2007 |title=Energy Victory: Winning the War on Terror by Breaking Free of Oil |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |page=121 |isbn=978-1-59102-591-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal combustion engine conversions to hydrogen===

Combustion engines in commercial vehicles have been converted to run on a hydrogen-diesel mix in the UK, where up to 70% of emissions have been reduced during normal driving conditions. This eliminates range anxiety as the vehicles can fill up on diesel. Minor modifications are needed to the engines, as well as the addition of hydrogen tanks at a compression of 350 bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalagan|first1=Maria Theresa|title=ULEMCO developing hydrogen-fuelled vehicles|url=https://www.freightwaves.com/news/hydrogen-retrofit-system|website=freightwaves.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trials are now underway to test the efficiency of the 100% conversion of a Volvo FH16 heavy-duty truck to use only hydrogen. The range is expected to be 300km/17kg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK firm to demonstrate “world’s first” hydrogen-fuelled combustion engine truck|url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/hydrogen-fuelled-combustion-engine-truck/|website=theengineer.co.uk|publisher=Centaur Media plc|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; which means an efficiency better than a standard diesel engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mårtensson|first1=Lars|title=Emissions from Volvo’s trucks|url=http://www.volvotrucks.com/content/dam/volvo/volvo-trucks/markets/global/pdf/our-trucks/Emis_eng_10110_14001.pdf|website=volvotrucks.com|accessdate=22 April 2018|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where the [[embodied energy]] of [[Gasoline gallon equivalent|1 gallon of gasoline is equal to 1 kilogram of hydrogen]]). At a low cost price for hydrogen (€5/kg),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=André Løkke|first1=Jon|title=Wide Spread Adaption of Competitive Hydrogen Solution|url=http://nelhydrogen.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-02-FC-EXPO-Nel_FINAL.pdf|website=nelhydrogen.com/|publisher=Nel ASA|accessdate=22 April 2018|page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; significant fuel savings could be made via such a conversion in Europe or the UK. A lower price would be needed to compete with gasoline in the US, as gasoline is not exposed to high taxes at the pump. 

Fuel cell engines are two to three times more efficient than combustion engines, meaning that much greater fuel economy is available using hydrogen in a fuel cell.

The '''International Council on Clean Transportation''' (ICCT) is an independent [[nonprofit organization]] incorporated under [[Section 501(c)(3)]] of the US tax code. It provides technical and scientific analysis to environmental regulators. It is funded by the [[ClimateWorks Foundation]],  the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], the [[Energy Foundation]], and the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]].

== Volkswagen emissions scandal ==
The ICCT commissioned researchers at [[West Virginia University]] to test [[Volkswagen]] [[diesel engine|diesel]] car emissions in 2013. In May 2014, ICCT alerted the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] and the [[California Air Resources Board]] that the models displayed much higher levels of [[nitrogen oxide emissions]] than permitted by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eenews.net/assets/2015/09/21/document_cw_02.pdf|title=In-Use Emissions Testing of Light-Duty Diesel Vehicles in the United States|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/22/usa-volkswagen-researchers-idUSL1N11S20620150922|title=Interview: West Virginia engineer proves to be a David to VW's Goliath|date=September 2015|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the EPA said Volkswagen could be liable for up to $18 billion in penalties for using software on almost 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars sold between 2009 and 2015 that circumvented [[emissions regulations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/documents/vw-nov-caa-09-18-15.pdf|title=VW Notice of Violation, Clean Air Act (September 18, 2015)|author=Phillip A. Brooks|publisher=US [[Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 20, 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; unleashing [[Volkswagen emissions violations|a controversy]] that led to multiple regulatory probes worldwide.

In 2015 an [[ADAC]] study (ordered by ICCT) of 32 [[Euro6]] cars showed that few complied with on-road emission limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theicct.org/nox-control-technologies-euro-6-diesel-passenger-cars NOx control technologies for Euro 6 diesel passenger cars]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 ICCT measured 19 new cars and found that real emissions were 40% higher than they were approved with, primarily due to the lax methods of [[New European Driving Cycle|NEDC]]-testing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/ICCT_Coastdowns-EU_201605.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">This list covers optical '''lens designs''' grouped by tasks or overall type. The field of [[optical lens design]]ing has many variables including the function the lens or group of lenses have to perform, the limits of optical glass because of the [[index of refraction]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties, and design constraints including realistic lens element center and edge thicknesses, minimum and maximum air-spaces between lenses, maximum constraints on entrance and exit angles, and even cost. Some lenses listed are overall types with sub-designs (''as noted'').   

==Simple lens designs==
[[Simple lens]]es are lenses consisting of a single element. Lenses in this section may overlap with lens designs in other sections, for example the [[Wollaston landscape lens]] is a single element and also a camera lens design.

;Basic types

'''MOS (Magnetic Organization System)''' is an American brand of organizational tools that use [[magnetism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOS Magnetic Cable Organizer Magnetizes Your Cords and Holds Them Anywhere|url=http://lifehacker.com/5985366/mos-magnetic-cable-organizer-magnetizes-your-cords-and-holds-them-anywhere}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manage cables and other magnetic items. The brand was formed through [[crowdfunding]] on [[Kickstarter]] in August 2012.  MOS has launched every subsequent product through the Kickstarter platform since. In January 2014 MOS released Spring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Phone Will Break Before These Fortified Charging Cables Do|url=https://gizmodo.com/your-phone-will-break-before-these-fortified-charging-c-1580205077}}&lt;/ref&gt; a line of phone and audio cables, as well as a miniaturized version of the original Magnetic Organization System called MOS Menos. Later in June 2014 MOS started another Kickstarter campaign for the Reach project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOS Reach offers power solution|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2014/06/26/mos-reach-power-solution/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made its goal of $50,000 in the first day of the Kickstarter campaign. The Reach campaign was funded at 284 percent of the initial goal on July 26, 2014. MOS is a brand of Sewell Development Corp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5975">'''Medical technology assessment (MTA)''' is the objective evaluation of a [[medical technology]] regarding its safety and performance, its (future) impact on clinical and non-clinical patient outcomes as well as its interactive effects on economical, organizational, social, juridical and ethical aspects of healthcare. Medical technologies are assessed both in absolute terms and in comparison to other (combinations of) medical technologies, procedures, treatments or ‘doing-nothing’.

The aim of MTA is to provide objective, high-quality information that relevant stakeholders use for decision-making about for example development, pricing, market access and reimbursement of new medical technologies. As such, MTA is similar to [[health technology assessment]] (HTA), except that HTA has a wider scope and may include assessments of for example organizational or financial interventions.

The classical approach of MTA is to evaluate technologies after they enter the marketplace. Yet, a growing number of researchers and policy-makers argue that new technologies should be evaluated before they diffuse into routine clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo-Torres L, Steuten LM, Buxton MJ, Girling AJ, Lilford RJ, Young T. ''Integrating health economics modeling in the product development cycle of medical devices: a Bayesian approach.'' International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care. 2008 Fall;24(4):459–64.&lt;/ref&gt; MTA of biomedical innovations in a very early stage of development could improve health outcomes, minimise wrong investment and prevent social and ethical conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Pietzsch JB, Paté-Cornell ME. ''Early technology assessment of new medical devices.'' International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care, 24:1 (2008), 36–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular method within the area of early MTA is constructive technology assessment (CTA). CTA is particularly appropriate for the early assessment of dynamic technologies that are implemented under uncertain circumstances. CTA is based on the idea that during the course of technology development, choices are constantly being made about the form, the function, and the use of that technology. Especially in early stages, technologies are not always stable, nor are its specifications and neither is its use, as both technology and environment will mutually influence each other. In recent years, CTA has developed from assessing the (clinical) impact of a new technology to a much broader approach, including the analysis of design, development, and implementation of that new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Douma KF, Karsenberg K, Hummel MJ, Bueno-de-Mesquita, van Harten WH. ''Methodology of Constructive Technology Assessment in health care.'' International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care, 23:2 (2007), 162–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, the department [http://www.mb.utwente.nl/htsr/ Health Technology and Services Research] (HTSR) of the [[University of Twente]] and the [http://www.imta.nl/ institute for Medical Technology Assessment] (iMTA) of the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] perform early MTA and CTA in collaboration with technology users (patients, healthcare professionals), technology developers (academic and industrial), technology investors (venture capitalists, government, etc.) technology procurers (hospitals, patients, etc.) and decision-makers in healthcare (patients, policy-makers etc.) By performing excellent scientific research, that is valuable and relevant for society, HTSR and iMTA aim to support decisions about early development and implementation of health care technology in order to achieve high quality healthcare for individual patients. Examples of the research of HTSR include the early [[economic evaluation]] of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in the treatment of shoulder pain and early phase technology assessment of [[nanotechnology]] in oncology.&lt;ref&gt;Van Til JA, Renzenbrink GJ, Groothuis K, Ijzerman MJ. ''A preliminary economic evaluation of percutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation in the treatment of hemiplegic shoulder pain.'' Disability Rehabilitation, 30:28 (2006), 645–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Retèl VP, Hummel MJ, van Harten WH. ''Early phase Technology Assessment of nanotechnology in oncology.'' Tumori, 94:2 (2008), 284–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the work if iMTA include the development of the widely used cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs),&lt;ref&gt;Van Hout, Ben A., Maiwenn J.

'''Medium Atomic Demolition Munition''' ('''MADM''') was a [[tactical nuclear weapon]] developed by the [[United States]] during the [[Cold War]]. They were designed to be used as [[Atomic demolition munition|nuclear land mines]] and for other tactical purposes, with a relatively low [[nuclear weapon yield|explosive yield]] from a [[W45]] warhead, between 1 and 15 [[kiloton]]s. Each MADM weighed less than 400&amp;nbsp;lb (181&amp;nbsp;kg) total.

The '''Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer''' ('''MODIS''') is a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] [[imaging sensor]] built by Santa Barbara Remote Sensing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/components.php|title=MODIS Components|accessdate= 11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was launched into [[Earth orbit]] by [[NASA]] in 1999 on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] ([[Earth Observing System|EOS]] AM) Satellite, and in 2002 on board the [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] (EOS PM) satellite. The instruments capture data in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 [[µm]] to 14.4&amp;nbsp;µm and at varying spatial resolutions (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1&amp;nbsp;km). Together the instruments image the entire Earth every 1 to 2 days. They are designed to provide measurements in large-scale global dynamics including changes in Earth's [[cloud cover]], [[radiation budget]] and processes occurring in the oceans, on land, and in the [[Atmosphere of Earth#Structure of the atmosphere|lower atmosphere]]. MODIS utilizes four on-board calibrators in addition to the space view in order to provide in-flight calibration: solar diffuser (SD), solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM), spectral radiometric calibration assembly (SRCA), and a v-groove [[black body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/design.php|title=MODIS Design|accessdate= 11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MODIS has used the [[Marine Optical Buoy#Contribution|marine optical buoy]] for vicarious calibration. MODIS is succeeded by the [[VIIRS]] instrument on board the [[Suomi NPP]] satellite launched in 2011 and future [[Joint Polar Satellite System]] (JPSS) satellites.

The MODIS characterization support team (MCST) is dedicated to the production of high-quality MODIS calibrated product which is a precursor to every geophysical science product. A detailed description of the MCST mission statement and other details can be found at MCST Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title=MODIS Characterization Support Team|accessdate= 18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
With its low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution, MODIS data is useful to track changes in the landscape over time. Examples of such applications are the monitoring of vegetation health by means of time-series analyses with vegetation indices,&lt;ref&gt;LU, L., KUENZER, C., WANG, C., GUO, H., Li, Q., 2015: Evaluation of three MODIS-derived Vegetation Index Time Series for Dry land Vegetation Dynamics Monitoring.

The Museum of Municipal Engineering in Kraków or the '''Muzeum Inżynierii Miejskiej w Krakowie''' is a municipal museum in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]]; located at  ul. św. Wawrzyńca 15 street in the centre of historical [[Kazimierz]] district. It was established in 1998 by the city, for the purpose of documenting and popularizing the history of the city engineering, transport as well as technological progress. It consists of several buildings housing early trams, buses and motorcycles, radios, industrial machinery and early means of production, as well as many educational aids and displays. The museum is very popular with school children, but also with adults.&lt;ref name="mimk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mimk.com.pl/ | title=Działalność muzeum | publisher=Muzeum Inżynierii Miejskiej w Krakowie, official website | accessdate=December 23, 2012 | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NFPA 72''' (''National [[Fire Alarm]] Code'') is a standard published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]].

== Purpose ==
The '''NFPA 72''' specifies "the application, installation, location, performance, inspection, testing, and maintenance of [[fire alarm system]]s, fire warning equipment, and emergency warning equipment, and their components." [§ 1.1.1].  Federal, state, and local [[municipality|municipalities]] across the United States have adopted the NFPA 72 as a standard in the [[law enforcement|enforcement]] of [[fire code]] regulation. Municipalities often adopt revisions of the code after years of review and amendments, making many local fire codes specific to their governing authorities.

== Structure ==
The '''NFPA 72 2007 edition''' is sectioned as follows:
* 1. Administration
* 2. Referenced Publications
* 3. Definitions
* 4. Fundamentals of Fire Alarm Systems
* 5. Initiating Devices
* 6. Protected Premises Fire Alarm Systems

The '''National Internet Exchange of India''' ('''NIXI''') is a [[governmental organization|government]] [[non-profit]] company established in 2003 to provide neutral [[Internet Exchange Point]] services in [[India]]. It was established under section 8 of the [[Companies Act 2013]], with the [[Internet Service Providers Association of India]] (ISPAI) to become the operational meeting point of [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) in India.

'''Parchment paper''' and '''bakery release paper''' are [[cellulose]]-based [[paper]]s that are used  in [[baking]] as a disposable non-stick surface. Both are also called '''bakery paper''' or '''baking paper'''. They should not be confused with [[waxed paper]], also known as wax paper or rarely as butter paper.

==Parchment paper==
[[File:Chocolate chip cookies on parchment paper, August 2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chocolate chip cookies]] on baking parchment paper]]
Modern parchment paper is made by running sheets of [[Pulp (paper)|paper pulp]] through a bath of [[sulfuric acid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ferdinand F|last=Mayer|journal=[[American Journal of Science|The American Journal of Science and Arts]]|volume=XXIX|issue=LXXXVI|date=May 1860|title=Technical Intelligence&amp;mdash;Vegetable Parchment&amp;mdash;Papyrene|page=278|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KsEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a method similar to how [[tracing paper]] is made) or sometimes [[zinc chloride]]. This process partially dissolves or gelatinizes the paper. This treatment forms a sulfurized [[cross-linked]] material with high density, stability, and heat resistance, and low [[surface energy]]—thereby imparting good non-stick or release properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Silicone Coated Baking Sheets {{!}} Sierra Coating|url = http://www.sierracoating.com/silicone-coated-baking-sheets|website = Sierra Coating|access-date = 2016-02-19|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treated paper has an appearance similar to that of traditional [[parchment]], and because of its stability is sometimes used for legal purposes where traditional parchment was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.asn.au/Bookshop/Legal-Forms/A-Z-List/1-2-%28Pack-of-50%29-135-GSM-Blank-Parchment-Paper Blank Parchment Paper 135 GSM (Pack of 50)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410130536/http://www.liv.asn.au/Bookshop/Legal-Forms/A-Z-List/1-2-(Pack-of-50)-135-GSM-Blank-Parchment-Paper|archivedate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bakery release paper==
The stickless properties can be also achieved by employing a [[coated paper]], for which a suitable [[release agent]]—a coating with a low surface energy and capability to withstand the temperatures involved in the [[baking]] or [[roasting]] process—is deposited onto the paper's surface; [[silicone]] (cured with a suitable [[catalyst]]) is frequently used.

==Applications==
A common use is to eliminate the need to grease [[sheet pan]]s and the like, allowing very rapid turn-around of batches of baked goods. Parchment paper is also used to cook ''[[en papillote]]'', a technique where food is [[steaming|steamed]] or cooked within closed pouches made from parchment paper.

Bakery paper can be used in most applications that call for [[wax paper]] as a non-stick surface. The reverse is not true, as using wax paper will cause smoke in the oven and affect taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parchment Paper vs. Wax Paper|url = http://www.marthastewart.com/269281/parchment-vs-wax-paper|website = Martha Stewart|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pristine''' is a [[Venture capital|VC]] funded [[Startup company|startup]] that develops software for hands-free [[smartglasses]] and smart mobile devices, enabling video collaboration and remote support in industrial and manufacturing environments, [[field service management]] and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strickland |first=Eliza |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/start-ups/startup-profile-pristine-is-bringing-google-glass-to-the-hospital |title=Start-up Profile: Pristine Is Bringing Google Glass to the Hospital - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2014-08-19 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pristine is based in [[Austin, Texas]].

==History==
Pristine was founded by Kyle Samani and Patrick Kolencherry May 2013, shortly after Google announced the [[Google Glass]] program. It raised initial funding through angel investors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/techflash/2014/09/microventures-marketplace-reaches-50m-milestone.html |title=MicroVentures Marketplace reaches $50M milestone - Austin Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2014-09-17 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began piloting in a major academic medical center. In the months following, Pristine raised over $5 million in venture capital investment from S3 Ventures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/29/pristine-grabs-5-4m-to-cure-the-doctor-shortage-and-save-lives-with-google-glass/ |title=Pristine grabs $5.4M to cure the doctor shortage and save lives with Google Glass &amp;#124; VentureBeat &amp;#124; Health &amp;#124; by Tom Cheredar |publisher=VentureBeat.com |date=2014-09-29 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://hitconsultant.net/2014/09/29/pristine-nabs-5-5m-to-expand-telehealth-through-google-glass/ |title=Pristine Nabs $5.4M To Expand Telehealth Through Google Glass |publisher=Hitconsultant.net |date=2014-09-29 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capital Factory, Healthfundr, and others.

Pristine took second place at HATCH Pitch 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatchpitch.com/news/2013/hatchou/techstreet-2013-winners |title=HATCH pitch at TechStreet Winners Announced — HATCH pitch |publisher=Hatchpitch.com |date=2014-03-10 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a start up pitch competition that was held at the [[George R. Brown Convention Center]]. At the 2013 DEMO conference, Pristine CEO Kyle Samani demonstrated on stage how an emergency room surgeon would use Google Glass to request support from another physician.

[[University of California, Irvine]] participated in a smartglasses pilot in October 2013, and announced in February the following year that they would roll out the technology to outpatient programs and [[Wound, ostomy, and continence nursing|wound care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephanie M.

The '''Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda''' ({{lang-de|Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda}}, RMVP or ''Propagandaministerium'') was a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] government agency to enforce [[Nazi]] ideology.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=121}}
==Origin==
Founded on 14 March 1933, a few months after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s government, it was headed by Reich Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=121}} The role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century [[Ordenspalais]] across from the [[Reich Chancellery]], was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=212–213}} An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the [[Nazi Party]] had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=121}} [[Censorship in Germany]] was vital to the Nazi's retention of political control. It was responsible for controlling the German [[news media]], [[literature]], [[visual arts]], [[filmmaking]], [[theatre]], [[music]], and [[broadcasting]].

==Propaganda==
As the central office of [[Nazi propaganda]], it comprehensively supervised and regulated the culture and [[mass media]] of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=140–141}} A major focus of the propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a [[cult of personality]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=292–293}} Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels' propaganda work.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=122–123}} An example of the latter would be the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally]]. Hitler was the focus and his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 [[Venice Film Festival]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=123–127}} Goebbels and his ministry were involved in both the rally and the film production.

==Organization==
The ministry was organized into seven departments.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=140–141}}
# Division I: Administration and legal
# Division II: Mass rallies; public health; youth; race
# Division III: [[Broadcasting]]
# Division IV: National and foreign press
# Division V: [[Films]] and [[film censorship]]
# Division VI: Art, music, and theatre
# Division VII: Protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic

In 2016 the company was labelled the [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] of FinTech and successfully launched this revised model to eliminate insurance companies in the insurance value by directly connecting brokers and consumers with risk capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/357/142762.html |title=The Uber of finance |website=Bizcommunity.com |date=2016-04-01 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also labelled the "Uber of Insurance", Riovic pioneered "private investor backed insurance" where a private investor (or group of private investors) essentially steps into the financial shoes of the insurer, accepting a stream of certain cash flows in exchange for an uncertain future liability.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Riovic has a collaboration with New Zealand's PeerCover and was admitted into South African [[Rand Merchant Investment Holdings|Rand Merchant Investment Holdings' (RMIH)]] incubator for next generation financial services companies (similar to Level39), which provides the company with working space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/22/startup-of-the-year-2015-2016-competition-entry-riovic |title=Startup of the Year 2015-2016 competition entry: Nkambule Ltd &amp;#124; Guardian Small Business Network |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2016-02-22 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of Facebook's FBStart accelerator programme.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Pension Mistakes by Expats in Dubai|url=http://holbornassets.com/holborn-assets-reviews-10-pension-mistakes-by-expats-in-dubai/|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23699">'''STANAG 3910''' ''High Speed Data Transmission Under [[MIL-STD-1553|STANAG 3838]] or Fibre Optic Equivalent Control''&lt;ref name = "STANAG 3910 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; is a protocol defined in a [[NATO]] [[Standardization Agreement]] for the transfer of data, principally intended for use in [[avionics|avionic systems]]. STANAG 3910 allows a 1&amp;nbsp;Mb/s STANAG 3838&lt;ref name = "3838 1997"/&gt; / MIL-STD-1553B / MoD Def Stan 00-18 Pt 2 (3838/1553B) data bus to be augmented with a 20&amp;nbsp;Mb/s high-speed (HS) bus, which is referred to in the standard as the HS channel: the 3838/1553B bus in an implementation of STANAG 3910 is then referred to as the low-speed (LS) channel. Either or both channels may be multiply [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]], and may use either electrical or optical media. Where the channels use redundant media, these are individually referred to as buses by the standard.&lt;ref name = "STANAG 3910 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt;

== Historique ==
The original STANAG 3910, i.e. the [[NATO]] standard, reached, at least, draft version 1.8,&lt;ref name = "STANAG 3910 1993"/&gt; before work on it was abandoned in the early 1990s in favour of its publication through non-military standardization organizations: the foreword to Rev. 1.7 of the STANAG from March 1990 stated "The main body of this document is identical to the proposed Rev 1.7 of prEN 3910".&lt;ref name = "STANAG 3910 1990"/&gt; Following this, several provisional, green-paper versions, prEN 3910 P1 &amp; P2, were produced by working-group C2-GT9 of the ''Association Europeene des Constructeurs de Materiel Aerospatial'' (AECMA) (now ASD-STAN),&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; before its development also ceased in 1996-7 (following the withdrawal of the French delegation, who held the [[Chairman|chair]] of AECMA C2-GT9 at the time). As a result, the standard remains (as of Aug. 2013) in green paper form: the latest draft version is prEN3910-001 Issue P1, the front sheet of which states, 'This "Aerospace Series" Prestandard has been drawn up under the responsibility of AECMA (The European Association of Aerospace Industries). It is published on green paper for the needs of AECMA-Members.'&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; However, despite this disclaimer, the document is offered for sale by ASD-STAN, currently (August 2013) at €382.64.&lt;ref name = "ASD3910 catalogue"/&gt;

== Utilisation ==

The incomplete nature of the standardization process (as of Aug. 2013) has not prevented at least two versions of STANAG 3910 being implemented: one for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]&lt;ref name = "Konig 1994"/&gt; and one for the [[Dassault Rafale]]. The Eurofighter version, known as EFABus, is standardized by an internal Eurofighter document (SP-J-402-E-1039).&lt;ref name = "Tilly 1994"/&gt; The standardization documentation for the Dassault version is unknown.

The EFABus version of STANAG 3910 is known to use an electrical low speed (3838/1553B) control channel and a fibre optic HS channel.&lt;ref name = "Konig 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tilly 1994"/&gt; The version specified for the [[Dassault Rafale]] uses electrical media for both channels.

There are a number of manufacturers of avionic equipment that supply both flight and ground (e.g. test) equipment to this protocol standard.

== Media ==
The (draft) standard contains annexes, known as slash-sheets, that specify a number of different media types for the high-speed and low-speed channels, implementations identifying a specific slash-sheet with the relevant specifications.&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt;

===Optical===
Versions of STANAG 3910 using optical media for the HS channel component require an additional [[passive component]], in the form of an optical [[star coupler]] either reflective or transmissive, to interconnect the remote terminals. This limits the number of remote terminals that may be connected to the HS media, through the effect of the optical star on the optical power (determined by the number of "ways" of the star).&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; Therefore, it may not be possible for all the (up to) 31 RTs (and 1 BC) that may be connected to the LS channel to have HS channel connections.

The optical media types include 200 and 100&amp;nbsp;μm [[diameter]] core (280, 240, or 140 μm [[Cladding (fiber optics)|clading]]) [[Step-index profile]] ([[Depressed-cladding fiber|depressed cladding]]) optical fibre.&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; These are much larger-core fibres than are commonly used in short-haul commercial applications, which are more normally 50/125 or 62.5/125&amp;nbsp;μm. This is, in part at least, to reduce the problems associated with [[contamination]] of the optical connectors – a given size of particle between the end faces of the fibre in a connector or misalignment of such a connector has significantly less effect on the larger fibre – which is seen as a significant issue in avionic applications, especially where contaminating environments, high [[vibration]], and wide [[temperature]] ranges can apply.

The major difference between the transmissive and reflective star coupled fibre networks is that two fibres are needed with the transmissive star coupler to connect a line replaceable item (LRI), but with the reflective star, and a [[Optical Y coupler|"Y" coupler]] internal to the LRI, only a single fibre is required: a "Y" coupler, is a three-port optical device that connects the [[simplex]] transmitter and simplex receiver to a single fibre that carries the optical signals transmitted and received by the LRI in opposite directions ([[half duplex]]). However, while the use of the reflective star reduces the cabling in the aircraft, and thus weight, the excess losses involved in the use of the "Y" couplers and reflective star coupler makes meeting the power budget requirements, given a transmitter power and receiver sensitivity, more difficult.
Whilst it is explicitly stated that the LS buses may be a fibre optic equivalent to STANAG 3838, e.g. MIL-STD-1773, there are no known implementations of this approach.

===Electrical===
Versions using an electrical HS channel require an additional active component, in the form of a "central repeater", with multi-tap collector and distributor lines (which use [[Power dividers and directional couplers|directional couplers]] to connect to the LRIs) and a buffer memory, to allow for small differences in data rates.

The standard and the electrical media slash sheet it contains specify a 100-ohm characteristic impedance cable for both collector and distributor lines. A maximum cable length is not given for either, and neither are limits on the numbers of directional couplers and thus RTs. However, the losses in the directional couplers, etc., especially for the RT furthest from the central repeater, and the limitations on dynamic range between the furthest (and most attenuated) and nearest (and least attenuated) RT, will limit the number of RTs operating to the standard that may be connected to the HS media.

== System architectures ==
Since STANAG 3910 uses a 3838/1553B LS channel for control, the logical architectures that are supported are very similar to those described for [[MIL-STD-1553|3838/1553B]]. Essentially, there is a bus controller (BC) and up to 31 individually addressed (0-30) remote terminals (RTs) connected to the bus. The BC then commands the RTs to receive or transmit the data, either as RT to RT, RT to BC, BC to RT, RT to RTs (broadcast), or BC to RTs (broadcast) transfers.

With electrical media HS buses, the physical architecture is like that with 3838/1553B, save that the central repeater has to be at one end of each of the collector and distributor lines: the RT's connections to these lines work preferentially in one physical direction along the bus - hence directional couplers.

The use of optical media for the HS buses, e.g. in EFABus, has a significant effect on the physical architectures: it is not practical to implement linier T coupled bus architectures, where the bus is run around the platform (e.g. the aircraft), and each line replaceable item (LRI) connects, though a stub, at the nearest convenient point in its path. Rather, each LRI has an optical physical media connection to a common star coupler, which passively connects it to all the other LRIs connected to the same star. In the case of a reflective star, the bus connection from the RT will be a single fibre cable, over which the RT both transmits and receives ([[half duplex]]). With a transmissive star, each RT is connected through two fibres, one for it to transmit and one for it to receive data over.

== Transfer sequence ==

Transfers over the HS channel are initiated via the 3838/1553B LS channel, in an analogous way to the setup of 3838/1553B data transfers. 3838/1553B BC-RT transfers are sent to a specific subaddress of the receiving and transmitting RTs by the STANAG 3910 bus controller (BC). Despite this being a subaddress on the LS side of the RT, and thus exactly the same as any other 3838/1553B RT's subaddress, this subaddress is known as the "HS subaddress". The 3838/1553B BC-RT transfers each carry a single data word, known as an HS action word. Each HS action word identifies the HS message to be transmitted or received, analogous to the command words used to initiate 3838/1553B RT transfers. As with 3838/1553B transfers, there can be HS transfers from BC to RT, RT to BC, RT to RT, BC to RTs (broadcast) and RT to RTs (broadcast).

According to the standard, the HS actions words comprise the following:
::A single-bit HS A/B field, which indicates on which bus of a dual redundant HS channel the message is to be transmitted and received.
::A single-bit HS T/R field, which indicates whether the HS action word is commanding the RT to transmit or receive.
::A 7-bit HS message identify/HS mode field. This either indicates that the HS action word is a mode control (value = 0000000) or identifies the subaddress of the HS RT's (which is a different entity from the HS subaddress to which the HS action word is sent) from which the message is to be sent or at which it is to be received, depending on the value of the HS T/R field.
::A 7-bit HS block count (BLC) or HS mode code field, which "shall be the quantity of Data Blocks to be either sent out or received by the RT on the HS Channel or the HS Mode Code". The standard goes on to say "The message shall consist of 32 Data Words per Data Block and a maximum of 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Data Blocks may be transmitted or received".

As a 3838/1553B data word, the HS action word is preceded by the 3 bit-time data word sync field and followed by the single bit parity bit. As part of a 3838/1553B BC-RT transfer, it is preceded by a 3838/1553B command word, and should normally, i.e. if not broadcast, invalid, or illegal, elicit a 3838/1553B status word from the receiving RT.

In the case of an RT to RT HS transfer, the BC sends an HS action word to the receiving HS RT, instructing it to receive the HS message with a specified block count value at the specified subaddress. The receiving RT will then reply on the LS channel with an LS status word indicating it received the HS action word. The BC will then, after an intermessage gap on the LS channel, send another HS action word to the transmitting HS RT, instructing it to transmit the message, normally with the same block count value, and from one of its subaddresses. The transmitting RT will then reply on the LS channel with an LS status word indicating it received the HS action word and completing the HS control format. The HS RT transmitting an HS message will then begin its transmission within a maximum time measured from the parity (last) bit of the transmit HS action word. This initialization time is specified in the slash sheets, though all those in the current, draft standard are 24 to 32 µS. If the receiving HS RT does not receive the start of the HS message within a specified (in the slash sheet) time, which should be sufficient for the duration of the HS control format and the initialization time of the transmitter, it is required to timeout.

According to the standard, HS messages comprise the following:&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt;
::A preamble which is equivalent to a sequence of binary ones encoded with a method equivalent to [[Manchester code|Manchester II bi-phase]] encoding, and which "is primarily used by the receiving HS MIU [RT interface] to acquire signal level and synchronization by using a known pattern." This is needed because, as a shared media protocol, these signal levels and data transmission rates will vary slightly between transmitters. The number of bits in the preamble can be specific to the implementation, i.e. is selected by a system's designers.
::A start delimiter (SD) which is 4 bit times long, but is formatted as a specific pattern that is an illegal Manchester II bi-phase signal, so that it may always be distinguished from the data.
::A frame control (FC) field in 8 bits carrying a fixed value. This field exists for compatibility with other protocols using similar protocol data units (PDUs).
::A physical address (PA) field in 8 bits carrying the RT address of the STANAG 3838 source RT.
::A destination address (DA) in 16 bits, which may be subdivided into an RT address in 7 bits and subaddress in 8 bits or may contain a 15-bit logical address.
::A word count (WC) in 16 bits that is required to contain the actual length of the information payload field (see below) of the message in words.
::A frame information payload (info) field that may contain up to 4096 words, each of 16-bits. This info field is organized into blocks of 32 words, and the HS action word, rather than indicating the length of the message to be received or transmitted in words, specifies the number of blocks.
::A [[frame check sequence]] (FCS) word, which "provides a check for errors in the message" and covers "the FC, PA, DA, WC, INFO, and the FCS fields."
:::The FC , PA, DA, WC, INFO, and the FCS fields are all required to be formatted as valid Manchester II bi-phase signals.
:::There are no explicit delimiters or separators between the fields of the PDU or the blocks or words in the info field, and all are required to be transmitted contiguously.
::An end delimiter (ED) field, which is 4 bit times long and, like the SD field, is an illegal Manchester II bi-phase signal that may always be distinguished from the data.

While the WC fields [sic] are required to contain the actual lengths of the following info fields in words, if the receiving RT implements a feature called "word count checking", then the length of the info field may be less than 32 times the block count value in the HS action word by up to 31 words. In effect, the last block of an HS message may vary in length from 1 to 32 words. If the receiving terminal does not implement word count checking then the length of the info field shall be the block count multiplied by 32. The standard does not indicate how the transmitting terminal is meant to know whether the receiving RT implements this feature or not; hence it may be assumed to be part of the system's design.

There are also, analogous to the 3838/1553B status words, HS status words. These are also 3838/1553B data words sent over the LS channel, from the HS subaddress to which the HS action words are sent. The status words are therefore, unlike with 3838/1553B statuses, not transmitted automatically by the RTs, and require the STANAG 3910 BC to cause their transmission over the LS channel from the same HS subaddress the action words are sent to.&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt;

The HS subaddress, to which the HS action words are sent, and from which HS status words and HS ???? words are transmitted, is not specified by the standard, other than it "shall not be equal to 00000 or 11111 [binary] and shall not be used for any other function".&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; It may then, be selected for the specific implementation, i.e. a value that is not otherwise in use.

It also is possible to have "normal" 3838/1553B transfers that take place over the LS channel alone, and which may use any of the other 3910/1553B subaddresses. These transfers may happen in parallel with the HS channel transfers or be in between them. It is, however, common practice not to use the LS channel other than for control of the HS, and for LS mode commands, etc., e.g. during BC handover.

The duration of an HS control format initiating an HS RT to HS RT transfer over the HS channel comprises a pair of 3838/1553B BC-RT transfers, including command words, data words (the HS action words themselves), LS status responses, LS RT response times, and an inter message gap (which is limited by, but is not necessarily the same as the 3838/1553B specified minimum intermessage gap of 4&amp;nbsp;μs). As a consequence, the duration of such a HS control format can be relatively long in comparison to the duration of the HS transfer that follows. This overhead is then compounded where the BC initiates an RT to BC transfer on the LS channel to, e.g., obtain the HS status word from the receiver. It is technically possible to begin the setup of the next HS transfer while the previous one is in progress, and thus achieve the minimum permitted HS interframe gap of 4&amp;nbsp;μs.&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; However, it is common practice to wait for one HS transfer to end before beginning the LS channel transfers to set up the next, as predicting the timing of the end of a transmission is complicated by the possible variations in transmitter bit rates.&lt;ref name = "prEN 3910 1996"/&gt; Thus, while the theoretical throughput approaches 21 (20 + 1) Mbps, the actual throughput will be significantly less than 20&amp;nbsp;Mbps.

==Developments==
There is also an extended version of EFABus, known as EFABus Express (EfEx). This was designed for tranche 2 of the Eurofighter Typhoon to reduce the time needed to set up the HS transfers by allowing them to be set up over the HS channel. This version is fully compatible with MIL-STD-1553 / STANAG 3838 and the mixed EFABus (STANAG 3910).

Since the setup of HS transactions over an EfEx channel occurs between the HS transfers themselves, like the implementations of STANAG 3910 that wait for the preceding HS transfer to complete before initiating the next, the maximum bandwidth is necessarily less than 20 Mbps; though it is higher than that of this type of STANAG 3910 channel, because the HS control formats on the HS channel require less time than those on the LS channel. However, where a STANAG 3910 channel implementation performs the setup of an HS transfer in parallel with the preceding one, an implementation of STANAG 3910 could provide a very slightly higher throughput than an EfEX implementation, even allowing for the longest possible transmission of the HS message at the lowest possible data transmission rate. Also, assuming that the RTs met the requirements of the standard for a minimum 4&amp;nbsp;μs interframe gap time, this should have meant modifying only the BC to predict the end times of the HS messages, and initiate the HS control just before this; rather than modifying both the BC and multiple RTs to send and receive HS control formats on the HS channel.

==Competing protocols==
Another proposed development of MIL-STD-1553 is known as MIL-STD-1553E or E-1553.&lt;ref name = "E-1553"/&gt; This uses technologies similar to those used in [[ADSL]] to transmit very much higher bandwidths, in multiple channels, over the same media as the existing data bus, but in such a way that they do not interfere with the operation of the normal 1553B data transfers or RTs that should not be involved in them. MIL-STD-1553E is, therefore, an attractive option for upgrading existing aircraft, etc., that use 1553B, because it should not involve any modification to the wiring or any RTs that are not required to take part in these high-speed transfers.

However, whilst there has been some research into its use, there do not appear to be any existing or impending implementations of it on production aircraft, either as new build or upgrades. This may be related to the susceptibility of these additional high-speed transmissions to the specific routeing of the 1553 bus cables, and the exact placement of the couplers, BC, and RTs on different aircraft of a fleet, which may make it difficult to specify, in advance of an upgrade, precisely what additional capacity might be provided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25298">Social computing is an area of [[computer science]] that is concerned with the intersection of [[social behavior]] and computational systems. It is based on creating or recreating social conventions and social contexts through the use of software and technology. Thus, [[blogs]], [[email]], [[instant messaging]], [[social network services]], [[wikis]], [[social bookmarking]] and other instances of what is often called social software illustrate ideas from social computing.   

== History ==
Social computing begins with the observation that humans&amp;mdash;and human behavior&amp;mdash;are profoundly social. From birth, humans orient to one another, and as they grow, they develop abilities for interacting with each other. This ranges from expression and gesture to spoken and written language. As a consequence, people are remarkably sensitive to the behavior of those around them and make countless decisions that are shaped by their social context. Whether it's wrapping up a talk when the audience starts fidgeting, choosing the crowded restaurant over the nearly deserted one, or crossing the street against the light because everyone else is doing so, social information provides a basis for inferences, planning, and coordinating activity.

The premise of social computing is that it is possible to design digital systems that support useful functionality by making socially produced information available to their users. This information may be provided directly, as when systems show the number of users who have rated a review as helpful or not. Or the information may be provided after being filtered and aggregated, as is done when systems recommend a product based on what else people with similar purchase history have purchased. Alternatively, the information may be provided indirectly, as is the case with Google's page rank algorithms which orders search results based on the number of pages that (recursively) point to them. In all of these cases, information that is produced by a group of people is used to provide or enhance the functioning of a system. Social computing is concerned with systems of this sort and the mechanisms and principles that underlie them.

Social computing can be defined as follows:

    &lt;blockquote&gt;"Social Computing" refers to systems that support the gathering, representation, processing, use, and dissemination of information that is distributed across social collectivities such as teams, communities, organizations, and markets. Moreover, the information is not "anonymous" but is significantly precise because it is linked to people, who are in turn linked to other people.&lt;ref name=Schuler&gt;From "Social Computing", introduction to Social Computing special edition of the Communications of the ACM, edited by Douglas Schuler, Volume 37, Issue 1 (January 1994), Pages: 28 - 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recent definitions, however, have foregone the restrictions regarding anonymity of information, acknowledging the continued spread and increasing pervasiveness of social computing. As an example, Hemmatazad, N. (2014) defined social computing as "the use of computational devices to facilitate or augment the social interactions of their users, or to evaluate those interactions in an effort to obtain new information."&lt;ref name="IGI Global"&gt;From ''Social Computing'' in Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Third Edition. IGI Global, 2014, p. 6754.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] may be the earliest example of social computing in a live production environment with initially hundreds and soon thousands of users, on the PLATO computer system based in the [[University of Illinois]] at Urbana Champaign in 1973, when social software applications for multi-user [[chat rooms]], group message [[Internet forum|forum]]s, and [[instant messaging]] appeared all within that year. In 1974, [[email]] was made available as well as the world's first online newspaper called NewsReport, which supported content submitted by the user community as well as written by editors and reporters.

Social computing has to do with supporting "computations" that are carried out by groups of people, an idea that has been popularized in [[James Surowiecki|James Surowiecki's]] book, [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Examples of social computing in this sense include [[collaborative filtering]], [[online auctions]], [[prediction markets]], [[reputation systems]], computational social choice, tagging, and verification games. The [[social information processing]] page focuses on this sense of social computing.

== Background ==

===Technology infrastructure===

The idea to engage users using websites to interact was first brought forth by Web 2.0 and was an advancement from Web 1.0 where according to Cormode, G. and Krishnamurthy, B. (2008): "content creators were few in Web 1.0 with the vast majority of users simply acting as consumers of content."&lt;ref name="IGI Global"/&gt;

Web 2.0 provided functionalities that allowed for low cost web-hosting services and introduced features with browser windows that used basic information structure and expanded it to as many devices as possible using HTTP.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt;

By 2006, Of particular interest in the realm of social computing is social software for enterprise. Sometimes referred to as "Enterprise 2.0",&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; a term derived from Web 2.0, this generally refers to the use of social computing in corporate intranets and in other medium- and large-scale business environments. It consisted of a class of tools that allowed for networking and social changes to businesses at the time. It was a layering of the business tools on Web 2.0 and brought forth several applications and collaborative software with specific uses.

'''Finance'''&lt;blockquote&gt;Electronic negotiation, which first came up in 1969 and was adapted over time to suit financial markets networking needs, represents an important and desirable coordination mechanism for electronic markets. Negotiation between agents (software agents as well as humans) allows cooperative and competitive sharing of information to determine a proper price. Recent research and practice has also shown that electronic negotiation is beneficial for the coordination of complex interactions among organizations. Electronic negotiation has recently emerged as a very dynamic, interdisciplinary research area covering aspects from disciplines such as Economics, Information Systems, Computer Science, Communication Theory, Sociology and Psychology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Social computing has become more widely known because of its relationship to a number of recent trends. These include the growing popularity of social software and Web 3.0, increased academic interest in social network analysis, the rise of open source as a viable method of production, and a growing conviction that all of this can have a profound impact on daily life. A February 13, 2006 paper by market research company Forrester Research suggested that:

|Easy connections brought about by cheap devices, modular content, and shared computing resources are having a profound impact on our global economy and social structure. Individuals increasingly take cues from one another rather than from institutional sources like corporations, media outlets, religions, and political bodies. To thrive in an era of Social Computing, companies must abandon top-down management and communication tactics, weave communities into their products and services, use employees and partners as marketers, and become part of a living fabric of brand loyalists.&lt;ref name=Schuler/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;A term coined by Andrew McAfee of [[Harvard Business School]] in the Spring 2006 [[MIT Sloan Management Review]].  &lt;br&gt;  {{cite journal | last1 = McAfee | first1 = Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration | url = | journal = MIT Sloan Management Review | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 21–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical Foundations ==
Socially intelligent computing is a new term that refers to the recent efforts of individuals to understand the ways in which systems of people and computers will prove useful as intermediaries between people and tools used by people. These systems result in new behaviors that occur as a result of the complex interaction between humans and computers and can be explained by several different areas of science. The Foundations of Social Computing are deeply vested in the understanding of [[social psychology]] and [[cyberpsychology]]. [[Social psychology]] covers topics such as [[decision making]], [[persuasion]], [[group behavior]], [[attraction (emotion)|personal attraction]], and factors that promote health and well-being.&lt;ref name=Ip/&gt; [[Cognitive sciences]] also play a huge role in understanding Social computing and human behavior on networking elements driven by personal needs/means. [[Sociology]] is also a factor since overall environments decide how individuals choose to interact.&lt;ref name=Marlow/&gt;

There are multiple areas of social computing that have been able to expand the threshold of knowledge in this discipline.  Each area has been able to have a focus and goal behind it that provides us with a deeper understanding of the social behavior between users that interact using some variation of social computing.

== Social Software ==
Social software can be any computational system that supports social interactions among groups of people. The following are examples of such systems.

=== Social media ===
[[Social media]] has become an outlet that is one of the most widely used ways of interacting through computers. Though there are many different platforms that can be used for social media, they all serve the same primary purpose of creating a social interaction through computers, mobile devices, etc.  Social media has evolved into not just an interaction through text, but through pictures, videos, [[GIF]]s, and many other forms of [[multimedia]].  This has provided users an enhanced way to interact with other users while being able to more widely express and share during computational interaction.  Within the last couple decades, social media has blown up and created many famous applications within the social computing arena.

=== Social networking ===
Through social networking, people are able to use platforms to build or enhance social networks/relations among people.  These are people who commonly share similar backgrounds, interests, or participate in the same activities.  For more details see [[social networking service]].

=== Wiki pages ===
A [[wiki]] provides computing users a chance to collaborate to come together with a common goal and provide content to the public; both novice and expert users.  Through the collaboration and efforts of many, a wiki page has no limit for the number of improvements that can be made.

=== Blogs ===
[[File:Tumblr-2.svg|thumb|Tumblr-2]]

A [[blog]], in social computing aspects, is more a way for people to follow a particular user, group, or company and comment on the progress toward the particular ideal being covered in the blog. This allows users to interact using the content that is provided by page admin as the main subject.

Five of the best blogging platforms&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;Fitzpatrick, Jason. "Five Best Blogging Platforms." Lifehacker. N.p., 20 June 2010. Web. 22 Oct. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; include [[Tumblr]], [[Wordpress]], [[Squarespace]], [[Blogger]], and [[Posterous]]. These sites enable users, whether it be a person, company, or organization, to express certain ideas, thoughts, and/or opinions on either a single or variety of subjects. There are also a new technology called webloging which are sites that hosts blogs such as Myspace and Xanga. Both blogs and weblogging are very similar in that they act as a form of social computing where they help form social relations through one another such as gaining followers, trending using hashtags, or commenting on a post providing an opinion on a blog.

According to a study conducted by Rachael Kwai Fun IP and Christian Wagner,&lt;ref name=Ip&gt;Ip, Rachael Kwai Fun, and Christian Wagner. "Weblogging: A Study of Social Computing and Its Impact on Organizations." Decision Support Systems45.2 (2008): 242-50. Science Direct. Web&lt;/ref&gt; some features of weblogs that attract users and support blogs and weblogs as an important aspect of social computing in forming and strengthening relationships are: content management tools, community building tools, time structuring, search by category, commentary, and the ability to secure closed blogs.

Blogs are also highly used in social computing concepts in order to understand human behaviors amongst online communities through a concept called [[social network analysis]]. Social network analysis (SNA) is "a discipline of social science that seeks to explain social phenomena through a structural interpretation of human interaction both as a theory and a methodology".&lt;ref name=Marlow&gt;Marlow, Cameron. "Audience, Structure and Authority in the Weblog Community." MIT Media Laboratory (2004): 1-9. Web. 26 Oct. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; There are certain links that occur in blogs, weblogs in this case, where they have different functions that portray different types of information such as Permalink, Blogrolls, Comments, and Trackbacks.

=== Online gaming ===
Online gaming is the social behavior of using an [[online game]] while interacting with other users.  Online gaming can be done using a multitude of different platforms; common ones include [[personal computers]], [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation]], and many more gaming consoles that can be stationary or mobile.

=== Online dating ===
[[Online dating]] has created a community of websites like OkCupid, eHarmony, and Match.com.  These platforms provide users with a way to interact with others that have goals relating to creating new relationships.  The interaction between users in sites like these will differ based on the platform but the goal is simple; create relationships through online social interaction.

== Socially Intelligent Computing ==
Groups of people interact with these social computing systems in a variety of ways, all of which may be described as socially intelligent computing.

=== Crowdsourcing ===
[[Crowdsourcing]] is currently a branch of social computing that has brought computing tasks to a new level when it comes to completion speed.  This has also given users a way to earn an income through things like [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]].

=== Dark social media ===
The Dark social media is the social media tools used to collaborate between individuals where contents are supposed to be only available to the participants. However, unlike mobile phone calls or messaging where information is sent from one user, transmitted through a medium and stored on each user devices, with the medium having no storage permission of the actual content of the data, more and more communication methods include a centralized server where all the contents are received, stored, and then transmitted. Some examples of these new mechanisms include Google Doc, Facebook Messages or Snapchat. All of the information passes through these channels has largely been unaccounted for by users themselves and the data analytics. However, in addition to their respective users private companies (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat) that provided these services do have complete control over such data. The number of images, links, referrals and information pass through digital is supposed to be completely unaccounted for in the marketing scheme of things.

== Social Science Theories ==

=== Collective intelligence ===
[[Collective intelligence]] is considered an area of social computing because of the group collaboration aspect.  Becoming a growing area in computer science, collective intelligence provides users with a way to gain knowledge through collective efforts in a social interactive environment.

=== Social perceptions ===
Recent research has begun to look at interactions between humans and their computers in groups. This line of research focuses on the interaction as the primary unit of analysis by drawing from fields such as psychology, social psychology, and sociology.&lt;ref name="posard2014"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2014|title=Status processes in human-computer interactions: Does gender matter?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214002349|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=37|pages=189–195|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.025|last1=Posard|first1=Marek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="posardRinderknecht2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Rinderknecht|first2=R.

== Current Research ==
Since 2007, research in social computing has become more popular for researchers and professionals in multiple fields dealing with technology, business and politics. A study performed by affiliates of [[Washington State University]] used a [[Latent semantic analysis]] on academic papers containing the term "social computing" to find that topics in social computing converge into the three major themes of Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Sharing and Content Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Yibai|last2=Joshi|first2=K.D.|date=July 29, 2012|title=The State of Social Computing Research: A Literature Review and Synthesis using the Latent Semantic Analysis Approach|journal=Association for Information Systems Electronic Library|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social computing continues to shift the direction of research in Information Sciences as a whole, extending social aspects into technological and corporate domains. Companies and industries such as Google, Cisco and Fox have invested in such endeavors. Possible questions to be answered through social computing research include how to form stable communities, how these communities evolve, how knowledge is created and processed, how people are motivated to participate, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parameswaran|first=Manoj|last2=Whinston|first2=Andrew B.|date=June 2007|title=Research Issues in Social Computing|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Sciences|volume=8|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, research in the areas of social computing is being done by many well known labs owned by [[Microsoft]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. The team at Microsoft has taken off with a mission statement of "To research and develop software that contributes to compelling and effective social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Computing - Microsoft Research|url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/scg/|website = research.microsoft.com|accessdate = 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They take a main focus on user-centered design processes.

Its aim is to be an experiment in a new learning environment, blurring the boundaries between coffee shops and schools, between home-schooling and institutional schooling, between tactile, multisensory methods and abstract thinking. Wildflower will serve as a research platform to test new ideas in advancing the Montessori Method in the context of modern fluencies, as well as to test how to direct the organic growth of a social system that fosters the growth and connection of such schools."&lt;ref name="media.mit.edu"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The difference between social science and computational social science ==
[[Computational social science]] can be defined as the interdisciplinary investigation of the social universe on many scales, ranging from individual actors to the largest grouping through the medium of computation.
[[Computer science]] is the study of the principles and use of computers to study experimentation and theories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1252">A '''Solar Spark Lighter''' or '''Sunlighter''' is a pocket-sized stainless steel [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]], shaped to concentrate sunlight on a small prong holding combustible material at the focal point. A revival of an old gadget marketed as a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]] by [[RadioShack]] in the 1980s, it is a useful hiking and camping accessory as its functioning is not affected by having been soaked by rain or falling in rivers or the sea. To operate it clearly needs sunlight and a small piece of flammable material. Once a glowing spark has been achieved, careful blowing will produce a blaze. Its simplicity, small size and light weight make it a useful item in a [[survival kit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirogadget.com/solar-powered/solar-spark-lighter-solar-powered-fire-starter/ Enviro Gadget]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sundial Bridge''' (also known as the '''Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay''') is a [[cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge]] for bicycles and pedestrians that spans the [[Sacramento River]] in [[Redding, California]], [[United States]] and forms a large [[sundial]]. It was designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]] and completed in 2004 at a cost of US$23,500,000. The bridge has become iconic for Redding.&lt;ref name=Calvan2004&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/04/05/bridge_unites_parkland_divides_town/ |title=Bridge unites parkland, divides town: Some see path to future, others a misguided mess |last=Calvan |first=Bobby Caina |date=April 5, 2004 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shastacascade.com/showrecord.asp?id=2048 |title=Sundial Bridge—California's Newest Icon |year=2007 |work=ShastaCascade.com |publisher=Shasta Cascade Wonderland Association |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The Sundial Bridge provides pedestrian access to the north and south areas of [[Turtle Bay Exploration Park]], a complex containing environmental, art and history museums and the McConnell Arboretum and Gardens. It also forms the gateway to the Sacramento River Trail,&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; a {{Convert|35|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} trail completed in 2010 that extends along both sides of the river and connects the bridge to the [[Shasta Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Finished trail is 35 miles of pure heaven|publisher=Recordnet|first=Peter|last=Ottesen|date=June 2, 2010|url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100602/A_SPORTS03/6020326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drift boats of fishermen are often seen passing beneath the bridge as they fish for salmon, steelhead and rainbow trout.&lt;ref name="bee05"&gt;{{citation|title=Tourists lured by Redding bridge|journal=[[Sacramento Bee]]|date=October 5, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the distance, [[Mount Shasta]] is barely visible.

[[File:SundialBridgeCA2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The support tower of the bridge.]]

== Sundial ==
The support tower of the bridge forms a single {{Convert|217|ft|m|adj=on}} mast that points due north at a cantilevered angle, allowing it to serve as the [[gnomon]] of a sundial; it has been billed as the world's largest sundial,&lt;ref name="bee01"&gt;{{citation|title=Redding is seeking to bridge image gap|journal=[[Sacramento Bee]]|date=July 12, 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=California's Seven Wonders: There's no shortage of the spectacular|journal=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=July 26, 2007|first=Janet|last=Fullwood|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07207/803169-37.stm}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Taipei 101]] and the associated sundial design of its adjoining park are much larger. The Sundial Bridge gnomon's shadow is cast upon a large dial to the north of the bridge, although the shadow cast by the tower is exactly accurate on only one day in a year&amp;nbsp;– the summer [[solstice]], June 20 or 21. The time is given as [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Daylight Time]]. The tip of the shadow moves at approximately one foot per minute so that the Earth's rotation about its axis can be seen with the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Serway"&gt;{{Citation | title = Physics: For scientists and engineers with modern physics | last = Serway | first = Raymond A. | last2 = Jewett | edition = 7th | publisher = Thomson, Brooks/Cole | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-03-004538-X }}. Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The Sundial Bridge is a cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, similar to Calatrava's earlier design of the ''[[Puente del Alamillo]]'' in [[Seville]], Spain (1992). This type of bridge does not balance the [[force]]s by using a [[symmetry|symmetrical]] arrangement of [[wire rope|cable]] forces on each side of its support tower; instead, it uses a [[cantilever]] tower, set at a 42-degree angle&lt;ref name="ar"&gt;{{citation|title=Calatrava's "Sundial Bridge" Opens In Redding, California|journal=[[Architectural Record]]|date=July 21, 2004|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/040721calatrava.asp}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and loaded by cable stays on only one side. This design requires that the spar resist [[bending]] and [[Torsion (mechanics)#Mechanics|torsional]] forces and that its [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] resists overturning. While this leads to a less structurally efficient structure, the [[architect]]ural statement is dramatic. The bridge is {{Convert|700|ft}} in length and crosses the river without touching the water, a design criterion that helps protect the salmon spawning grounds beneath the bridge.&lt;ref name="aofi"&gt;''Santiago Calatrava's Sundial Bridge: Angle of Inspiration'', Mill Valley Film Group, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The cable stays are not centered on the walkway but instead divide the bridge into a major and minor path.

The cable for the bridge totals {{Convert|4,342|ft}} and was made in England. The dial of the sundial and a small plaza beneath the support tower are decorated with broken white tile from Spain. The bridge's deck is surfaced with translucent structural glass from Quebec, which is illuminated from beneath and glows aquamarine at night. The steel support structure of the bridge was made in [[Vancouver, Washington]] and transported in {{Convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} sections by truck to Redding.&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt;
[[File:Sundialbridge2.jpg|thumb|Sundial Bridge at [[night]]]]

== Budget ==
Plans for the Sundial Bridge began in the 1990s, when the city of Redding budgeted $3 million for a pedestrian bridge across the river. However, costs escalated after Calatrava's design was chosen in 1996,&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{citation|title=Walking Bridge That Soars: Backers See Stardom for Sundial Bridge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/06/30/BAGEN7EAIH1.DTL|journal=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 30, 2004|first=Greg|last=Lucas}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the project became a controversial one within Redding, supported by a small group of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals but opposed by other residents who thought it would be too expensive&lt;ref name="aofi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{citation|title=Bridge unites parkland, divides town: Some see path to future, others a misguided mess|journal=[[Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/04/05/bridge_unites_parkland_divides_town/|first=Bobby Caina|last=Calvan|date=April 5, 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Coronary: A True Story of Medicine Gone Awry|first=Stephen|last=Klaidman|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-6754-0|pages=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and who favored a more "folksy" covered bridge design.&lt;ref name="aofi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citation|title=Bridge Out of Nowhere Leads a Town to Its Future|journal=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/19/garden/bridge-out-of-nowhere-leads-a-town-to-its-future.html|date=February 19, 2004|first=Patricia Leigh|last=Brown}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was completed in 2004, three years later than originally planned,&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; at a cost of $23.5 million, with funding from the Redding-based McConnell Foundation.&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{citation|title=California's Timeless Bridge|journal=[[Washington Post]]|date=July 25, 2004|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9484-2004Jul23.html|first=Christine|last=Vovakes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Aesthetics and economy in pedestrian bridge design|last1=Woodruff|first1=Shawn|last2=Billington|first2=David P.|journal=International Journal of Space Structures|volume=22|issue=1|year=2007|pages=81–89|doi=10.1260/026635107781037310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The expense was justified on the basis that it would increase tourism in the Redding area,&lt;ref name="bee01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; which also features [[Shasta Dam]] as another architectural marvel, and it has been successful in that goal.&lt;ref name="bee05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Redding's magnetic bridge; The Sundial span has a powerful pull.

== Tourism ==
In the fiscal year following its grand opening, Turtle Bay Exploration Park, adjacent to the bridge, saw a 42-percent increase in its visitation.&lt;ref name="bee05" /&gt; As of 2011, Redding's city manager stated that the bridge "continues to generate millions of dollars worth of commerce and tourism each year".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=It's meant to startle – and it does|journal=[[Sacramento Bee]]|date=April 11, 2011|first=Loretta|last=Kalb|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/04/11/3543095/its-meant-to-startle-and-it-does.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430025132/http://www.sacbee.com/2011/04/11/3543095/its-meant-to-startle-and-it-does.html|archivedate=April 30, 2011|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In media ==

== Pink Sundial Bridge ==
In 2009, Nor-Cal Think Pink, a non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of early detection of breast cancer, received approval from the City of Redding to illuminate the Sundial Bridge in pink for its Think Pink Day. The event now takes place annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norcalthinkpink.org/pink-sundial-bridge.php Nor-Cal Think Pink]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redding.com/news/2009/oct/15/sundial-bridge-will-turn-pink-tonight-think-pink-b/ "Sundial Bridge turns pink for Think Pink Breast Cancer Awareness Day"] Redding.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redding.com/news/2010/oct/18/txy-xy-xy-xyx-y-x/ "3 nights of pink lights"] Redding.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TheFlyStop''' is a retail fly shop and e-commerce business specializing in fly fishing, hunting and [[sporting goods]]. Founded in [[Pennsylvania]] in 2006, it is the largest online seller of fishing flies in the United States.

==History==
The companies beginnings started out of a truck where Kory Van Tassel spent downtime tying flies one dozen at a time as he waited for customers he was guiding on the rivers of central and western PA.  While building the initial customer base he worked for another successful store, the Neshannock Creek Fly Shop,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncflyshop.com/news.stm&lt;/ref&gt; which sat on prime Blue Ribbon trout fishing.  He would take long junkets up to New York for steelhead guiding and after fishing a client all day would set up a vice tying late into the night in cheap motels trying to keep up, before getting up at 4 A.M. to drive to the next spot and set up for the day.  Eventually the demand grew to the point he could no longer keep up on his own and began to search for additional tiers to fulfill demand.  At the same time he realized that he could only reach a limited number of customers within a small radius of his region invested in a website, www.theflystop.com, to try and expand the market he could reach.

After seeing some great initial success he relocated the business to Colorado, continuing to service the East Coast through dedicated customer service and long hours to keep up in both time zones.  The business expanded slower than expected in Colorado and after a series of unfortunate business dealings migrated back to its roots in Pennsylvania.

In 2012 Matthew Austin&lt;ref&gt;http://askaboutflyfishing.com/speakers/matt-austin/matt-austin.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; was brought in as a temporary consultant to the company and was later invited to join as Director of Marketing and E-commerce.  This key hire would serve as a turning point in the direction of the company and led to the technologization of many of the companies infrastructure and fulfillment processes, re-branding, expansion of core business arena and growth into additional markets in California. In 2015 he was appointed to a role of President of Business and Lead Strategist.

Their flagship store is located at 9275 Trade Place, Suite E San Diego, California 92126 and their fleet of guide boats operates out of Dana Landing.

==Famous Personalities==
Their fishing guide service is known worldwide for two of the sports most interesting target species, Mako Sharks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theflystop.com/san-diego-california-shark-fishing&lt;/ref&gt; and Carp.  Captain Conway Bowman pioneered fishing for Mako's on the fly&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/sports/13sharks.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsgreatestfishing.com/podcast/mako-shark-fishing-with-captain-conway-bowman-of-bowman-bluewater-ep-35/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bowmanbluewater.com/index.php?/TFS/Trips/BBGO/body/Sort1/asc/bottom/C16/&lt;/ref&gt; also is host to several ESPN, Sportman Channel,&lt;ref&gt;http://thefordoutfitters.com/&lt;/ref&gt; World Fishing network,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/fifty-places/host&lt;/ref&gt; and the target of several fly fishing film documentaries.

Additionally the company is a national host to the Carpthrow Down&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anglingtrade.com/2014/06/11/lake-henshaw-3rd-annual-carp-tournament-june-28th/&lt;/ref&gt; held in Santa Ysabel, CA which attracts anglers from around the country to compete for various prizes from [[orvis]], [[patagonia]] and others&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/flytalk/2014/05/help-me-solve-carp-riddle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

The Carp Throwdown is an annual carp fishing event held in Southern California at Lake Henshaw. It is one of the premier fly fishing events in the country&lt;ref&gt;http://midcurrent.com/2014/06/16/lake-henshaw-carp-throwdown/&lt;/ref&gt;  Annually sponsored by Orvis, Patagonia, Scott Fly Rods, Abel Reels, [[Simms Fishing Products]] and Reisa Fly Fishing it features divisions for both team boat and individual walk and wade.  Started in 2012 by Conway Bowman and Al Quatracchi it was acquired by Theflystop.com in 2014.  It was featured in the film Carpland&lt;ref&gt;http://carpfishingfilm.com/&lt;/ref&gt; by RA Beattie in 2014 which preceded to win 2015 Movie of the Year by the Drake Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drakemag.com/featured-content/daily-drake/1453-drake-magazine-best-fishing-movies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the Flying Mako tournament has run in San Diego several years but is less popular than their Carp Event.

The Indian [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]] signed a contract worth Rs 167 crore with BEL for the delivery of the sonars for four Kilo-class submarines between 2003 and 2007. Initially one sonar system was installed and integrated in Russia and other system was installed on board an Indian submarine.&lt;ref name=drdo13j&gt;{{cite web|title=Naval Systems - USHUS|url=http://drdo.res.in:8080/alpha/drdo/English/index.jsp?pg=ushus.jsp|publisher=DRDO|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAG report ===
A [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|CAG]] audit report filed in December 2012 criticised the program for the delays, and mentioned that by then, only three submarines were upgraded with the sonar, and two of those had completed sea trials. The report also stated that due to delays in implementing the upgrade, a large portion of the sonar's technical life had expired. In 2005, two submarines were outfitted, of which one completed sea trial in January 2011. In 2008, the third submarine was upgraded and it completed the trial in December 2011.&lt;ref name=deccanherald/&gt;

=== Current status ===
Indian Nuclear Submarine Project starting with INS Arihant (ATV-1) include advanced USHUS sonar system.

By April 2013, five [[Sindhughosh class submarine]]s of the navy were upgraded to include the USHUS system. They are, in order of their upgrade, ''Sindhuvir'', ''Sindhuratna'', ''Sindugosh'', ''Sinduvijay'' and ''Sindhurakshak''. INS ''Sindhukirti'' was upgraded in India at [[Hindustan Shipyard]].&lt;ref name=is13j /&gt; The remaining submarines of the class are expect to follow.&lt;ref name=ir29a&gt;{{cite news|title=INS Sindhurakshak arrives in India|url=http://indrus.in/economics/2013/04/29/ins_sindhurakshak_arrives_in_india_24289.html|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=IndRus|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia hands over to India refitted sub|url=http://news.in.msn.com/national/russia-hands-over-to-india-refitted-sub-1|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=MSN India|date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Underbalanced drilling''', or UBD, is a procedure used to drill oil and gas wells where the pressure in the wellbore is kept lower than the static pressure then the formation being drilled. As the well is being drilled, formation fluid flows into the wellbore and up to the surface. This is the opposite of the usual situation, where the wellbore is kept at a pressure above the formation to prevent formation fluid entering the well. In such a conventional "overbalanced" well, the invasion of fluid is considered a kick, and if the well is not shut-in it can lead to a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]], a dangerous situation.  In underbalanced drilling, however, there is a "[[rotating head]]" at the surface - essentially a seal that diverts produced fluids to a separator while allowing the [[drill string]] to continue rotating.

If the formation pressure is relatively high, using a lower density mud will reduce the well bore pressure below the pore pressure of the formation. Sometimes an inert gas is injected into the drilling mud to reduce its equivalent density and hence its [[hydrostatic pressure]] throughout the well depth. This gas is commonly nitrogen, as it is non-combustible and readily available, but air, reduced oxygen air, processed [[flue gas]] and [[natural gas]] have all been used in this fashion.

[[Coiled tubing drilling]] (CTD) allows for continuous drilling and pumping and therefore underbalanced drilling can be utilized which can increase the [[rate of penetration]] (ROP).

==Kinds of Underbalanced Drilling==
There are several kinds of underbalanced drilling. The most common are listed below.

*Dry air. This is also known as dusting. Here air compressors combined with a booster (which takes the head from the compressors and increases the pressure of the air, but does not increase the volume of air going down hole) are used and the only fluid injected into the well is a small amount of oil to reduce corrosion.
*Mist. A small amount of foaming agent (soap) is added into the flow of air. Fine particles of water and foam in an atmosphere of air bring cuttings back to the surface.
*Foam. A larger amount of foaming agent is added into the flow. Bubbles and slugs of bubbles in an atmosphere of mist bring cuttings back to the surface.
*Stable foam. An even larger amount of foaming agent is added into the flow. This is the consistency of a shaving cream.
*Airlift. Slugs and bubbles of air in a matrix of water, soap can or can not be added into the fluid flow of air.
*Aerated mud. Air or another gas is injected into the flow of drilling mud. Degassing units are required to remove air before it can be recirculated.

==Advantages==

Under-balanced wells have several advantages over conventional drilling including:

* Eliminates [[formation damage]].  In a conventional well, [[drilling mud]] is forced into the formation in a process called [[drilling fluid invasion|invasion]], which frequently causes formation damage - a decrease in the ability of the formation to transmit oil into the well-bore at a given pressure and flow rate.  It may or may not be repairable. In under-balanced drilling, if the under-balanced state is maintained until the well becomes productive, invasion does not occur and formation damage can be completely avoided.
* Increases rate of penetration (ROP). With less pressure at the bottom of the well-bore, it is easier for the drill bit to cut and remove rock.
* Reduction of [[lost circulation]].  Lost circulation is when drilling mud flows into the formation uncontrollably. Large amounts of mud can be lost before a proper [[mud cake (oil and gas)|mud cake]] forms, or the loss can continue indefinitely. If the well is drilled under-balanced, mud will not enter the formation and the problem can be avoided.
* Eliminates differential sticking. Differential sticking is when the drill pipe is pressed against the well-bore wall so that part of its circumference will see only reservoir pressure, while the rest will continue to be pushed by well-bore pressure. As a result, the pipe becomes stuck to the wall, and can require thousands of pounds of force to remove, which may prove impossible. Because the reservoir pressure is greater than the well-bore pressure in UBD, the pipe is pushed away from the walls, eliminating differential sticking.
* Reduces formation damage and water loss.  Some rock formation have a reactive tendency to water. When drilling-mud is used the water in the drill mud reacts with the formation (mostly clay) and inherently causes a formation damage (reduction in permeability and porosity) Use of under-balanced drilling can prevent it

==Disadvantages==

Underbalanced drilling is usually more expensive than conventional drilling (when drilling a deviated well which requires [[directional drilling]] tools), and has safety issues of its own. Technically the well is always in a blowout condition unless a heavier fluid is displaced into the well. Air drilling requires a faster up hole volume as the cuttings will fall faster down the annulus when the compressors are taken off the hole compared to having a higher viscosity fluid in the hole. Because air is compressible mud pulse telemetry measurement while drilling (MWD) tools which require an incompressible fluid can not work. Common technologies used to eliminate this problem are either electromagnetic MWD tools or wireline MWD tools. Downhole mechanics are usually more violent also because the volume of fluid going through a downhole motor or downhole hammer is greater than an equivalent fluid when drilling balanced or over balanced because of the need of higher up hole velocities. Corrosion is also a problem, but can be largely avoided using a coating oil or rust inhibitors.

'''W29''' would have been the operational designation of the TX-29, which was development of the Mk-15 and was proposed for the Javajo, [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]], and Snark [[missile]]s. The TX-29 was terminated in mid-1955 in favor of the W-39 development of the TX-15-X3.
==Design==
As this warhead was never tested its yield is unknown. However it is known that the warhead would have been 52 or 35 wide by 145 inches long and would have weighed in at 3,500 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wagon fort''' is a mobile [[fortification]] made of [[wagon]]s arranged into a rectangle, a circle or other shape and possibly joined with each other, an improvised [[military camp]]. It is also known as a '''laager''' (from [[Afrikaans]]) ({{lang-en|leaguer}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Laager]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable historical examples include [[Hussite]]s, which called it ''vozová hradba'' ("wagon wall"), known under the German word ''Wagenburg'' ("wagon castle"), ''tabors'' in the armies of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Cossacks]], the ''Laager'' of the settlers in [[South Africa]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When faced with attack, such as by hostile [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]], the travellers would rapidly form a circle out of their wagons, bringing the [[Working animal|draft animals]] (sometimes [[horse]]s, but more commonly [[ox]]en) and women and children to the center of the circle. The armed men would then man the perimeter, the circled wagons serving to break up the enemy charge, to create a certain amount of concealment from observation and shelter from enemy [[firearm]]s fire. They would also slow down and separate any warriors who attempted to get past the wagons into the circle, making them easier to dispatch, although they never formed a perfect barricade as a true wall would. This tactic was popularly known as "''circling the wagons''", and survives into the modern day as an idiom describing a person or group preparing to defend themselves from attack or criticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'': ''"Corral: a circular enclosure formed by wagons during an encampment, as by covered wagons crossing the North American plains in the 19th century, for defense against attack"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== History ==

=== Chinese ===
One of the earliest examples of using conjoined wagons as fortification is described in the Chinese historical record ''[[Book of Han]]''. During the 119 BC [[Battle of Mobei]] of the [[Han–Xiongnu War]], the famous [[Han Dynasty|Han]] general [[Wei Qing]] used armored wagons known as "Wu Gang Wagon" (武剛車) in ring formations to neutralise the [[Xiongnu]]'s cavalry charges, before launching a counteroffensive which overran the [[nomad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Han'', [[Ban Gu]], 111 CE&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czechs and Hussites ===
[[File:Der Frauen der Teutonen verteidigen die Wagenburg by Heinrich Leutemann.jpg|thumb|300px|"The Women of the [[Teutons]] Defend the Wagon Fort" (1882) by [[Heinrich Leutemann]].]]
In the 15th century, during the [[Hussite Wars]], the [[Hussite]]s developed tactics of using the tabors, called ''vozová hradba'' in Czech or ''Wagenburg'' by the [[Germans]], as mobile [[fortification]]s. When the Hussite army faced a numerically superior opponent, the [[Bohemians]] usually formed a square of the armed wagons, joined them with iron chains, and defended the resulting fortification against charges of the enemy. Such a camp was easy to establish and practically invulnerable to enemy [[cavalry]]. The etymology of the word ''tabor'' may come from the Hussite fortress and modern day Czech city of [[Tábor]], which itself is a name derived from biblical [[Jezreel Valley|Jezreel]] mountain [[Mount Tabor|Tavor]] (in Hebrew תבור).

The crew of each wagon consisted of 18 to 21 soldiers: 4 to 8 crossbowmen, 2 handgunners, 6 to 8 soldiers equipped with pikes or flails, 2 shield carriers and 2 drivers. The wagons would normally form a square, and inside the square would usually be the cavalry. There were two principal stages of the battle using the wagon fort: defensive and counterattack. The defensive part would be a pounding of the enemy with artillery. The Hussite artillery was a primitive form of a [[howitzer]], called in [[Czech language|Czech]] a ''houfnice'', from which the [[English language|English]] word howitzer comes. Also, they called their guns the Czech word ''píšťala'' ([[hand cannon]]), meaning that they were shaped like a pipe or a [[fife (instrument)|fife]], from which the English word [[pistol]] is possibly derived. When the enemy would come close to the wagon fort, crossbowmen and hand-gunners would come from inside the wagons and inflict more casualties on the enemy at close range. There would even be stones stored in a pouch inside the wagons for throwing whenever the soldiers were out of ammunition. After this huge barrage, the enemy would be demoralized. The armies of the anti-Hussite crusaders were usually heavily armored [[knight]]s, and Hussite tactics were to disable the knight's horses so that the dismounted (and slow) knights would be easier targets for the ranged men. Once the commander saw it fit, the second stage of battle would begin. Men with [[sword]]s, [[flail (weapon)|flails]], and [[polearm]]s would come out and attack the weary enemy. Together with the infantry, the cavalry in the square would come out and attack. At this point, the enemy would be eliminated or very nearly so.

The wagon fort's effect on Czech history was lost, but the Czechs would continue to use the wagon forts in later conflicts. After the Hussite Wars, foreign powers such as the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarians]] and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poles]] who had confronted the destructive forces of Hussites, hired thousands of Czech mercenaries (such as into the [[Black Army of Hungary]]). At the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444, it is said that 600 Bohemian handgunners (men armed with early shoulder arms) defended a wagon fortification. The Germans would also use wagons for fortification. They would use much cheaper materials than the Hussites, and they would have different wagons for the infantry and the artillery. The [[Tsardom of Russia|Russians]] also used a type of movable fortress, called a ''[[guliai-gorod]]'' in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hussite Wars (1419–36)'', Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing ({{ISBN|1-84176-665-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of this tactic would be very similar to the [[infantry square]]s used by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the [[South Africa]]n laager. The wagon forts would form into squares that would support each other. Whenever an enemy charged between two forts, marksmen from both of them would easily exploit the advantage and kill many of the enemy. The wagon fort was later used by the crusading anti-Hussite armies at the [[Battle of Tachov]] (1427). However, the anti-Hussite [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] forces, being inexperienced at this type of strategy, were defeated. The Hussite wagon fort would meet its demise at the [[Battle of Lipany]] (1434), where the [[Utraquist]] faction of Hussites defeated the [[Taborite]] faction by getting the Taborites inside a wagon fort on a hill to charge at them by at first attacking, then retreating. The Utraquists would reunite with the Catholic Church afterwards. Thus ended the wagon fort's effect on Czech history. The first victory against the wagon fort at the Battle of Tachov showed that the best ways to defeat it were to prevent it from being erected in the first place or to get the men inside of it to charge out of it by means of a [[Feint|feint retreat]]. Thus, the fortification would lose its prime advantage.

== Variations ==

=== Laager ===
A ''laager'', ''lager'', ''leaguer'' or ''laer'' ([[Afrikaans]], from Dutch ''leger'' (camp or army); {{IPA-af|ˈlɑːɡər|pron}} or {{IPA-af|ˈliɡər|}}). The word is South African in origin, and originally referred to a formation used by travelers whereby they would draw wagons into a circle and place [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s on the inside to protect them from raiders or nocturnal animals. Laager were extensively used by the [[Voortrekkers]] of the [[Great Trek]] during the 1830s. The laager was put to the ultimate test on 16 December 1838, when an army of 10 000 [[Zulu people|Zulu]] [[Impi]]s besieged and were defeated by approximately 350 [[Voortrekkers]] in the aptly named [[Battle of Blood River]]. In 19th century America, the same approach was used by pioneers who would "circle the wagons" in case of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The WRAP certification program mainly focuses on the apparel, footwear and sewn products sectors.

==History==
Created by a working group of the [http://www.apparelandfootwear.org American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association] in 1997, WRAP became a standalone entity in 2000. While it was founded by clothing industry companies, WRAP's charter requires that a majority of its board members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrapapparel.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=5 Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production - Content&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; come from outside the apparel industry.

==WRAP's 12 Principles==
The WRAP Principles are based on generally accepted international workplace standards, local laws and workplace regulations which encompass human resources management, health and safety, environmental practices, and legal compliance including import/export and customs compliance and security standards:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrapapparel.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=3 Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production - Content&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compliance with Laws and Workplace Regulations
# Prohibition of Forced Labor
# Prohibition of Child Labor
# Prohibition of Harassment or Abuse
# Compensation and Benefits
# Hours of Work
# Prohibition of Discrimination
# Health and Safety
# Freedom of Association &amp; Collective Bargaining
# Environment
# Customs Compliance
# Security

==Certification Process==

1. Application

A production facility submits basic information to WRAP and pays a registration fee of US$1195.

2. Self-Assessment

Facilities complete a self-assessment of their facility to show that they
have been utilizing socially-compliant practices for a minimum of 90 days (for new facilities; facilities seeking re-certification are expected to have been compliant throughout their preceding certification period).

3. Monitoring

After submitting their self-assessment, the facility selects a WRAP-accredited monitoring organization to audit the facility against WRAP's 12 Principles. The audit must be successfully passed within 6 months of paying the registration fee to avoid having to re-register.

4. Evaluation

WRAP will review the monitor's audit report and decide whether or not to certify the facility. If WRAP decides not to issue a certification, the facility will be notified of the corrections that need to be made and the monitoring firm will conduct an additional inspection. If the facility does not satisfactorily implement the recommendations within the original six-month period, it must renew its application and pay the registration fee again.

5. Certification

The certificate issued to a facility is determined by WRAP and depends on the extent to which the audit indicates full compliance and management commitment to the WRAP Principles.

==Certification Levels==
PLATINUM (Valid for 2 years)



A facility must maintain a Gold certification for at least 3 consecutive years before it can be considered for Platinum certification. All Platinum-certified facilities must successfully pass each audit with no corrective actions and maintain continuous certification in order to remain Platinum (a facility whose certification lapses for any reason must hold a Gold certification for at least 3 consecutive years before it can regain Platinum status).

GOLD (Valid for 1 year)

Gold certifications are awarded to facilities that demonstrate full compliance with WRAP's 12 Principles during an audit.

*NOTICE: Any facility that cannot show complete and accurate records regarding wages and/or working hours during ANY audit (initial, re-certification, or post-certification) will automatically lose eligibility for Platinum and Gold certification for their current period. This includes any violations of Principles 5 or 6 where WRAP monitors indicate issues with record keeping or cannot verify them due to inconsistencies.

SILVER (Valid for 6 months)

A facility may request a Silver level certification if an audit finds that it is in substantial compliance with the WRAP principles, but has minor non-compliances in policies, procedures or training that need to be addressed. Facilities seeking certification through this route must request a Silver certificate in writing from a WRAP office at the conclusion of their first formal audit as a certificate will not be automatically issued. Important points to note in this regard are:

•Facilities may not have any "red flag" non-compliances such as child labor, egregious health &amp; safety or environmental issues, prison labor, forced or involuntary labor, or harassment or abuse of employees.

•Facilities must demonstrate that their employees are paid at least the minimum wage and any required overtime compensation.

Alternatively, the WRAP Review Board may issue a Silver certificate if any of these criteria are met:

The facility is a first-time applicant and has demonstrated difficulty in achieving full compliance or has shown non-material non-compliances in one of these areas:

•working hours

•training and communications with employees

•payment of regular wages and overtime premiums

•any other factors that would bar the facility from being granted a Gold certificate

The facility is applying for a re-certification, but non-material non-compliances are found during the audit

Special Notices for Silver Certifications:

All Silver-certified facilities wishing to renew their certification must reapply prior to the expiration of their certificate, pay a reduced registration fee of US$895, and demonstrate improvement toward achieving Gold certification at the subsequent audit.

A facility may be awarded no more than 3 consecutive Silver certificates. If a facility fails to achieve full compliance within this time period, its certification will be revoked, however the facility may reapply for certification using its original registration number following a waiting period of 6 months.

Facilities that have two successive "clean" audits will be eligible for a Gold certificate.

==Training Program==
WRAP administers a comprehensive [http://www.wrapcompliance.org/training training program] that has become one of the leaders in the industry. All of WRAP's [http://www.wrapcompliance.org/en/monitor-information accredited monitors] must undergo an intensive 5-day [http://www.wrapcompliance.org/lead-auditor-training Lead Auditor Course] and attend regular refresher training sessions in order to maintain accreditation. Additionally, WRAP offers a 2-day [http://www.wrapcompliance.org/internal-auditor-training Internal Auditor Course] for factory personnel charged with maintaining compliance in a facility. WRAP has also been a leader with its [http://www.wrapcompliance.org/en/fire-safety-awareness-course Fire Safety Awareness Course] that focuses on the prevention of fires via the [http://www.wrapcompliance.org/blog/highly-effective-highly-affordable-fire-safety 5-step Risk Assessment Process]

== Partnerships ==
In February 2018, WRAP became the official Corporate Social Responsibility partner of the [[American Apparel and Footwear Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.just-style.com/news/aafa-and-wrap-to-offer-guidance-on-labour-issues_id132822.aspx|title=AAFA and WRAP to offer guidance on labour issues|date=2018-02-12|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
