[[File:Gregor Reisch, Margarita Philosophica, 1508 (1230x1615).png|right|thumb|250px|Calculating-Table by Gregor Reisch: Margarita Philosophica, 1508]]
'''Algorism''' is the technique of performing basic [[arithmetic]] by writing numbers in [[place value]] form and applying a set of memorized rules and [[mathematical table|facts]] to the digits. One who practices algorism is known as an '''algorist'''. This [[positional notation]] system largely superseded earlier calculation systems that used a different set of symbols for each numerical [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], such as [[Roman numerals]], and in some cases required a device such as an [[abacus]].

==Etymology==
The word ''algorism'' comes from the name [[Al-Khwārizmī]] (c. 780–850), a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[geographer]] and [[scholar]] in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]], whose name means "the native of [[Khwarezm]]", a city that was part of the [[Greater Iran]] during his era and now is in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]&lt;ref name="toomer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogendijk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oaks"/&gt; He wrote a treatise in Arabic language in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century, which was translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Sfrxde0CXIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor of Algebra], by Corona Brezina (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through his other book, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system" that is still the meaning of modern English algorism. During the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, the French form for the word –but not its meaning– was changed to ''[[algorithm]]'', following the model of the word ''[[logarithm]]'', this form alluding to the ancient Greek {{nowrap|''arithmos'' {{=}} number}}. English adopted the French very soon afterwards, but it wasn't until the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of algorithm at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/algorithm Dictionary.Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In English, it was first used about 1230 and then by Chaucer in 1391.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (first quote ''c'' 1230 CE, Chaucer ''c'' 1391, and later quotes showing continuing usage since then)&lt;/ref&gt; Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexandre de Villedieu]]. It begins thus:
{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}
which translates as:
{{quote|This present art, in which we use those twice five Indian figures, is called algorismus.}}

The word ''[[algorithm]]'' also derives from ''algorism'', a generalization of the meaning to any set of rules specifying a computational procedure. Occasionally ''algorism'' is also used in this generalized meaning, especially in older texts.

==History==
Starting with the integer arithmetic developed in India using [[base 10]] notation, [[Al-Khwārizmī]] along with other [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematicians in medieval Islam]], both [[Iran]]ian and [[Arabic]], documented new arithmetic methods and made many other contributions to decimal arithmetic (see the articles linked below). These included the concept of the decimal fractions as an extension of the notation, which in turn led to the notion of the [[decimal point]].  This system was popularized in Europe by Leonardo of Pisa, now known as [[Fibonacci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-Pisano|title=Leonardo Pisano {{!}} Italian mathematician|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the longer the [[biological half-life]] of a [[Toxin|toxic substance]], the greater the risk of chronic [[poisoning]], even if [[Measured environmental concentration|environmental level]]s of the toxin are not very high.&lt;ref&gt;Bioaccumulation of Marine Pollutants [and Discussion], by G.

[[Bioconcentration]] is a related but more specific term, referring to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone. By contrast, bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=|date=|title=Bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, biomagnification|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F1-4020-4494-1_31|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

An example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase "[[mad as a hatter]]" (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which forms organic species such as [[methylmercury]], which is lipid-soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [[mercury poisoning]]. Other lipid-[[soluble]] (fat-soluble) poisons include [[tetraethyllead]] compounds (the [[lead]] in leaded [[petrol]]), and [[DDT]]. These compounds are stored in the body's [[fat]], and when the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.

[[Strontium-90]], part of the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[atomic bomb]]s, is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in [[osteogenesis]], where its radiation can cause damage for a long time.

Naturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate. The marine [[algal bloom]]s known as "[[red tide]]s" can result in local filter-feeding organisms such as [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s becoming toxic; coral fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as [[ciguatera]] when they accumulate a toxin called [[ciguatoxin]] from reef algae.

Some animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense; by consuming toxic plants or animal prey, a species may accumulate the toxin, which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator. One example is the [[Manduca sexta|tobacco hornworm]], which concentrates [[nicotine]] to a toxic level in its body as it consumes [[tobacco]] plants.
Poisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on.
Other compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms. The classic example is of [[Vitamin A]], which becomes concentrated in [[carnivore]] [[liver]]s of e.g. [[polar bear]]s: as a pure carnivore that feeds on other carnivores (seals), they accumulate extremely large amounts of Vitamin A in their livers. It was known by the native peoples of the Arctic that the livers of carnivores should not be eaten, but Arctic [[explorer]]s have suffered [[Hypervitaminosis A]] from eating the bear livers (and there has been at least one example of similar poisoning of [[Xavier Mertz|Antarctic explorers]] eating [[husky]] [[dog]] livers).  One notable example of this is the expedition of [[Mawson|Sir Douglas Mawson]], where his exploration companion died from eating the liver of one of their dogs.

[[Coastal fish]] (such as the [[smooth toadfish]]) and [[seabird]]s (such as the [[Atlantic puffin]]) are often monitored for [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] bioaccumulation.

In some eutrophic aquatic systems, [[biodilution]] can occur. This trend is a decrease in a contaminant with an increase in trophic level and is due to higher concentrations of algae and bacteria to "dilute" the concentration of the pollutant.

'''Chinta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चिन्ता) in Hindu philosophy refers to mentation i.e. mental activity, especially thinking.

==Meaning==

The word, Chintā (चिन्ता), is derived from the root – चिन्त् meaning -  to think, consider, reflect, ponder over; and by itself means – thinking, thought, sad or sorrowful thought, reflection, consideration, anxiety  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.apte.1968613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==

Chintā is one of thirty-three ''Vyabhichāri bhavas'', the transient feelings which rise irregularly and support the permanent basic sentiments, because of their fleeting nature they are also called ''sanchāri bhavas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Sanskrit Literature|author=Mohan Lal|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=4603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4603&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ytNHU7r2OMaGrgeY4IDwAw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manas'', which is the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, is the perceiving and arranging mind. In Samkhya system it refers to the personal organ of thought, not diffused like the''ātman'' but localized in the individual. ''Manas'' has its own illumination (''chetas'') which gives man awareness or consciousness (''chetna''), faculties of perception (''[[pratyaksha]]''), thought (''chintā''), imagination (''kalpanā'') and volition (''praytana''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia|author=subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publications|page=5839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDh2WjvLo7gC&amp;pg=PA5839&amp;dq=chinta+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wtRHU6LbFMaxrgfM94HAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chintā is the faculty whereby the current of thought dwells, thinks and contemplates upon the subject so recalled by ''Samarnam'' (memory), and previously known and determined by ''[[buddhi]]'' (intellect)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Serpent Power|author=Kalicarana|publisher=Ganesh|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CWgwAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chinta+vedanta&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItNHU5CLG4GGrQevm4GQDw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

Rishi Shant Vaikhānsa of the [[Rig Veda]] (IX.66.25) in a mantra addressed to Soma tells us that

: पवमानस्य जङ्घ्नतो हरेश्चन्द्रा असृक्षत |

when the material darkness is dispelled by the powerful purifying (पवमानस्य) light emanating from the divine source, coinciding therewith is also the destruction of the darkness of the mind (जङ्घ्नतः) (which darkness is ignorance), then that light (जीराः) (the bright divine source) which is Brahman (अजिराशोचिषः) is seen which delivers the ''yogins'' beyond all (imaginable) folds (barriers) of existence, which existence with reference to the body is gross but is subtle with reference to the mind. The epithet – [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] as the ever glowing one, is used with regard to [[Agni]], [[Aditya]] and [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|page=181|url=https://openlibrary.org/search?author_key=OL6886704A&amp;has_fulltext=false&amp;publisher_facet=GBD+Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his [[Vivekachudamani]] (Sloka 539) uses the term – चिन्ताशून्यम् (''chintashoonyam'') as meaning without anxiety or worry (''chinta'' here means anxiety). [[Chinmayananda Saraswati]] explains that it refers to the man of perfection to whom no thought comes to mind so as to disturb and destroy him because worry cannot reach him who refuses to worry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekcoodamani|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=593|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mArVw7yUkCsC&amp;pg=PA593&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=itJHU7vcO8XarAfWxoH4Cw&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vedanta]], ''Chinta'', along with and therefore interconnected with ''[[vāsanā]]'' and ''[[karma]]'', is a factor which represents the chain of causation. ''Chinta'' and ''karmas'' create powerful ''vasanas'' and by themselves are the effects of ''vasanas''.  ''Vasanas'' are not destroyed if ''chinta'' and ''karmas'' are not destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta, the Science of Life|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Central Chinmaya Mission Trust|page=527,1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=chinta+vedanta&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItNHU5CLG4GGrQevm4GQDw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBjgU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

[[Gaudapada]] in his ''Karika'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] (Slokas III.31-48) explains that all that there is, is perceived by the mind; when the mind ceases to be (stops thinking) duality is not perceived; the mind ceases to think as a consequence of the realisation of the Truth that it is the Self, it becomes a non-perceiver. Truth is known through knowledge and both are birth-less; the mind that does not lose itself when under control becomes the fearless Brahman possessed of the light of Consciousness; then all mentation (चिन्ता) stops, he states:-

: सर्वभिलापविगतः सर्वचिन्तासमुत्थितः |
: सुप्रशान्तः सकृज्ज्योतिः समाधिरलोऽभयः ||

: " The Self is free of all sense-organs, and is above all internal organs. It is supremely tranquil, eternal effulgence, divine absorption, immutable, and fearless. "

In this verse, the word ''chinta'' derived in the sense of that by which things are thought of, means - the intellect. Gaudapada calls the moment of direct apprehension of the [[Paramatman]] (whose presence is known through the mind) the state of the highest [[Samadhi]] in which all talk is at an end, all anxiety is at an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=306-313|url=https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The learned people are those who are aware of the existence of Truth, and the enlightened one are those who have in their own way personally experienced, both know about the true nature of Truth.

{{strong|Choiceless awareness}} is posited in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[spirituality]] to be the state of unpremeditated, complete [[awareness]] of the [[present]] without [[preference]], effort, or compulsion. The term was popularized in mid-20th century by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], in whose philosophy it signifies a main theme. Similar or related concepts had been previously developed in several religious or spiritual traditions; the term or others like it has also been used to describe traditional and contemporary [[Secularity|secular]] and religious [[meditation]] practices. By {{nobr|early 21st century,}} choiceless awareness as a concept or term had appeared in a variety of fields, including in [[neuroscience]], [[therapy]], sociology, and in art. However, Krishnamurti's approach of the subject was unique, and differs from both prior and later notions.

==Jiddu Krishnamurti==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti to Himself]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
Choiceless awareness is a major topic in the exposition of [[India]]n philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895{{en dash}}1986).{{r|rv2001}} Beginning in the 1930s, he often commented on the subject, which became a recurring theme in his work.{{r|jk-ca}} He is considered to have been mainly responsible for the subsequent interest in both the term and the concept.{{r|jk-ca-spread}}

Krishnamurti held that outside of strictly practical, technical matters, the presence and action of [[choice]] indicates confusion and subtle bias: an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner, without distortion, and therefore with complete awareness, will immediately, naturally, act according to this awareness{{spaced en dash}}the action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness, rather than the result of choice. Such action (and quality of mind) is inherently without conflict.{{r|jk-choice}}

He did not offer any method to achieve such awareness;{{nnbsp}}{{r|hr1996-p49}} in his view application of technique cannot possibly evolve into, or result in, true choicelessness{{spaced en dash}}just as unceasing application of effort leads to illusory effortlessness, in reality the action of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]];{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk-habit}} additionally, in his opinion all methods introduce potential or actual conflict, generated by the practitioner's efforts to comply. According to this analysis, all practices towards achieving choiceless awareness have the opposite effect: they inhibit its action in the present by treating it as a future, premeditated result, and moreover one that is conditioned by the practitioner's implied or expressed expectations.{{r|jk-ca-inhibit}} For true choicelessness to be realized, choice{{spaced en dash}}implicit or explicit{{spaced en dash}}has to simply, irrevocably, stop; however, the ceasing of choice is not the result of decision-making, but implies the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or [[Psychology of self|self as a psychological entity]]. Krishnamurti proposed that such a state might be approached through inquiry based on total attentiveness: [[identity (social science)|identity]] is then dissolved in complete, all-encompassing attention.{{r|jk-attention}} Therefore, he asserted that choiceless awareness is a natural attribute of non-self-centered perception, which he called "observation without the observer".{{r|jk-no-observer}}

Accordingly, Krishnamurti advised against following any [[doctrine]], discipline, teacher, [[guru]], or authority, including himself.{{r|jk-no-authority}} He also advised against following one's own psychological knowledge and experience, which he considered integral parts of the observer.{{r|jk1975-p19}} He denied the usefulness of all meditation techniques and methods, but not of meditation itself, which he called "perhaps the greatest" art in life;{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk1975-p116}} and stated that insight into choiceless awareness could be shared through open dialogue.{{r|pk2008-p970}}

Krishnamurti's ideas on choiceless awareness were discussed by among others, influential [[Hindu]] [[Index of religious honorifics and titles#Teachers|spiritual teacher]] [[Ramana Maharshi]] (1879{{en dash}}1950){{nnbsp}}{{r|ao1996-p70}} and, following wide publication of his books,{{r|jk-books}} they attracted the attention of psychologists and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] in the 1950s;{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk-psych}} in subsequent decades Krishnamurti held a number of discussions on this and related subjects with practicing psychotherapists and with researchers in the field.{{r|ml2003-pp206}} His views on the subject have been included in [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|scholarly papers]] on [[existential therapy]],{{r|cf2005-p316}} [[education theory]],{{r|dl2014-pp357}} and [[Peace and conflict studies|peace research]],{{r|ljf1994}} but they have also been discussed in less formal or structured settings.{{r|jk-informal}}

In late{{nbsp}}1980, almost half a century after he started discussing it, Krishnamurti included the concept in "The Core of Krishnamurti's Teaching", a pivotal statement of his philosophy: "Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity.{{"-}}{{r|jk1980-par3|jk-more}}

==Other representations==
In contrast with Krishnamurti's approach, other articulations commonly include choiceless awareness (or related ideas and terms) as part, or as the hoped-for result, of specific [[Methodology|methodologies]] and meditation techniques.{{r|methodologies}} Similar concepts and terms appeared or developed in various traditional and contemporary religious or spiritual doctrines and texts,{{r|ca-similar}} and also within secular disciplines such as [[psychotherapy]],{{r|cg2013-p16}} rehabilitation medicine,{{r|c&amp;s2011-ch10}} and counseling.{{r|kcp2010-ho2.8}} Choiceless awareness has been examined within the context of [[philosophy of perception]] and behavior,{{r|ad2006-pp39}} while studies have cited its possible role in [[job performance]].{{r|job-studies}} Other studies have linked meditation based on the concept (among others), with [[Biological neural network|neural activity]] consistent with increased attentiveness, considered a factor of well-being and happiness.{{r|mind-studies}}

One term that is often used as a near-[[synonym]] is [[mindfulness]], which as a concept has similarities to or may include choiceless awareness.{{r|mindfulness}} Initially part of [[Sati (Buddhism)|Buddhist meditation practice]], it has been adapted and utilized for contemporary [[Mindfulness#Psychology|psychological treatment]],{{r|cg2013-p82}} and has been applied as a component of [[integrative medicine]] programs.{{r|uwh}}

Kindred themes can be found in the doctrine and meditation practices (such as [[Vipassanā]]) associated with the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]];{{nnbsp}}{{r|jkz2011-pp289}} and also in 20th-century offshoots such as the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].{{r|rhs2013}} Within these and similar fields, for example the [[Shikantaza]] practice in [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]],{{r|ms2004-pp76}} choiceless (or effortless) awareness is considered to frequently be the result of a mature progression of practice.{{r|practice}}

The concept has been included in the discourse of [[transpersonal]] philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] (b. 1949),{{r|kw1988-pp155}} and also of independent Indian spiritual teacher [[Rajneesh|Osho (Rajneesh)]] (1931{{en dash}}1990).{{r|osho}} [[Tibetan Buddhism]] teacher [[Chögyam Trungpa]] (1939{{en dash}}1987), who engaged in dialogue with Krishnamurti,{{r|jk1996-ch?}} used the term to describe the experience of shunyata ([[Śūnyatā]]){{spaced en dash}}in [[Sanskrit]], "emptiness", or "ego-less perception".{{r|ct1994-ch3}}

Among other fields, the term has appeared in [[dispute resolution]] theory and practice,{{r|lr2006}} and has found application in artistic endeavors. In [[dramatic theory]], [[Theatre criticism|theater criticism]],{{r|rl1970}} and [[acting]],{{r|se2010}} it has been used to denote spontaneous creativity and related practices or attempts; it has additionally appeared in music works.{{r|sm1978-a2}} Author [[J. D. Salinger]] (1919{{en dash}}2010), who was interested in spirituality and alternative religions, was reputedly an adherent of Ramana Maharshi's ideas on choiceless awareness.{{r|ek2010}}

Contrary to press reports published in mid-20th-century,{{r|toi1954}} later interest in practices related to, or influenced by, choiceless awareness, has resulted in unambiguously favorable mentions in the [[Mass media|popular press]].{{r|pop-press}} Additionally, [[mass market]] general interest titles covering the subject have been published.{{r|sa2015-pp110}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83725">The '''African-American civil rights movement (1896–1954)''' was a long, primarily [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent]] series of events to bring full [[civil rights]] and equality under the law to all Americans. The era has had a lasting impact on United States society, in its tactics, the increased social and legal acceptance of civil rights, and in its exposure of the prevalence and cost of racism.

Two [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions—''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', {{ussc|163|537|1896}}, which upheld "separate but equal" racial segregation as [[Constitution of the United States|constitutional]] doctrine, and ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', {{ussc|347|483|1954}} which overturned ''Plessy''—serve as milestones. This was an era of new beginnings, in which some movements, such as [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]], were very successful but left little lasting legacy, while others, such as the [[NAACP]]'s painstaking legal assault on state-sponsored segregation, achieved modest results in its early years but made steady progress on voter rights and gradually built to a key victory in ''Brown v. Board of Education'' (1954).

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the US expanded the legal rights of African Americans. [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed, and enough states ratified, an amendment ending slavery in 1865—the [[13th Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. This amendment only outlawed slavery; it provided neither citizenship nor equal rights. In 1868, the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was ratified by the states, granting African Americans citizenship. All persons born in the US were extended equal protection under the laws of the Constitution.  The [[15th Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] (ratified  in 1870) stated that race could not be used as a condition to deprive men of the ability to vote. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] (1865–1877), Northern troops occupied the South.  Together with the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], they tried to administer and enforce the new constitutional amendments. Many black leaders were elected to local and state offices, and many others organized community groups, especially to support education.

Reconstruction ended following the [[Compromise of 1877]] between Northern and Southern white elites.&lt;ref&gt;''America: A Narrative History'', Chapter 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for deciding the contentious Presidential election in favor of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], supported by Northern states, over his opponent, [[Samuel J. Tilden]], the compromise called for the withdrawal of Northern troops from the South.  This followed violence and fraud in southern elections from 1868 to 1876, which had reduced black voter turnout and enabled Southern white Democrats to regain power in state legislatures across the South.  The compromise and withdrawal of Federal troops meant that white Democrats had more freedom to impose and enforce discriminatory practices. Many African Americans responded to the withdrawal of federal troops by leaving the South in what is known as the [[Exodusters|Kansas Exodus of 1879]].

The [[Radical Republicans]], who spearheaded Reconstruction, had attempted to eliminate both governmental and private discrimination by legislation. That effort was largely ended by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in the [[Civil Rights Cases]], {{ussc|109|3|1883}}, in which the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not give Congress power to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or businesses.

{{See also|List of 14th amendment cases}}
The Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) upheld state-mandated discrimination in public transportation under the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine. As Justice [[John Marshall Harlan|Harlan]], the only member of the Court to dissent from the decision, predicted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If a state can prescribe, as a rule of civil conduct, that whites and blacks shall not travel as passengers in the same railroad coach, why may it not so regulate the use of the streets of its cities and towns as to compel white citizens to keep on one side of a street, and black citizens to keep on the other? Why may it not, upon like grounds, punish whites and blacks who ride together in street cars or in open vehicles on a public road or street? . . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Plessy'' decision did not address an earlier  Supreme Court case, ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'', [[Case citation|118 U.S. 356]] (1886),&lt;ref name="citation"&gt;{{caselaw source
 |case=''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'', 118 U.S. 356 (1886)

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  involving discrimination against Chinese immigrants, that held that a law that is [[race-neutral]] on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[US Constitution]].
While in the 20th century, the Supreme Court began to overturn state statutes that disenfranchised African Americans, as in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915), with ''Plessy'', it upheld segregation that Southern states enforced in nearly every other sphere of public and private life.
The Court soon extended ''Plessy'' to uphold segregated schools.  In ''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'', {{ussc|211|45|1908}}, the Court upheld a Kentucky statute that barred Berea College, a private institution, from teaching both black and white students in an integrated setting. Many states, particularly in the South, took ''Plessy'' and ''Berea'' as blanket approval for restrictive laws, generally known as ''[[Jim Crow laws]]'', that created second-class status for African Americans.

In many cities and towns, African Americans were not allowed to share a [[taxicab|taxi]] with whites or enter a building through the same entrance. They had to drink from separate water fountains, use separate restrooms, attend separate schools, be buried in separate cemeteries and swear on separate [[Bible]]s. They were excluded from restaurants and public libraries. Many parks barred them with signs that read "Negroes and dogs not allowed." One municipal zoo listed separate visiting hours.

The etiquette of racial segregation was harsher, particularly in the South. African Americans were expected to step aside to let a white person pass, and black men dared not look any white woman in the eye. Black men and women were addressed as "Tom" or "Jane", but rarely as "Mr." or "Miss" or "Mrs," titles then widely in use for adults. Whites referred to black men of any age as "boy" and a black woman as "girl"; both often were called by labels such as "[[Nigger (word)|nigger]]" or "colored."

Less formal social segregation in the North began to yield to change.  In 1941, however, the [[United States Naval Academy]], based in segregated Maryland, [[1941 Harvard–Navy lacrosse game|refused to play]] a [[lacrosse]] game against [[Harvard University]] because Harvard's team included a black player.

===Jackie Robinson's Major League Baseball debut, 1947===
[[Jackie Robinson]] was a sports pioneer of the civil rights movement, best known for becoming the first African American to play professional sports in the major leagues. 
Robinson debuted with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] on April 15, 1947. His first major league game came one year before the [[US Army]] was integrated, seven years before ''Brown v. Board of Education'', eight years before [[Rosa Parks]], and before [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was leading the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dorinson, and Joram Warmund, ''Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports and the American Dream'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political opposition==

===Lily-white movement===
{{Main article|Lily-white movement}}
Following the Civil War, black leaders made substantial progress in establishing representation in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].

Among the most prominent was [[Norris Wright Cuney]], the Republican Party chairman in late 19th century [[Texas Republican Party|Texas]]. These gains led to substantial discomfort among many white voters, who generally supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. During the 1888 Texas Republican Convention, Cuney coined the term ''lily-white movement'' to describe efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of party leadership and incite riots to divide the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Myrdal, Gunnar |author2=Bok, Sissela | title=An American dilemma: the Negro problem and modern democracy | publisher=Transaction Publishers  | year=1995 | page=478 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuAEokAx2G4C|isbn=9781412815109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly organized efforts by this movement gradually eliminated black leaders from the party. The writer Michael Fauntroy contends that the effort was coordinated with Democrats as part of a larger movement toward [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of blacks in the South at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century by increasing restrictions in voter registration rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Republicans and the Black Vote | author=Fauntroy, Michael K. | year=2007 | publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers | page=43 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyuHAAAAMAAJ | quote="... lily whites worked with Democrats to disenfranchise African Americans."| isbn=9781588264701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following biracial victories by a Populist-Republican slates in several states, by the late 19th century the Democratic Party had regained control of most state legislatures in the South. From 1890 to 1908, they accomplished disenfranchisement of blacks and, in some states, many poor whites. Despite repeated legal challenges and some successes by the NAACP, the Democrats continued to devise new ways to limit black electoral participation, such as [[white primaries]], through the 1960s.

Nationally, the Republican Party tried to respond to black interests. [[Theodore Roosevelt]], president 1901–1909, had a mixed record on race relations. He relied extensively on the backstage advice of [[Booker T. Washington]] regarding patronage appointments across the South. He publicly invited Washington to dinner at the White House, thereby challenging racist attitudes. On the other hand, he began the system of segregating federal employees; and he cracked down on black soldiers who refused to testify against each other in the [[Brownsville Affair]] of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Adam D. Burns, "President Roosevelt, African Americans and the South" in Serge Ricard, ed., ''A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt'' (2011) pp 198-215.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to defeat his successor William Howard Taft for the Republican nomination in 1912, Roosevelt pursued a Lily-white policy in the South. This new progressive party of 1912 was supportive of black rights in the North, but excluded all black members in the South.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Mowry, "The South and the Progressive Lily White Party of 1912." ''Journal of Southern History'' 6.2 (1940): 237-247. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2191208 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans in Congress repeatedly proposed federal legislation to prohibit [[lynching]], which was always defeated by the Southern block. In 1920 Republicans made opposition to [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] part of their platform at the Republican National Convention. Lynchings, primarily of black men in the South, had increased in the decades around the turn of the 20th century. [[Leonidas C. Dyer]], a white Republican Representative from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], worked with the NAACP to introduce an anti-lynching bill into the House, where he gained strong passage in 1922. His effort was defeated by the Southern Democratic block in the Senate, which [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibustered]] the bill that year, and in 1923 and 1924.

===Disenfranchisement===
{{Main article|Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era}}
Opponents of black civil rights used economic reprisals and frequently violence at the polls in the 1870s and 1880s to discourage blacks from registering to vote or voting.  Paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts in Mississippi and the Carolinas, and the White League in Louisiana, practiced open intimidation on behalf of the Democratic Party. By the turn of the 20th century, white Democratic-dominated Southern legislatures [[disfranchisement after the Civil War|disfranchised]] nearly all age-eligible African-American voters through a combination of statute and constitutional provisions.  While requirements applied to all citizens, in practice, they were targeted at blacks and poor whites (and Mexican Americans in Texas), and subjectively administered. The feature "Turnout in Presidential and Midterm Elections" at the following University of Texas website devoted to politics, shows the drastic drop in voting as these provisions took effect in Southern states compared to the rest of the US, and the longevity of the measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mississippi]] passed a new constitution in 1890 that included provisions for [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests]] (which depended on the arbitrary decisions of white registrars), and complicated record keeping to establish residency, which severely reduced the number of blacks who could register. It was litigated before the Supreme Court. In 1898, in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'', the Court upheld the state.  Other Southern states quickly adopted the "Mississippi plan", and from 1890 to 1908, ten states adopted new constitutions with provisions to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites. States continued to disfranchise these groups for decades, until mid-1960s federal legislation provided for oversight and enforcement of constitutional voting rights.

Blacks were most adversely affected, and in many southern states black voter turnout dropped to zero. Poor whites were also disfranchised. In Alabama, for instance, by 1941, 600,000 poor whites had been disfranchised, as well as 520,000 blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 20th century that litigation by African Americans on such provisions began to meet some success before the Supreme Court. In 1915 in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'', the Court declared  Oklahoma's '[[grandfather clause]]' to be unconstitutional. Although the decision affected all states that used the grandfather clause, state legislatures quickly employed new devices to continue disfranchisement. Each provision or statute had to be litigated separately. The [[NAACP]], founded in 1909, litigated against many such provisions.

One device which the Democratic Party began to use more widely in Southern states in the early 20th century was the [[white primary]], which served for decades to disfranchise the few blacks who managed to get past barriers of voter registration. Barring blacks from voting in the Democratic Party primaries meant they had no chance to vote in the only competitive contests, as the Republican Party was then weak in the South. White primaries were not struck down by the Supreme Court until ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' in 1944.

==Criminal law and lynching==
[[File:Convicts (1903).jpg|thumb|Juvenile African-American convicts working in the fields in a chain gang, photo taken c. 1903]]

In 1880, the United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'', {{ussc|100|303|1880}} that African Americans could not be excluded from juries.  But, beginning in 1890 with new state constitutions and electoral laws, the South effectively disfranchised blacks in the South, which routinely disqualified them for jury duty which was limited to voters. This left them at the mercy of a white justice system arrayed against them. In some states, particularly [[Alabama]], the state used the criminal justice system to reestablish a form of [[peonage]], through the convict-lease system.  The state sentenced black males to years of imprisonment, which they spent working without pay. The state leased prisoners to private employers, such as [[Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company]], a subsidiary of [[United States Steel Corporation]], which paid the state for their labor.  Because the state made money, the system created incentives for the jailing of more men, who were disproportionately black. It also created a system in which treatment of prisoners received little oversight.

Extrajudicial punishment was more brutal. During the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century, white vigilante mobs [[lynched]] thousands of black males, sometimes with the overt assistance of state officials, mostly within the South.  No whites were charged with crimes in any of those murders. Whites were so confident of their immunity from prosecution for lynching that they not only photographed the victims, but made postcards out of the pictures.

The [[Ku Klux Klan]], which had largely disappeared after a brief violent career in the early years of Reconstruction, reappeared in 1915.  It grew mostly in industrializing cities of the South and Midwest that underwent the most rapid growth from 1910 to 1930.  Social instability contributed to racial tensions that resulted from severe competition for jobs and housing. People joined KKK groups because they were anxious about their place in American society, as cities were rapidly changed by a combination of industrialization, migration of blacks and whites from the rural South, and waves of increased immigration from mostly rural [[Southern Europe|southern]] and [[eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915–1930'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1967; reprint, Chicago: Elephant Paperback, 1992, pp.242–243&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the KKK presented itself as another fraternal organization devoted to betterment of its members. The KKK's revival was inspired in part by the movie ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', which glorified the earlier Klan and dramatized the racist stereotypes concerning blacks of that era. The Klan focused on political mobilization, which allowed it to gain power in states such as [[Indiana]], on a platform that combined [[racism]] with anti-immigrant, [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] and anti-union rhetoric, but also supported lynching. It reached its peak of membership and influence about 1925, declining rapidly afterward as opponents mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915–1930'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1967; reprint, Chicago: Elephant Paperback, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans repeatedly introduced bills in the House to make [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] a federal crime, but they were defeated by the Southern block.  In 1920 the Republicans made an anti-lynching bill part of their platform and achieved passage in the House by a wide margin.  Southern Democrats in the Senate repeatedly filibustered the bill to prevent a vote, and defeated it in the 1922, 1923 and 1924 sessions as they held the rest of the legislative program hostage.

==Farmers and blue-collar workers==
White society also kept blacks in a position of economic subservience or marginality. Most black farmers in the South by the early 20th century worked as sharecroppers or tenant farmers.  Relatively few were landowners.

Employers and labor unions generally restricted African Americans to the worst paid and least desirable jobs. Because of the lack of steady, well-paid jobs, relatively undistinguished positions, such as those with the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters|Pullman Porter]] or as hotel doorman, became prestigious positions in black communities in the North.  The expansion of railroads meant that they recruited in the South for laborers, and tens of thousands of blacks moved North to work with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], for example, during the period of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].

==The golden age of black entrepreneurship==

The nadir of race relations was reached in the early 20th century, in terms of political and legal rights. Blacks were increasingly segregated. Cut off from the larger white community, however, black entrepreneurs succeeded in establishing flourishing businesses that catered to a black clientele, including professionals. In urban areas, north and south, the size and income of the black population was growing, providing openings for a wide range of businesses, from barbershops &lt;ref&gt;Quincy T. Mills, ''Cutting along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America'' (2013) [https://www.questia.com/library/120086708/cutting-along-the-color-line-black-barbers-and-barber online]&lt;/ref&gt;  to insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Weems, Jr., ''Black Business in the Black Metropolis: The Chicago Metropolitan Assurance Company, 1925–1985'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Undertakers had a special niche in their communities, and often played a political role, as they were widely known and knew many of their constituents.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Boyd, "Black undertakers in northern cities during the great migration: The rise of an entrepreneurial occupation." ''Sociological Focus'' 31.3 (1998): 249-263.

Historian Juliet Walker calls 1900–1930 the "Golden age of black business." &lt;ref&gt;Juliet E.K. Walker, ''The History of Black Business in America: Capitalism, Race, Entrepreneurship'' (2009) p 183.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Negro Business League, the number black-owned businesses doubled rapidly, from 20,000 in 1900 to 40,000 in 1914. There were 450 undertakers in 1900, rising to 1000 in this time period. The number of black-owned drugstores rose from 250 to 695. Local retail merchants – most of them quite small – jumped from 10,000 to 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier, "Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T. Washington."

Washington'', University of Michigan Press (1963/2nd edition 1966), p 140.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous entrepreneurs was [[Madame C.J. Walker]] (1867–1919), who built a national franchise business called [[Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company]], based on her development of the first successful hair straightening process.&lt;ref&gt;A'Lelia Bundles, ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J.

[[Booker T. Washington]], who ran the [[National Negro Business League]] and was president of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], was the most prominent promoter of black business. He traveled from city to city to sign up local entrepreneurs into the national league.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Boston, ''The Business Strategy of Booker T.

[[Charles Clinton Spaulding]] (1874–1952), an ally of Washington, was the most prominent black American business leader of his day. Behind the scenes he was an advisor to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the 1930s, with the goal of promoting a black political leadership class. He founded [[North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company]], which became America's largest black-owned business, with assets of over $40 million at his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =William S. Powell|title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography: Vol. 5, P-S|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeSDB5tKDagC&amp;pg=PA408|year=2000|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|pages=408–9|isbn=9780807867006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although black business flourished in urban areas, it was severely handicapped in the rural South where the great majority of blacks lived. Blacks were farmers who depended on  one cash crop, typically cotton or tobacco. They chiefly traded with local white merchants. The primary reason was that the local country stores provided credit, that is the provided supplies the farm and family needed, including tools, seeds, food and clothing, on a credit basis until the bill was paid off at harvest time. Black businessmen had too little access to credit to enter this business.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline P. Bull, "The General Merchant in the Economic History of the New South."

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1234631 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, there were only a small number of wealthy blacks; overwhelmingly they were real estate speculators in the fast-growing cities, typified by  [[Robert Reed Church|Robert Church]] in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Meier, ''Negro thought in America, 1880–1915'' p 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor =Jessie Carney Smith |title=Encyclopedia of African American Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VYN_LWZwf4C&amp;pg=PA164|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|pages=164–67|isbn=9780313331107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division of Negro Affairs in the Department of Commerce===
Minority entrepreneurship entered the national agenda in 1927 when Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] set up a Division of Negro Affairs to provide advice, and disseminate information to both white and black businessmen on how to reach the black consumer. Entrepreneurship was not on the [[New Deal]] agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, when he turned to war preparation in 1940, he used this agency to help black business secure defense contracts. Black businesses had not been oriented toward manufacturing, and generally were too small to secure any major contracts. President Eisenhower disbanded the agency in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Weems Jr., ''Business in Black and White: American Presidents and Black Entrepreneurs'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive Orders for non-discriminatory hiring by defense contractors==
President Roosevelt issued two Executive Orders directing defense contractors to hire, promote and fire without regard for racial discrimination. In areas such as West Coast shipyards and other industries, blacks began to gain more of the skilled and higher-paying jobs and supervisory positions.

==Church growth==
This period saw the maturing of independent black churches, whose leaders were usually also strong community leaders. Blacks had left white churches and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] to set up their own churches free of white supervision immediately during and after the [[American Civil War]]. With the help of northern associations, they quickly began to set up state conventions and, by 1895, joined several associations into the black [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]], the first of that denomination among blacks. In addition, independent black denominations, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and [[AME Zion Church]], had made hundreds of thousands of converts in the South, founding AME churches across the region. The churches were centers of community activity, especially organizing for education.

==Educational growth==
Continuing to see education as the primary route of advancement and critical for the race, many talented blacks went into teaching, which had high respect as a profession.  Segregated schools for blacks were underfunded in the South and ran on shortened schedules in rural areas. Despite segregation, in Washington, DC by contrast, as Federal employees, black and white teachers were paid on the same scale. Outstanding black teachers in the North received advanced degrees and taught in highly regarded schools, which trained the next generation of leaders in cities such as Chicago, Washington, and New York, whose black populations had increased in the 20th century due to the Great Migration.

Education was one of the major achievements of the black community in the 19th century. Blacks in Reconstruction governments had supported the establishment of public education in every Southern state. Despite the difficulties, with the enormous eagerness of [[freedmen]] for education, by 1900 the African-American community had trained and put to work 30,000 African-American teachers in the South.  In addition, a majority of the black population had achieved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Anderson, ''Black Education in the South, 1860–1935'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1988, pp.244–245&lt;/ref&gt; Not all the teachers had a full 4-year college degree in those years, but the shorter terms of normal schools were part of the system of teacher training in both the North and the South to serve the many new communities across the frontier. African-American teachers got many children and adults started on education.

Northern alliances had helped fund normal schools and colleges to teach African-American teachers, as well as create other professional classes. The [[American Missionary Association]], supported largely by the [[Congregational]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches, had helped fund and staff numerous private schools and colleges in the South, who collaborated with black communities to train generations of teachers and other leaders.  Major 20th-century industrialists, such as [[George Eastman]] of [[Rochester, New York]], acted as [[philanthropists]] and made substantial donations to black educational institutions such as Tuskegee Institute.

In 1862, the US Congress passed the [[Morrill Act]], which established federal funding of a [[land grant college]] in each state, but 17 states refused to admit black students to their land grant colleges.  In response, Congress enacted the second Morrill Act of 1890, which required states that excluded blacks from their existing land grant colleges to open separate institutions and to equitably divide the funds between the schools.  The colleges founded in response to the second Morill Act became today's public [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs) and, together with the private HBCUs and the unsegregated colleges in the North and West, provided higher educational opportunities to African Americans. Federally funded [[cooperative extension|extension]] agents from the land grant colleges spread knowledge about scientific agriculture and home economics to rural communities with agents from the HBCUs focusing on black farmers and families.

In the 19th century, blacks formed fraternal organizations across the South and the North, including an increasing number of women's clubs. They created and supported institutions that increased education, health and welfare for black communities. After the turn of the 20th century, black men and women also began to found their own college fraternities and sororities to create additional networks for lifelong service and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] the first black intercollegiate fraternity was founded at [[Cornell University]] in 1906. Wesley, Charles H. (1950). ''The History of Alpha Phi Alpha: A Development in Negro College Life'' (6th ed.). Chicago, IL: Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; These were part of the new organizations that strengthened independent community life under segregation.

Tuskegee took the lead in spreading industrial education to Africa, typically in cooperation with church missionary efforts.&lt;ref&gt;
Andrew E. Barnes, Global Christianity and the Black Atlantic: Tuskegee, Colonialism, and the Shaping of African Industrial Education'' (Baylor University Press, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Black church==
As the center of community life, Black churches were integral leaders and organizers in the [[civil rights movement]]. Their history as a focal point for the Black community and as a link between the Black and White worlds made them natural for this purpose. Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was but one of many notable Black ministers involved in the movement. [[Ralph David Abernathy]], [[Bernard Lee (civil rights movement)|Bernard Lee]], [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], and [[C.T. Vivian]] are among the many notable minister-activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights/players.htm |title=We Shall Overcome: The Players |accessdate=2007-05-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607180155/http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights/players.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were especially important during the later years of the movement in the 1950s and 1960s.

==The Niagara Movement and the founding of the NAACP==
At the turn of the 20th century, [[Booker T. Washington]] was regarded, particularly by the white community, as the foremost spokesman for African Americans in the US. Washington, who led the [[Tuskegee Institute]], preached a message of self-reliance.  He urged blacks to concentrate on improving their economic position rather than demanding social equality until they had proved that they "deserved" it. Publicly, he  accepted the continuation of Jim Crow and segregation in the short term, but privately helped to fund national court cases that challenged the laws.

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and others in the black community rejected Washington's apology for segregation. One of his close associates, [[William Monroe Trotter]], was arrested after challenging Washington when he came to deliver a speech in [[Boston]] in 1905. Later that year Du Bois and Trotter convened a meeting of black activists on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.  They issued a manifesto calling for universal manhood suffrage, elimination of all forms of racial segregation and extension of education—not limited to the vocational education that Washington emphasized—on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The [[Niagara Movement]] was actively opposed by Washington, and had effectively collapsed due to internal divisions by 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott M. Rudwick, "The Niagara Movement." ''Journal of Negro History'' 42#3 (1957): 177-200. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2715936 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Bois joined with other black leaders and white activists, such as [[Mary White Ovington]], [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], [[William English Walling]], [[Henry Moskowitz (civil rights leader)|Henry Moskowitz]], Julius Rosenthal, [[Lillian Wald]], Rabbi [[Emil G. Hirsch]], and [[Stephen Wise]] to create the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909. Du Bois also became editor of its magazine ''[[The Crisis]]''. In its early years, the NAACP concentrated on using the courts to attack Jim Crow laws and disfranchising constitutional provisions.  It successfully challenged the [[Louisville, Kentucky]] ordinance that required [[residential segregation]] in ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'', {{ussc|245|60|1917}}.  It also gained a Supreme Court ruling striking down Oklahoma's ''[[grandfather clause]]'' that exempted most illiterate white voters from a law that disfranchised African-American citizens in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;Benno C. Schmidt, "Principle and prejudice: The Supreme Court and race in the progressive era. Part 3: Black disfranchisement from the KKK to the grandfather clause." ''Columbia Law Review'' 82#5 (1982): 835-905. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1122210 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Segregation in the federal civil service began under President Theodore Roosevelt, and continued under President Taft. President Wilson allowed his cabinet to escalate the process, ignoring complaints by the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier  and Elliott Rudwick. "The Rise of Segregation in the Federal Bureaucracy, 1900–1930." ''Phylon'' (1960) 28.2 (1967): 178-184. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/273560 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAACP lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I. It was arranged for Du Bois to receive an Army commission, but he failed his physical.  In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D.W. Griffith's film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan.  Boston and a few other cities refused to allow the film to open.

==The American Jewish community and the civil rights movement==
Many from the [[American Jews|American Jewish community]] tacitly or actively supported the civil rights movement.  Several of the co-founders of the NAACP were Jewish.  In the latter part of the 20th century, many of its white members and leading activists came from within the Jewish community.

Jewish [[philanthropy|philanthropists]] actively supported the NAACP and various civil rights group, and schools for African Americans. The Jewish philanthropist [[Julius Rosenwald]] supported the construction of thousands of primary and secondary schools for black youth in the rural South; the public school system was segregated and black facilities were historically underfunded.  In partnership with [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[Tuskegee University]], Rosenwald created a matching fund which provided seed money for building. Tuskegee Institute architects created model school plans. Black communities essentially taxed themselves twice to raise funds for such schools, which required community matching funds. Often most of the residents in rural areas were blacks. Public funds were committed for the schools, and blacks raised additional funds by community events, donating land and labor, and sometimes by members' getting second mortgages on their homes. Hoping to encourage collaboration, Rosenwald required the white school systems to support the schools by approving them. At one time some forty percent of rural southern blacks were learning at Rosenwald elementary schools; nearly 5,000 were built in total.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Anderson, ''Black Education in the South, 1860–1935'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenwald also contributed to HBCUs such as [[Howard University|Howard]], [[Dillard University|Dillard]] and [[Fisk University|Fisk]] universities.

The [[PBS]] television show ''From Swastika to Jim Crow'' discussed Jewish involvement in the civil rights movement.  It recounted that Jewish scholars fleeing from or surviving the [[Holocaust]] of [[World War II]] came to teach at many Southern schools, where they reached out to black students:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, in the 1930s and 1940s when Jewish refugee professors arrived at [[Historically Black colleges and universities|Southern Black Colleges]], there was a history of overt empathy between Blacks and Jews, and the possibility of truly effective collaboration. Professor [[Ernst Borinski]] organized dinners at which Blacks and Whites would have to sit next to each other—a simple yet revolutionary act. Black students empathized with the cruelty these scholars had endured in Europe and trusted them more than other Whites. In fact, often Black students—as well as members of the Southern White community—saw these refugees as "some kind of colored folk."&lt;ref&gt;PBS website ''From Swastika to Jim Crow''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After World War II particularly, the [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Jewish Congress]], and [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) became active in promoting civil rights.

=="The New Negro"==
The experience of fighting in [[World War I]] along with exposure to different racial attitudes in Europe influenced the black veterans by creating a widespread demand for the freedoms and equality for which they had fought. Those veterans found conditions at home as bad as ever. Some were assaulted even while wearing their uniforms in public.&lt;ref name=doublevee&gt;{{cite book|author =Rawn James, Jr.|title=The Double V: How Wars, Protest, and Harry Truman Desegregated America's Military|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uW4nx6pLEoUC|accessdate=16 May 2013|date=22 January 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-60819-617-3|pages=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generation responded with a far more militant spirit than the generation before, urging blacks to fight back when whites attacked them. [[A. Philip Randolph]] introduced the term the "[[New Negro]]" in 1917; it became the catchphrase to describe the new spirit of militancy and impatience of the post-war era.

A group known as the [[African Blood Brotherhood]], a socialist group with a large number of Caribbean émigrés in its leadership, organized around 1920 to demand the same sort of self-determination for black Americans that the Wilson administration was promising to [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples at the [[Versailles conference]] in the aftermath of World War I. The leaders of the Brotherhood, many of whom joined the Communist Party in the years to come, were also inspired by the anti-imperialist program of the new [[Soviet Union]].

In addition, during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], hundreds of thousands of African Americans moved to northern and midwestern industrial cities starting before World War I and through 1940.  Another wave of migration during and after World War II led many to West Coast cities, as well as more in the North and Midwest.  They were both fleeing violence and segregation and seeking jobs, as manpower shortages in war industries promised steady work.  Continued depressed conditions in the farm economy of the South in the 1920s made the north look more appealing. Those expanding northern communities confronted familiar problems—racism, poverty, police abuse and official hostility—but these were in a new setting, where the men could vote (and women, too, after 1920), and possibilities for political action were far broader than in the South.

==Marcus Garvey and the UNIA==
[[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] made great strides in organizing in these new communities in the North, and among the internationalist-minded "[[New Negro]]" movement in the early 1920s. Garvey's program pointed in the opposite direction from mainstream civil rights organizations such as the NAACP; instead of striving for integration into white-dominated society, Garvey's program of [[Pan Africanism]] has become known as [[Garveyism]]. It encourages economic independence within the system of [[racial segregation]] in the United States, an African Orthodox Church with a black Jesus and black Virgin Mother that offered an alternative to the white [[Jesus]] of the black church, and a campaign that urged [[African Americans]] to "return to Africa", if not physically, at least in spirit. Garvey attracted thousands of supporters, both in the United States and in the African diaspora in the [[Caribbean]], and claimed eleven million members for the UNIA, which was broadly popular in Northern black communities.

Garvey's movement was a contradictory mix of defeatism, accommodation and separatism: he married themes of self-reliance that [[Booker T. Washington]] could have endorsed and the "[[gospel of success]]" so popular in white America in the 1920s with a rejection of [[colonialism]] worldwide and rejection of racial inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;from [[PBS]] "American Experience", "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/garvey/peopleevents/p_garvey.html People &amp; Events: Marcus Garvey, 1887–1940]" The Marcus Garvey and U.N.I.A. Papers Project, [[UCLA]].&lt;/ref&gt; The movement at first attracted many of the foreign-born radicals also associated with the [[Socialist]] and [[African Blood Brotherhood|Communist parties]], but drove many of them away when Garvey began to suspect them of challenging his control.

The movement collapsed nearly as quickly as it blossomed, as the federal government convicted Garvey for mail fraud in 1922 in connection with the movement's financially troubled "[[Black Star Line]]". The government commuted Garvey's sentence and deported Garvey to his native [[Jamaica]] in 1927. While the movement floundered without him, it inspired other self-help and separatist movements that followed, including [[Father Divine]] and the [[Nation of Islam]].

==The Labor movement and civil rights==
The labor movement, with some exceptions, had historically excluded African Americans. While the radical labor organizers who led organizing drives among packinghouse workers in Chicago and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] during [[World War I]] and the steel industry in [[Steel strike of 1919|1919]] made determined efforts to appeal to black workers, they were not able to overcome the widespread distrust of the labor movement among black workers in the North. With the ultimate defeat of both of those organizing drives, the black community and the labor movement largely returned to their traditional mutual mistrust.

Left-wing political activists in the labor movement made some progress in the 1920s and 1930s, however, in bridging that gap. A. Phillip Randolph, a long-time member of the [[Socialist Party of America]], took the leadership of the fledgling Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters at its founding in 1925. Randolph and the union faced opposition not only from the Pullman Company, but from the press and churches within the black community, many of whom were the beneficiaries of financial support from the company. The union eventually won over many of its critics in the black community by wedding its organizing program with the larger goal of black empowerment. The union won recognition from the Pullman Company in 1935 after a ten-year campaign, and a union contract in 1937.

The BSCP became the only black-led union within the [[American Federation of Labor]] in 1935. Randolph chose to remain within the AFL when the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] split from it. The CIO was much more committed to organizing African-American workers and made strenuous efforts to persuade the BSCP to join it, but Randolph believed more could be done to advance black workers' rights, particularly in the railway industry, by remaining in the AFL, to which the other railway brotherhoods belonged. Randolph remained the voice for black workers within the labor movement, raising demands for elimination of Jim Crow unions within the AFL at every opportunity. BSCP members such as [[Edgar Nixon]] played a significant role in the civil rights struggles of the following decades.

Many of the CIO unions, in particular the Packinghouse Workers, the [[United Auto Workers]] and the [[Western Federation of Miners|Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers]] made advocacy of civil rights part of their organizing strategy and bargaining priorities: they gained improvements for workers in meatpacking in Chicago and Omaha, and in the steel and related industries throughout the Midwest. The [[Transport Workers Union of America]], which had strong ties with the Communist Party at the time, entered into coalitions with [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], the NAACP and the [[National Negro Congress]] to attack employment discrimination in public transit in New York City in the early 1940s.

The CIO was particularly vocal in calling for elimination of racial discrimination by defense industries during [[World War II]]; they were also forced to combat racism within their own membership, putting down strikes by white workers who refused to work with black co-workers. While many of these "hate strikes" were short-lived: a wildcat strike launched in [[Philadelphia]] in 1944 when the federal government ordered the private transit company to desegregate its workforce lasted two weeks and was ended only when the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration sent troops to guard the system and arrested the strike's ringleaders.

Randolph and the BSCP took the battle against employment discrimination even further, threatening a March on Washington in 1942 if the government did not take steps to outlaw racial discrimination by [[defense contractor]]s. Randolph limited the March on Washington Movement to black organizations to maintain black leadership; he endured harsh criticism from others on the left for his insistence on black workers' rights in the middle of a war. Randolph only dropped the plan to march after winning substantial concessions from the Roosevelt administration.

==The Left and civil rights==
''See'' [[The Communist Party and African-Americans]].

==The Scottsboro Boys==
In 1931, the NAACP and the [[Communist Party USA]] also organized support for the "[[Scottsboro Boys]]", nine black men arrested after a fight with some white men also riding the rails, then convicted and sentenced to death for allegedly raping two white women dressed in men's clothes later found on the same train. The NAACP and the CP fought over the control of those cases and the strategy to be pursued; the CP and its arm the [[International Labor Defense]] largely prevailed. The ILD's legal campaign produced two significant Supreme Court decisions (''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' and ''Norris v. Alabama'') extending the rights of defendants; its political campaign saved all the defendants from the death sentence and ultimately led to freedom for most of them.

The Scottsboro defense was only one of the ILD's many cases in the South; for a period in the early and mid-1930s, the ILD was the most active defender of blacks' civil rights, and the Communist Party attracted many members among activist African Americans. Its campaigns for black defendants' rights did much to focus national attention on the extreme conditions which black defendants faced in the criminal justice system throughout the South.

==The NAACP==

The [[NAACP]] operated primarily at the local level, providing as forum that brought black religious, professional and business elites in most large cities. Baltimore was a pioneer in battling for issues that dominated the agendas of the post-World War II civil rights and Black Power movements. Baltimore activists were protest pioneers during the 1930s and 1940s. They organized in the city city to fight against housing discrimination, school segregation, prison conditions, and police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Sartain, ''Borders of Equality: The NAACP and the Baltimore Civil Rights Struggle, 1914–1970'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAACP devoted much of its energy between the first and second world wars to mobilizing a crusade against the lynching of blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Zangrando, ''The NAACP Crusade against Lynching, 1909–1950'' (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; It investigated the serious race riots in numerous major industrial cities throughout the United States in what was called the "[[Red Summer of 1919]]," catalyzed by postwar economic and social tensions. These were white on black attacks, but that summer, blacks began to fight back, in Chicago and other cities.

The organization sent [[Walter F. White]], who later became its general secretary, to [[Phillips County, Arkansas]] in October 1919 to investigate the [[Elaine Race Riot]]. In that year, it was unusual for being a rural riot: more than 200 black tenant farmers were killed for trying to organize a union. They were murdered by roving white [[vigilantes]] and federal troops after a deputy sheriff's attack on a union meeting of [[sharecroppers]] left one white man dead. The NAACP organized the appeals for twelve men sentenced to death a month later, based on their testimony having been obtained by beating and electric shocks.

The NAACP worked for more than a decade seeking federal anti-lynching legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Zangrando, "The NAACP and a Federal Antilynching Bill, 1934–1940." ''Journal of Negro History'' 50#2 (1965): 106-117. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2715996 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Its offices in New York City regularly displayed a black flag out the window - stating "A Man Was Lynched Yesterday" - to mark each outrage. Efforts to pass an anti-lynching law foundered on the power of the [[Solid South]]; Southern Democrats in the Senate controlled power in Congress.  For instance, while Republicans achieved passage in the House of an anti-lynching law in 1922, Southern Democratic senators filibustered the bill in the Senate and defeated it in the 1922, 1923 and 1924 legislative sessions.  Because positions were awarded by seniority and the South was a one-party region, its Democratic congressmen controlled important chairmanships in both houses of Congress. The South defeated all anti-lynching legislative bills.

The NAACP led the successful fight, in alliance with the [[American Federation of Labor]], to prevent the nomination of [[John Parker (judge)|John Johnston Parker]] to the Supreme Court.  They opposed him because of his opposition to black suffrage and his anti-labor rulings. This alliance and lobbying campaign were important for the NAACP, both in demonstrating the NAACP's ability to mobilize widespread opposition to racism and as a first step toward building political alliances with the labor movement.

[[Elbert Williams]] of [[Brownsville, Tennessee]], is believed to be the first NAACP member lynched for his civil rights activities, killed on June 20, 1940.&lt;ref name="neu"&gt;[http://nuweb9.neu.edu/civilrights/elbert-williams/ "Elbert Williams"], Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Clinic, Northeastern University School of Law, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blackpast"/&gt; He had been part of an NAACP effort in 1940 to register black voters in his city for that year's presidential election. Whites targeted other NAACP members, threatening them, and ran several families out of town who feared for their safety.&lt;ref name="neu"/&gt; In 2015 the Tennessee Historical Commission approved a marker commemorating Elbert Williams in Brownsville.&lt;ref name="blackpast"&gt;[http://www.blackpast.org/aah/williams-elbert-1908-1940 Jim Emison, "Williams, Elbert (1908–1940)"], Black Past website&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], African-American veterans returning to the South were spurred by their sacrifices and experiences to renew demands for the protection and exercise of their constitutional rights as citizens in US society. One serviceman reportedly said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I spent four years in the Army to free a bunch of Dutchmen and Frenchmen, and I'm hanged if I'm going to let the Alabama version of the Germans kick me around when I get home. No sirree-bob! I went into the Army a nigger; I'm comin' out a man.&lt;ref name="USNews p2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From 1940 to 1946, the NAACP's membership grew from 50,000 to 450,000.&lt;ref name="USNews p2"&gt;Ewers, Justin (March 22, 2004). [https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040322/22history_2.htm "'Separate but equal' was the law of the land, until one decision brought it crashing down"] (page 2). ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAACP's legal department, headed by [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]], undertook a litigation campaign spanning several decades to bring about the reversal of the "separate but equal" doctrine established in the Supreme Court's decision in ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' (1896). Instead of appealing to the legislative or executive branches of government, they focused on challenges through the courts. They knew that Congress was dominated by Southern segregationists, while the Presidency could not afford to lose the Southern vote.&lt;ref name="USNews p2"/&gt; The NAACP's first cases did not challenge the principle directly, but sought instead to establish factually that the state's segregated facilities in transportation, public education and parks, for instance, were not equal. These were typically underfunded, with outdated textbooks and facilities. Such cases helped lay the foundation for the ultimate reversal of the doctrine in ''Plessy v. Ferguson''.

Marshall believed that the time had come to do away with "separate but equal". The NAACP issued a directive stating that their goal was now "obtaining education on a nonsegregated basis and that no relief other than that will be acceptable." The first case that Marshall argued on this basis was ''[[Briggs v. Elliott]]'', but the NAACP also filed challenges to segregated education in other states. In [[Topeka, Kansas]], the local NAACP branch determined that [[Oliver Brown (civil rights)|Oliver Brown]] would be a good candidate for filing a lawsuit; he was an assistant pastor and the father of three girls. The NAACP instructed him to apply to enroll his daughters at a local white school; after the expected rejection, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' was filed. Later, this and several other cases made their way to the Supreme Court, where they were consolidated under the title of ''Brown''.  The decision to name the case after one originating in Kansas was apparently made "so that the whole question would not smack of being a purely southern one."&lt;ref name="USNews p2"/&gt;

Some in the NAACP thought Marshall was moving too quickly. They feared that the Southern judge, Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]], who would almost certainly oppose overruling ''Plessy'', could destroy their case. One historian stated: "There was a sense that if you do this and you lose, you're going to enshrine Plessy for a generation." A government lawyer involved in the case agreed that it was "a mistake to push for the overruling of segregation per se so long as Vinson was chief justice—it was too early." In December 1952, the Supreme Court heard the case, but could not come to a decision. Unusually, they pushed the case back by a year, to allow the lawyers involved to research the intention of the framers who drafted the [[equal protection clause]] of the 14th Amendment. In September 1953, Vinson died due to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] said: "This is the first indication I have ever had that there is a God." Vinson was succeeded as chief justice by [[Earl Warren]], who was known for his moderate views on civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ewers, Justin (March 22, 2004). [https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040322/22history_3.htm "'Separate but equal' was the law of the land, until one decision brought it crashing down"] (page 3). ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the case was reheard in December, Warren set about persuading his colleagues to reach a unanimous decision overruling ''Plessy''. Five of the other eight judges were firmly on his side. He persuaded another two by saying that the decision would not touch greatly on the original question of ''Plessy'''s legality, focusing instead on the principle of equality. Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]] was swayed after Warren suggested that a Southerner's lone dissent on this issue could be more dangerous and incendiary than the court's unanimous decision.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In May 1954, Warren announced the Court's decision, which he wrote. It said that "segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race" was unconstitutional because it deprived "the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities" and thus equal protection under the law.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Numerous Southern leaders and their constituents strongly resisted the ruling; the [[Governor of Virginia]], [[Thomas B. Stanley]], insisted he would "use every legal means at my command to continue segregated schools in Virginia," and some school districts closed down rather than integrate. One survey suggested that 13% of Florida policemen were willing to enforce the decision in ''Brown''.

Some 19 Senators and 77 members of the House of Representatives, including the entire congressional delegations of the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia, signed "[[The Southern Manifesto]]", all but two of the signatories were Southern Democrats: Republicans Joel Broyhill and Richard Poff of Virginia also promised to resist the decision by "lawful means." By the fall of 1955, Cheryl Brown started first grade at an integrated school in Topeka—the first step on the long road to eventual equality for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ewers, Justin (March 22, 2004). [https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040322/22history_4.htm "'Separate but equal' was the law of the land, until one decision brought it crashing down"] (page 4). ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional Council of Negro Leadership==
On December 28, 1951, [[T.R.M. Howard]], an entrepreneur, surgeon, fraternal leader and planter in Mississippi, founded the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL) together with other key blacks in the state. At first the RCNL, which was based in the all-black town of [[Mound Bayou]], did not directly challenge "separate but equal" policy, but worked to guarantee the "equal." It often identified inadequate schools as the primary factor responsible for the black exodus to the North. It called for equal school terms for both races, as black schools were historically underfunded. From the beginning, the RCNL also pledged an "all-out fight for unrestricted voting rights."&lt;ref name="Beito and Beito"&gt;David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, ''Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power'' (University of Illinois Press, 2009), pp.72-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCNL's most famous member was [[Medgar Evers]]. Fresh from graduation at [[Alcorn State University]] in 1952, he moved to Mound Bayou to sell insurance for Howard. Evers soon became the RCNL's program director and helped to organize a boycott of service stations that failed to provide restrooms for blacks. As part of this campaign, the RCNL distributed an estimated 20,000 bumper stickers with the slogan "Don't Buy Gas Where You Can't Use the Rest Room." Beginning in 1953, it directly challenged "separate but equal" and demanded integration of schools.&lt;ref&gt;Beito and Beito, ''Black Maverick'' pp.79-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCNL's annual meetings in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1955 attracted crowds of 10,000 or more. They featured speeches by Rep. [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William L. Dawson]] of Chicago, Rep. [[Charles Diggs]] of Michigan, Alderman [[Archibald Carey, Jr.]] of Chicago, and NAACP attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Each of these events, in the words of [[Myrlie Evers]], later Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of Medgar, constituted "a huge all-day camp meeting: a combination of pep rally, old-time revival, and Sunday church picnic." The conferences also included panels and workshops on voting rights, business ownership, and other issues. Attendance was a life-transforming experience for many future civil black leaders who became prominent in the 1960s, such as [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], [[Amzie Moore]], [[Aaron Henry]] and [[George W. Lee]].

On November 27, 1955, [[Rosa Parks]] attended one of these speeches at Dexter Avenue Church in Montgomery.  The host for this event was a then relatively unknown Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]  Parks later said that she was thinking of Till when she refused to give up her seat four days later.&lt;ref&gt;Beito and Beito, ''Black Maverick'' pp.78-79, 88-89, 107, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign pressure==
Its treatment of African Americans compromised the United States' role as a would-be world leader and champion of democracy. The world challenge from [[Communism]] – not to be confused with the actions of the [[U.S. Communist Party]] in support of ending discrimination – forced 
&lt;blockquote&gt;democracies of the West... to divest themselves of antiquated racial attitudes and practices in order to prevent further mergers of anti-imperialist revolutions and Communist revolutions. Incidents in the United States involving Negro discrimination...are given a much bigger play in the neutralist Asian press than they are in America itself.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In addition, the victory over Nazis and Fascists in World War II did much to lay the groundwork for the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Carleton, Introduction to H. D. Price, ''The Negro and Southern Politics. A Chapter of Florida History'', New York University Press, 1957; reprinted by Greenwood Press, 1973, {{ISBN|0837168244}}, pp. xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42141">'''Communication privacy management''' ('''CPM'''), originally known as '''communication boundary management''', is a systematic research theory designed to develop an evidence-based understanding of the way people make decisions about revealing and concealing private information. CPM theory suggests that individuals maintain and coordinate privacy boundaries (the limits of what they are willing to share) with various communication partners depending on the perceived benefits and costs of information disclosure. It was first developed by [[Sandra Petronio]] in 1991.

Petronio uses a boundary [[metaphor]] to explain the privacy management process. '''[[#Private boundaries|Privacy boundaries]]''' draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a [[#Rule-based management system|rule-based management system]] to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her
[[self-disclosure]]s. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A
distressing sense of "[[#Boundary turbulence|boundary turbulence]]" can arise when
clashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM:

(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.

== Background ==
Petronio's communication privacy management (CPM) theory is built on Altman's dialectical
conception of privacy as a process of opening and closing a boundary to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication Privacy Management in Electronic Commerce|last = |first = |date = 2001|journal = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altman and Taylor's [[social penetration theory]] focused on [[self-disclosure]] as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is only part of the story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called ''communication boundary management''. In 2002, she renamed it to ''communication privacy management'', underscoring private disclosure as the main thrust of the theory.

==Assumptions==
* Humans are choice-makers
* Humans are rule-makers and rule-followers
* Humans' choices and rules are based on a consideration of others as well as the self
* Relational life is characterized by change
* Contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/844725577|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=9780073534282|edition=Fifth|location=New York, NY|oclc=844725577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory elements==

=== Private information ===
[[File:CPM Basic Suppositions.png|thumb|230x230px]]
The content of concealing and revealing is private information. Petronio favored the term "private information" over the term "self-disclosure" because there are many [[caveat lector|caveats]] inherent to private information disclosure that are not present with self-disclosure.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"&gt;Petronio, S. (2002). Boundaries of Privacy: Dialectics of Disclosure. Albany, NY: SUNY Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the motivations behind sharing are many, including but not limited to: sharing a burden, righting a wrong, and influencing others.&lt;ref name="Petronio 19912"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S | year = 1991 | title = Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples | url = | journal = Communication Theory | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 311–335 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1991.tb00023.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since private information can be about yourself or others, the decision as to what is private and whom to share it with plays a part when taking the idea of boundaries into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=Alicia|last2=Derlega|first2=Valerien|last3=Morrow|first3=Jennifer|title=What is Highly Personal Information and How Is It Related to Self-Disclosure Decision-Making?|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=Aug 20, 2006|volume=23|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1080/08824090600668915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to share is ultimately left up to the process of the privacy rule management system which combines rules for coordination of information, characteristics of disclosure, and attributes of the nature of boundaries.

=== Private boundaries ===
To understand CPM theory it is important to follow the metaphor of the [[Personal boundaries|boundary]]. Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982"&gt;Petronio, S., Ellmers, N., Giles, H., Gallois, C. (1998). (Mis)communicating across boundaries: Interpersonal and intergroup considerations. Communication Research, 25, 571–595.
&lt;/ref&gt; When private information is shared, there will be a '''collective boundary'''. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a '''personal boundary'''. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).
[[File:Personal and Collective Boundaries.jpg.png|thumb|Personal and collective boundaries]]

=== Control and ownership ===
Communication privacy management theory understands information (as well as boundaries) as something that is owned, and each owner must decide whether or not they are willing to have a confidant, i.e. a co-owner, to that information. In some cases, it is preferable for the owner to have another person share the private information, though this may not be the case for the confidant. [[Concurrent estate|Co-ownership]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of information is characterized by two things: heavy responsibility and a knowledge of the rules for a particular disclosure. However, ownership can be felt to different degrees, and the understanding of disclosure rules can be different from owner to owner. Also, the act of sharing is coupled along with the realization that boundaries have expanded and that they may never return to their original state. It is the responsibility of co-owners to decide and make clear if, when, and how information can or should be shared with others.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Durham, W.T. (2008). Communication privacy management theory. In L.A. Baxter &amp; D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 309-322). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule-based management system===
[[File:Three processes.jpg.png|thumb|right]]

As the framework for understanding the decisions people make about private information, this system allows for management on the individual and collective levels through three processes: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

=== Management dialectics ===
[[File:Boundaries in a Life Span.png|thumb|224x224px]]
Petronio's understanding and argument of privacy management rests on the idea that a dialectic exists wherever the decision is made to disclose or conceal private information. Thus, costs and benefits must be weighed and consideration must be given to how such information will be owned, used, and spread.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Rierson 2009"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Reierson, J. (2009). Regulating the Privacy of Confidentiality: Grasping the Complexities through Communication Privacy Management Theory. Uncertainty, Information Management, and Disclosure Decisions: Theories and Applications. 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of [[dialectic]] that Petronio borrows from can be found in Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery's theory of [[relational dialectics]], wherein various approaches to the contradictory impulses of relational life are discussed. The theory focuses on the idea that there are not only two contradictory stances within a relationship, but that at any given moment decisions are weighed using multiple viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Baxter, Montgomery 1996"&gt;Baxter, L.A., &amp; Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating Dialogues and dialectics: New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule-based management system ==
Petronio views boundary management as a rule based process, not an individual decision. This rule-based management system allows for management on the individual and collective levels. This system depends on three privacy rule management to regulate the process of revealing and concealing private information: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

===Privacy rule characteristics===
The characteristics of privacy rules are divided into two sections, attributes and development. Privacy rule attributes refer to how people obtain rules of privacy and understand the properties of those rules.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991"&gt;Petronio, S. (1991). Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples. [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]], 1, 311–335.&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally done through social interactions where the boundaries for rules are put to the test. Rules are set in different social situations which dictate the type of disclosure that should be made, for example, the difference between disclosure at a family member's birthday party versus an office event at work. Petronio asserts that each situation will come with its own set of rules for managing privacy that are learned over time. The development of privacy rule characteristics has to do with the criteria implemented to decide if and how information will be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"&gt;Petronio, S. (2007). Translational Research Endeavors and the Practices of Communication Privacy Management. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 35, 218-222.
&lt;/ref&gt; Communication privacy management theory general lists those criteria as the following:

|''Cultural ''

|-
|''Gender''

|Privacy boundaries are sculpted differently by men and women based on socialization, which leads to difference in how rules are understood and operated in
|American women are socialized to be more disclosive than men
|-

|-
|''Motivation ''

|Owners of information can form certain bonds that lead to disclosure, or conversely the express interest in forming bonds may cause private information to be shared. Motivations for sharing can include reciprocity or self-clarification.
|If you have disclosed a great deal to me, out of reciprocity, I might be motivated to disclose to you
|-
|''Risk/benefit ratio ''
|catalyst
|Owners of private information evaluate risks relative to the benefits of disclosure or maintaining information private. 
|Our rules are influenced by our assessment of the ratio of risks to benefits of disclosing
|}
With these five criteria, personal and group privacy rules are developed, but disclosure of private information necessitates the inclusion of others within the boundary of knowledge, which demands an understanding between parties for how to coordinate ownership of knowledge.

===Boundary coordination===
An individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"/&gt; By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development.  
*'''''Boundary permeability''''' refers to the nature of the invisible divisions that keep private information from being known outside of an individual or particular group. When private information is kept with one owner, the boundaries are said to be thick because there is less possibility for information to make its way out into the public sphere. Once information is shared to one or more persons, the boundaries for that private information expand, become more permeable, and are considered ''thin''.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"/&gt;
*'''''Boundary linkage''''' has to do with how owners are connected when they build associations through a boundary. For example, doctors and patients are linked to each other in such a way that private information is passed within their boundaries constantly. These linkages can be strong or weak depending on how information was shared or whether a co-owner wanted to know or was prepared to learn a new piece of information. Case in point, the link between an organization and a spy meant to infiltrate the organization is weak because the two are not coordinated on how information will be maintained private or disclosed.&lt;ref name="Caughlin, Afifi 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caughlin | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Afifi | first2 = T.D. | year = 2004 | title = When is topic avoidance unsatisfying? Examining moderators of the association between avoidance and dissatisfaction | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 479–513 | doi=10.1093/hcr/30.4.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Boundary ownership''''' refers to the responsibilities and rights each person has over the control of the spread of information that they [[Ownership|own]]. When working to mutually create the boundary of privacy it is key for all parties to have a clear understanding of whether information should be shared, who it should be shared with, and when it should be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; A simple example of this is the planning of a surprise birthday party; all those involved in planning must agree on how the information about the party will be spread so as not to ruin the surprise. As new guests are invited, they become an owner of the information and are bound to the rules of privacy maintenance, or else the surprise could be ruined.

===Boundary turbulence===
Often, boundaries are not coordinated as well as they should be to maintain the level of privacy or exposure desired by owners – this leads to problems known as boundary turbulence. The coordination of shared boundaries is key to avoiding over-sharing. When the boundaries are unclear, owners may come into conflict with one another. [[Clear-air turbulence|Turbulence]] among co-owners is caused when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners and when the management of private information comes into conflict with the expectations each owner had,&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"/&gt; which can happen for a number of reasons.

Boundary turbulence can be caused by mistakes, such as an uninvited party overhearing private information (causing weak boundary linkage) or a disclosure an owner might make under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. Disclosure to a new party was not the intent, but, when it happens, other co-owners can feel that their expectations of maintaining boundaries have been violated.

In addition, boundary turbulence occurs when a co-owner intentionally breaks the coordinated boundary of privacy to disclose private information.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = T. D. | year = 2003 | title = Feeling caught" in stepfamilies: managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 729–755 | doi=10.1177/0265407503206002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such intentional disclosure would be a daughter revealing to a doctor that her father is indeed an active smoker when the father has told the doctor that he no longer smokes after his heart surgery. The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.

Lastly, boundary turbulence can also occur when there have not been pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, with the emergence of [[social media]] and, in particular, [[Facebook]], boundary rules had not been established. As parents began to join Facebook and [[Friending|"friend"]] their children, the children felt turbulence. There was a perception of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanter |first1=M. |last2=Robbins |first2=S. |title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent-Child Relationship Quality |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2012 |page=900 of 917 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x |volume=62|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of boundary turbulence, co-owners of information can feel that their expectations have been violated and lose trust in other co-owners. In these cases, the goal of each party is to reduce turbulence by reestablishing and coordinating boundaries.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt; It should be noted, however, that turbulence doesn't always have a negative outcome, there has been studies which show that turbulence within relationships can lead to stronger and improved relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLaren|first1=R.M.|title=Emotions, Communicative responses, and relational consequences of boundary turbulence|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=August 2013|volume=30|issue=5|pages=606–626|doi=10.1177/0265407512463997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory applications ==
Communication privacy management can be applied across different contexts, primarily include: (1) family communication, with a particular focus on parental privacy invasions, (2) online social media, (3) health, and (4) relational issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid = |volume=13 |pages=6–14|last1 = Petronio|first1 = Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (5) work environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Seumas | last2 = Weckert | first2 = John | year = 2000 | title = Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 255–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family communication===

Specific applications of CPM highlight family privacy management. Research focused on secrets and topic avoidance, such as questions of concealment to [[Stepfamily|stepfamily members]] feeling caught, and parents-adolescent conversations about sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Feeling caught' in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules|last = Afifi|first = T.D.|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0265407503206002|pmid =|volume=20|issue = 6|pages=729–755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family privacy research over the decades are also inspired specifically by the chapter of parental privacy invasion. For example, work by Hawk and his colleagues explore perceived parental invasions from the view of adolescents in reaction to such issues as control attempts, solicitation of information, and conflict outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = Petronio|first = Sandra|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid =|volume=13|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way that family communication uses CPM is with child bearing or the lack thereof; whom childless-couples choose to disclose to that they voluntarily do not want children is another way CPM has been explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durham|first1=Wesley|title=The Rules-Based Process of Revealing/Concealing the Family Planning Decisions of Voluntarily Child-Free Couples: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|journal=Communication Studies|date=May 21, 2008|volume=59|issue=2|pages=132–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy loss due to [[miscarriage]] could be a unique CPM case in the family setting as couples often manage this information jointly as they decide whether to share the miscarriage with people outside the dyad. The research found that couples frame miscarriage as a shared but distinct experience and that both members exert rights of ownership over the information. Couples' privacy rules centered on issues of social support and others' need to know about the loss. Even though couples described their privacy rules as implicitly understood, they also recalled having explicit conversations to develop rules. We discuss how the management of co-owned information can improve communication and maintain relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100015365&amp;db=ufh|title=Co-ownership of Private Information in the Miscarriage Context|last=Bute, J.

===Online social media===

Recent researchers apply CPM to investigate privacy management for online [[blog]]ging, Facebook usage and [[online dating]]. Further, there have been investigations into parental behavior that is enacted through online social media; specifically when parents 'friend' their children and the management of privacy that ensues from that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanter|first1=Maggie|last2=Robbins|first2=Stephanie|title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent–Child Relationship Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|date=October 2012|volume=62|issue=5|pages=900–917|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. Some study explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-Enhancing Behavior in Facebook|last = Fred Stutzman, Jacob Kramer-Duffield|first = |date = April 2010|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar research has been done on the perceptions of teachers' disclosures on Facebook and their impact on credibility. The relevance and valence of disclosures were compared between disclosures made in the classroom and those made on Facebook and were found to be significantly different. Students' perceptions of teacher credibility were shown to decrease as relevance of disclosures increased and as negativity increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=101487383|title=Perceptions of Teachers’ Disclosures on Facebook and their Impact on Credibility|last=Coffelt, T.

Another popular SNS Twitter was examined as well. In the research, Twitter was regarded as an onion with multiple privacy layers. The research found out that there were significant differences at the descriptive and inferential levels among the multiple dimensions of private information, including daily lives, social identity, competence, socio-economic status, and health. Private information regarding daily lives and entertainment was disclosed easily and located at the outermost layer of the disclosure onion. In contrast, health-related private information was concealed and located within the innermost layer of the disclosure onion. What's more, there were significant differences among current Twitter users, nonusers, and dropouts with regard to personality traits and privacy concerns about Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=95546c19-b61c-4971-9aaf-7eea06c2bcb6%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=90180338&amp;db=ufh|title=The roles of virtual identity discrepancy and personality traits in communication privacy management on Twitter|last=Jin, Seung|first=A Annie|date=2013|website=|publisher=New Media &amp; Society|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people especially highschool and college students are an important part of SNS users. A recent study examined college students' privacy concerns and impacts on their Twitter usage behaviors. Regression analyses concluded that Control and Boundary Rules of Private Information on Twitter significantly predict daily minutes spent on Twitter accounts. However, the same CPM variables did not predict college students' other Twitter usage behaviors (e.g., weekly inquiries and total months of using Twitter). This shows the intricate connection between students' privacy concern and their usage behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=9b8072d1-acbd-46d4-9d13-ec29624248db%40sessionmgr105&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=118972200|title=Exploring the Relationship between Privacy Concerns and Social Media Use among College Students: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|last=YANG, K.

===Health communication ===

Informed by principles of CPM, health communication research using CPM to explore health privacy issues has become a growth area. Earlier study investigated physician disclosure of medical mistakes. Recently there have been a number of studies focused on ways that privacy issues influence patient care, confidentiality and control over ownership, choices about disclosure, for instance, with stigmatized health-related illness such as [[HIV/AIDS]], about [[e-health]] information, and the [[digitization]] of healthcare.

One recent study about how [[overweight]] and [[obese]] individuals handle their personal history after they become a normal weight. The result shows that the vast majority of participants perceived more benefits from disclosing their larger identity than risks, regardless of weight-loss method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romo|first=Lynsey K|title=How Formerly Overweight and Obese Individuals Negotiate Disclosure of Their Weight Loss|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=b31b1607-b9a5-4eef-a969-8e138716da4d%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4207&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116509531&amp;db=aph|journal=Health Communication|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1145–1154|doi=10.1080/10410236.2015.1045790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using CPM, ''Celebrity Health Narratives &amp; the Public Health'' offers the "first extensive look at celebrity health sagas, this book examines the ways in which their stories become our stories, influencing public perception and framing dialog about wellness, disease and death. These private-yet-public narratives drive fund-raising, reduce stigma and influence policy. Celebrities such as [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]], [[Michael J. Fox]], and [[Christopher Reeve]]—as well as 200 others included in the study—have left a lasting legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7971-9|title=McFarland - a leading independent publisher of academic and nonfiction books|website=www.mcfarlandbooks.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship issues===

Many studies emphasize the use of CPM in relationships because of the concepts of disclosure and boundaries. Not only romantic relationships, but also friendships are a factor when thinking of CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBride|first1=Chad|last2=Bergen|first2=Karla|title=Communication Research: Becoming a Reluctant Confidant: Communication Privacy Management in Close Friendships|journal=Texas Speech Communication Journal|date=2008|volume=33|issue=1|pages=50–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, work on conflict and topic avoidance, considering the relational impact of privacy turbulence, students and faculty relationships, and workplace relationships have all produced useful information that opens new doors regarding CPM-based research.

The mobile phone and its impact on romantic relationships is a good example. After investigating mobile phone usage rules that are negotiated by adolescents and young adults in romantic relationships, findings are that the negotiation of rules is a crucial part of young adult relationships while enhancing trust and fostering harmony were important factors in the rule development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02500167.2016.1140666|pages= 56–74|title= Mobile communication privacy management in romantic relationships: A dialectical approach|journal= Communicatio|volume= 42|year= 2016|last1= Ngcongo|first1= Mthobeli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPM also appears in the friendship. The study intended to addresses the issue of whether personal traits and predispositions can predict the tendencies to either reveal or conceal secrets shared in confidence by a best friend suggested that a combination of several traits could successfully distinguish those who revealed secrets from those who did not. Significant discriminators included tendency to gossip and depth of disclosure. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=cd2e4976-6af1-4f4e-984f-f0a0953a3789%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=97239961&amp;db=ufh|title=A Profile of Those Likely to Reveal Friends' Confidential Secrets|last=Bello, R. S|first=Brandau-Brown|date=2014|website=|publisher=Communication Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although privacy violations can be uncomfortable and disruptive, they have the potential for positive outcomes in relationships if addressed. Using CPM theory as a framework, a study surveyed a community sample of 273 adults to examine their retrospective accounts of privacy violations in personal relationships. Results showed that less than half of the sample offered explicit rules for information management, and the majority of participants blamed the confidant for the privacy turbulence. Findings indicated that people often do not share similar information with the violator in the future, but if they do, less than half offer explicit privacy rules during the privacy recalibration process. Confrontation efficacy was positively associated with initiating a conversation about the privacy turbulence and that people who engaged in privacy recalibration were more likely to report forgiveness and relational improvement and less likely to report relational damage than those individuals who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=7f9fc8cf-95ac-4800-b9e5-28c8506b72a3%40sessionmgr107&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=103187596&amp;db=ufh|title=Privacy Recalibration in Personal Relationships: Rule Usage Before and After an Incident of Privacy Turbulence|last=Steuber, Keli Ryan|first=Rachel M. McLaren|date=2015|website=|publisher=Communication Quarterly|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work environments===

CPM has become very applicable in the workplace as personal mobile devices have increasingly been allowed to be brought to work. The concept of [[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)]] has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Seumas|last2=Weckert|first2=John|title=Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=December 2000|volume=28|issue=3|pages=255–265|doi=10.1023/a:1006232417265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=K.W.|last2=Voas|first2=J.|last3=Hurlburt|first3=G.F.|title=BYOD: Security and Privacy Considerations|journal=IT Professional|date=Sep–Oct 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=53–55|doi=10.1109/mitp.2012.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and interviewing. How much we decide to reveal within an interview and the boundaries we have in that situation is directly related to CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney|first1=Michael|last2=Kleiner|first2=Brian|title=Conducting an Effective Selection Interview|journal=Work Study|date=1994|volume=43|issue=7|doi=10.1108/eum0000000004009|pages=8–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even interviewing within a job (as a cop, for example) requires a certain sensitivity to people's boundaries and how much private information they are willing to reveal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Martine|last2=Wright|first2=Rebecca|last3=Clark|first3=Susan|title=Improving the Competency of Police Officers in Conducting Investigative Interviews with Children|journal=Police Practice &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/15614260902830070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural communication ===
Several studies tested CPM within intercultural contexts.  For instance, a study that examined intercultural privacy management between foreign English teachers and Japanese co-workers uncovered cultural premises. This "study highlights four cultural premises that garner intercultural privacy management between foreign English language teachers (ELTs) and Japanese coworkers (JCWs) in Japan. The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected not to be a "free space" for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care. This study calls for attention to intercultural privacy management and enhances CPM's cultural criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Nathaniel|date=2016-08-24|title=Cultural discourses of privacy: Interrogating globalized workplace relationships in Japan|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/17513057.2016.1142601|issn=1751-3057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the same context, foreign English teachers "employed the following management strategies: (a) withdrawal, (b) cognitive restructuring, (c) independent control, (d) lying, (e) omission, (f) avoidance, and (g) gaijin smashing. Japanese co-workers defined privacy as information that should be hidden and managed such information by: (a) drawing clear boundaries by not talking or changing contexts, and (b) being pre-emptive by demarcating privacy boundaries early on within a relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2012-01-01|title=Tales of Gaijin: Health Privacy Perspectives of Foreign English Teachers in Japan|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/kaleidoscope/vol11/iss1/3/|journal=Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2014-01-01|title=Negotiating Boundaries in a Globalized World: Communication Privacy Management between Foreign English Teachers and Japanese Co-workers in Japan|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:ohiou1400259896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==
There are a few communication theories that are worth noting after understanding CPM in more depth.

[[Expectancy violations theory]] discusses the importance of personal space, [[Territoriality (nonverbal communication)|territoriality]] and the expectations individuals have of another's non verbal communication. Though dealing with physical proximity, we can see the relation between expectancy violations theory and CPM as it pertains to privacy and how close we allow another to come to us. Both physical and intimate proximity requires boundaries to be crossed or permeated.

[[Social penetration theory]] explains how two individuals grow in intimacy and move from one level to the next in their relationships. The popular idea behind social penetration is that individual are like onions; they have layers and as you go deeper, the more intimate you become. For this intimacy to occur, we can safely say that private information needs to be shared and exchanged. As one does this, boundaries are permeated and become co-owned.

Finally, [[coordinated management of meaning]] explains how people establish rules for both creating and interpreting meaning. Similar to CPM, coordinated management of meaning has stages were coordination is achieved, not achieved, or partially achieved. Similarly you can have boundary ownership, boundary turbulence or boundary linkage. Moreover, in order to achieve meaning there needs to be an exchange of information between individuals to decipher. This exchange of private information falls directly into CPM.

==Academic integration==
Communication privacy management theory utilizes a socio-cultural communication tradition within an interpersonal context, and employs both a positivistic and interpretive approach to knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Critique==

=== Values ===

Altman speaks to the values of this theory as it advances our thinking by incorporating different "levels" or combinations of participants in communication processes (Altman 2002). Whereas earlier research and theorizing on privacy-disclosure focused on dyads or individuals, a most complicated set of dynamics has been carefully enunciated by Petronio. Petronio also describes communication within families and between family members and outsiders, within and outside work and social groups, and between many combinations of individuals, dyads, and others within and across social boundaries. In addition, her analysis of privacy-disclosure "turbulence", or breaches of desired communication patterns, is articulate and systematic.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. | last2 = Martin | first2 = J.N. | year = 1986 | title = Ramifications of revealing private information: A gender gap | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 499–506 | doi=10.1002/1097-4679(198605)42:3&lt;499::aid-jclp2270420317&gt;3.0.co;2-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin, Litlefield 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. Martin | last2 = Littlefield | first2 = R. | year = 1984 | title = Prerequisite conditions for self-disclosing: A gender issue | url = | journal = Communication Monographs | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 268–273 | doi=10.1080/03637758409390200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Some researchers have questioned whether CPM theory truly is dialectical in nature.  It has argued that CPM takes a dualistic approach, treating privacy and disclosure as independent of one another and able to coexist in tandem rather than in the dynamic interplay characteristic of dialectics. This accusation of dualistic thinking might result from the theory's use of the terms ''balance'' and ''equilibrium'' in the early versions of CPM theory. Petronio argues that CPM is not focused on balance in the psychological sense. "Instead, [CPM] argues for coordination with others that does not advocate an optimum balance between disclosure and privacy. As an alternative, the theory claims there are shifting forces with a range of privacy and disclosure that people handle by making judgments about the ''degrees'' [emphasis in original] of privacy and publicness they wish to experience in any given interaction" (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13). Thus, Petronio argues that it is legitimate to call CPM theory dialectical in nature.

The '''Cortex Plus System''' is a toolkit RPG system that evolved from [[Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd]]'s [[Cortex System]].  It has been used for four published games and one published preview to date, and the design principles are in the '''Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Of the four games published using this system, [[Leverage: The Roleplaying Game]] was nominated for the 2011 Origins Award for best Role Playing Game,&lt;ref name="Leverage RPG on RPG Geek"&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/4883/leverage-the-roleplaying-game Leverage RPG on RPG Geek]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]] won the 2013 award and the award for best support as well as the 2012 [[ENnie Award]] for Best Rules and runner up for Best Game.&lt;ref name="rpggeek.com"&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/16869/marvel-heroic-roleplaying Marvel Heroic Roleplaying on RPG Geek]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that despite the similarity in name, ''Cortex Plus'' is not the [[Cortex System]], also produced by Margaret Weis Productions.

==System==

Unlike the [[Cortex System]], Cortex Plus is a roll and keep system in which you roll one die from each category and keep the two highest dice in your [[dice pool]].  What goes into your dice pool is whatever is considered important for the game you are playing - but different stories have different things they consider important so the implementation of the system has been different for each game so far.  All versions of Cortex Plus use standard polyhedral dice and the normal [[dice notation]] ranging from d4 (a 4 sided tetrahedral die) to d12 (a 12-sided dodecahedral die), and narratively notable features are given dice from this list, with d6 being the default.

In all cases Cortex Plus uses dice pools ranging from d4 (terrible) to d12 (the best possible), and every die in your pool that rolls a natural 1 (called an 'Opportunity') doesn't count toward your total and causes some form of negative consequence which, depending on the game, either creates a complication for the characters to overcome or adds to the Doom Pool that provides the [[Game Master]] resources within the scene.  Adding a d4 to your dice pool is considered a penalty because it isn't likely to roll one of your best two die results and there's such a high chance of rolling a 1.

Most versions of Cortex Plus (other than Smallville) give the character a set of three distinctions that they can choose to add to their dice pool either as a d8 to assist them, or as a d4 to hinder them - but they gain a plot point by using the d4 option.

Equipment is normally handled by enabling the character to do things (you can't shoot someone without a gun) but where it is especially notable it is given a dice rating and added to the dice pool as an asset.  And things that get in the way are treated similarly, and added to the dice pool as complications.

Cortex Plus also uses [[Plot point (role-playing games)|Plot Points]] - the normal uses of which are to establish something as notable (turning it into an asset), power a stunt or ability, to add a die to your roll, or to keep an additional die after you have rolled.

===Action===

Cortex Plus Action is used in both the Leverage and [[Firefly Role-Playing Game]]s, and is the most traditional of the three.  The important factors are an ''attribute'' (Leverage uses the six from the [[Cortex System]], Firefly uses Physical/Mental/Social), a ''Skill'' (Leverage uses Grifter, Hacker, Hitter, Mastermind, and Thief which are based on the TV show.  Firefly has a list of 22).  Also in the dice pool can be a distinction, an asset, and a complication affecting the opposition.

Leverage, as a [[Heist film|Heist]] or [[Confidence trick|Con]] game allows characters to spend a plot point to establish [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback scenes]] to explain what is really going on and why things are not as bad as they appear.

===Drama===

Cortex Plus Drama is used in the [[Smallville Roleplaying Game]], which was the first Cortex Plus game.  It has the most complicated character generation; the players start by drawing a relationship map that step by step ties the player characters to each other and the gameworld.  Instead of attributes and skills, the important factors are considered Relationships with other characters and Values (Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power, Truth in Smallville) and each relationship and values having a statement attached and you can use the dice when acting in line with the statement.  A character can also challenge a value statement and possibly reject it, allowing them to use it three times in the dice pool on that roll - but using a smaller die for the rest of the session every time they want to invoke that value or relationship.

When a character loses a contest and doesn't give in Smallville they take stress (Insecure, Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, and Injured) which can be used against them - or they can use at the cost of increasing the amount of stress they've taken, and being unable to act beyond d12 stress.

===Heroic===

Cortex Plus Heroic was written for [[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]] and has the largest dice pools.  In addition to distinctions, assets, complications, and stress (as used in Drama - with stress being Physical, Mental, and Emotional in Marvel Heroic), Cortex Plus Heroic characters have an Affiliation (Solo, Buddy, Team), at least one powerset and possibly more, and some Specialities (which represent a mix of skills, resources, and contacts).  The powersets are further detailed with [[Special effect|Sfx]] and Limits so they more closely represent the vision of the character, and character creation is largely freeform.  Unlike other Cortex Plus games, the default is to keep three dice with the third die representing the effect size and not being added to the total, only the size of this die mattering. This third die is known as the Effect Die.  Marvel Heroic Roleplaying commonly uses large dice pools with seven separate categories (and potentially more than one power set).  The dice in Marvel Heroic are:

From the character:
* ''Distinction'' which may be invoked either positively for a d8 or negatively for a [[dice notation|d4]] (more chance of being a complication, little chance of being one of the best two dice)
* ''Affiliation'' (Solo/Budy/Team).  This reflects who the character is with and the nature of the scene.  Each character has one at d6, one at d8, one at d10.
* ''Power Sets'' - representing the characters' powers.  To better represent a character's abilities these are tweaked with [[Special effect|Sfx]] and limits.  One die per power set by default - but Sfx can increase this.
* ''Speciality'' which represents a mix of character skill, knowledge, and connections in their specialty field. Experts are rated d8, and Masters d10.  A d10 speciality may be replaced by 2d8 or 3d6 and a d8 speciality may be replaced by 2d6.

There are also three potential dice from the situation:
* ''Asset'' - a situational advantage or an object that's been created earlier.
* ''Resource'' created in a "transition scene" a resource represents a character building something with their skill or calling on their contacts in advance.
* ''Their opponent's state'' - opponents may have taken ''stress'' (i.e. harm) or ''complications'' (i.e. temporary disadvantages) from previous actions, and one die for this may be included.

Extra dice may be included through [[Plot point (role-playing games)|Plot Points]], and characters seldom use all those dice.

'''Data compression ratio''', also known as '''compression power''', is a [[computer science]] term used to quantify the reduction in data-representation size produced by a data compression algorithm.  The data compression ratio is analogous to the physical [[compression ratio]] used to measure substances.

==Definition==
Data compression ratio is defined as the ratio between the ''uncompressed size'' and ''compressed size'':&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioBroadcastEngineering&gt;{{cite news |title=Pixel grids, bit rate and compression ratio |publisher=Broadcast Engineering |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/storage-amp-networking/pixel-grids-bit-rate-and-compression-ratio |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010224651/http://broadcastengineering.com/storage-amp-networking/pixel-grids-bit-rate-and-compression-ratio |archivedate=2013-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CompressionRatioDigitalVideoandHD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Video and HD: Algorithms and Interfaces|author=[[Charles Poynton]]|date=2012-02-07|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]]|edition=2nd|isbn=9780123919267}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-06-05--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioHEVCdraft10&gt;{{cite news |title=High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) text specification draft 10 (for FDIS &amp; Consent) |publisher=JCT-VC |url=http://phenix.it-sudparis.eu/jct/doc_end_user/current_document.php?id=7243 |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioLogitechAVCStandard&gt;{{cite news |title=The H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) Standard |publisher=Logitech |url=http://www.logitech.com/assets/45120/logitechh.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioSonyBroadcastApplications&gt;{{cite news |title=White Paper on Performance Characteristics of MPEG-2 Long GoP vs AVC-I video compression techniques for Broadcast Applications |publisher=[[Sony]] |url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsccms/assets/files/micro/xdcam/solutions/MPEG-2_Long_GoP_vs_AVC_Comp-Strategies.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Compression\;Ratio} = \frac{\rm Uncompressed\;Size}{\rm Compressed\;Size}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a representation that compresses a 10 MB file to 2 MB has a compression ratio of 10/2 = 5, often notated as an explicit ratio, 5:1 (read "five" to "one"), or as an implicit ratio, 5/1. Note that this formulation applies equally for compression, where the uncompressed size is that of the original; and for decompression, where the uncompressed size is that of the reproduction. 

Sometimes the '''space savings''' is given instead, which is defined as the reduction in size relative to the uncompressed size: 

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Space\;Savings} = 1 - \frac{\rm Compressed\;Size}{\rm Uncompressed\;Size}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a representation that compresses a 10MB file to 2MB would yield a space savings of 1 - 2/10 = 0.8, often notated as a percentage, 80%.

For signals of indefinite size, such as [[streaming audio]] and video, the compression ratio is defined in terms of uncompressed and compressed [[Bit rate|data rates]] instead of data sizes: 

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Compression\;Ratio} = \frac{\rm Uncompressed\;Data\;Rate}{\rm Compressed\;Data\;Rate}&lt;/math&gt;

and instead of space savings, one speaks of '''data-rate savings''', which is defined as the data-rate reduction relative to the uncompressed data rate: 

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Data\;Rate\;Savings} = 1 - \frac{\rm Compressed\;Data\;Rate}{\rm Uncompressed\;Data\;Rate}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, uncompressed songs in CD format have a data rate of 16 bits/channel x 2 channels x 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz ≅ 1.4 Mbit/s, whereas [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] files on an iPod are typically compressed to 128 kbit/s, yielding a compression ratio of 10.9, for a data-rate savings of 0.91, or 91%. 

When the uncompressed data rate is known, the compression ratio can be inferred from the compressed data rate.

==Lossless vs. Lossy==
[[Lossless compression]] of digitized data such as video, digitized film, and audio preserves all the information, but it does not generally achieve compression ratio much better than 2:1 because of the intrinsic [[information entropy|entropy]] of the data. Compression algorithms which provide higher ratios either incur very large overheads or work only for specific data sequences (e.g. compressing a file with mostly zeros).&lt;ref &gt;S. Mittal and J. Vetter, "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7110612 A Survey Of Architectural Approaches for Data Compression in Cache and Main Memory Systems]", IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[lossy compression]] (e.g. [[JPEG]] for images, or [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] for audio) can achieve much higher compression ratios at the cost of a decrease in quality, such as Bluetooth audio streaming, as visual or audio compression artifacts from loss of important information are introduced. A compression ratio of at least 50:1 is needed to get [[1080i]] video into a 20 Mbit/s [[MPEG transport stream]].&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioBroadcastEngineering/&gt;

==Uses==
The data compression ratio can serve as a measure of the [[complexity]] of a data set or signal, in particular it is used to approximate the [[algorithmic information theory|algorithmic complexity]]. It is also used to see how much of a file is able to compressed without increasing its original size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13633">'''Contrast''' in [[visual perception]] is the difference in appearance of two or more parts of a field seen simultaneously or successively (hence: brightness contrast, lightness contrast, color contrast, simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, etc.). 

'''Contrast''' in [[physics]] is a quantity intended to correlate with the perceived [[brightness]] contrast, usually defined by one of a number of formulae (see below) which involve e.g. the [[luminance]]s of the stimuli considered, for example: ΔL/L near the luminance threshold (known as Weber contrast&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynton.com/notes/Timo/Weber_and_contrast_ratio.html Charles Poynton on Weber contrast]&lt;/ref&gt;), or L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; for much higher luminances.&lt;ref&gt;IEC(50)845-02-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''contrast''' can also be due to differences of [[chromaticity]] specified by colorimetric characteristics (e.g. the [[color difference]] ΔE CIE 1976 UCS).

Visual [[information]] is always contained in some kind of visual contrast{{Clarify|date=February 2016}}, thus '''contrast''' is an essential performance feature of [[electronic visual display]]s.

The '''contrast''' of electronic visual displays depends on the electrical driving (analog or digital input signal), on the ambient illumination and on the direction of observation (i.e. [[viewing cone|viewing direction]]). 

==Luminance contrast==

The "luminance contrast" is the ratio between the higher luminance, L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;, and the lower luminance, L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, that define the feature to be detected. This ratio, often called '''contrast ratio''', CR, (actually being a [[luminance]] [[ratio]]), is often used for high luminances and for specification of the [[contrast ratio|contrast]] of [[electronic visual display]] devices. The luminance contrast (ratio), CR, is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless number]], often indicated by adding ":1" to the value of the quotient (e.g. CR = 900:1).

&lt;math&gt;CR = \frac{L_H}{L_L}&lt;/math&gt; with 1 ≤ CR ≤ &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;

A "contrast ratio" of CR = 1 means no contrast.

The contrast can also be specified by the '''contrast modulation''' (or '''Michelson contrast'''), C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as:

&lt;math&gt;C_M = \frac{L_H -L_L}{L_H+L_L}&lt;/math&gt; with 0 ≤ C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1.

C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 means no contrast.

Another contrast definition sometimes found in the electronic displays field, K, is:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{L_H -L_L}{L_H}&lt;/math&gt; with 0 ≤ K ≤ 1.

K = 0 means no contrast, the maximum possible contrast, K&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; equals one.

==Color contrast==

Two parts of a [[visual field]] can be of equal luminance, but their color ([[chromaticity]]) is different. Such a ''color contrast'' can be described by a distance in a suitable chromaticity system (e.g. CIE 1976 UCS, [[Lab color space|CIELAB]], CIELUV). 

A metric for ''color contrast'' often used in the electronic displays field is the [[color difference]] ΔE*uv or ΔE*ab.

==Full-screen contrast==

During measurement of the luminance values used for evaluation of the contrast, the active area of the display screen is often completely set to one of the optical states for which the contrast is to be determined, e.g. completely white (R=G=B=100%) and completely black (R=G=B=0%) and the luminance is measured one after the other (time sequential).

This way of proceeding is suitable only when the display device does not exhibit ''loading effects'', which means that the luminance of the test pattern is varying with the size of the test pattern. Such loading effects can be found in [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-displays and in [[Plasma display|PDP]]s. A small [[test pattern]] (e.g. 4% window pattern) displayed on these devices can have significantly higher luminance than the corresponding full-screen pattern because the supply current may be limited by special electronic circuits.

==Full-swing contrast==
Any two test patterns that are not completely identical can be used to evaluate a contrast between them. When one test pattern comprises the completely bright state (full-white, R=G=B=100%) and the other one the completely [[dark state]] (full-black, R=G=B=0%) the resulting contrast is called ''full-swing contrast''. This contrast is the highest (maximum) contrast the display can achieve. If no test pattern is specified in a data sheet together with a contrast statement, it will most probably refer to the ''full-swing contrast''.

==Static contrast==

The standard procedure for contrast evaluation is as follows:

1 apply the first test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,

2 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the first test pattern and record the result,

3 apply the second test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,

4 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the second test pattern and record the result,

5 calculate the resulting ''static contrast'' for the two test patterns using one of the metrics listed above (CR,C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; or K).

When luminance and/or chromaticity are measured before the optical response has settled to a stable steady state, some kind of ''transient contrast'' has been measured instead of the ''static contrast''.

==Transient contrast==

When the image content is changing rapidly, e.g. during the display of video or movie content, the optical state of the display may not reach the intended stable steady state because of slow response and thus the apparent contrast is reduced if compared to the [[#Static_contrast|static contrast]].

|}

==Dynamic contrast==

This is a technique for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens.
 
LCD-screens comprise a backlight unit which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel in front of it which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased.&lt;ref&gt;T. Shiga and S. Mikoshiba: "Reduction of LCTV Backlight Power and Enhancement of Gray Scale Capability by Using an Adaptive Dimming Technique", SID03 Digest, pp. 1364-1367&lt;/ref&gt; Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some [[digital signal processing]] required for implementation of the ''dynamic contrast control technique'' in a way that is pleasing to the human [[visual system]] (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced). 

The contrast within individual frames (''simultaneous contrast'') can be increased when the backlight can be locally dimmed. This can be achieved with backlight units that are realized with arrays of LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Chen, et al.: "Locally pixel-compensated backlight dimming on LED-backlit LCD TV", JSID 15/12(2007), pp. 981-988&lt;/ref&gt; High-dynamic-range (HDR) LCDs are using that technique in order to realize (static) contrast values in the range of CR &gt; 100.000.&lt;ref&gt;H. Seetzen, et al.: "A [[High dynamic range rendering|High Dynamic Range]] Display System Using Low and High Resolution Modulators", SID03 Digest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark-room contrast==

In order to measure the highest contrast possible, the dark state of the display under test must not be corrupted by light from the surroundings, since even small increments ΔL in the denominator of the ratio (L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔL) / (L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔL) effect a considerable reduction of that quotient. This is the reason why most contrast ratios used for advertising purposes are measured under dark-room conditions (illuminance E&lt;sub&gt;DR&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 lx).

All emissive electronic displays (e.g. CRTs, PDPs) theoretically do not emit light in the black state (R=G=B=0%) and thus, under darkroom conditions with no [[Low-key lighting|ambient light]] reflected from the display surface into the light measuring device, the luminance of the black state is zero and thus the contrast becomes infinity.

When these display-screens are used outside a completely dark room, e.g. in the living room (illuminance approx. 100 lx) or in an office situation (illuminance 300 lx minimum), ambient light is reflected from the display surface, adding to the luminance of the dark state and thus reducing the contrast considerably.

A quite novel TV-screen realized with OLED technology is specified with a ''dark-room contrast'' ratio CR = 1.000.000 (one million). In a realistic application situation with 100 lx illuminance the contrast ratio goes down to ~350, with 300 lx it is reduced to ~120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specsmanship.com STOP Specsmanship]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|ambient_contrast}}

=="Ambient contrast"==

The contrast that can be experienced or measured in the presence of ambient illumination is shortly called "ambient contrast".&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Kelley: "Diffuse Reflectance and Ambient Contrast Measurements Using a Sampling Sphere", SID ADEAC06 Digest, pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of "ambient contrast" is the contrast under outdoor illumination conditions when the illuminance can be very intense (up to 100.000 lx). The contrast apparent under such conditions is called "daylight contrast".&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Kelley, et al.: "Display Daylight Ambient Contrast Measurement Methods and Daylight Readability", JSID 14, 11, pp. 1019-1030&lt;/ref&gt;

Since always the dark areas of a display are corrupted by reflected light, reasonable "ambient contrast" values can only be maintained when the display is provided with efficient measures to reduce reflections by anti reflection and/or anti-glare coatings.

==Concurrent contrast==

When a test pattern is displayed that contains areas with different luminance and/or chromaticity (e.g. a checkerboard pattern), and an observer sees the different areas simultaneously, the apparent contrast is called ''concurrent contrast'' (the term ''[[simultaneous contrast]]'' is already taken for a different effect). Contrast values obtained from two subsequently displayed full-screen patterns may be different from the values evaluated from a checkerboard pattern with the same optical states. That discrepancy may be due to non-ideal properties of the display-screen (e.g. crosstalk, halation, etc.) and/or due to straylight problems in the light measuring device.

==Successive contrast==

When a contrast is established between two optical states that are perceived or measured one after the other, this contrast is called ''successive contrast''. The contrast between two full-screen patterns (full-screen contrast) always is a ''successive contrast''.

==Methods of measurement==

* contrast of direct-view displays
* contrast of projection displays

Depending on the nature of the display under test (direct-view or projection) the contrast is evaluated as a quotient of luminance values (direct-view) or as a quotient of illuminance values (projection displays) if the properties of the [[projection screen]] is separated from that of the projector. In the latter case, a checkerboard pattern with full-white and full-black rectangles is projected and the illuminance is measured at the center of the rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI IT7.215-1992: Data Projection Equipment and Large Screen Data Displays -- Test Methods and Performance Characteristics&lt;/ref&gt; The standard ANSI IT7.215-1992 defines test-patterns and measurement locations, and a way to obtain the [[luminous flux]] from illuminance measurements, it does not define however a quantity named "ANSI lumen".

If the reflective properties of the projection screen (usually depending on direction) are included in the measurement, the luminance reflected from the centers of the rectangles has to be measured for a (set of) specific [[viewing cone|directions of observation]].

[[Luminance]], contrast and [[chromaticity]] of [[Liquid crystal display|LCD-screens]] is usually varying with the [[viewing cone|direction of observation]] (i.e. [[viewing cone|viewing direction]]). The variation of electro-optical characteristics with [[Viewing cone|viewing direction]] can be measured sequentially by mechanical scanning of the [[viewing cone]] (''gonioscopic'' approach) or by simultaneous measurements based on [[conoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Becker: "Viewing-cone Analysis of LCDs: a Comparison of Measuring Methods", Proc. SID'96, pp. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49217">The '''Dormant Commerce Clause''', or '''Negative Commerce Clause''', in [[American constitutional law]], is a [[legal doctrine]] that courts in the [[United States]] have inferred from the [[Commerce Clause]] in [[Article I of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Norman. "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=700173 Why Congress May Not Overrule the Dormant Commerce Clause]", 53 UCLA L. Rev. 153 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The Dormant Commerce Clause is used to prohibit state legislation that discriminates against interstate or international commerce.

For example, it is lawful for [[Michigan]] to require food labels that specifically identify certain animal parts, if they are present in the product, because the state law applies to food produced in Michigan as well as food imported from other states and foreign countries; the state law would violate the Commerce Clause if it applied only to imported food or if it was otherwise found to favor domestic over imported products. Likewise, [[California]] law requires milk sold to contain a certain percentage of milk solids that federal law does not require, which is allowed under the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine because California's stricter requirements apply equally to California-produced milk and imported milk and so does not discriminate against or inappropriately burden interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Food and Agriculture – Milk Standards "[https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Milk_and_Dairy_Food_Safety/Milk_Standards.html]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the doctrine==
The idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive Federal power was discussed even before adoption of the Constitution, but the framers did not use the word "dormant". On September 15, 1787, the [[Framers of the Constitution]] debated in [[Philadelphia]] whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of [[tonnage]] without Congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of [[harbors]] and the building of [[lighthouses]].&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"&gt;2 M. Farrand, [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_3s2.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787], p. 625 (1937) (1787-09-15).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]] believed that the mere existence of the Commerce Clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage: "He was more and more convinced that the regulation of Commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

[[Roger Sherman]] disagreed: "The power of the United States to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the State regulations when such interferences happen; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power, the latter being one of the [[concurrent powers]] shared by the federal and state governments.  Ultimately, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]], which says: "No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage ..."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

The word "dormant," in connection with the Commerce Clause, originated in [[dicta]] of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]]. For example, in the case of ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', {{ussc|22|1|1824}}, he wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce "can never be exercised by the people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of agents, or lie dormant." Concurring Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] was even more emphatic that the Constitution is "altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to Congress of power over commerce."

Later, in the case of ''[[Willson v. Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co.]]'', {{ussc|27|245|1829}}, Marshall wrote: "We do not think that the [state] act empowering the Black Bird Creek Marsh Company to place a dam across the creek, can, under all the circumstances of the case, be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state, or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject."

If Marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an [[exclusive federal power]], the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine eventually developed very differently: it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power, rather than an exclusive federal power, and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power. Thus, the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but "not absolutely exclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, Frank.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbNdwTo2ENEC&amp;pg=PA41Broken Landscape : Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution: Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution], p. 41 (Oxford University Press 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The approach began in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court: "Either absolutely to affirm, or deny that the nature of this [commerce] power requires exclusive legislation by Congress, is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power, and to assert concerning all of them, what is really applicable but to a part."&lt;ref name=Cooley&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=53&amp;page=299 Cooley v. Board of Wardens], 53 U.S. 299 (1851).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first clear holding of the Supreme Court striking down a state law under the Dormant Commerce Clause came in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Reading Railroad v. Pennsylvania, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=82&amp;invol=232 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 232 (1873)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of the doctrine==
Justice Anthony Kennedy has written that: "The central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism, laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the Constitution was designed to prevent."&lt;ref&gt;C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., 511 U.S. 383 (1994) (quoting The Federalist No. 22, pp.&amp;nbsp;143&amp;ndash;145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton);  Madison, Vices of the Political System of the United States, in 2 Writings of James Madison 362&amp;ndash;363 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to determine whether a law violates a so-called "dormant" aspect of the Commerce Clause, the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce. In this context, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.

Thus, in a dormant Commerce Clause case, a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests. Discriminatory laws motivated by "simple economic protectionism" are subject to a "virtually per se rule of invalidity", ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'' 437 U.S. 617 (1978), ''[[Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, Wisconsin]]'', 340 U.S. 349 (1951), ''[[Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm.]]'', 432 U.S. 333 (1977) which can only be overcome by a showing that the State has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, ''[[Maine v. Taylor]]'', 477 U.S. 131(1986). See also ''[[Brown-Forman Distillers v. New York State Liquor Authority]]'', {{ussc|476|573|1986}}.

On the other hand, when a law is "directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental" (United Haulers Association, Inc.), that is, where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a much more flexible approach, the general contours of which were outlined in ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970) and ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'', 437 U.S. at 624.   If the law is not outright or intentionally discriminatory or protectionist, but still has some impact on interstate commerce, the court will evaluate the law using a balancing test. The Court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits. If such is the case, the law is usually deemed unconstitutional.  See ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|397|137|1970}}. In the Pike case, the Court explained that a state regulation having only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce "will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits".  397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847.  When weighing burdens against benefits, a court should consider both "the nature of the local interest involved, and ... whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities".  Id.  Thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety, or serve other legitimate state interests, but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose, are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test, a minimum level of scrutiny. See ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc.]]'' In USA Recycling, Inc. v. Town of Babylon, 66 F.3d 1272, 1281 (C.A.2 (N.Y.), 1995), the court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the state activity constitutes "regulation" of interstate commerce, then the court must proceed to a second inquiry: whether the activity  regulates evenhandedly with only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce.  As we use the term here, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.  The party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against, or places some burden on, interstate commerce.  ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979).  If discrimination is established, the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects, and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests.  If the challenging party cannot show that the statute is discriminatory, then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that "is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits."  ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456, 471(1981) (quoting Pike, 397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==State taxation==
Over the years, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the language of the Commerce Clause contains a further, negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when Congress has failed to legislate on the subject. Examples of such cases are ''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'', 504 U.S. 298 (1992); ''[[Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota]]'', 358 U.S. 450, 458 (1959) and ''[[H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond]]'', 336 U.S. 525 (1949).

More recently, in the 2015 case of ''[[Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne]]'',&lt;ref name=Wynne&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-485_o7jp.pdf Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne] (No. 13-485, May 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court addressed Maryland's unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in Maryland, and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside Maryland, ''without'' any tax credit for income tax paid to other states.  The Court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;  The Court faulted Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s criticism of the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by saying that he failed to "explain why, under his interpretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause 
would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant Commerce Clause".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

Application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the Court's holdings that the Commerce Clause prevents a State from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole, as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear. The Court's taxation decisions thus "reflected a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic [[Balkanization]] that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the [[Articles of Confederation]]." ''[[Wardair Canada, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue]]'', 477 U.S. 1 (1986); ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322 (1979); ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995).

===Formalistic approach===
As with the Court's application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation, the pre-[[New Deal]] Court attempted to apply a [[Commerce Clause#Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence|formalistic approach]] to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce.  The history is described in ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The command has been stated more easily than its object has been attained, however, and the Court's understanding of the dormant Commerce Clause has taken some turns.   In its early stages, the Court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation "in any form", "even though the same amount of tax should be laid on (intrastate) commerce".  This position gave way in time to a less uncompromising but formal approach, according to which, for example, the Court would invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate commerce, or upon the "freight carried" in interstate commerce, but would allow a tax merely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon franchises,  or "'in lieu of all taxes upon (the taxpayer's) property,'" Dissenting from this formal approach in 1927, Justice Stone remarked that it was "too mechanical, too uncertain in its application, and too remote from actualities, to be of value." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Decline of formalism===
Accompanying the revolution in approach in the Court's Congressional powers jurisprudence, the New Deal Court began to change its approach to state taxation as well. The Jefferson Lines decision continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1938, the old formalism began to give way with Justice Stone's opinion in ''[[Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue]]'', 303 U.S. 250, which examined New Mexico's franchise tax, measured by gross receipts, as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in New Mexico but circulated both inside and outside the State.   Although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent, Justice Stone added a dash of the pragmatism that, with a brief interlude, has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law.  ... The Court explained that "[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business."  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the transition period, some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax, and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved, whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not.  Under this formalistic approach, a tax might be struck down, and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence, but under another name, and then withstand review.

The absurdity of this approach was made manifest in the two Railway Express cases.  In the first, a tax imposed by the [[U.S. state|state]] of Virginia on [[United States|American]] business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce. But then, in the second, Virginia revised the wording of its statute to impose a "franchise tax" on "intangible property" in the form of "going concern" value as measured by gross receipts.

The Court upheld the reworded statute as not violative of the prohibition on privilege taxes, even though the impact of the old tax and new were essentially identical. There was no real economic difference between the statutes in Railway Express I and Railway Express II. The Court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way. Yet under the Spector rule, the economic realities in Railway Express I became irrelevant. The Spector rule (against privilege taxes) had come to operate only as a rule of draftsmanship, and served only to distract the courts and parties from their inquiry into whether the challenged tax produced results forbidden by the Commerce Clause.

The death knell of formalism occurred in ''[[Complete Auto Transit, Inc v. Brady]]'', 430 U.S. 274 (1977), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=430&amp;invol=274] which approved a Mississippi privilege tax upon a Michigan company engaged in the business of shipping automobiles to Mississippi dealers.  The Court there explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appellant's attack is based solely on decisions of this Court holding that a tax on the "privilege" of engaging in an activity in the State may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce. See, e. g., ''[[Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor]]'', 340 U.S. 602 (1951); ''[[Freeman v. Hewit]]'', 329 U.S. 249 (1946). This rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the "privilege of doing business"; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax. The rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of "free trade" immunity from state taxation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Complete Auto Transit is the last in a line of cases that gradually rejected a per se approach to state taxation challenges under the commerce clause.  In overruling prior decisions which struck down privilege taxes per se, the Court noted the following, in what has become a central component of commerce clause state taxation jurisprudence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the State to justify a tax, or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer, or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce, or that the tax is not fairly apportioned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These four factors, nexus, relationship to benefits, discrimination, and apportionment, have come to be regarded as the four Complete Auto Transit factors applied repeatedly in subsequent cases.  Complete Auto Transit must be recognized as the culmination of the Court's emerging commerce clause approach, not just in taxation, but in all of its aspects.  Application of Complete Auto Transit to State taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture, requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law.&lt;!--   How does a federal court decide whether a tax is "fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer", and what deference should the court show to state legislative determinations?  How does the Court determine whether a tax which is facially non-discriminatory should be upheld or struck down?  What level of nexus is required, and how does one determine that a tax is fairly apportioned.  All of these issues belong in an article on the law of local taxation.--&gt;

==Taxation of international commerce==
In addition to satisfying the four-prong test in ''Complete Auto Transit'', the Supreme Court has held state taxes which burden international commerce cannot create a substantial risk of multiple taxations and must not prevent the federal government from "speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments". ''Japan Lines, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles'', 441 U.S. 434 (1979).

In ''Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance'', 505 U.S. 71 (1992), the Supreme Court considered a case in which Iowa taxed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, without allowing a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments, but not dividends from domestic subsidiaries operating outside Iowa. This differential treatment arose from Iowa's adoption of the definition of "net income" used by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. For federal income tax purposes, dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation. The Iowa Supreme Court rejected a Commerce Clause claim because Kraft failed to show "that Iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to Iowa's taxing scheme." Considering an Equal Protection Clause challenge, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the use of the federal government's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was "rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency". The Supreme Court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce. The Supreme Court held that "a State's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause even if the State's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination."

==Local processing requirements==
Discrimination in the flow of interstate commerce has arisen in a variety of contexts. A line of important cases has dealt with local processing requirements.  Under the local processing requirement, a municipality seeks to force the local processing of raw materials before they are shipped in interstate commerce.

===No local processing preference===
The basic idea of the local processing ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials.  Examples of Supreme Court decisions in this vein are set out in its Carbone decision.  They include ''[[Minnesota v. Barber]]'', 136 U.S. 313, (1890) (striking down a Minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the State, whether originating within or without the State, to be examined by an inspector within the State);  ''[[Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 1 (1928) (striking down a Louisiana statute that forbade shrimp to be exported unless the heads and hulls had first been removed within the State);  ''[[Johnson v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 16 (1928) (striking down analogous Louisiana statute for oysters);  ''[[Toomer v. Witsell]]'', 334 U.S. 385 (1948) (striking down South Carolina statute that required shrimp fishermen to unload, pack, and stamp their catch before shipping it to another State);  ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', supra  (striking down Arizona statute that required all Arizona-grown cantaloupes to be packaged within the State prior to export);  ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82 (1984) (striking down an Alaska regulation that required all Alaska timber to be processed within the State prior to export).   The Court has defined "protectionist" state legislation as "regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors". ''New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach'', 486 U.S. 269, 273&amp;ndash;74 (1988).

===Carbone: local processing law benefiting private entity===
{{Main|C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York}}

In the 1980s, spurred by [[RCRA]]'s emphasis on comprehensive local planning, many states and municipalities sought to promote investment in more costly disposal technologies, such as [[waste-to-energy]] incinerators, state-of-the-art landfills, composting and recycling.   Some states and localities sought to promote private investment in these costly technologies by guaranteeing a longterm supply of customers.  See Phillip Weinberg, Congress, the Courts, and Solid Waste Transport:  Good Fences Don't Always Make Good Neighbors, 25 Envtl. L. 57 (1995); Atlantic Coast Demolition &amp; Recycling, Inc., 112 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir. 1997).  For about a decade, the use of regulation to channel private commerce to designated private disposal sites was greatly restricted as the result of the Carbone decision discussed below.

Flow control laws typically came in various designs.   One common theme was the decision to fund local infrastructure by guaranteeing a minimum volume of business for privately constructed landfills, incinerators, composters or other costly disposal sites.    In some locales, choice of the flow control device was driven by state bonding laws, or municipal finance concerns.    If a county or other municipality issued general obligation bonds for construction of a costly incinerator, for example, state laws might require a special approval process.  If approval could be obtained, the bonds themselves would be counted against governmental credit limitations, or might impact the governmental body's credit rating: in either instance the ability to bond for other purposes might be impaired.  But by guaranteeing customers for a privately constructed and financed facility, a private entity could issue its own bonds, privately, on the strength of the public's waste assurance.

The private character of flow control regimens can thus be explained in part by the desire to utilize particular kinds of public financing devices.  It can also be explained by significant encouragement at the national level, in national legislation as well as in federal executive policy to achieve environmental objectives utilizing private resources.    Ironically, these public-private efforts often took the form of local processing requirements which ultimately ran afoul of the commerce clause.

The Town of Clarkstown had decided that it wanted to promote waste assurance through a local private transfer station.  The transfer station would process waste and then forward the waste to the disposal site designated by the Town.    The ordinance had the following features:

Waste hauling in the Town of Clarkstown was accomplished by private haulers, subject to local regulation.  The scheme had the following aspects: (A) The Town promoted the financing of a privately owned transfer station through a waste assurance agreement with the private company.     Thus the designated facility was a private company. (B) The Town of Clarkstown forced private haulers to bring their solid waste for local processing at the designated transfer station, even if the ultimate destination of solid waste was an out-of-state disposal site. (C) The primary rationale for forcing in-state waste into the designated private transfer station was financial; it was seen as a device to raise revenue to finance the transfer station.

The Town of Clarkstown's ordinance was designed and written right in the teeth of the long line of Supreme Court cases which had historically struck down local processing requirements. In short, it was as if the authors of the ordinance had gone to a treatise on the commerce clause and intentionally chosen a device which had been traditionally prohibited. A long line of Supreme Court case law had struck down local processing requirements when applied to goods or services in interstate commerce.  As the Court in Carbone wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We consider a so-called flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality.   The avowed purpose of the ordinance is to retain the processing fees charged at the transfer station to amortize the cost of the facility. Because it attains this goal by depriving competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market, we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court plainly regarded the decision as a relatively unremarkable decision, not a bold stroke.  As the Court wrote: "The case decided today, while perhaps a small new chapter in that course of decisions, rests nevertheless upon well-settled principles of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence."  And, the Court made it plain, that the problem with Clarkstown's ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this light, the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid ... The essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service. Out-of-state meat inspectors, or shrimp hullers, or milk pasteurizers, are deprived of access to local demand for their services.  Put another way, the offending local laws hoard a local resource&amp;mdash;be it meat, shrimp, or milk&amp;mdash;for the benefit of local businesses that treat it. 511 U.S. at 392&amp;ndash;393.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Haulers: local processing law benefiting public entity===
{{main|United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority}}

The Court's 2007 decision in ''[[United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority]]'' starkly illustrates the difference in result when the Court finds that local regulation is not discriminatory.  The Court dealt with a flow control regimen quite similar to that considered in Carbone.   The "only salient difference is that the laws at issue here require haulers to bring waste to facilities owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation."  The Court decided that the balancing test should apply, because the regulatory scheme favored the government owned facility, but treated all private facilities equally.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors. "Conceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities." ''[[General Motors Corp. v. Tracy]]'', 519 U.S. 278 (1997). But States and municipalities are not private businesses&amp;mdash;far from it. Unlike private enterprise, government is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. See ''[[Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts]]'', 471 U.S. 724 (1985) ... These important responsibilities set state and local government apart from a typical private business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's United Haulers decision demonstrates an understanding of the regulatory justifications for flow control starkly missing in the Carbone decision:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the 1980s, the Counties confronted what they could credibly call a solid waste " 'crisis.' "... Many local landfills were operating without permits and in violation of state regulations. Sixteen were ordered to close and remediate the surrounding environment, costing the public tens of millions of dollars. These environmental problems culminated in a federal clean-up action against a landfill in Oneida County; the defendants in that case named over local businesses and several municipalities and school districts as third-party defendants The "crisis" extended beyond health and safety concerns. The Counties had an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, enduring price fixing, pervasive overcharging, and the influence of organized crime. Dramatic price hikes were not uncommon: In 1986, for example, a county contractor doubled its waste disposal rate on six weeks' notice&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court would not interfere with local government's efforts to solve an important public and safety problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government. The dormant Commerce Clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake, and what activities must be the province of private market competition. In this case, the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties have chosen the government to provide waste management services, with a limited role for the private sector in arranging for transport of waste from the curb to the public facilities. The citizens could have left the entire matter for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce. But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort. It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services. "The Commerce Clause significantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce, but it does not elevate free trade above all other values."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Health and safety regulation==
The history of commerce clause jurisprudence evidences a distinct difference in approach where the state is seeking to exercise its public health and safety powers, on the one hand, as opposed to attempting to regulate the flow of commerce. The exact dividing line between the two interests, the right of states to exercise regulatory control over their public health and safety, and the interest of the national government in unfettered interstate commerce is not always easy to discern.  One Court has written as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not surprisingly, the Court's effort to preserve a national market has, on numerous occasions, come into conflict with the states' traditional power to "legislat[e] on all subjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens."  ''[[Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of Detroit]]'', 362 U.S. 440, 443 (1960).  On these occasions, the Supreme Court has "struggled (to put it nicely) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the States' police powers, each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the Nation."  ''[[Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison]]'', 520 U.S. 564, 596 (1997) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing ''[[Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines]]'', 514 U.S. 175, 180&amp;ndash;83 (1995));  see generally [[Boris I. Bittker]], Regulation of Interstate and Foreign Commerce § 6.01[A], at 6&amp;ndash;5 ("[T]he boundaries of the [State's] off-limits area are, and always have been, enveloped in a haze."). Those rules are "simply stated, if not simply applied."  Camps Newfound/Owatonna, 520 U.S. at 596 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A frequently cited example of the deference afforded to the powers of state and local government may be found in ''[[Exxon Corp. v. Maryland]]'', 437 U.S. 117 (1978), where the State of Maryland barred producers of petroleum products from operating retail service stations in the state. It is difficult to imagine a regimen which might have greater impact on the way in which markets are organized.  Yet, the Court found the legislation constitutionally permitted: "The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce," the Court wrote.  The "Clause protects interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations."

Similarly, in ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456 (1981) the Court upheld a state law that banned nonreturnable milk containers made of plastic but permitted other nonreturnable milk containers.  The Court found that the existence of a burden on out-of-state plastic industry was not 'clearly excessive' in comparison to the state's interest in promoting conservation.  And the court continued:

In Exxon, the Court stressed that the Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.  A nondiscriminatory regulation serving substantial state purpose is not invalid simply because it causes some business to shift from a predominantly out-of-state industry to a predominantly in-state industry.  Only if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State's legitimate purpose does such a regulation violate the commerce clause.  When a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce, the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce.  In ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines]]'' 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959), the United States Supreme Court stated: 'These safety measures carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged in court.  If there are alternative ways of solving a problem, we do not sit to determine which of them is best suited to achieve a valid state objective.   Policy decisions are for the state legislature, absent federal entry into the field.  Unless we can conclude on the whole record that "the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it"  we must uphold the statute.

==Exceptions==
There are two notable exceptions to the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause to survive court challenges.

===Congressional authorization===
The first exception occurs when Congress has legislated on the matter. See ''[[Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. v. State Board of California]]'', {{ussc|451|648|1981}}. In this case the Dormant Commerce Clause is no longer "dormant" and the issue is a Commerce Clause issue, requiring a determination of whether Congress has approved, preempted, or left untouched the state law at issue.

===Market participation exception===
The second exception is "[[market participation exception]]". This occurs when the state is acting "in the market", like a business or customer, rather than as a "market regulator".&lt;ref&gt;''[[South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82, 87 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a state is contracting for the construction of a building or selling maps to state parks, rather than passing laws governing construction or dictating the price of state park maps, it is acting "in the market".  Like any other business in such cases, a state may favor or shun certain customers or suppliers.

The Supreme Court introduced the market participant doctrine in  ''[[Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.]]'', 426 U.S. 794 (1976), which upheld a Maryland program that offered bounties to scrap processors to destroy abandoned automobile hulks. See also ''[[Wisconsin Dep't of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations v. Gould Inc.]]'', 475 U.S. 282, 289 (1986); ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', 447 U.S. 429, 437 (1980).  Because Maryland required out-of-state processors, but not in-state processors, to submit burdensome documentation to claim their bounties, the state effectively favored in-state processors over out-of-state processors. The Court held that because the state was merely attaching conditions to its expenditure of state funds, the Maryland program affected the market no differently than if Maryland were a private company bidding up the price of auto hulks.  Because the state was not "regulating" the market, its economic activity was not subject to the anti-discrimination principles underlying the dormant Commerce Clause&amp;mdash;and the state could impose different paperwork burdens on out-of-state processors. "Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others."

Another important case is ''[[White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc.]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that the City of Boston could require its building contractors to hire at least fifty percent of their workforce from among Boston residents.  460 U.S. at 214&amp;ndash;15. Because all of the employees covered by that mandate were "in a substantial if informal sense, 'working for the city,' " Boston was considered to be simply favoring its own residents through the expenditures of municipal funds.  The Supreme Court stated, "when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause." Id. at 208.  Nothing in the Constitution precludes a local government from hiring a local company precisely because it is local.

Other important cases enunciating the market participation exception principle are ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', {{ussc|447|429|1980}} and ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', {{ussc|467|82|1984}}. The ''Reeves'' case outlines the market participation exception test. In this case state-run cement co-ops were allowed to make restrictive rules (e.g. rules not to sell out-of-state). Here, this government-sponsored business was acting restrictively like an individually owned business and this action was held to be constitutional. ''South-Central Timber'' is important because it limits the market exception. ''South-Central Timber'' holds that the market-participant doctrine is limited in allowing a State to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant, but allows it to go no further. The State may not impose conditions that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market.

The "market participation exception" to the dormant Commerce Clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests, because limits from other laws and Constitutional limits still apply.  In ''[[United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Camden]]'', {{ussc|465|208|1984}}, the city of [[Camden, New Jersey]] had passed an ordinance requiring that at least forty percent of the employees of contractors and subcontractors on city projects be Camden residents. The Supreme Court found that while the law was not infirm because of the Dormant Commerce Clause, it violated the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]] of the Constitution. Justice Rehnquist's opinion distinguishes the market-participant doctrine from the privileges and immunities doctrine.  Similarly, Congress has the power itself under the Commerce Clause to regulate and sanction states acting as "market participants", but it lacks power to legislate in ways that violate Article IV.

In the 21st century, the dormant Commerce Clause has been a frequent legal issue in cases arising under state laws regulating some aspects of Internet activity. Because of the interstate, and often international, nature of Internet communications, state laws addressing internet-related subjects such as [[spam (electronic)|spam]], online sales or online pornography can often trigger Dormant Commerce Clause issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldsmith |first=Jack L. |authorlink= |author2=Sykes, Alan O. |year=2001 |title=The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=785&amp;ndash;828 |doi=10.2307/797608 |jstor= 797608|quote= |publisher=The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the doctrine==
A "negative" or "dormant" component to the Commerce Clause has been the subject of scholarly discussion for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;FELIX FRANKFURTER, THE COMMERCE CLAUSE UNDER MARSHALL, TANEY AND WAITE 12 (1937) (describing absence of comment during drafting and ratification of Constitution regarding possible negative implications of Commerce Clause); Albert S. Abel, The Commerce Clause in the Constitutional Convention and in Contemporary Comment, 25 Minn. L. Rev. 432, 493 (1941) (arguing that historical evidence "supports the view that, as to the restricted field which was deemed at the time to constitute regulation of commerce, the grant of power to the federal government presupposed the withdrawal of authority ''pari passu'' from the states.").&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Supreme Court Justices [[Antonin Scalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tyler Pipe Industries v. Department of Revenue]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=483&amp;invol=232 483 U.S. 232] (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston]]'', 507 U.S. 60(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (concurring in enforcement of dormant Commerce Clause on stare decisis grounds)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clarence Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.]]'', [http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/05-1345_All.pdf 550 U.S. ___] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have rejected the notion of a Dormant Commerce Clause.  They believe that such a doctrine is inconsistent with an [[Originalism|originalist]] interpretation of the Constitution—so much so that they believe the doctrine is a "judicial fraud".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

A number of earlier Supreme Court justices also expressed dissatisfaction with the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.  For example, [[Roger Taney|Chief Justice Taney]] said this in 1847:&lt;ref&gt;License Cases (Thurlow v. Massachusetts; Fletcher v. Rhode Island; Peirce v. New Hampshire), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=46&amp;invol=504 46 U.S. 504 (1847)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it was intended to forbid the States from making any regulations of commerce, it is difficult to account for the omission to prohibit it, when that prohibition has been so carefully and distinctly inserted in relation to other powers ... [T]he legislation of Congress and the States has conformed to this construction from the foundation of the government ... The decisions of this court will also, in my opinion, when carefully examined, be found to sanction the construction I am maintaining.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, that statement by Taney in 1847 was before the doctrine morphed in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court that the Commerce Clause does not always require "exclusive legislation by Congress".&lt;ref name=Cooley /&gt;

==Puerto Rico==
In ''Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vázquez'', 977 F.2d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1992), the [[First Circuit]] held that the dormant Commerce Clause applies to [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/977/1/305484/ 977 F.2d 1: Trailer Marine Transport Corp., Plaintiff, Appellee, v. Carmen M. Rivera Vazquez, Etc., et al., Defendants, Appellants]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Eastern world in a 1796 map, which included the continents of Asia and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The term '''Eastern world''' refers to various [[culture]]s or [[society|social structures]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems depending on the context, most often including at least part of [[Asia]] or geographically the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean Region and [[Arab world]], specifically in historical ([[pre-modern]]) contexts, and in modern times in the context of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson|location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is usually not used by people in this region itself, since this Eastern world is a varied, complex and dynamic region, hard to generalize, and although these countries and regions have many common threads running through them, historically they never needed to define themselves collectively against another entity, real or superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sandra S. Mouth, Joanna.  Barbara, Koening A. The Meanings of Race in the New Genomics: Implications for Health Disparities Research. Yale University. 2001. October 26, 2006. [http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20(koenig).pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101012859/http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20%28koenig%29.pdf |date=2006-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the [[Old World]], contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (the ''[[Occident]]'' or [[Western world]]). Traditionally, this includes all of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] (the [[Far East]]), [[Greater Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]]). 

Conceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West, while [[Muslim world|Islamic nations]] and much of the former [[Soviet Union]] are, regardless of location, grouped in the East.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic&gt;{{cite book | last = Meštrovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than [[Asia]] and some parts of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] has successfully absorbed almost all of the societies of Oceania, and the [[Americas]] into the [[Western world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |title=Embassy of Brazil - Ottawa |publisher=Brasembottawa.org |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013145/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Falcoff |first=Mark |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |title=Chile Moves On |publisher=AEI |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417075124/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], the [[Philippines]],

== Identity politics ==

=== Asian concepts ===
{{cleanup|reason=The first paragraph in this section uses English words, but does not manage to make coherent English sentences. The second paragraph is mostly one run-on sentence.|date=April 2018}}
[[File:LocationAsia.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An image of the "Eastern world" defined as [[Asia]]]]
Although the concept of a united Asian people and not mean [[Asian people|Asian race]] is even more debatable due to the fact that most of the world link the identity of Asian only to the people of South, East and Southeast Asia and so regions like [[Western Asia]] that who even though see themselves as part of the Eastern world such as the [[Arab world|Arab nations]] of Western Asia, [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and the ethnic groups that come along with these countries do not identify as Asian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another reason why a [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Asian and Indian people" are referred to in the New Zealand Heart Foundation's [http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ BMI calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531222922/http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ |date=2009-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of [[Nationalism|nationalistic]], cultural, and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic individualism]] many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in [[colonialism|colonial times]] and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.

The division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European [[Christendom]] and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the [[European colonization of the Americas]] the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" ([[Indies]]) or "[[Oriental]]" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and [[Indology]]. An intriguing fact to be noted is that [[Orientalism]] has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from the Latin ''oriens''; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European concepts ===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of [[Eastern bloc]], connoting the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and their [[communist]] allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies such as the [[United Kingdom]].

The concept is often another term for the [[Far East]] – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Yoga]] is partly responsible for this.

Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

* [[Abrahamic religions]] (a.k.a. [[Abrahamic religions|West Asian religions]]) 
** [[Christianity]] — the majority of the modern world adheres to this faith although it isn't widely practiced in its native continent of Asia anymore and since the faith had spread to the [[Western World]] the notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, vibrant indigenous minorities in the [[Levant]] have preserved their ancient beliefs, adhering to [[Syriac Christianity]] (i.e. [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Maronite people]]), an [[Eastern Christian]] sect.
** [[Islam]] — the majority of the world [[Muslim]] population have always lived in Asia, due to Islam spreading and becoming the dominant religion of these areas.
** [[Judaism]] — the national religion of the [[Israelites]]/[[Hebrews]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]], or what is now [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. They eventually evolved into the [[Jews]] (particularly [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi]]) and [[Samaritans]] of today.
* [[Zoroastrianism]] — the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[state religion]] of [[Sassanid Persia|Sassanid Iran]]
* [[Eastern religions]] / [[Eastern philosophy]]
** [[Indian religions]]
*** [[Buddhism]] — the path of liberation attained through insight into the ultimate nature of reality.
*** [[Hinduism]] 
*** [[Jainism]]
*** [[Sikhism]] — a religion that developed in the warring plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in an atmosphere of ideological clash between [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. Its followers retain spiritual as well as martial qualities.
** [[East Asian religions|Taoic religions]] (a.k.a. [[East Asian religions]] or [[East Asian religions|Far Eastern religions]])
*** [[Chinese folk religion]]
*** [[Confucianism]] — the belief that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12985">The '''Edict of Toleration''' took place during the process referred to as the [[Eastern Question]] in relations between European powers, Britain in particular, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in its development at a time referred to as [[Tanzimat]] internally which included other initiatives like ending the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman slave trade]] a few years later but overall as part of the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] – a process that continued into the 1920s. It was largely a result of pressure from the British government on the [[Sublime Porte]], [[Abdülmecid I]] of the Ottomans, urging to stop the persecutions of the Christians, and eventually had an effect on the persecutions of Jews,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} continuing effects such as the earlier [[Damascus affair]]. It is one of the [[Edict of toleration|edicts of toleration]] of history.

Tanzimat was an Ottoman reform process that sought equal protections under the law in Ottoman lands for all people; however, it did not address matters of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first =Selim | last = Deringil | editor-last =Michael| editor-first =Michalis N. | editor2-last =Anastassiades | editor2-first =Tassos | editor-last3 = Verdeil| editor-first3 =Chantal | title =Re-configuring Ottoman citizenship in the Tanzimat state: conversion, religion and identity politics in the late Ottoman Empire(abstract | booktitle =Religious community and modern statehood: The passage from the Ottoman Empire to modern state | page =  5 | publisher = University of Cyprus, Department of Turkish and Middle Eastern Studies | date =October 2010 | location = Nicosia, Cyrpus | url =http://www.ucy.ac.cy/tms/documents/tms/sinedria/Conf.29.10.10_Programme.pdf | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular incident in 1843 with an Armenian Ottoman subject sparked an incident in August which gained international entanglements and then a Greek national in November, both of whom were put to death - the process of which became the Edict in March 1844.&lt;ref name="Subsi"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Subsi | first = Turgut | title =The apostasy question in the context of Anglo-Ottoman relations, 1843-44. | journal =Middle Eastern Studies | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = Frank Cass &amp; Company Ltd.  | date =April 1, 2002 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112247877.html | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] referred to these developments in 1844 when he summarized diplomatic notes&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Bickersteth|authorlink=Edward Bickersteth (priest)|title=A practical guide to the Prophecies, with reference to their interpretation and fulfilment, and to personal edification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wFOAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA223|year=1844|publisher=Seeley, Burnside, and Seeley|pages=221–23, 387–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The original notes of the diplomatic letter noting this edict can be obtained from the Public Record Office in London.

==The Edict==
In February 1844 there is a question on the status of Jew apostates from Islam (who, it was claimed, must pass through being Christian on the way to Islam in the first place)&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite book|author=August Jochmus (freiherr von Cotignola.)|title=The Syrian war and the decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1840-1848: in reports, documents, and correspondences, etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXfDamiuHEkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA106|year=1883|publisher=A. Cohn|pages=102, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 21, 1844 appears (in translation):

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the special and constant intention of His Highness the Sultan that his cordial relations with the High Powers be preserved, and that a perfect reciprocal friendship be maintained and increased.&lt;br&gt;
 The Sublime Porte engage to take effectual measures to prevent henceforward the execution and putting to death of the Christian who is an apostate.&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Muslim Islamic scholar [[Cyril Glassé]], death for [[Apostasy in Islam]] was "not in practice enforced" in later times in the Muslim world, and was "completely abolished" by "a decree of the Ottoman government in 1260AH/1844AD."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Cyril |last=Glassé |year=2001 |title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=AltaMira |page=54|location=[[Walnut Creek, California]] |isbn=978-0-7591-0189-0|oclc=48553252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This short edict was advanced in the wider [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856]].

==Prophetic interpretations==
The Edict was seen by some especially among the religious as a specific sign leading towards the fulfillment of prophecy.

Research conducted by Michael Sours&lt;ref name="Sours"/&gt; into this subject and the records of the development of the Edict did not refer directly to the Jews but rather infers religious tolerance through ending executions for apostasy for Jews that seemed to convert making their social situation easier while actually keeping their personal and group identity in their Judaic religion. Jerusalem has had the largest Jewish population in Palestine in recent centuries since about 1844&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lapidoth | first = Ruth |author2=Moshe Hirsch | title = The Jerusalem question and its resolution: selected documents|publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1994| pages = 258, 384 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e93JIwTBjHgC&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;pg=PA384#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-7923-2893-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and been majority Jewish since about 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morgenstern | first = Arie |others=Joel A.

The Edict was first publicly commented upon by Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] in his publication, ''Practical Guide to the Prophecies'' in the 1844 edition.&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"/&gt; Adventist [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], and those that disagreed with him, though unaware of the Edict and the diplomacy around it, still looked to the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire even in the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper| last = Nichol | first =Francis D. | authorlink =Francis D.

The 2300 days are understood to represent 2300 years stretching from 457 BC, the calculated starting date of the [[70 weeks prophecy#Seventh-day Adventists|70 weeks prophecy]] based on the 3rd decree found in Ezra, thus leading to 1843/4. Bickersteth acknowledged the same interpretation and added a second - {{bible verse||Ezekiel|4:5|KJV}} - as a parallel to start the clock for understanding {{bible verse||Revelation|9:15|KJV}}; taking 390 years as a period for persecution of Christians in the [[End time]]. Bickersteth takes this persecution from the [[Fall of Constantinople|triumph of Ottoman]] rule of Constantinople in 1453, thus 1453+390 is 1843/4, directly before these events. Thus, independently of Miller, a number of Christian authors followed the significance of this declaration from Bickersteth including [[Alfred Edersheim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Edersheim|authorlink = Alfred Edersheim |title=Israel's watchman (and prophetic expositor) &amp;#91;afterw.&amp;#93; The prophetic news and Israel's watchman, ed. by A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proclamation of His Faith was made in 1844, the year when the strict exclusion of the Jews from their own land enforced by the Muslims for some twelve centuries was at last relaxed by the Edict of Toleration and "the times of the Gentiles" were "fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Edward Hart''' was an early settler of the American Colonies who, as town clerk, wrote the [[Flushing Remonstrance]], a precursor to the [[United States Constitution]]'s provision on [[freedom of religion]] in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;

==Early life==

Little is known with any degree of certainty regarding Edward Hart's life before 1640. Genealogical sources give place and date of birth, year and manner of emigration to North America, and first places of residence within the American colonies, but none provide documentary evidence for their assertions.{{refn|group=note|On this topic see also Andrews's ''Genealogical history of Deacon Stephen Hart and his descendants'' which says that Edmund Hart, probable brother of Stephen, was one of the first settlers of Dorchester, having lived there from 1632.&lt;ref name="Andrews1875"/&gt; Edward Hart is said to have moved from Dorchester to Weymouth, Massachusetts, in 1634 or 1636 and to Farmington, Connecticut, the following year, but this was also likely to have been Edmund. On Edward in Dorchester and Weymouth see Robertson's ''Profiles of the signers of the Flushing Remonstrance, December 27, 1657''&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;{{rp|56}} and the ''Hart Memorial''.&lt;ref name="Andrews1875"/&gt;{{rp|56}} For the likelihood that Edmund is meant see Whittmore's ''Genealogical Guide to the Early Settlers of America'',&lt;ref name="Whittemore1898"/&gt; Pope's ''The pioneers of Massachusetts, a descriptive list, drawn from records of the colonies, towns and churches and other contemporaneous documents'',&lt;ref name="Pope1900"/&gt; Holmes's ''Directory of the ancestral heads of New England families, 1620-1700'',&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt; and the source used by Singleton: ''Genealogical history of Deacon Stephen Hart and his descendants, 1632. 1875: with an introduction of miscellaneous Harts and their progenitors, as far as known; to which is added a list of all the clergy of the name found, all the physicians, all the lawyers, the authors, and soldiers'' by Alfred Andrews (New Britain, Connecticut, Hart, Austin, 1875).}} A man named Edward Hart was one of the early settlers of Rhode Island having obtained a plot of land from [[Roger Williams]] and signed an agreement for the government of Providence in 1640.&lt;ref name="Bayles1891"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staples1843"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staples1843"/&gt; This man married a woman named Margaret whose surname is unknown.&lt;ref name="Austin1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Torrey1985"/&gt; There is no definite evidence that this Edward Hart is the same as the Edward Hart of Flushing, Long Island, but sources generally accept that he is.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Torrey1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Chapin1916"/&gt;

==Founding settler of Flushing==

Although there is some level of uncertainty about his prior whereabouts, there is no doubt that on October 10, 1645, Hart was one of 18 men who received a charter from the Dutch governor of [[New Netherland]], [[William Kieft]], to establish the town of Vlissingen (i.e., [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]) in Long Island.&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross1902"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In addition to Edward Hart the charter establishing Flushing lists Thomas Applegate, Thomas Beddard, Lawrence Dutch, Robert Field, Thomas Farrington, Robert Firman, John Hicks, [[John Lawrence (New York)|John Lawrence]], William Lawrence, John Marston, Michael Millard, William Pidgeon, Thomas Stiles, Thomas Saul, Henry Sawtelle, [[John Townsend (Norwich)|John Townsend]], and William Thorn.&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt;}} Three of these men came to Flushing from Rhode Island and may have known Hart there. The others, so far as is known, came from Massachusetts, Connecticut, or other towns in Long Island.{{refn|group=note|Applegate, Field, and Hicks came to Flushing from Rhode Island; Stiles from Connecticut, the Lawrences and Thorn from Long Island, and the rest from Massachusetts so far as is known.}}

In 1642, after efforts to attract Dutch immigrants had disappointing results, the administration in New Netherland and its parent governors in Amsterdam began to accept applications from English settlers to form towns on Long Island.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|38–39, 41–42, et. seq.}}&lt;ref name="McKinley1900"/&gt; These settlers brought with them the forms of government common in the settlements of New England. Based on practices common in English towns, these were generally more liberal than the ones granted to New Netherland's Dutch communities&lt;ref name="McKinley1900"/&gt;{{rp|12, 18}} and the charter granted to the applicants from Flushing was no exception.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}{{refn|group=note|In granting unusual privileges to settlers from New England the administration in New Amsterdam expected to gain revenue from taxes, manpower for defense against the predations of unfriendly Indians, and local resistance to encroachments by the administrators of New England colonies.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}}} Having obtained privileges of self-government that were not granted to the towns where Dutch settlers resided, the settlers from New England were energetic in defending and where possible expanding these rights against efforts of the administration in New Amsterdam to erode them.&lt;ref name="Stiles1895"/&gt;

In 1648 Hart, as one of Flushing's landholders, joined with four other men to protest the payment of tithes to the pastor of a state-sponsored church and to question the manner of choosing the town's sole magistrate, the [[schout]], who acted as court officer, prosecutor, and sheriff.&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt; On January 17 of that year the government of New Netherland, now headed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]] summoned the five men to answer for this resistance to the authorities in New Netherland and ordered them to accept the Dutch method for electing their schout.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|231}}&lt;ref name="Stiles1895"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt;

Stuyvesant did not relent in his efforts to require the inhabitants of Flushing to support a pastor of his choosing nor did he change the method for electing a schout.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|82}} However, a few months later he expanded local government by granting the town's freeholders the right to elect three additional magistrates, called schaepens, and a clerk.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|23}} The election of the officials would be subject to confirmation by the New Netherland government but in practice the town's nominations of its officials were routinely accepted.{{refn|group=note|The frequency of elections was not stipulated but is understood to have been annual. In the first election following this change in the town's charter John Underhill was named schout; John Townsend, John Hicks, and William Thorne were named schaepens; and John Lawrence was named clerk. Although one source says that Hart was elected to the position of town clerk on April 27, 1648, that source does not cite evidence,&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;{{rp|3}} and other sources which do give evidence maintain that John Lawrence, was elected at that time.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|35}}&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1865"/&gt;{{rp|44, 88, 105}} Flushing and other towns in New Netherland nominated officials for approval by authorities in New Amsterdam. The form is given in a council minute of March 25, 1656.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|343}}}} Although there is some doubt about the names and terms of early clerks, it is certain that Hart was clerk in 1656 for in July of that year he signed himself clerk in responding on behalf of the town's schout and schaepens to a demand from the New Netherland government for payment of a tenth of the town's agricultural production as annual tax as provided in its charter. Hart's letter said that Flushing was "willing to do that which is reasonable and honest" and proposed an amount of produce ("fiftie scipple of peas and twentie-five of wheat") which was apparently acceptable.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|35–36}}&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|361–362}} That he continued as clerk in 1657 is shown by a letter of his dated January 23, 1657, affirming the town's rights and privileges and complaining that the neighboring town of Hempstead was encroaching on its lands.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|384–385}}&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1865"/&gt;{{rp|105}}

==Writer of the Flushing Remonstrance==
{{main|Flushing Remonstrance}}
The next document bearing Hart's signature as clerk is the famous [[Flushing Remonstrance]] of December 27, 1657.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|40–41}}&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|402–408}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corwin1901"/&gt;{{rp|412–414}}&lt;ref name="FriendsIntelligencer"/&gt;{{rp|54–58}} The towns settled by immigrants from New England were generally granted charters recognizing their right to freedom of conscience but not freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|167}} In the case of Flushing, the relevant clause granted the original patentees the right "to have and Enjoy the Liberty of Conscience, according of Religion; to the Custome and manner of Holland, without molestacōn or disturbance, from any Magistrate or Magistrates, or any other Ecclesiasticall Minister, that may extend Jurisdiccōn over them."&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt; In practice this meant that men would not be prosecuted for religious practices that did not strongly contradict those of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] which was the official public church in Holland.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|167}} It also meant that personal beliefs that were contrary to the tenets of the established church would be tolerated so long as they were kept private and expressed only in the narrow circle of the family. Meetings for the public expression of dissenting worship would be prosecuted.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Although the early settlers of Flushing complied with these strictures, some of them came into conflict with Stuyvesant and the New Netherlands government when charismatic speakers began to come among them proclaiming nonconformist beliefs.{{refn|group=note|In 1656 a prominent Baptist minister, [[William Wickenden]], was banished and fined for holding illegal religious gatherings and baptizing adult Christians in Flushing.&lt;ref name="JacksonKeller2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Root1890"/&gt; A year later three Quakers were sent away from Manhattan for public preaching and one of them, Robert Hodgson, moved on to Long Island where some of the inhabitants, including residents of Flushing, gave him a warm welcome. Arrested once again, he refused to acknowledge that he had done wrong and would not perform hard labor to which he had been sentenced. As punishment he was treated very severely: put in solitary confinement, beaten, and tortured.&lt;ref name="Bowden1850"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GarmanThesis"/&gt;{{rp|71–77}}&lt;ref name="Brodhead1853"/&gt;}} Believing that Quakers posed the most serious threat to religious and civil tranquility, the administration in New Amsterdam proclaimed that any person who took a Quaker into his home, even for a single night, would be fined fifty pounds and that any ships bringing any Quaker into the province would be confiscated.&lt;ref name="Brodhead1853"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1918Jstor"/&gt;{{rp|210}}&lt;ref name="MaikaJstor"/&gt;{{rp|38}} The schout, magistrates, of Flushing, along with twenty-eight other freeholders of that town and two from neighboring Jamaica recognized that they could not, in conscience, obey this regulation and signed a protest, the Remonstrance, explaining why they could not comply.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|40–41}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|219–220}} The document says Quakers are not seducers of the people nor are they "destructive unto magistracy and ministers" but—along with Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists—are members of the "household of faith" who, when they "come unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free ingress and egress unto our town and houses, so as God shall persuade our consciences." It closes by saying that the signatories "desire to be true subjects both of church and state" according to the law of God and also to the provisions of the town's charter.&lt;ref name="FriendsIntelligencer"/&gt;

==Government response to the Remonstrance==

The signers of the Remonstrance followed correct procedure in having the town schout, Tobias Feake, submit it to the provincial schout, Nicasius de Sille. De Sille passed it on to Stuyvesant who immediately ordered de Sille to arrest and imprison Feake.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|403–404}}&lt;ref name="Corwin1901"/&gt;{{rp|414}}{{refn|group=note|The provincial schout—officially called Schout-Fiscal and informally called Fiscal—functioned as attorney general and sheriff.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|38}}}}{{refn|group=note|There is greater than usual variation in the spelling of the name Feake. Contemporary documents render it as Fecco, Feaks, Feakes, ffeake, Feeque, and Feakx.}}{{refn|group=note|Nicasius de Sille was the son of a prominent statesman [[Nicasius de Sille|of the same name]].}} A few days later—January 1, 1658—he also ordered the arrest of two of the town's magistrates, Thomas Farrington and William Noble,&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404}}{{refn|group=note|Thomas Farrington was one of the original patentees of Flushing. He was elected schaepen in 1655, 1656, 1657, and 1661.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|88–89}} William Noble (or Nobel) had been born in Flushing and was in his mid-30s when first elected schaepen in 1656. He was re-elected to that office in 1657, 1661, 1662, and 1664.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|88–90}}}} and on January 3 he summoned Hart to testify.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404}} Under examination by Stuyvesant and two councilors, Hart said that the Remonstrance contained the sentiments of the community as expressed in a town meeting, that some who were not present at the meeting signed afterward, and that he did not know who called the meeting or who had drafted the document for the community's consideration.{{refn|group=note|Peter Tonneman served as schout and secretary of Brooklyn as well as provincial councilor and schout.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404ff and 423ff}}}}{{refn|group=note|On January 8 Stuyvesant and the council granted a petition from Farrington and Noble to be released from prison so long as they did not leave Manhattan. Having received from them a letter of apology in which they claimed they had been misled and promised future good conduct, he granted them pardons provided they to pay court costs.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|406–407}} In releasing them the council noted that they acknowledged their error and concluded that they had "been misled by the Schout Tobias Feakx."&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|407}} Asked whether they would continue to serve as magistrates in Flushing, the council said it had not yet decided and asked for important matters to be referred to themselves if any arose.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|407}}}} Having suffered imprisonment for three weeks Hart wrote the governor and council on January 28 requesting to be released. He acknowledged no offense and made no excuse for writing the Remonstrance but begged mercy and consideration for his "poore estate and Condition" and promised that he would "indeavor hereafter to walke inoffensively."&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|408–409}} The council responded the same day. The record of its decision says something about his performance as town clerk and his standing in the community:&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|409}}&lt;blockquote&gt;In Council received and read the foregoing petition of the imprisoned Clerk of Vlissingen, Edward Hart, and having considered his verbal promises of better behavior and the mediation of some inhabitants of said village, also that he has always been an efficient officer and as an old resident is well acquainted with divers matters; further whereas the Schout Tobias Feakx has advised him to draw up the remonstrance recorded on the first of January and he is burdened with a large family,

The Director-General and Council forgive and pardon his error this time on condition of his paying the costs and misses of law.&lt;/blockquote&gt; On March 26 the director-general and council passed an ordinance intended to prevent the town from ever again submitting a "seditious and mutinous" document like the Remonstrance. Saying that "all the late Schouts successively have manifested no small negligence," it added new qualifications for the office aimed at obtaining persons "better versed in Dutch Practice, and somewhat conversant in both languages, the English and Dutch." It also prohibited town meetings for conducting ordinary business and, in their place, instituted a town council consisting of seven persons to assist the schout and magistrates and it required the town to acquire and maintain "an Orthodox Minister" to conduct religious services.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1868"/&gt;{{rp|338–341}}

==Responsibility for the Remonstrance==

Hart gave somewhat inconsistent statements in his interrogation by Stuyvesant, de Sille, and Tonneman, saying first that he drew up the Remonstrance on the order of those who signed it in order to record the "opinion of the people" of the town and then saying that he had prepared it before the town meeting at which he submitted it for consideration. He pleaded ignorance concerning the responsibility of any specific individuals as instigators prior to the town meeting. Pressed to explain his inconsistent testimony he said the draft he prepared prior to the meeting contained "what he thought to be the opinion of the people." The questions submitted to Hart show that Stuyvesant and the two councilors suspected that the four town officials who signed the document (the schout, two magistrates, and Hart) bore primary responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404}} After interrogating the two magistrates and after the two of them and Hart had submitted apologies for their actions, the governor and councilors settled on the schout as mainly responsible.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|409}} Although they singled out Feake for punishment, the ordinance they passed subsequent to the release from imprisonment and pardoning of the Hart and the magistrates maintains that all four of the town's officials were jointly at fault. It says  that most of the men who signed the Remonstrance were "urged to subscribe by the previous signatures of the Schout, Clerk and some Magistrates."&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1868"/&gt;{{rp|339}}

Historians who have considered this subject have not agreed about who took the lead in preparing the Remonstrance and, as a result, it is not known which of its signers most inspired its moving appeal for freedom of conscience. Some maintain that the schout, Feake, was mainly responsible.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|220}} Others say it was mainly Hart's doing&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt; or that, at least, the language was his.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt; One says that the four town officials were more or less equally responsible.&lt;ref name="Bowden1850"/&gt; Many accounts say that the responsibility was communal.{{refn|group=note|Most sources take this view. See in particular ''New Netherland and the Dutch Origins of American Religious Liberty'' by Evan Haefeli (2013).&lt;ref name="Haefeli2013"/&gt;{{rp|170}}}} One author makes a case for a strong influence of Baptist beliefs among those who signed the document.&lt;ref name="GarmanThesis"/&gt;

==Life of Edward Hart subsequent to the Remonstrance==

There is little information about Hart following his pardoning and release from prison. In 1660 and 1661 his name appears as a witness on deeds for transfer of land and in the latter year he was listed as a tax collector in Flushing.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|36}} On April 13, 1662, Hart wrote Stuyvesant on behalf of Flushing residents to request help in dealing with three Indians "who demand pay for the Land wee live vpon"&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|512}} and later that year (June 26) A man whose name is given as Eduart Hart obtained a translation from the Notary Public in New Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="HollandSocietyYearbook1900"/&gt;{{rp|144}} After that there is no assured documentary evidence regarding him. The last references to a man who is supposed to have been Hart are in records of land transfer. In 1679 a man named Robert West acquired land originally owned by an Edward Hart in Providence, R.I.&lt;ref name="Hopkins2009"/&gt; and in 1707 land formerly owned by him is referred to in a deed filed by a man named William Field.&lt;ref name="Commissioners1909"/&gt; It is likely but not certain that this Edward Hart is the same as the one who wrote the Remonstrance.

==Family of Edward Hart==

Hart's life after 1662 is described from inferences lacking a clear documentary trail. With his wife, Margaret, he is said to have had two sons, Thomas and Jonathan. Hart having returned to Rhode Island and then died, his wife is supposed to have remarried.{{refn|group=note|Examples of these sources include a number of genealogical sites and the following monographs: ''Edward Hart; descendants and allied families'' by Clara Hart Kennedy (Bloomington, Ill., 1939)&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt; and ''Profiles of the signers of the Flushing Remonstrance, December 27, 1657'' by Purcell B. Robertson (4 vols. typescript held in Queens Public Library, New York, N.Y.)&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt; For an instance of doubt about these suppositions see "The Ancestry of the Hon. John Hart, of Hopewell, N.J., Signer of the Declaration of Independence" by Frederick W. Bailey, in ''The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record'', Volumes 25-26 (New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, 1894, New York).&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt;}} Some genealogical and other sources say that Jonathan Hart died in Newtown, Long Island, in 1671,&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1996"/&gt; however ''Early Wills of Westchester County, New York, from 1664 to 1784'' by William Smith Pelletreau (Francis P. Harper, New York, 1898) says that the family of one Monmouth Hart of Rye, New York, is descended from an Edmund Hart who signed the Flushing Remonstrance and that his son, Jonathan Hart, came to Rye in 1685 and subsequently married Hannah Budd.&lt;ref name="PelletreauHaviland1898"/&gt; Thomas Hart is said to have married Freeborn Williams, a daughter of Roger Williams&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1996"/&gt; and this fact is supported by a note in ''The genealogical dictionary of Rhode Island'' by John Osborne Austin (Joel Munsells Sons, Albany, 1887). The note says that the Edward Hart who was granted land in Providence and subsequently signed the civil compact of 1640 was the husband of a woman named Margaret and the two were parents of a son named Thomas. It says that this son lived in Newport, Rhode Island, and was husband of Freeborn Williams, daughter of [[Roger Williams]] and his wife Mary.&lt;ref name="Austin1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton1881"/&gt; Although most sources accept that this Edward Hart is the same man as the one who drafted the Remonstrance, they offer no evidence to support their inference.

==Documentary evidence on the life of Edward Hart==

In 1789 all the records of the town of Flushing were destroyed in a fire{{refn|group=note|"The most important event of the closing years of the last century was the destruction of the town records by the burning of the residence of the clerk, Jeremiah Vanderbilt. It was set on fire by Nellie, a slave girl belonging to Capt. Daniel Braine, who had been hired to work in the family, and who, conceiving a dislike for her new mistress, took this way to revenge the fancied injury. She was arrested in company with Sarah, one of Vanderbilt's slaves, and on their own confession they were sentenced to be hanged. Sarah was afterwards reprieved on condition that she be removed from the island. Nellie was hanged at Jamaica, after having been in jail fifty weeks. Aaron Burr, then attorney-general for the State, conducted the prosecution."&lt;ref name="HistoryOfQueensCounty1882"/&gt;{{rp|85}}}} and in 1911 a fire caused serious damage to the manuscripts of the New Netherland colony.{{refn|group=note|"While many ... Dutch volumes were charred at the edges, they survived because they had been kept on shelves close to the floor, below the English volumes. When the fire caused the shelves to collapse, the Dutch books were buried under the English ones, which suffered far greater damage, many being completely destroyed.

This practice consists of an outpouring of ministry in which words and phrases of Scripture are woven into the discourse with no mention of "chapter or verse," but in a manner by which they can be clearly identified as Scripture. The ministry of George Fox displays this feature but the Flushing Remonstrance is an unusually concentrated illustration of it. In these ministers, Scripture had been so thoroughly assimilated that its words and phrases became a part of the person. What follows is the text of the Flushing Remonstrance with the Biblical phrases identified by chapter and verse in the King James Version. This compilation may not exhaust the Biblical elements to be found in the Remonstrance, but it suggests the possibilities. |doi=10.1353/qkh.1993.0010}}&lt;!--|access-date=2015-08-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3289">'''Egain forecasting''' is a method of controlling building [[heating]] by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit. By combining [[physics]] of structures with [[meteorology]], properties of the building, [[weather]] conditions including outdoor temperature, [[wind power]] and direction, as well as [[solar radiation]] can be taken into account. In the case of conventional heating control, only current outdoor temperature is considered.

The starting point for developing the method of eGain forecasting was the ENLOSS mathematical [[energy accounting|energy balance]] model developed by Prof. Roger Taesler
&lt;ref&gt;Taesler, R. (1990/91) "Climate and Building Energy Management". ''Energy and Buildings'', Vol. 15-16, pp 599 - 608.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] in cooperation with Thorbjörn Geiser (member of the board) and Stefan Berglund,&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent 6098893 Comfort control system incorporating weather forecast data and a method for operating such a system (Inventor Stefan Berglund)&lt;/ref&gt; who are currently both employed at eGain Sweden AB. Forecasting method began to be introduced to use in the late 1980s.

Until 2017 inclusive, forecasting method has been introduced in nearly 16 million square metres of floorage of [[residential building]]s and commercial premises. Estimated data indicate 10 - 15 kWh/''m''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;  reduction of average annual [[heat energy]] consumption. Since forecasting method contains information about future demand and is not in conflict with other methods of increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], it is always a good foreground solution.

==eGain Forecasting in practice==
As far as practical use of forecasting method is concerned, usually [[remote control]] forecasting receivers are used to send and receive data by means of [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]] or [[GSM]] network. Then, the forecasting receivers manage the operation of control panels installed in buildings which adjust distribution of heat energy in the [[heating system]] of a given property.

Recently, special remote control weather loggers have started to be used in combination with forecasting receivers. The weather loggers measure [[air temperature]] and [[humidity]] with high accuracy and the measurements are sent in real time to forecasting receivers to which they are connected. Such a turning point in [[technology]] means even more detailed preview of situation and better possibilities of control for users of forecasting method.

An '''epiphenomenon''' (plural: '''epiphenomena''') is a secondary [[phenomenon]] that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon. The word has two [[word sense|senses]],&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one that [[connotation|connotes]] known [[causality|causation]] and one that connotes absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;

==Examples==
===Metaphysics===
{{Main|Causality}}
The problem of epiphenomena is often a counterexample to theories of causation and is identified with situations in which an event E is caused by (or, is said to be caused by) an event C, which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event F. For example, take a simplified Lewisian counterfactual analysis of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events A and B can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form “if A had not occurred then B would not have occurred”. Suppose that C causes E necessarily and that C has an epiphenomenon F necessarily. We then have that if E had not occurred, then F would not have occurred, either. But then according to the counterfactual analysis of causation, the proposition that there is a causal dependence of F on E is true; that is, on this view, E caused F. Since this is not in line with how we ordinarily speak about causation (we would not say that E caused F), a counterfactual analysis seems to be insufficient.

===Philosophy of mind and psychology===
{{Main|Epiphenomenalism}}
An epiphenomenon can be an effect of primary phenomena, but cannot affect a primary phenomenon. In [[philosophy of mind]], [[epiphenomenalism]] is the view that [[mind|mental]] phenomena are epiphenomena in that they can be caused by physical phenomena, but cannot cause physical phenomena.  In strong epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can ''only'' be caused by physical phenomena, not by other mental phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can be caused by both physical phenomena and other mental phenomena, but mental phenomena cannot be the cause of any physical phenomenon.  

The [[physical world]] operates independently of the [[mental world]] in epiphenomenalism; the mental world exists as a derivative [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] to the physical world, affected by the physical world (and by other epiphenomena in weak epiphenomenalism), but not able to have an effect on the physical world.  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalist]] versions of epiphenomenalism allow some mental phenomena to cause physical phenomena, when those mental phenomena can be strictly analyzable as summaries of physical phenomena, preserving causality of the physical world to be strictly analyzable by other physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Richard]] (1963). ''Metaphysics''. First Edition. Eaglewood Cliffs, Prentice-Hall.    &lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
In the more general use of the word, a [[causality|causal relationship]] between the phenomena is implied;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; the epiphenomenon is a consequence of the primary phenomenon.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; This is the [[word sense|sense]] that is related to the noun ''[[epiphenomenalism]]''.

However, in [[medicine]], this relationship is typically ''not'' implied, and the word is usually used in its second sense: an epiphenomenon may occur independently, and is called an epiphenomenon because it is not the primary phenomenon under study or because only [[correlation]], not [[causality|causation]], is known or suspected. In this sense, saying that X is [[association (statistics)|associated with]] Y as an epiphenomenon is preserving an acknowledgment that [[correlation does not imply causation]]. [[Medical sign|Signs]], [[symptom]]s, [[syndrome]]s (groups of symptoms), and [[risk factor]]s can all be epiphenomena in this sense. For example, having an increased risk of [[breast cancer]] concurrent with taking an [[antibiotic]] is an epiphenomenon. It is not the antibiotic that is causing the increased risk, but the increased [[inflammation]] associated with the bacterial [[infection]] that prompted the taking of an antibiotic. The [[metaphor]] of a [[tree]] is one way of helping to explain the difference to someone struggling to understand. If the infection is the root of the tree, and the inflammation is the trunk, then the cancer and the antibiotic are two branches; the antibiotic is not the trunk.

===Electromagnetism===
Although [[electronics]] is said to be due to the influence of [[electron]]s, the standard approach to the study of electrical phenomena due to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] views these particles as secondary:
:In [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Maxwell’s theory]], [[electric charge|charge]] and [[electric current|current]] are 'epiphenomena' (secondary appearances) of underlying processes in what he termed, following [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. Indeed, Maxwell’s mature theory stays completely away from microstructure of matter and from any consideration of ‘electric substance’. Instead he proposed that certain quantities should be defined at every point in space, such that relations between them (the [[Maxwell equations]]) and functions of them (such as energy functions) determine phenomena. These quantities (the [[vector field|fields]]) may depend on microphysical events, and indeed Maxwell did expend some effort in his early papers on attempting to explain qualitatively how their relations could result in mechanical motions. However, the theory explains only large-scale phenomena, and it is not necessary to have the microscopic model in mind in order to work successfully with it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Archibald (1994) "Mathematical theories of electricity and magnetism to 1900", in ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'',  volume 2, page 1216, [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] editor, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-09239-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
                
===Free will===
According to epiphenomenalism, [[free will]] having an effect on the physical world is an illusion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun Gallagher|Gallagher, Shaun]]; in: Does consciousness cause behavior? Pockett, Susan (ed.); Banks, William P. (ed.); Gallagher, Shaun (ed.); Cambridge, MA,: MIT Press, 2006. pp. 109–124. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt; as physical phenomena can only be caused by other physical phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, there is free will to cause some mental effects, allowing for [[mental discipline]] that is directed at other mental phenomena.

===Behaviorism===
Weak versions of [[behaviorism]] in [[psychology]] admit the existence of mental phenomena but not their meaningful study as causes of observable behavior and view mental phenomena as either epiphenomena or linguistic summaries, [[instrumentalism|instruments]] to examine objectively observable physical behavior.

=== Complexity ===
In the field of [[complex systems]], the term epiphenomenon tends to be used interchangeably with "emergent effect".

=== Propositional theory ===
[[Zenon Pylyshyn]] suggested a [[propositional model of cognition]] where people do not conceptualize ideas in images but rather in meaningful relationships.  In this theory, epiphenomena refer to images because they are merely products people conceptualize from their actual thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Sternberg|Sternberg, R.]] (2005). Cognitive psychology. 5th ed., Pearson, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pylyshyn defends his claim by explaining that we only see images when we envision the form of an object.  While visualizing objects or actions is a frequent process in our mind, it does not occur when we are considering the meaning behind an action or the non-visual properties of an object.  There are many concepts we simply cannot envision.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Return of the mental image: are there really pictures in the brain? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 113–118. doi:10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00003-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, when envisioning an image, it changes based on our preconceived notions, suggesting that semantic relations precede visual images.  Unfortunately, the idea of epiphenomena in propositional theory is largely subjective and not [[falsifiable]].&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Explaining mental imagery: Now you see it, now you don't. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 111–112. doi: 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00004-4&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against women}}

The '''Family Violence Prevention and Services Act''' (FVPSA) is a [[United States]] law, first authorized as part of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (PL 98–457), that provides federal funding to help victims of [[domestic violence]] and their dependent children by providing shelter and related help, offering violence prevention programs, and improving how service agencies work together in communities. 
* The 24-hour, confidential, toll-free [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]] provides support, information, referrals, safety planning, and [[crisis intervention]] in more than 170 languages to hundreds of thousands of domestic violence victims each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8024">'''Fragmentalism''' is a view that holds that the world consists of individual and independent objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kukla A|title=Antirealist Explanations of the Success of Science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=63|issue=1|pages=S298–S305|year=1996|doi=10.1086/289964|jstor=188539}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term contends that the world is indeed composed of separable parts, and that it is chiefly knowable through the study of these component parts, rather than through wholes. It therefore stands opposed to holistic interpretations of phenomena.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Fragmentalists carved the universe up into smaller and smaller pieces until they reached such a fine level of subdivision that they could no longer observe the pieces directly." (Stewart &amp; Cohen, p.198) "As the tale of the Fragmentalists demonstrates, reductionist science usually looks for a mathematical equation, formula, or process that describes general features of the universe." (Stewart &amp; Cohen, p.200)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fragmentalism has also been defined as ''the notion that knowledge is a growing collection of substantiated facts or "nuggets of truth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML|title=Personal construction of formal knowledge|journal=Interchange|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/VQ4L33X920880824.pdf|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3–14|year=1982|doi=10.1007/BF01191417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-realism|Anti-realists]] use the term fragmentalism in arguments that the world does not exist of separable [[entity|entities]], instead consisting of wholes. For example, advocates of this position declare that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The linear deterministic approach to nature and technology promoted a fragmented perception of reality, and a loss of the ability to foresee, to adequately evaluate, in all their complexity, global crises in ecology, civilization and education.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly P. Liferov, Global Education as a Trend Reflecting the Problems of Today and Meeting the Requirements of Tomorrow http://www.indiana.edu/~isre/NEWSLETTER/vol6no2/global.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This term is usually applied to [[reductionism|reductionist]] modes of thought, frequently with the related pejorative term of ''[[scientism]]''. This usage is popular amongst some ecological activists: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is a need now to move away from [[scientism]] and the ideology of cause-and-effect determinism toward a radical [[empiricism]], such as [[William James]] proposed, as an [[epistemology]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;Yunkaporta on Kakkib and Oneness, Tyson Yunkaporta, Friday, January 05, 2007 http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; These perspectives are not new and in the early twentieth century, [[William James]] noted that rationalist science emphasized what he termed fragmentation and disconnection.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin/&gt;
 Such anti-realist rhetoric also underpins many criticisms of the scientific method: &lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific method only acknowledges monophasic consciousness. The method is a specialized system that focuses on studying small and distinctive parts in isolation, which results in fragmented knowledge.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin&gt;Tara W. Lumpkin, ''Perceptual Diversity: Is Polyphasic Consciousness Necessary for Global Survival?'' December 28, 2006, http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An alternative usage of this term is in [[cognitive psychology]]. Here, [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] developed "constructive alternativism" as a form of [[personal construct psychology]], this provided an alternative to what he saw as "accumulative fragmentalism". In this theory, knowledge is seen as the construction of successful mental models of the exterior world, rather than the accumulation of independent "nuggets of truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML and Watts M|title=Constructivist Goggles: Implications for Process in Teaching and Learning Physics|journal=Eur. J. Physics|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0143-0807/9/2/004|volume=9|pages=101–109|year=1988|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/9/2/004|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{emotion}}
'''Gratitude''', '''thankfulness''', or '''gratefulness''', from the Latin word ''gratus'' ‘pleasing, thankful’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gratitude|title=Definition of Gratitude - Oxford Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a feeling of appreciation felt by and/or similar positive response shown by the recipient of kindness, gifts, help, favors, or other types of generosity, towards the giver of such gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gratitude|title=Definition of Gratitude - Cambridge Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The experience of gratitude has historically been a focus of several world [[religion]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Emmons, Robert A., and Cheryl A. Crumpler. "Gratitude as a Human Strength: Appraising the Evidence." Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology 19.1 (2000): 56-69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been a topic of interest to ancient, medieval and modern philosophers, and continues to engage contemporary philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Manela, Tony. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gratitude/ Gratitude.] In Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, edited by Edward N. Zalta, 2015. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gratitude/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The systematic study of gratitude within psychology only began around the year 2000, possibly because psychology traditionally  focused more on understanding distress than on understanding positive emotions. The study of gratitude within psychology has focused on the understanding of the short term experience of the emotion of gratitude (state gratitude), individual differences in how frequently people feel gratitude ([[trait theory|trait]] gratitude), and the relationship between these two aspects.&lt;ref name="WoodEmotion"&gt;Wood, A. M., Maltby, J., Stewart, N., Linley, P. A., &amp; Joseph, S. (2008). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/state%20and%20trait%20gratitude.pdf A social-cognitive model of trait and state levels of gratitude].''Emotion, 8'', 281-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, M. E., Tsang, J. &amp; Emmons, R. A. (2004). Gratitude in intermediate affective terrain: Links of grateful moods to individual differences and daily emotional experience.

==Comparison with indebtedness==
Gratitude is not the same as ''indebtedness''. While both [[emotions]] occur following help, indebtedness occurs when a person perceives that they are under an obligation to make some repayment of compensation for the aid.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, M. S. (1980). ''A theory of indebtedness''. In K. J. Gergen, M. S. Greenberg &amp; R. H. Wills (Eds.), Social exchange: Advances in theory and research: New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotions lead to different actions; indebtedness can motivate the recipient of the aid to avoid the person who has helped them, whereas gratitude can motivate the recipient to seek out their benefactor and to improve their relationship with them.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, P. C., Scheer, J., Ovnicek, M., &amp; Kolts, R. (2006). The debt of gratitude: Dissociating gratitude and indebtedness. ''Cognition and Emotion, 20'', 217-241, {{doi|10.1080/02699930500172291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, J. A. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivator of behavior==
Gratitude may also serve to reinforce future prosocial behavior in benefactors. For example, one experiment found that customers of a jewelry store who were called and thanked showed a subsequent 70% increase in purchases. In comparison, customers who were called and told about a sale showed only a 30% increase in purchases, and customers who were not called at all did not show an increase.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, J. R., Clicque, S. H., Leighton, B. A., &amp; Milton, F. (1976). A test of positive reinforcement of customers. ''Journal of Marketing, 40'', 98-100.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, regular patrons of a restaurant gave bigger tips when servers wrote "Thank you" on their checks.&lt;ref&gt;Rind, B., &amp; Bordia, P. (1995). Effect of server's "Thank you" and personalization on restaurant tipping. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 25'', 745-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious approaches ==
The link between spirituality and gratitude has recently become a popular subject of study. While these two characteristics are certainly not dependent on each other, studies have found that spirituality is capable of enhancing a person’s ability to be grateful and therefore, those who regularly attend religious services or engage in religious activities are more likely to have a greater sense of gratitude in all areas of life.&lt;ref name="McCullough, M.E. 2002"&gt;McCullough, M.E., Emmons, R.A., &amp; Tsang, J. (2002). The grateful disposition: A conceptual and empirical topography. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, 112-127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/labs/emmons/ |title=Highlights from the Research Project of Gratitude and Thankfulness |author1=Emmons, Robert A. |author2=Michael E. McCullough |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=27 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811213042/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/labs/emmons/ |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gratitude is viewed as a prized human propensity in the Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, Baha'i, and Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Worship with gratitude to [[God]] is a common theme in such religions and therefore, the concept of gratitude permeates religious texts, teachings, and traditions. For this reason, it is one of the most common emotions that religions aim to provoke and maintain in followers and is regarded as a universal religious sentiment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Emmons, Robert A., and Teresa T. Kneezel. "Giving Gratitude: Spiritual and Religious Correlates of Gratitude." Journal of Psychology and Christianity 24.2 (2005): 140-48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish conceptions===
In Judaism, gratitude is an essential part of the act of worship and a part of every aspect of a worshiper’s life. According to the Hebrew worldview, all things come from God and because of this, gratitude is extremely important to the followers of Judaism. The Hebrew Scriptures are filled with the idea of gratitude. Two examples included in the psalms are "O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever," and "I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart"  (Ps. 30:12; Ps. 9:1). The Jewish prayers also often incorporate gratitude beginning with the Shema, where the worshiper states that out of gratitude, "You shall love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might" (Deut. 6:5). One of the crucial blessings in the central thrice-daily prayer, the "Amidah", is called "Modim" - "We give thanks to You"; this is also the only blessing which is recited by the congregation together with the leader during their repetition of the Amidah. The concluding prayer, the Alenu, also speaks of gratitude by thanking God for the particular destiny of the Jewish people. Along with these prayers, faithful worshipers recite more than one hundred blessings called berachot throughout the day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In Judaism there is also a major emphasis on gratitude for acts of human kindness and goodness.

===Christian conceptions ===
[[File:GuadalupeNOLA15Oct07Thanks.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[New Orleans]]: Thank you message in the grotto of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] Church; added by those for whom prayer or miracles were granted]]

Gratitude has been said to mold and shape the entire Christian life. [[Martin Luther]] referred to gratitude as "The basic Christian attitude" and today it is still referred to as "the heart of the gospel."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Christians are strongly encouraged to praise and give gratitude to their creator. In Christian gratitude, God is seen as the selfless giver of all good things and because of this, there is a deep sense of gratefulness which enables Christians to share a common bond, shaping all aspects of a follower’s life. Gratitude in Christianity is an acknowledgment of God’s generosity that inspires Christians to shape their own thoughts and actions around such ideals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Instead of simply a sentimental feeling, Christian gratitude is regarded as a virtue that shapes not only emotions and thoughts but also actions and deeds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] writes in his ''A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections'' that gratitude and thankfulness toward God are among the signs of true religion. Because of this interpretation, modern measures of religious spirituality include assessments of thankfulness and gratitude towards God. Allport (1950) suggested that mature religious intentions come from feelings of profound gratitude and Edwards (1746/1959) claimed that the "affection" of gratitude is one of the most accurate ways of finding the presence of God in a person’s life. In a study done by Samuels and Lester (1985) it was contended that in a small sample of Catholic nuns and priests, out of 50 emotions, love and gratitude were the most experienced emotion towards God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In the Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican churches, the most important rite is called the [[Eucharist]]; the name derives from the Greek word eucharistia for thanksgiving.

===Islamic conceptions ===
The Islamic sacred text, The Quran, is filled with the idea of gratitude.  Islam encourages its followers to be grateful and express thanks to God in all circumstances. Islamic teaching emphasizes the idea that those who are grateful will be rewarded with more. A traditional Islamic saying states that, "The first who will be summoned to paradise are those who have praised God in every circumstance"&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist"&gt;Wood, A. M., Joseph, S., &amp; Linley, P. A. (2007). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/gratitude%20psychologist.pdf Gratitude: The parent of all virtues.] ''The Psychologist, 20'', 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran it is also stated in Sura 14 that those who are grateful will be given more by God. The prophet Muhammad also said, "Gratitude for the abundance you have received is the best insurance that the abundance will continue."{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
Many practices of the Islamic faith also encourage gratitude. The Pillar of Islam calling for daily prayer encourages believers to pray to God five times a day in order to thank him for his goodness. The pillar of fasting during the month of Ramadan is for the purpose of putting the believer in a state of gratitude.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Individual differences ==
Much of the recent work psychological research into gratitude has focused on the nature of individual difference in gratitude, and the consequences of being a more or less grateful person.&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist" /&gt; Three [[scale (social sciences)|scales]] have been developed to measure individual differences in gratitude, each of which assesses somewhat different conceptions.&lt;ref name="WoodFactor"&gt;Wood, A. M., Maltby, J., Stewart, N., &amp; Joseph, S. (2008). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Gratitude%20and%20appreciation%20factor%20analysis.pdf Conceptualizing gratitude and appreciation as a unitary personality trait.] ''Personality and Individual Differences, 44'', 619-630.&lt;/ref&gt; The GQ6&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2002"&gt;McCullough, M. E., Emmons, R. A., &amp; Tsang, J. (2002). The grateful disposition: A conceptual and empirical topography.

A recent study showed that each of these scales are actually all measuring the same way of approaching life; this suggests that individual differences in gratitude include all of these components.&lt;ref name="WoodFactor" /&gt;

==Empirical findings==

===Association with well-being===
A large body of recent{{when|date=July 2016}} work has suggested that people who are more grateful have higher levels of [[subjective well-being]]. Grateful people are happier, less depressed, less stressed, and more satisfied with their lives and [[social relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodSatisfaction"&gt;Wood, A. M., Joseph, S., &amp; Maltby, J. (2008).

Gratitude has been said{{By whom|date=March 2013}} to have one of the strongest links with [[mental health]] of any character trait. Numerous studies suggest that grateful people are more likely to have higher levels of happiness and lower levels of stress and depression.&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2004"&gt;McCullough, M. E., Tsang, J., &amp; Emmons, R.A. (2004). Gratitude in Intermediate affective terrain: Links of grateful moods with individual differences and daily emotional experience. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86, 295-309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2015/08/grateful-individuals-tend-to-experience-less-depressive-symptoms-36850|title=Grateful individuals tend to experience less depressive symptoms|website=PsyPost|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many emotions and personality traits are important to well-being, there is evidence that gratitude may be uniquely important. First, a longitudinal study showed that people who were more grateful coped better with a life transition. Specifically, people who were more grateful before the transition were less stressed, less depressed, and more satisfied with their relationships three months later.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Maltby, J., Gillett, R., Linley, P. A., &amp; Joseph, S. (2008). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/gratitude%20longitudinal.pdf The role of gratitude in the development of social support, stress, and depression: Two longitudinal studies.] ''Journal of Research in Personality, 42'', 854-871.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, two recent studies have suggested that gratitude may have a unique relationship with well-being, and can explain aspects of well-being that other personality traits cannot. Both studies showed that gratitude was able to explain more well-being than the [[Big five personality traits|Big Five]] and 30 of the most commonly studied personality traits.&lt;ref name="WoodSatisfaction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodEudamonic" /&gt;

===Relationship to altruism===
Gratitude has also been shown to improve a person’s altruistic tendencies. One study conducted by David DeSteno and Monica Bartlett (2010) found that gratitude is correlated with economic generosity. In this study, using an economic game, increased gratitude was shown to directly mediate increased monetary giving. From these results, this study shows that grateful people are more likely to sacrifice individual gains for communal profit (DeSteno &amp; Bartlett, 2010).  A study conducted by McCullough, Emmons, &amp; Tsang, (2002) found similar correlations between gratitude and empathy, generosity, and helpfulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20364907|year=2010|author1=Desteno|first1=D|title=Gratitude as moral sentiment: Emotion-guided cooperation in economic exchange|journal=Emotion|volume=10|issue=2|pages=289–93|last2=Bartlett|first2=M.

===Psychological interventions===
Given that gratitude appears to be a strong determinant of people's well-being, several psychological interventions have been developed to increase gratitude.&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, R. A. &amp; McCullough, M. E. (2003). Counting blessings versus burdens: An experimental investigation of gratitude and subjective well-being in daily life. ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]],  84'', 377-389. [http://psy.miami.edu/faculty/mmccullough/Gratitude-Related20Stuff/Emmons_McCullough_2003_JPSP.pdf (electronic copy)]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Watkins and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, P. C., Woodward, K., Stone, T., &amp; Kolts, R. L. (2003). Gratitude and happiness: Development of a measure of gratitude, and relationships with subjective well-being. ''Social Behavior and Personality, 31'', 431-452.&lt;/ref&gt; had participants test a number of different gratitude exercises, such as thinking about a living person for whom they are grateful, writing about someone for whom they are grateful, and writing a letter to deliver to someone for whom they are grateful. Participants in the control condition were asked to describe their living room. Participants who engaged in a gratitude exercise showed increases in their experiences of positive emotion immediately after the exercise, and this effect was strongest for participants who were asked to think about a person for whom they are grateful. Participants who had grateful personalities to begin with showed the greatest benefit from these gratitude exercises. In another study concerning gratitude, participants were randomly assigned to one of six therapeutic intervention conditions designed to improve the participants' overall quality of life (Seligman et al., 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P., Steen, T. A., Park, N.,&amp; Peterson, C. (2005). Positive psychology progress: Empirical validation of interventions. ''American Psychologist'', 60, 410-421.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these conditions, it was found that the biggest short-term effects came from a "gratitude visit" where participants wrote and delivered a letter of gratitude to someone in their life. This condition showed a rise in happiness scores by 10 percent and a significant fall in depression scores, results which lasted up to one month after the visit. Out of the six conditions, the longest lasting effects were associated with the act of writing "[[gratitude journal]]s" where participants were asked to write down three things they were grateful for every day. These participants’ happiness scores also increased and continued to increase each time they were tested periodically after the experiment. In fact, the greatest benefits were usually found to occur around six months after treatment began. This exercise was so successful that although participants were only asked to continue the journal for a week, many participants continued to keep the journal long after the study was over. Similar results have been found from studies conducted by Emmons and McCullough (2003)&lt;ref name="McCullough, M.E. 2002"/&gt; and Lyubomirsky et. all. (2005). See also [[gratitude journal]].

Recently (2013), the [[Greater Good Science Center]] at the [[University of California|University of California, Berkeley]], has been offering awards for dissertation-level research projects with the greatest potential to advance the science and practice of gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/expandinggratitude/dissertation_research_awards Greater Good Science Center: Research awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
According to [[Cicero]], "Gratitude is not only the greatest of the virtues but the parent of all others." Multiple studies have shown the correlation between gratitude and increased wellbeing not only for the individual but for all people involved.&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The positive psychology movement has embraced these studies and in an effort to increase overall well-being, has begun to make an effort to incorporate exercises to increase gratitude into the movement. Although in the past gratitude has been neglected by psychology, in recent years much progress has been made in studying gratitude and its positive effects.

In mathematics, a '''handle decomposition of a 3-manifold''' allows simplification of the original [[3-manifold]] into pieces which are easier to study.

==Heegaard splittings==
An important method used to decompose into [[handlebody|handlebodies]] is the [[Heegaard splitting]], which gives us  a decomposition in two handlebodies of equal genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Quantum invariant|Quantum Invariants]] of Knots and 3-manifolds|first=Vladimir G. |last=Turaev|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|year= 1994|isbn=3-11-013704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As an example: [[lens space]]s are orientable 3-spaces, and allow decomposition into two '''solid-tori''' which are genus-one-handlebodies. The genus one non-orientable space is a space which is the union of two [[solid Klein bottle]]s and corresponds to the twisted product of the 2-sphere and the 1-sphere: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S^2\tilde{\times}S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Orientability==
Each orientable 3-manifold is the union of exactly two orientable handlebodies; meanwhile, each non-orientable one needs three orientable handlebodies.

==Heegaard genus==
The minimal genus of the glueing boundary determines what is known as the [[Heegaard genus]]. For non-orientable spaces an interesting invariant is the [[trigenus|tri-genus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="86674">[[File:CincinnatiCustomsHouse.jpg|thumb|300px|[[United States Custom House and Post Office (Cincinnati)|Cincinnati Customs House]] {{circa}} 1850–60&lt;br&gt;Governments were one of the earliest users of weights and measures – often for the purpose of tax collection.  In the United States the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] rather than [[United States Congress|Congress]] took the lead in establishing a standard [[system of weights and measures]].]]

The [[imperial units|imperial system of measurement]] and the [[United States customary units|US customary system of measurement]] are both derived from an earlier [[English units|English system of measurement]] which in turn can be traced back to [[Ancient Roman units of measurement]], and [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] units of measure.

The US Customary system of units was developed and used in the United States after the [[American Revolution]], based on a subset of the English units used in the [[Thirteen Colonies]].  The Imperial system of units was developed and used in the United Kingdom beginning in 1826, and subsequently used in the rest of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. US Customary units are the predominant system of units in the United States, but the [[metric system]] has, to varying degrees, replaced the imperial system in all Commonwealth countries.

Most of the units of measure have been adopted in one way or another since the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066). The units of linear measure have changed the least – the [[yard]] (which replaced the [[ell]]) and the [[chain (unit)|chain]] were measures derived in England. The [[foot (unit)|foot]] used by craftsman supplanted the longer foot used in agriculture.  The agricultural foot was reduced to {{fract|10|11}} of its former size, causing the [[Rod (unit)|rod, pole or perch]] to become {{fract|16|1|2}} (rather than the older 15) agricultural feet.  The [[furlong]] and the [[acre]], once it became a measure of the size of a piece of land rather than its value, remained relatively unchanged. In the last thousand years, three principal pounds were used in England. The [[troy pound]] (5760 [[grain (unit)|grains]]) was used for precious metals, the [[Apothecaries' system|apothecaries' pound]], (also 5760 grains) was used by [[pharmacist]]s and the [[avoirdupois pound]] (7000 grains) was used for general purposes. The apothecaries and troy pounds are divided into 12 ounces (of 480 grains) while the avoirdupois pound has 16 ounces (of 437.5 grains). The unit of volume, the [[gallon]], has different values in the United States and in the United Kingdom – the US fluid gallon being about 0.83 imperial gallons and the US dry gallon being about 0.97 imperial gallons.

Both systems of measure were widely used in [[mechanical engineering]], though not in [[electrical engineering]]. Some units of measure such as the [[horsepower]] or the [[British thermal unit]] (BTU) have special names but by and large unit names are generated from their constituent components – for example, [[pounds per square inch]]. In contrast, the [[metric system]] has a special name for pressure—the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]].

After the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] the units of measurement in the [[United States]] developed into what is now known as [[United States customary units|customary units]]. The United Kingdom overhauled its system of measurement in 1826, when it introduced the [[imperial units|imperial system of units]]. This resulted in the two countries having different gallons. Later in the century, efforts were made to align the definition of the [[pound (avoirdupois)|pound]] and the [[yard]] in the two countries by using copies of the standards adopted by the British Parliament in 1855. However, these standards were of poor quality compared with those produced for the [[Convention of the Metre]]. In 1960 the two countries agreed to common definitions of the yard and the pound based on definitions of the [[metre]] and the [[kilogram]]. This change, which amounted to a few parts per million, had little effect in the United Kingdom, but resulted in the United States having two slightly different systems of linear measure – the international system, and the surveyors system.

== English units of measure==
{{main|English units}}
[[File:Aethelstan.jpg|thumb|120px|Silver penny of Aethelstan (924-939) from which the name ''[[pennyweight]]'' (dwt) was derived]]

English units of measure, were derived from a combination of [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman]], [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolignian]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] units of measure.  They were a precursor to both the [[Imperial units|Imperial system of units]] (first defined in 1824, to take effect in 1826) and [[United States customary units]] which evolved from English Units from 1776 onwards.&lt;ref name=Smoot/&gt;

The earliest records of English units of measure involve the weight (and therefore the value) of [[Saxons|Saxon]] coins.  The [[penny]] introduced by [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] was about 20 grains (1.296&amp;nbsp;g). [[Edward the Elder]] increased the weight of the English penny to 26 grains (1.685&amp;nbsp;g), thereby aligning it with the penny of [[Charlemagne]].  By the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] (1066), it had decreased to 24 grains (1.555&amp;nbsp;g).  This value was subsequently called the ''[[pennyweight]]'' and formed the basis of the [[Troy weight|Troy units of weight]]—the [[troy ounce]] used to this day for weighting precious metals.&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|44–48}} [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1272–1307) broke the link between a coin's value and its weight when he debased the English coinage by introducing a [[Groat (coin)|groat]] (four pence) which weighed of 89 grains rather than the expected 96 grains. The groat was further devalued in the 1350s when its weight was reduced to 72 grains.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite book

During Saxon times land was measured both in terms of its economic value and in terms of its size. The [[Domesday Book]] used the [[Hide (unit)|hide]], an economic unit of measure. In other references the [[furlong]] and the [[rood]] appear to be units related to ploughing procedures. Of particular interest was the rood which was 15 North German feet in length, the North German foot being equivalent to 335&amp;nbsp;mm (13.2&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|50}} Craftsmen, on the other hand used a shorter Roman foot.

This law, attributed to either Henry III or his successor Edward I, instituted a new foot that was exactly {{frac|10|11}} the length of the old foot, with corresponding reductions in the size of the yard, ell, inch, and barleycorn.

In 1324 [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] systematized units of length by defining the inch as 3 barleycorns, the foot as 12 inches, the yard as 3 feet, the perch as 5{{frac|1|2}} yards, and the acre as an area 4 by 40 perches.&lt;ref name=Smoot&gt;{{cite book

The units were however redefined many times – during Henry VIII's time standard yards and ells made of [[brass]] were manufactured, during [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s time these were replaced with standards made of [[bronze]] and in 1742, after scientific comparisons showed a variation of up to 0.2% from the mean, a definitive standard yard was proposed (but not manufactured).&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|122–123}}&lt;ref name=knight&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Charles|title=The Penny magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|volume=9|year=1840|pages=221–222|publisher=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BHnAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the medieval era agricultural products, apart from wool, were mostly sold by volume, with various [[bushel]]s and [[gallon]]s being introduced over the years for different commodities. In the early fourteenth century the wool trade traditionally used the [[avoirdupois]] system of weights, a process that was formalized by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1340.

During the [[Tudor period]], numerous reforms were made to English weights and measures. In 1496 [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] ordered that reference copies of the yard, pound and gallon should be made of brass and distributed to specified towns and cities throughout the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;{{rp|36}} Many weights and measures that had crept into use were banned: in 1527 [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] banned the [[Tower pound]] (5400 grains against the 5760 grains of the apothecaries and troy pounds) and the [[Pound (mass)#Merchants' pound|mercantile pound]] (6750 grains against the 7000 grains of the pound avoirdupois)&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|105}} and in 1592 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] ordered the use of the "statute mile" (5280 feet against the 5000 feet of the London or Old English mile).&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|123}}

Under the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], Scotland, which had developed its own system of weights and measures independently of England, abandoned them in favour of English weights and measures.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;{{rp|90–91}} The [[Acts of Union 1800]] which united Ireland with Great Britain had less of an effect on weights and measures—Irish weights and measures having been based on the English foot and pound avoirdupois since 1351, though the Irish acre and mile were based on a perch of 7 yards, not {{fraction|5|1|2}} yards as in England.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;{{rp|116}}

By the early nineteenth century many commodities had their own set of units, the units of measure for the wool and cloth industries had units of measure specific to those commodities, albeit derived on the pound avoirdupois or the foot while wine and beer used units with the same names but different sizes – the wine gallon being 231 cubic inches and the beer or ale gallon being 282 cubic inches. Agricultural produce was sold by the bushel which was based on yet another gallon – the dry gallon of 268.8 cubic inches. Even though not explicitly permitted by statute, many markets used bushels based on weight rather than volume when selling wheat and barley.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book

The British [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1824 repealed all existing British weights and measures legislation, some dating back to the 1300s, and redefined existing units of measure. In particular, a new standard yard and troy pound were manufactured as the standards for length and weight respectively. A new measure, the [[gallon|imperial gallon]], which replaced the many gallons in use,&lt;ref group = Note&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson]], in his ''[[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States]]'' identified 13 different gallons and 13 different bushels in used in Great Britain in 1790. The gallons ranged from the wine gallon of {{convert|224|cuin|L}} to the beer and ale gallon of {{convert|282|cuin|L}}. The only consistency was 8&amp;nbsp;gallons to the bushel.&lt;/ref&gt; was defined as being the volume of 10&amp;nbsp;pounds of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F which, after the authorized experiments, was found to be 277.274 cubic inches. The [[bushel]], which like the gallon, had definitions reflecting the various gallons, was defined as 8&amp;nbsp;imperial gallons.&lt;ref name=1824Act&gt;{{cite book

The 1824 Act also introduced some changes to the administration of the standards of weights and measures: previously Parliament had been given the custody of the standards but the act passed this responsibility on to the [[Exchequer]]. The act also set up an inspectorate for weights and measures.&lt;ref name=1824Act/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt;

The standard yard and pound were lost in 1834 when a fire partially destroyed the Palace of Westminster. Following a report published in 1841 by a commission new standard yard and pound were manufactured using the best available secondary sources. Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard was a pound avoirdupois. They were accepted by an Act of Parliament as the standards for length and weight in 1855. Following the debacle over the different gallons that had been adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom thirty years earlier, one of the copies of the standard yard was offered to and accepted by the United States Government.&lt;ref name=MacLean&gt;{{cite conference

The 1835 Weights and Measures Act tidied up a number of shortcomings in the 1825 Act. In response to representations from traders, the [[stone (unit)|stone]] and the [[hundredweight]] were formally defined as being 14&amp;nbsp;pounds and 112&amp;nbsp;pounds respectively and the experiment of defining a "heaped" measure as outlined in the 1824 Act was abandoned.&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt; Not all trades followed the use of the 14&amp;nbsp;stone&amp;mdash;Britten, in 1880 for example, catalogued a number of different values of the stone in various British towns and cities ranging from 4&amp;nbsp;lb to 26&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Weights and Measures Act of 1878 overhauled the inspection regime of weights and measures used in trade. The act also reaffirmed the use of the brass standard yard and platinum standard pound as the standards for use in the United Kingdom, reaffirmed the use of apothecaries measures in the pharmaceutical industry, reaffirmed the 1824 definition of the gallon, removed the Troy pound from the list of legal units of measure, added the fathom to the list of legal units and fixed the ratio of metric to imperial units at one metre being equal to 39.3708 inches and one kilogram being equal to 15432.3487 grains (1&amp;nbsp;lb = 0.453592654&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Weights and Measures Act of 1878 effectively prohibited the use of metric weights for trade, the United Kingdom having declined to sign the [[Metre Convention|Convention of the Metre]] three years previously.

Under the Weights and Measures Act of 1824 custody of the standard yard and pound and custody of the administration of weights and measures was entrusted to the [[Exchequer]] but verification was administered locally. The 1835 Act formally described the office and duties of Inspectors of Weights and Measures and required every borough to appoint such officers and the 1866 Act passed responsibility for weights and measures to the [[Board of Trade]]. In 1900 the Board of Trade established the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) to provide laboratory facilities for weights and measures.&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt;

After the passage of the 1897 Act, weights and measures in the United Kingdom remained relatively unchanged until after the [[Second World War]]. By the middle of the century the difference of 2 parts per million between the British and US standard yards was causing problems—in 1900 a tolerance of 10 parts per million was adequate for science, but by 1950 this tolerance had shrunk to 0.25 parts per million.&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|155}} In 1960 representatives from the NPL and other national laboratories from the United States and Commonwealth agreed to redefine the yard as being exactly 0.9144&amp;nbsp;metres, an action that was ratified by the British Government as part of the 1963 Weights and Measures Act.

[[Metrication in the United Kingdom]] began in the mid-1960s. Initially this metrication was voluntary and by 1985 many traditional and imperial units of measure had been voluntarily removed from use in the retail trade. The Weights and Measures Act of 1985 formalized their removal for use in trade, though imperial units were retained for use on road signs and the most common imperial weights such as the foot, inch, pound, ounce, gallon and pint continued to be used in the retail trade for the sale of loose goods or goods measured or weighed in front of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK

[[File:Bushel Table of States.jpg|thumb|250px|Nineteenth century list of various bushels by state and commodity]]
Throughout the nineteenth century individual states developed their own standards and in particular a variety of bushels based on weight (mass) rather than volume emerged, dependent on both commodity and state.  This lack of uniformity crippled inter-state trade and in 1905 the National Bureau of Standards called a meeting of the states to discuss the lack of uniform standards and in many cases, a means of regulatory oversight. A meeting was held the following year and subsequently became an annual gathering known as the [[National Conference on Weights and Measures]] (NCWM).  In 1915 the conference published its first model standards.&lt;ref name="OurHistory"/&gt;  The bushel was not fully standardized and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] still (May 2013) uses different bushels for different commodities—a bushel of [[Maize|corn]] being 56&amp;nbsp;lb, a bushel of [[oat]]s 38&amp;nbsp;lb and a bushel of [[soybean]]s 60&amp;nbsp;lb and a bushel of [[Winter wheat|red winter wheat]] (both hard and soft) also 60&amp;nbsp;lb.

During the twentieth century the principal change in the customary system of weights and measures was an agreement between NIST and the corresponding bodies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, signed in 1960, that redefined the yard and the pound in terms of the metre and the kilogram respectively.  These new units became known as the international yard and pound. Congress has neither endorsed nor repudiated this action. (See {{section link||Metric equivalents}}).

Imperial and US customary units have long been used in many branches of engineering. 
Two of the earliest such units of measure to come into use were the ''[[horsepower]]'' and the [[Fahrenheit|''degree Fahrenheit'']]. The ''horsepower'' was defined by [[James Watt]] in 1782 as the power required to raise 33,000 pounds of water through a height of one foot in one minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1777 the [[Royal Society]], under the chairmanship of [[Henry Cavendish]], proposed the definition of the Fahrenheit scale be modified such that the temperature corresponding to the melting point of ice be 32&amp;nbsp;°F and the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric conditions be 212&amp;nbsp;°F.

The [[British thermal unit]] (Btu) is defined as the heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|British thermal unit}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in use before 1859 as a unit of heat based on imperial units rather than the metric units used by the French&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1873 a committee of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] under the chairmanship of [[Lord Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] introduced the concept of a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherence]] into units of measure and proposed the names [[dyne]] and [[erg]] as the units of [[force]] and [[Work (physics)|work]] in the [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system of units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*The [[dyne]] is the force needed to accelerate a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;g by 1&amp;nbsp;cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The [[erg]] is the work done when a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;g is moved a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;cm when opposed by a force of 1&amp;nbsp;dyne
Since all the constants in these relationships is unity, the units are said to be [[coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]].&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], older brother of William Thomson introduced the term [[poundal]] as a coherent unit of force in the [[Foot–pound–second system]] (FPS) of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|poundal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent FPS unit of work was the [[foot-poundal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Other systems for the measurement of dynamic quantities that used imperial and US customary units are the [[British Gravitational System]] (BG) proposed by [[Arthur Mason Worthington]] and the [[English Engineering Units|English Engineering System]] (EE). Both systems depend on the [[gravitational acceleration]], and use the [[pound-force]] as the unit of force but use different approaches when applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. In the BG system, force, rather than mass is a [[SI base unit|base unit]] while the [[Slug (unit)|slug]] is a derived unit of [[inertia]] (rather than mass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Both these approaches led to slight variations in the meaning of the pound-force (and also of the kilogram force) in different parts of the world.  Various countries published standard values that should be used for ''g'' and in 1901 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] published a standard value for ''g'' that should be used in the "International Service of Weights and Measures", namely 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (32.174&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) which is equal to the value of ''g'' at 45° latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Newton's second law]] in these systems becomes:
:'''BG:''' Force (lbf) = inertia (slugs) × acceleration (ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:'''EE:''' Force (lbf) = mass (lb) × ''g'' × acceleration (ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

[[File:StandardYardEnd.jpg|thumb|End of the Standard yard of 1855 showing the gold plugs which bore the markings for the standard yard]]
The standard yard and [Troy] pound were lost in 1834 when a [[Burning of Parliament|fire partially destroyed the Palace of Westminster]]. Following a report published in 1841 by a commission new standard yard and pound were manufactured using the best available secondary sources. Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard, made of platinum, was a pound avoirdupois. The new yard, slightly longer than a yard to prevent wear as was experienced with the ''[[mètre des Archives]]'', was made of brass and had two gold plugs close to its end. Scratch marks on the plugs denoted the length of the yard. They were accepted by an Act of Parliament as the standards for length and weight in 1855. Following the debacle over the different gallons that had been adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom thirty years earlier, one of the copies of the standard yard and avoirdupois pound (known in the United States as the "Mint pound") was offered to and accepted by the United States Government.&lt;ref name=MacLean/&gt;

The definition of units of weight above a pound differed between the customary and the imperial system - the imperial system employed the stone of 14&amp;nbsp;pounds, the hundredweight of 8&amp;nbsp;stone&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In this context, the plural is "stone", not "stones"&lt;/ref&gt; and the ton of 2240&amp;nbsp;pounds (20 hundredweight), while the customary system of units did not employ the stone but has a hundredweight of 100&amp;nbsp;pounds and a ton of 2000&amp;nbsp;pounds. In international trade, the ton of 2240&amp;nbsp;pounds was often referred to as the "long ton" and the ton of 2000&amp;nbsp;pounds as the "short ton".  When using customary units, it is usual to express [[body weight]] in pounds, but when using imperial units,  to use [[Stone (unit)|stones and pounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his ''[[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States]]'', [[Thomas Jefferson]], then [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], identified 14 different gallons in English statutes varying in size from 224 to 282 cubic inches (3.67 to 4.62 litres).&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; In 1832, in the absence of any direction by [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury]] chose the second smallest gallon, the "Queen Anne gallon" of 231 cubic inches (3.785 litres) to be the official gallon in the United States for fiscal purposes. Sixteen US fluid ounces make a US pint (8 pints equals 1 gallon in both customary and imperial systems). During the reform of Weights and measures legislation in the United Kingdom in 1824, old gallons were replaced by the new imperial gallon which was defined to be the volume to 10 pounds of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F (17&amp;nbsp;°C) and determined experimentally to be 277.42 cubic inches (4.546 litres).  Twenty imperial fluid ounces make an imperial pint, the imperial fluid ounce being 0.96 US fluid ounces.

The US Customary system of units makes use of set of dry units of capacity that have a similar set of names&lt;ref group = Note&gt;NIST does not catalogue a "dry gallon" in its list of US units of measure.&lt;/ref&gt; to those of liquid capacity, though different volumes - the dry pint having a volume of 33.6 cubic inches (550&amp;nbsp;ml) against the US fluid pint's volume of 28.875 cubic inches (473&amp;nbsp;ml) and the imperial pint of 34.68 cubic inches (568&amp;nbsp;ml).  The imperial system of measure does not have an equivalent to the US customary system of "dry measure".

In the international commodities markets, the [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] ({{gaps|42|US|gallons}}, ~159&amp;nbsp;litres) is used in both London and New York/Chicago for trading in crude oil and the [[troy ounce]] (~31.10&amp;nbsp;grams) for trading in precious metals, otherwise the London markets use metric units and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] uses customary units.

Prior to metrication, the units of measure used in the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]  were the same as those used in the United Kingdom while those used in the [[British Commonwealth]] and in [[South Africa]] were in most cases a subset of those used in the United Kingdom with, in certain cases, local differences.

Unless otherwise specified, the units of measure quoted below were used in both the United States, the United Kingdom. The SI equivalents are quoted to four significant figures.

In 1893 the United States fixed the yard at {{fract|3600|3937}} metres, making the yard 0.9144018 metres and 1896 the British authorities fixed the yard as being 0.9143993 metres. At the time the discrepancy of about two parts per million was considered to be insignificant. In 1960, the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada and South Africa standardised their units of length by defining the [[international yard and pound|"international yard"]] as being 0.9144 metres exactly. This change affected land surveyors in the United States and led to the old units being renamed "survey feet", "survey miles" etc.  However the introduction of the metric-based Ordnance Survey National Grid Surveyors in the United Kingdom in 1938 meant that British surveyors were unaffected by the change.

===Units of area===
The introduction of the international yard in 1960 had no effect on British measurements of area, however US measurements of land area, as opposed to other measurements of area (such as pounds per ''square inch'') continued to be based on the US statute yard.

Several of the units of liquid volume or capacity have similar names, but have different volumes – and in the case of fluid ounces and pints, different relations. In addition the definitions of the imperial and US gallons are based on different concepts – the imperial gallon is defined in terms of the volume occupied by a specified mass of water, while the US gallon is specified in terms of cubic linear measure.

Units of weight in both the imperial and US customary system always used the same standard, though differences in multiples of the avoirdupois pound developed in the nineteenth century. Both systems used the three different scales – the avoirdupois system for general use, the troy system for precious metals and the apothecaries system in the pharmacy industry. The term "weight" and "mass" are used interchangeably in the imperial and US customary systems, though since the linking of the pound to the kilogram in 19xx, the pound technically became a mass, not a weight.

=== Named units of energy, power and temperature===
The names of most derived units of measure in the imperial and US customary systems are concatenations of the constituent parts of the unit of measure, for example the unit of pressure is the ''[[Pounds per square inch|pounds [force] per square inch]]''. Apart from the [[poundal]], most of the named units of measure are [[Coherence (units of measurement)|non-coherent]], but were adopted due to traditional working practice.&lt;ref group = Note&gt;For example, the [[horsepower]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other units===
In addition to those catalogued above, there are literally hundreds of other units of measure in both the imperial and the US customary system of measurement – many are specific to a particular industry of application. Such units could, in theory, be replaced by general units of the same dimension, for example the [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] (42 US gallons, 34.97 imperial gallons or 159.0 litres) used in the oil industry has the dimension of volume and could be replaced by the gallon, cubic metre or litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The definitions of [[potential difference]] ([[volt]]), [[electric current]] ([[ampere]]), [[electrical resistance]] ([[ohm]]) were defined in terms of metric units, international agreement having been reached at a series of IEC Congress in Chicago between 1881 and 1906 when the electrical industry was in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, the units of measurement used in the [[Radiation|radiological]] industry were defined in terms of metric units, agreement first having been reached at the second International Congress of Radiology at Stockholm (1928).&lt;ref name=ISR_History&gt;{{cite web

==Current status==

Since its inception, the [[metric system]] has displaced the traditional system of units in many countries. In the 1960s a [[metrication]] program was initiated in most English-speaking countries, resulting in either the partial or total displacement of the imperial system or the US customary system of measure in those countries. The current status of imperial and US customary units, as summarised by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]], is that "the SI metric system is now the official system of units in the United Kingdom, while the customary units are still predominantly used in the United States".&lt;ref name=NISTB&gt;{{cite journal
|url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/upload/AppB-12-hb44-final.pdf

|publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)
|title = NIST Handbook 44 – Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices
|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is however not as clear-cut as this. In the United States, for example, the metric system is the predominant system of measure in certain fields such as automobile manufacture even though customary units are used in aircraft manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{As of|2013|6}} the imperial and US customary systems of measurement were dependent on the [[International system of units|SI]] for their formal definitions, the yard being defined as 0.9144&amp;nbsp;[[metre]]s exactly, the pound avoirdupois as {{val|0.45359237}} [[kilogram]]s exactly while both systems of measure share the definition of the [[second]].

== Art career ==
Various critics and publications have spoken of the direction and impact of Channa's work. Asim Akhtar in ''Pause Play'' wrote, "There is a revolutionary lexicography behind Channa’s visual vocabulary that is deeply rooted in the syntax and morphology of that visual modernity, and without it one will never learn how to read his pictures. His art is the very vision of an alterity that sets the political tyranny of language off balance – and with that liberates those who have gathered around the festive occasion of his art."&lt;ref&gt;Asim Akhtar. PAUSE PLAY. Libas international Magazine, Volume 23 issue 2010. Lahore&lt;/ref&gt; 
In ''Starring: The Artist''', Quddus Mirza said, "The interplay of obvious and unusualness makes his work, interesting and intriguing."&lt;ref&gt;2009. Mirza, Quddus Starring: The Artist. IVS Publication Karachi.&lt;/ref&gt;
Reflecting on the focus of his work and its impact, Yee-Wan Koon in ''MUSE'' wrote, "Imran Channa's work is based on historical perspectives. He questions the authenticity of history, which is constructed and manipulated by the power."

The art critic Maheen Bashir Adam Jee wrote in the article "messages for The Discerning" that: "Channa’s work, ‘Making of the History,’ defies the norm with its very title. The deliberate inclusion of “the” in the title challenges more than just grammar. Channa questions the veracity of the Badshahnama – a tale of kings, commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan – and the practice of getting one’s history written under one’s own auspices. The authenticity of Badshahnama’s account, on the making of the Taj Mahal, was first called into question by historian [[P. N. Oak]], who asserted that the Taj Mahal was, in fact, an ancient Hindu temple of Lord Shiva, usurped for Queen Mumtaz Mahal."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2010/05/messages-for-the-discerning/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irrationality''' is [[cognition]], thinking, talking, or acting without inclusion of [[rationality]]. It is more specifically described as an action or opinion given through inadequate use of [[reason]], or through emotional distress or cognitive deficiency. The term is used, usually pejoratively, to describe thinking and actions that are, or appear to be, less useful, or more illogical than other more rational alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Margaret. Male and Female: The Classic Study of the Sexes (1949) Quill (HarperCollins) 1998 edition: {{ISBN|0-688-14676-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fletcher |first=Joyce |title=Castrating the Female Advantage: Feminist Standpoint Research and Management Science |journal=Journal of Management Inquiry 3 |number=1 |date=March 1994 |pages=74–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrational behaviors of individuals include taking offense or becoming angry about a situation that has not yet occurred, expressing emotions exaggeratedly (such as crying hysterically), maintaining unrealistic expectations, engaging in irresponsible conduct such as problem intoxication, disorganization, and falling victim to [[confidence trick]]s. People with a [[mental illness]] like [[schizophrenia]] may exhibit irrational [[paranoia]].

These more contemporary normative conceptions of what constitutes a manifestation of irrationality are difficult to demonstrate empirically because it is not clear by whose standards we are to judge the behavior rational or irrational.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Explanation of occurrence==
The study of irrational behavior is of interest in fields such as [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[economics]], [[game theory]], and [[evolutionary psychology]], as well as of practical interest to the practitioners of [[advertising]] and [[propaganda]].

Theories of irrational behavior include:
* People's actual [[Interest (emotion)|interests]] differ from what they [[Belief|believe]] to be their interests.
* Mechanisms that have evolved to give optimal behavior in normal conditions lead to irrational behavior in abnormal conditions.
* Situations are outside of one's ordinary circumstances, where one may experience [[panic|intense levels]] of fear, or may regress to a [[fight-or-flight]] mentality.
* People fail to realize the irrationality of their actions and believe they are acting perfectly rationally, possibly due to flaws in their reasoning.
* Apparently irrational decisions are actually optimal, but made [[unconsciously]] on the basis of "hidden" interests that are not known to the conscious [[mind]].
* People have the inability to comprehend the social consequences of one's own actions, possibly due in part to a lack of [[empathy]].
* Some people find themselves in this condition by living "double" lives. They try to put on one "mask" for one group of people and another for a different group of people. Many will become confused as to which they really are or which they wish to become.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Factors which affect rational behavior include:
* [[Stress (medicine)|Stress]], which in turn may be emotional or physical
* The introduction of a new or unique situation
* Intoxication
* Peers who convey irrational thoughts as necessary standards for social acceptance.

==Intentional==
Irrationality is not always viewed as a negative. [[Dada]] [[Surrealist]] art movements embraced irrationality as a means to "reject reason and logic". [[André Breton]], for example, argued for a rejection of pure logic and reason which are seen as responsible for many contemporary social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screensite.org/courses/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm |title=Manifesto of Surrealism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401002841/http://www.screensite.org/courses/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm |archivedate=2009-04-01 |website=ScreenSite |year=1999 |origyear=First published 1924 |first=André |last=Breton |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In science fiction literature, the progress of pure rationality is viewed as a quality which may lead civilization ultimately toward a scientific future dependent on technology. Irrationality in this case, is a positive factor which helps to balance excessive reason.

In psychology, excessive rationality without creativity may be viewed as a form of [[self-control]] and protection. Certain problems, such as death and loss, may have no rational solution when they are being experienced.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} We may seek logical explanations for such events, when in fact the proper emotional response is grief.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Irrationality is thus a means of freeing the mind toward purely imaginative solutions, to break out of historic patterns of dependence into new patterns that allow one to move on.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Irrationalist==
''Irrationalist'' is a wide term. It may be applied to mean "one without [[rationality]]", for their beliefs or ideas. Or, more precisely, it may mean someone who openly rejects some aspect of [[rationalism]], variously defined.  It can be seen as either a negative quality, used pejoratively, or a positive quality: For example, [[religious faith]] may variably be seen by some as a virtue which doesn't need to be rational (see [[fideism]]), while others (even of the same religious tradition) may view their faiths as being rational, favoring [[rationalism]].

Also, it might be considered irrationalist to gamble or buy a [[lottery ticket]], on the basis that the [[expected value]] is negative.

Irrational thought was seen in Europe as part of the reaction against [[Continental rationalism]]. For example, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] is sometimes classified as an irrationalist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==In philosophy==
[[Ancient Greek philosophy]] established a fundamental differentiation between logical "true" assumptions of the universe and irrational "false" statements or mere opinions based on emotion or sensorial experience. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta has shown that Greek philosophy thus founded a dual cultural system based on rationality as the domain of philosophy and science versus "irrational" emotion and sensuality as domains of literature and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationalität. Eine Weltgeschichte. Europäische Kulturgeschichte und Globalisierung|publisher=Fink|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the irrational emotions as stirred up in literature threaten the rationality of human beings, in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' [[Plato]] expelled poets from the state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In the later history of philosophy this opposition of rationality and the irrational was renewed as a methodological differentiation by [[Descartes]], but reversed by Pascal in his statement: “Le coeur a ses raisons, que la raison ne connait point” (“The heart has its reasons which reason does not know”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pensées, Nr. 277|author=Pascal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal thus asserted a specific rationality of the "irrational" emotions. The philosophy of [[sensualism]] ([[John Locke]], among others) underlined the importance of the senses as the source of human perception and cognition.

The 19th-century German philosopher [[Julius Bahnsen]] asserted that all thought processes, desires and actions ultimately led to irresolvable contradictions which stem from the inherent irrationality of being. Years earlier, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] had theorized that despite some traces of rationality in the world, the "dark ground" of being itself rested in an irrational will that could not be explained, only described in an [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] manner. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] picked up on this idea and completely fleshed out the concept of an irrational will as a cause of existence, by founding his entire metaphysics and explaining the variety of physical phenomena precisely with this underlying, unconscious and dynamic notion of [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|will]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] gave some remit to irrationality in his ''Concluding Scientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments'', where he claimed that 'Subjectivity is Truth'. Rather than allowing reason to do our choosing for us, Kierkegaard argued that irrational leaps of faith could be more useful, as they were more [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] (although, he never used the word 'authentic'), and thus gave more meaning to life. Objectivity, like reason, was opposed to subjectivity, and thus could not be said to give any meaning to anyone's life. Although he never dismissed rationality in its entirety, Kierkegaard argued that we could not allow rationality to make our decisions for us. In this, and to some degree, he offers a vindication of irrationality.

==In literature==
Much subject matter in literature can be seen as an expression of human longing for the irrational. The [[Romanticism|Romantics]] valued irrationality over what they perceived as the sterile, calculating and emotionless philosophy which they thought to have been brought about by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven |last=Kreis |url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture16a.html |title=Lecture 16: The Romantic Era |publisher=Historyguide.org |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dadaists and Surrealists later used irrationality as a basis for their art. The disregard of reason and preference for dream states in [[Surrealism]] was an exaltation of the irrational and the rejection of logic.

Mythology nearly always incorporates elements of fantasy and the supernatural; however myths are largely accepted by the societies that create them, and only come to be seen as irrational through the spyglass of time and by other cultures. But though mythology serves as a way to rationalize the universe in symbolic and often anthropomorphic ways, a pre-rational and irrational way of thinking can be seen as tacitly valued in mythology's supremacy of the imagination, where rationality as a philosophical method has not been developed.

On the other side the irrational is often depicted from a rational point of view in all types of literature, provoking amusement, contempt, disgust, hatred, awe, and many other reactions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== In psychotherapy ==
{{See also|Cognitive distortions}}
The term ''irrational'' is often used in [[psychotherapy]] and the concept of irrationality is especially known in [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] originated and developed by American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]. In this approach, the term ''irrational'' is used in a slightly different way than in general. Here irrationality is defined as the tendency and leaning that humans have to act, emote and think in ways that are inflexible, unrealistic, absolutist and most importantly self-defeating and socially defeating and destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One psychotherapist describes the overlapping of irrationality and psychotherapy:  &lt;blockquote&gt;I didn't understand enough about them [patients] or how they thought even to begin to reach them. Listening to their stories, I wanted to offer advice. Why don't you escape from such a relationship? Leave your home, don't submit! Seek out others, expect more for yourself, I wanted to say. But I came to realize that they could not really hear me. They heard my words, perhaps even agreed with my recommendations. They had brain compartments to which new information, my suggestions for example, had easy access. But habits, learned emotional responses, and remembered expectations were buried deep in their brains that dictated the course of their lives. These patients, like victims of encephalitis, could not be awakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memory's Voice|last=Alkon|first=D.

In the [[British Armed Services]], '''jankers''' or '''Restrictions of Privileges''' is an official punishment for a minor breach of discipline, as opposed to the more severe punishment of "detention" which would be given for a man committing a more serious or criminal offence. To be "on jankers" meant the serviceman or woman had been put on a charge by a non-commissioned officer (NCO) or occasionally a commissioned officer (referred to in service slang as "being put on a fizzer"), and so having his alleged offence entered on a Charge Report (Army or RAF Form No. 252). After appearing before an officer, the punishment might be ordered by the officer only after he has heard the evidence and had considered any mitigating factors.

==Terminology==
''Jankers'' is a much used vernacular term. The official Army terminology for jankers was "'''CB'''" which means "'''Confined to Barracks'''" or in the RAF "'''CC'''" "'''Confined to Camp'''" but later during the epoch of [[National Service in the United Kingdom|National Service]] the term was changed to "'''ROP'''" or "'''Restrictions of Privileges'''" in both Services.

The term ''jankers'' is today very occasionally used jokingly in civilian life, such as in journalism to mean the punishment of minor infringements by the imposition of tedious duties.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Ordering of jankers==
As an alternative to ordering jankers, the officer may alternatively decide to "''dismiss the charge''", if he considered the man had no case to answer. Or the officer may simply "''admonish''" him or her if he decided the alleged breach of discipline had occurred but was just not serious enough to warrant jankers. For some offences, like drunkenness, the officer might alternatively impose a fine instead of jankers.

When jankers is "awarded" by the officer taking the charge, the officer will also specify the number of days the jankers would last for up to a maximum of 14 days.

The officer's decision, in this regard, is dependent upon his judgement of the seriousness, or otherwise, of the offence(s) committed and also whether it is a first offence or there were previous similar breaches of discipline already recorded on the man's or woman's conduct sheet e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schoolboy to Soldier 1935&amp;ndash;1960|author=Clement Hoyle|pages=31|year=2006|publisher=SERENDIPITY|isbn=1843941783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/bill-cheall/cheall01.htm |title=Bill Cheall's Story |work=The Green Howards Regimental History |publisher=Edward McKillop Nichol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117092511/http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/bill-cheall/cheall01.htm |archivedate=2007-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jankers|work=WW2 &amp;mdash; People's War|date=2006-01-24|author=searcherjohnedwards|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/32/a8794632.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A surprise for my brother|author=BBC GMR Bus|work=WW2 &amp;mdash; People's War|date=2003-11-12|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/49/a2026649.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Jankers" is a familiar part of life during Regular and National Service in both the British Army and the Royal Air Force.

The kinds of offences which, most typically, resulted in a man being put on jankers, have always been fairly minor breaches of discipline, most commonly being [[Absence without official leave|AWOL]], e.g. returning to base slightly late after leave on a weekend pass. Other common offences, often resulting in a spell of jankers, were being caught still in bed after reveille, being drunk, being deemed "scruffy" when in uniform such as boots or brasses not gleaming satisfactorily, performing some minor duty lazily or carelessly, failing to comply correctly with some order or regulation, failing to salute an officer correctly or some other similar mistake, being late for some duty, being untidy or lazy in his barrack room, such as not sweeping his bed space properly or having dust on his locker, making a sloppy bedpack, or else not being up to the required standard of smartness on parade or on a kit inspection.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In many such cases, another officer might have ordered an NCO to "'''put that man on a Charge'''" when the breach of discipline or mistake was originally observed, and the form 252 would then be signed by the NCO. The more severe punishment of "''detention''" was given for offences which might be considered as criminal in a civil court, such as theft or violence against another person, or insubordination. Detention could only be given to a soldier or airman by the Commanding Officer, usually somebody of the Army rank of Colonel or RAF rank of Group Captain or by a convened Court Martial Board. Jankers could be given by a less senior officer, most typically a Captain or Flight Lieutenant.

==Being on jankers==
Although what being on jankers involved has varied between different bases, different Services and over time, typically, whilst on jankers, the soldier or airmen was subjected to several punishment parades and inspections each day in different forms of dress, starting with working clothes [[Boilersuit|fatigues]] half an hour after reveille, where he paraded outside the guardhouse for inspection by the Orderly Officer. After inspection, the offender is sent to perform a variety of tasks, often menial, before breakfast. After lunch, the man has to report again to the guardroom for inspection, and is then assigned unpleasant work, known as "fatigues",  until shortly before he must attend the afternoon's muster parade. After tea, he parades again at the guardhouse, this time in battledress and in battle order, where he is rigorously inspected. Any criticism of his turnout or equipment can result in another 'charge' or 'fizzer.' The final parade of the day was at 22.00 hours, and in best [[Battle Dress]], best boots, sharply and cleanly turned out, and with every piece of equipment provided by the Army. After inspection, the soldier could then return to barracks, prepare his kit for tomorrow's parades, and then get to bed for some rest.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The theory was that the whole punishment made the offender's daily life unpleasant, having to get up extremely early, then rushing about miserable, often having the mickey taken out of him by his mates and perhaps feeling humiliated. So he was thereby motivated never to repeat in future, the mistake or slackness that got him put on the charge in the first place. Being put on jankers was never considered an indication of bad character in the Services, but particularly in the days of conscription, rather more as normal Armed Forces discipline likely to be experienced by the majority of ratings at some time or other while in the Forces.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

British TV classic comedies, such as ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'' and ''[[Get Some In!]]'' and full length cinema films of that epoch like ''[[Privates Progress]]'' and ''[[Carry on Sergeant]]'' habitually made fun of jankers, as have memoirs of life in the armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Oh, what a lovely war' |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=1988-01-24 |author=Patridge, Frances |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_199801/ai_n8786091 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All's well that ends well |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=2003-10-18 |author=Baxter, Keith |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200310/ai_n9331290/pg_2 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in the first episode of ''It Ain't Half Hot Mum'' Gunner Graham was put on "jankers" (painting stones) by the Sergeant Major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It Ain't Half Hot Mum will have you rolling on the floor laughing! |work=Epinions |publisher=Shopping.com, Inc. |date=2001-09-01 |author=cripper |url=http://www.epinions.com/content_39122931332 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508202659/http://www.epinions.com/content_39122931332 |archivedate=2008-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Last of the Summer Wine, Smiler once described that working for Nora Batty was like being in the Army again, and always on Jankers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5566">In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], the '''Kuratowski closure axioms''' are a set of [[axiom]]s that can be used to define a [[topological structure]] on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. They are equivalent to the more commonly used [[open set]] definition. They were first introduced by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1966|loc=p. 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar set of axioms can be used to define a topological structure using only the dual notion of [[Interior (topology)#Interior operator|interior operator]].

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; its [[power set]].&lt;br /&gt;
A '''Kuratowski Closure Operator''' is an assignment &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cl}:\mathcal{P}(X) \to \mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kuratowski|1966}} has a fifth (optional) axiom stating that singleton sets are their own closures. He refers to topological spaces which satisfy all five axioms as T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces in contrast to the more general spaces which only satisfy the four listed axioms.&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(\varnothing) = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; (Preservation of Nullary Union)
# &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(A) \text{ for every subset }A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; (Extensivity)
# &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(A \cup B) = \operatorname{cl}(A) \cup \operatorname{cl}(B) \text{ for any subsets }A,B \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; (Preservation of Binary Union)
# &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{cl}(A)) = \operatorname{cl}(A) \text{ for every subset }A \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; ([[Idempotent function|Idempotence]])

If the last axiom, idempotence, is omitted, then the axioms define a [[preclosure operator]].

A consequence of the third axiom is: &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Rightarrow \operatorname{cl}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(B) &lt;/math&gt; (Preservation of Inclusion).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pervin|1964|loc=p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four Kuratowski closure axioms can be replaced by a single condition, namely,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pervin|1964|loc=p. 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup \operatorname{cl}(A) \cup \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{cl}(B)) = \operatorname{cl}(A \cup B) \setminus \operatorname{cl}(\varnothing) \text{ for all subsets }A, B \subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;

== Connection to other axiomatizations of topology ==

=== Induction of Topology ===
'''Construction'''&lt;br /&gt;
A closure operator naturally induces a topology as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
A subset &lt;math&gt; C\subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; is called '''closed''' if and only if &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(C) = C &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Empty Set and Entire Space are closed:'''&lt;br /&gt;
By extensitivity, &lt;math&gt; X\subseteq\operatorname{cl}(X) &lt;/math&gt; and since closure maps the power set of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into itself (that is, the image of any subset is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(X)\subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; X = \operatorname{cl}(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is closed.&lt;br /&gt;
The preservation of nullary unions states that &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(\varnothing) = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; is closed.

'''Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary set of indices and &lt;math&gt; C_i &lt;/math&gt; closed for every &lt;math&gt; i\in\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
By extensitivity, &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also, by preservation of inclusions, &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i \subseteq C_i \forall i\in\mathcal{I} \Rightarrow \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(C_i) = C_i \forall i\in\mathcal{I} \Rightarrow \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) \subseteq \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i = \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i &lt;/math&gt; is closed.

'''Finite unions of closed sets are closed:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of indices and let &lt;math&gt; C_i &lt;/math&gt; be closed for every &lt;math&gt; i\in\mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
From the preservation of binary unions and using [[mathematical induction|induction]] we have &lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i = \operatorname{cl}(\bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i &lt;/math&gt; is closed.

=== Induction of closure ===
In any induced topology (relative to the subset ''A'') the closed sets induce a new closure operator that is just the original closure operator restricted to ''A'': &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl_A}(B) = A \cap \operatorname{cl_X}(B) \text{ for all } B \subseteq A. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pervin|1964|loc=p. 49, Theorem 3.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recovering notions from topology ===

'''Closeness'''&lt;br /&gt;
A point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is [[Closeness (topology)|close]] to a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;p\in\operatorname{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Continuity'''&lt;br /&gt;
A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]] at a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;p\in\operatorname{cl}(A) \Rightarrow f(p)\in\operatorname{cl}(f(A))&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''language tax''' is an [[economics|economic]] concept proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] economist [[Philippe Van Parijs]].&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Van Parijs, [http://www1.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf Europe's three language problems], in: Multilingualism in Law and Politics {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511222928/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf |date=May 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to compensate countries with a less widespread language for their expenses for teaching and translation.

Van Parijs points out that [[Jonathan Pool]] had proposed this kind of taxation in 1991 but criticizes Pool's proposal to distribute the cost of language learning on a [[per capita]] basis.

An analogous concept is found in the work of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] economist [[François Grin]],&lt;ref&gt;François Grin, [http://cisad.adc.education.fr/hcee/documents/rapport_Grin.pdf L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010075147/http://cisad.adc.education.fr/hcee/documents/rapport_Grin.pdf |date=2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that such countries are implicitly paying an ''impôt linguistique'' (literally also meaning "language tax") to countries with a "strong" language. In a similar sense, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Partito Radicale|Radical Party]] speaks of a ''tassa inglese''&lt;ref&gt;[http://coranet.radicalparty.org/pressreleases/press_release.php?func=detail&amp;par=7817 I costi della tassa "inglese"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310194941/http://coranet.radicalparty.org/pressreleases/press_release.php?func=detail&amp;par=7817 |date=2007-03-10 }}, press release 2005/21/10&lt;/ref&gt; ("English tax").

'''[[Law]] in [[Asia]]''' is undergoing rapid change and modernisation{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, especially given the economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]]. Asian countries share a substantial heritage with European law{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, whilst keeping their own distinct identity.

==History==
[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[preamble]] of the '''Constitution of India''']]
[[History of China|Ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]] had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice such as the ''[[Manusmriti|Laws of Manu]]'' or the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' in India and [[traditional Chinese law]] in China. Because [[Germany]] was a rising power in the late 19th century, and codified [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is more 'exportable' than large bodies of common law jurisprudence, the German Civil Code has been highly influential for most oriental legal systems, and forms the basis of civil law in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In [[China]], the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} which remains in force in [[Taiwan]]. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects influences from the German-based civil law, English-based common law in Hong Kong, Soviet-influenced [[Socialist law]], United States-style banking and securities law, and [[traditional Chinese law]]. In India, and other previous members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], English common law forms the basis of private law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18368">A '''mental representation''' (or '''cognitive representation'''), in [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]], is a hypothetical internal cognitive [[symbol]] that represents external reality,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://philpapers.org/archive/MORRGM.pdf|title = Representations Gone Mental|last = Morgan|first = Alex|date = 2014|journal = Synthese |volume=191 |issue=2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 213–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; or else a [[mental process]] that makes use of such a symbol:  "a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marr|first=David|year=2010|isbn=978-0262514620|title=Vision. A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

'''Motivational salience''' is a [[cognitive process]] and a form of [[attention]] that ''motivates'', or propels, an individual's behavior towards or away from a particular [[stimulus (psychology)|object, perceived event, or outcome]].&lt;ref name="Motivational salience"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puglisi-Allegra S, Ventura R | title = Prefrontal/accumbal catecholamine system processes high motivational salience | journal = Front. Behav. Neurosci. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 31 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22754514 | pmc = 3384081 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00031 | quote = Motivational salience regulates the strength of goal seeking, the amount of risk taken, and the energy invested from mild to extreme.&amp;nbsp;... Motivation can be conceptually described as a continuum along which stimuli can either reinforce or punish responses to other stimuli. Behaviorally, stimuli that reinforce are called rewarding and those that punish aversive (Skinner, 1953). Reward and aversion describe the impact a stimulus has on behavior, and provided of motivational properties, thus able to induce attribution of motivational salience.&amp;nbsp;... Attribution of motivational salience is related to the salience of an UCS (Dallman et al., 2003; Pecina et al., 2006). Thus, the more salient an UCS the more likely a neutral (to-be-conditioned) stimulus will be associated with it through motivational salience attribution. Prior experience is a major determinant of the motivational impact of any given stimulus (Borsook et al., 2007) and emotional arousal induced by motivational stimuli increases the attention given to stimuli influencing both the initial perceptual encoding and the consolidation process (Anderson et al., 2006; McGaugh, 2006).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motivational salience regulates the intensity of behaviors that facilitate the attainment of a particular [[goal]], the amount of time and energy that an individual is willing to expend to attain a particular goal, and the [[Risk aversion (psychology)|amount of risk that an individual is willing to accept]] while working to attain a particular goal.&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt;

Motivational salience is composed of two component processes that are defined by their attractive or aversive effects on an individual's behavior relative to a particular stimulus: ''incentive salience'' and ''aversive salience''.&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt; '''Incentive salience''' is the attractive form of motivational salience that causes [[approach behavior]], and is associated with [[operant reinforcement]], [[reward system|desirable outcomes, and pleasurable stimuli]].&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultz/&gt; '''Aversive salience''' is the aversive form of motivational salience that causes avoidance behavior, and is associated with [[Punishment (psychology)|operant punishment]], [[aversives|undesirable outcomes, and unpleasant stimuli]].&lt;ref name="Aversive salience"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Koob GF, Moal ML|title=Neurobiology of Addiction|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080497372|page=415|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sjn6I6QMxdwC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;dq=aversive+salience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incentive salience==
{{addiction glossary}}
'''Incentive salience''' is a [[cognitive process]] that confers a "desire" or "want" attribute, which includes a motivational component, to a [[rewarding stimulus]].&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt; ''Reward'' is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior – also known as approach behavior – and consummatory behavior.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz W | year = 2015 | title = Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–951 | pmid = 26109341 | pmc = 4491543 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014 | quote = Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.&amp;nbsp;... Rewarding stimuli, objects, events, situations, and activities consist of several major components. First, rewards have basic sensory components (visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and olfactory)&amp;nbsp;... Second, rewards are salient and thus elicit attention, which are manifested as orienting responses (FIGURE 1, middle). The salience of rewards derives from three principal factors, namely, their physical intensity and impact (physical salience), their novelty and surprise (novelty/surprise salience), and their general motivational impact shared with punishers (motivational salience). A separate form not included in this scheme, incentive salience, primarily addresses dopamine function in addiction and refers only to approach behavior (as opposed to learning)&amp;nbsp;... Third, rewards have a value component that determines the positively motivating effects of rewards and is not contained in, nor explained by, the sensory and attentional components (FIGURE 1, right). This component reflects behavioral preferences and thus is subjective and only partially determined by physical parameters. Only this component constitutes what we understand as a reward. It mediates the specific behavioral reinforcing, approach generating, and emotional effects of rewards that are crucial for the organism's survival and reproduction, whereas all other components are only supportive of these functions.&amp;nbsp;... These emotions are also called liking (for pleasure) and wanting (for desire) in addiction research (471) and strongly support the learning and approach generating functions of reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "wanting" of incentive salience differs from "liking" in the sense that liking is the [[pleasure]] that is immediately gained from the acquisition or consumption of a rewarding stimulus;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; the "wanting" of incentive salience serves a "motivational magnet" quality of a rewarding stimulus that makes it a desirable and attractive goal, transforming it from a mere sensory experience into something that commands attention, induces approach, and causes it to be sought out.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur. J. Neurosci. | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 1124–1143 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22487042 | pmc = 3325516 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.07990.x | quote = Here I discuss how mesocorticolimbic mechanisms generate the motivation component of incentive salience. Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&amp;nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.&amp;nbsp;...  A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS. This is a signature feature of incentive salience.&amp;nbsp;... When a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers ‘wanting’ for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive – even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience.&amp;nbsp;... An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to ‘consume’ the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). ‘Wanting’ of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too).&amp;nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed 'wanting' – CS-triggered pulses of intensified 'wanting' for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed 'wanting' – motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt;

Incentive salience is regulated by a number of brain structures, but it is assigned to stimuli by a region of the [[ventral striatum]] known as the [[nucleus accumbens shell]].&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt; Incentive salience is primarily regulated by [[dopamine]] neurotransmission in the [[mesocorticolimbic projection]],{{#tag:ref|The mesocorticolimbic projection is a group of [[dopamine pathway]]s that connects the [[ventral tegmental area]] to the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[prefrontal cortex]].|group="note"}}, but activity in other [[dopaminergic pathway]]s and [[hedonic hotspot]]s (e.g., the [[ventral pallidum]]) also modulate incentive salience.&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense ‘wanting’ (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more ‘wanted’ than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more ‘wanted’ more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&amp;nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify ‘wanting’ (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing ‘liking’ tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered ‘wanting’ to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).| pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chapter 18 – From Experienced Utility to Decision Utility|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124160088000188|publisher = Academic Press|date = 1 January 2014|location = San Diego|isbn = 978-0-12-416008-8|pages = 335–351|first = Kent C.|last = Berridge|first2 = John P.|last2 = O’Doherty|editor-first = Paul W.

Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&amp;nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of an addiction, the repeated association of otherwise neutral and even non-rewarding [[stimulation|stimuli]] with drug consumption triggers an [[associative learning]] process that causes these previously neutral stimuli to act as [[Reinforcement#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of addictive drug use (i.e., these stimuli start to function as [[drug cues]]).&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt; As conditioned positive reinforcers of drug use, these previously neutral stimuli are assigned incentive salience (which manifests as a craving)&amp;nbsp;– sometimes at pathologically high levels due to [[reward sensitization]]&amp;nbsp;– which can [[Pavlovian-instrumental transfer|transfer to the primary reinforcer]] (e.g., the use of an addictive drug) with which it was originally paired.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt; Thus, if an individual remains abstinent from drug use for some time and encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In [[addiction]], the "liking" (pleasure or [[hedonic]] value) of a drug or other stimulus becomes dissociated from "wanting" (i.e., desire or craving) due to the [[Addiction#Reward sensitization|sensitization of incentive salience]].&lt;ref&gt;Berridge, K.C., Robinson, T.E.

'''New media art''' refers to artworks created with [[new media]] [[technology|technologies]], including [[digital art]], [[computer graphics]], [[computer animation]], [[virtual art]], [[Internet art]], [[interactive art]], [[video games]], [[computer]] [[robotics]], [[3D printing]], [[cyborg art]] and art as [[biotechnology]]. The term differentiates itself by its resulting cultural objects and social events, which can be seen in opposition to those deriving from old visual arts (i.e. traditional [[painting]], sculpture, etc.). This concern with medium is a key feature of much [[contemporary art]] and indeed many art schools and major universities now offer majors in "New Genres" or "New Media"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academyart.edu/computer-arts-school/outline.html|title=Web Design &amp; New Media|work=academyart.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a growing number of graduate programs have emerged internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artexetra.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/shanken_art_industry_academy.pdf|format=PDF|last=Shanken|first=Edward A. |title=Artists in Industry and the Academy: Collaborative Research, Interdisciplinary Scholarship, and the Creation and Interpretation of Hybrid Forms|work= Leonardo 38:5 (2005)|pages= 415–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media art often involves interaction between artist and observer or between observers and the artwork, which responds to them. Yet, as several theorists and curators have noted, such forms of interaction, social exchange, participation, and transformation do not distinguish new media art but rather serve as a common ground that has parallels in other strands of contemporary art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hybridge.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/writings-media/|title=Contemporary Art and New Media: Toward a Hybrid Discourse?|work=Contemporary Art and New Media: Toward a Hybrid Discourse?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such insights emphasize the forms of cultural practice that arise concurrently with emerging technological platforms, and question the focus on technological media, per se.

New Media concerns are often derived from the [[telecommunications]], [[mass media]] and [[Digital electronics|digital electronic]] modes of delivering the artworks involve, with practices ranging from [[conceptual art|conceptual]] to [[Internet Art|virtual art]], [[performance]] to [[Installation art|installation]].

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
The origins of new media art can be traced to the moving photographic inventions of the late 19th century such as the [[zoetrope]] (1834), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877) and [[Eadweard Muybridge|Eadweard Muybridge's]] [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879). From the 1920s through the 1950s, various forms of kinetic and light art, from [[Thomas Wilfred]]'s 'Lumia' (1919) and 'Clavilux' light organs to [[Jean Tinguely]]'s self-destructing sculpture 'Homage to New York' (1960) can be seen as progenitors of new media art.

In 1958 [[Wolf Vostell]] becomes the first artist who incorporates a [[television]] set into one of his works. The ''Black Room Cycle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/deutscher-ausblick/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: German View from the Black Room Cycle|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Installation art|installation]] is part of the collection of the [[Berlinische Galerie]].

During the 1960s the development of then new technologies of video produced the new media art experiments of [[Nam June Paik]], and [[Wolf Vostell]] with the [[Installation art|installation]] ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' in 1963 at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: Television Décollage|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. Michael Noll]], and [[multimedia]] [[performance]]s of [[E.A.T.]], [[Fluxus]] and [[Happening]]. 
In 1983, [[Roy Ascott]] introduced the concept of "distributed authorship" in his worldwide telematic project La Plissure du Texte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timeline.1904.cc/tiki-index.php?page=La+Plissure+du+Texte|title=La Plissure du Texte|work=1904.cc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402201801/http://timeline.1904.cc/tiki-index.php?page=La+Plissure+du+Texte|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Frank Popper]]'s "Electra" at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]. The development of computer graphics at the end of the 1980s and real time technologies then in the 1990s combined with the spreading of the Web and the Internet favored the emergence of new and various forms of interactive art by [[Ken Feingold]],  [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]], [[David Rokeby]], [[Ken Rinaldo]], [[Perry Hoberman]], [[Tamas Waliczky]]; [[telematic art]] by [[Roy Ascott]], [[Paul Sermon]], [[Michael Bielický]]; Internet art by [[Vuk Ćosić]], [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi]]; virtual and immersive art by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[Monika Fleischmann]], [[Wolfgang Strauss]] and large scale urban installation by [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]]. In Geneva, the [[Centre pour l'Image Contemporaine]] or CIC coproduced with [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] from Paris and the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne the first internet video archive of new media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmedia-art.org/index_en.htm|title=Nouveaux Media - New Media - Neue Medien|website=www.newmedia-art.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously advances in biotechnology have also allowed artists like [[Eduardo Kac]] to begin exploring DNA and genetics as a new art medium.

Influences on new media art have been the theories developed around interaction, [[hypertext]], databases, and [[computer network|networks]]. Important thinkers in this regard have been [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Theodor Nelson]], whereas comparable ideas can be found in the literary works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Italo Calvino]], and [[Julio Cortázar]].

In the book ''New Media Art'', [[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana named several themes that contemporary new media art addresses, including [[computer art]], [[collaboration]], [[Personal identity|identity]], [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Open source|open sourcing]], [[telepresence]], surveillance, corporate parody, as well as intervention and [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurizio Bolognini]] suggested that new media artists have one common denominator, which is a self-referential relationship with the new technologies, the result of finding oneself inside an epoch-making transformation determined by technological development. Nevertheless, new media art does not appear as a set of homogeneous practices, but as a complex field converging around three main elements: 1) the art system, 2) scientific and industrial research, and 3) political-cultural media activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catricalà|first1=Valentino|title=Media Art. Toward a new Definition of Arts in the Age of Technology|date=2015|publisher=Gli Ori|isbn=978- 88-7336-564-8|url=https://www.academia.edu/11185472/Media_Art._Towards_a_New_Definition_of_Arts_in_the_Age_of_Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant differences between scientist-artists, activist-artists and technological artists closer to the art system, who not only have different training and technocultures, but have different artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This should be taken into account in examining the several themes addressed by new media art.

Non-linearity can be seen as an important topic to new media art by artists developing interactive, generative, collaborative, immersive artworks like [[Jeffrey Shaw]] or [[Maurice Benayoun]] who explored the term as an approach to looking at varying forms of digital projects where the content relays on the user's experience. This is a key concept since people acquired the notion that they were conditioned to view everything in a linear and clear-cut fashion.  Now, art is stepping out of that form and allowing for people to build their own experiences with the piece. Non-linearity describes a project that escape from the conventional linear narrative coming from novels, theater plays and movies. Non-linear art usually requires audience participation or at least, the fact that the "visitor" is taken into consideration by the representation, altering the displayed content. The participatory aspect of new media art, which for some artists has become integral, emerged from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s ''Happenings'' and became with Internet, a significant component of contemporary art. 

The inter-connectivity and interactivity of the [[internet]], as well as the fight between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web today, fascinate and inspire a lot of current new media art.

Many new media art projects also work with themes like politics and social consciousness, allowing for [[social activism]] through the interactive nature of the media. New media art includes "explorations of code and user interface; interrogations of archives, databases, and networks; production via automated scraping, filtering, cloning, and recombinatory techniques; applications of user-generated content (UGC) layers; crowdsourcing ideas on social- media platforms; narrowcasting digital selves on "free" websites that claim copyright; and provocative performances that implicate audiences as participants".&lt;ref&gt;Dale Hudson and Patricia R. Zimmermann. (2015). ''[http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/thinking-through-digital-media-dale-hudson/?K=9781137433626 Thinking Through Digital Media Transnational Environments and Locative Places]''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. P. 1. {{ISBN|978-1137433626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key themes in new media art is to create visual views of databases. Pioneers in this area include [[Lisa Strausfeld]], [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Bulajic|first1=Viktorija Vesna| title=Database aesthetics: art in the age of information overflow|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2007|url=|isbn=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberto Frigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moulon |first=Dominique |date=2013 |title=Contemporary new media art  |url= |location= |publisher=Nouvelles éditions Scala |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Database aesthetics holds at least two attractions to new media artists: formally, as a new variation on non-linear narratives; and politically as a means to subvert what is fast becoming a form of control and authority.

The emergence of 3D printing has introduced a new bridge to new media art, joining the virtual and the physical worlds.  The rise of this technology has allowed artists to blend the computational base of new media art with the traditional physical form of sculpture.  A pioneer in this field was artist [[Jonty Hurwitz]] who created the first known anamorphosis sculpture using this technique.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Longevity ==
As the technologies used to deliver works of new media art such as [[photographic film|film]], [[cassette tape|tapes]], [[web browser]]s, [[software]] and [[operating system]]s become obsolete, New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to [[Art conservation and restoration|preserve artwork]] beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects into [[New media art preservation]] are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile media arts heritage (see [[Docam|DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage]]).

Methods of preservation exist, including the translation of a work from an obsolete medium into a related new medium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/ws-proceedings/DELOS6/rosetta.pdf|format=PDF|title=Digital Rosetta Stone|website=ercim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the digital archiving of media (see the [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome ArtBase]], which holds over 2000 works, and the [[Internet Archive]]), and the use of [[emulators]] to preserve work dependent on obsolete software or operating system environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |title=Preserving the Rhizome ArtBase (report) |first=Richard |last=Rinehart |website=rhizome.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116094312/http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |archivedate=2005-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/design/the-mission-to-save-vanishing-internet-art.html|title=The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=2016-10-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Around the mid-90s, the issue of storing works in digital form became a concern. Digital art such as moving images, multimedia, interactive programs, and computer-generated art has different properties than physical artwork such as oil paintings and sculptures. Unlike analog technologies, a digital file can be recopied onto a new medium without any deterioration of content. One of the problems with preserving digital art is that the formats continuously change over time. Former examples of transitions include that from 8-inch floppy disks to 5.25-inch floppies, 3-inch diskettes to CD-ROMs, and DVDs to flash drives. On the horizon is the obsolescence of flash drives and portable hard drives, as data is increasingly held in online [[cloud storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/howard/Papers/elect-art-longevity.html|title=Longevity of Electronic Art|website=besser.tsoa.nyu.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums and galleries thrive off of being able to accommodate the presentation and preservation of physical artwork. New media art challenges the original methods of the art world when it comes to documentation, its approach to collection and preservation. Technology continues to advance, and the nature and structure of art organizations and institutions will remain in jeopardy. The traditional roles of curators and artist are continually changing, and a shift to new collaborative models of production and presentation is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225871513|title=New media in the white cube and beyond : curatorial models for digital art|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|others=Paul, Christiane.|isbn=9780520255975|location=Berkeley|oclc=225871513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In New Media programs, students are able to get acquainted with the newest forms of creation and communication. New Media students learn to identify what is or isn't "new" about certain technologies.&lt;ref name="illinois.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art.illinois.edu/content/undergraduate/programs/new-media/|title=The School of Art and Design - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|work=illinois.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science and the market will always present new tools and platforms for artists and designers. Students learn how to sort through new emerging technological platforms and place them in a larger context of sensation, communication, production, and consumption.

When obtaining a bachelor's degree in New Media, students will primarily work through practice of building experiences that utilize new and old technologies and narrative. Through the construction of projects in various media, they acquire technical skills, practice vocabularies of critique and analysis, and gain familiarity with historical and contemporary precedents.&lt;ref name="illinois.edu" /&gt; 

In the United States, many Bachelor's and Master's level programs exist with concentrations on Media Art, New Media, Media Design, Digital Media and Interactive Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~j21099/nmschools.html|title=New Media Programs in the United States — Dr. Edgar Huang|website=www.iupui.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ohm's acoustic law''', sometimes called the '''acoustic phase law''' or simply '''Ohm's law''', states that a [[music]]al [[sound]] is perceived by the [[ear]] as a set of a number of constituent pure [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] tones.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm's law, ''n''.2, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Text-book of Physics | author = A. Wilmer Duff, editor | year = 1912 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U_EzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA530&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA529,M1 | publisher =  P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co | location=Philadelphia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was proposed by physicist [[Georg Ohm]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm, G., ''Annalen der Physik'' (1843) 59 513&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] elaborated the law into what is often today known as Ohm's acoustic law, by adding that the quality of a tone depends solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple tones, and not on their relative phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Science of Musical Sounds | author = Dayton Clarence Miller | publisher = The Macmillan Company | year = 1916 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7f8KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lessons in Elementary Practical Physics, Vol. III, Part 1: Practical Acoustics | author = Charles Lightfoot Barnes | publisher = London: Macmillan and Co.

The law has also been interpreted as "a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustical wave contains power at that frequency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Acoustics and psychoacoustics | author = David M. Howard, Jamie A. S. Angus | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-240-51995-1 | page = 123 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyk5nAIJcBcC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=intitle:Acoustics+intitle:and+intitle:Psychoacoustics+ohm+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=5bxlSby6B5CQkQSJlpznAQ#PPA123,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are true to the extent that the ear is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the acoustic waves, and further, is able to resolve the differences in their frequency. In modern times, the sensitivity of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] to the phase of tone components has been extensively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Loudspeaker and Headphone Handbook | author = John Borwick | publisher = Focal Press | isbn = 0-240-51578-1 | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pAOFt1znYr8C&amp;pg=PA655&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+acoustic+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=NAiHR_CaNp6ktgP_i4zQBQ&amp;sig=1OIFUWDCMTIUILOZrnaa5j3ef9M#PPA655,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy has led to this characterization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory | editor = Jerry V.

In [[mathematics]], a '''partition of a set''' is a grouping of the set's elements into non-empty [[subset]]s, in such a way that every element is [[Collectively exhaustive events|included in one]] and [[Mutually exclusive events|only one]] of the subsets.

Every [[equivalence relation]] on a set defines a partition of this set, and every partition defines an equivalence relation. A set equipped with an equivalence relation or a partition is sometimes called a [[setoid]], typically in [[type theory]] and [[proof theory]].

== Definition ==
A partition of a set ''X'' is a set of [[nonempty]] [[subset]]s of ''X'' such that every element ''x'' in ''X'' is in exactly one of these subsets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Halmos|first=Paul|title=Naive Set Theory R.|publisher=Springer|year=1960|isbn=9780387900926|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6cZBQ9qtgoC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., ''X'' is a [[disjoint union]] of the subsets).

Equivalently, a [[family of sets]] ''P'' is a partition of ''X'' if and only if all of the following conditions hold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=John F.|title=Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1990|isbn=9780912675732|page=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jklsb5JUgoQC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The family ''P'' does not contain the empty set (that is &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \notin P&lt;/math&gt;).
*The [[union (set theory)|union]] of the sets in ''P'' is equal to ''X'' (that is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigcup_{A\in P} A = X&lt;/math&gt;). The sets in ''P'' are said to '''cover''' ''X''.
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any two distinct sets in ''P'' is empty (that is &lt;math&gt;(\forall A,B \in P)\; A\neq B \implies A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;). The elements of ''P'' are said to be [[pairwise disjoint]].

The sets in ''P'' are called the ''blocks'', ''parts'' or ''cells'' of the partition.{{sfn|Brualdi|2004|pp=44–45}}

The '''rank''' of ''P'' is |''X''| &amp;minus; |''P''|, if ''X'' is finite.

== Examples ==
*The [[empty set]] &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one partition, namely &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
*For any nonempty set ''X'', ''P'' = {''X''} is a partition of ''X'', called the '''trivial partition'''.
**Particularly, every [[singleton set]] {''x''} has exactly one partition, namely { {''x''} }.
*For any non-empty [[proper subset]] ''A'' of a set ''U'', the set ''A'' together with its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] form a partition of ''U'', namely, {''A'', ''U'' \ ''A''}.
*The set { 1, 2, 3 } has these five partitions (one partition per item):
** { {1}, {2}, {3} }, sometimes written 1|2|3.
** { {1, 2}, {3} }, or 12|3.
** { {1, 3}, {2} }, or 13|2.
** { {1}, {2, 3} }, or 1|23.
** { {1, 2, 3} }, or 123 (in contexts where there will be no confusion with the number).
*The following are not partitions of { 1, 2, 3 }:
** { {}, {1, 3}, {2} } is not a partition (of any set) because one of its elements is the [[empty set]].
** { {1, 2}, {2, 3} } is not a partition (of any set) because the element 2 is contained in more than one block.
** { {1}, {2} } is not a partition of {1, 2, 3} because none of its blocks contains 3; however, it is a partition of {1, 2}.

== Partitions and equivalence relations ==
For any [[equivalence relation]] on a set ''X'', the set of its [[equivalence class]]es is a partition of ''X''. Conversely, from any partition ''P'' of ''X'', we can define an equivalence relation on ''X'' by setting {{nowrap|''x'' ~ ''y''}} precisely when ''x'' and ''y'' are in the same part in ''P''. Thus the notions of equivalence relation and partition are essentially equivalent.{{sfn|Schechter|1997|p=54}}

The [[axiom of choice]] guarantees for any partition of a set ''X'' the existence of a subset of ''X'' containing exactly one element from each part of the partition. This implies that given an equivalence relation on a set one can select a canonical representative element from every equivalence class.

== Refinement of partitions ==
[[File:Set partitions 4; Hasse; circles.svg|thumb|left|300px|Partitions of a 4-set ordered by [[Partition refinement|refinement]]]]
A partition ''α'' of a set ''X'' is a '''refinement''' of a partition ''ρ'' of ''X''—and we say that ''α'' is ''finer'' than ''ρ'' and that ''ρ'' is ''coarser'' than ''α''—if every element of ''α'' is a subset of some element of ''ρ''. Informally, this means that ''α'' is a further fragmentation of ''ρ''.  In that case, it is written that ''α'' ≤ ''ρ''.

This ''finer-than'' relation on the set of partitions of ''X'' is a [[partially ordered set|partial order]] (so the notation "≤" is appropriate). Each set of elements has a [[least upper bound]] and a [[greatest lower bound]], so that it forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], and more specifically (for partitions of a finite set) it is a [[geometric lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lattice Theory|volume=25|series=Colloquium Publications|publisher=American Mathematical Society|first=Garrett|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff|edition=3rd|year=1995|isbn=9780821810255|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y8d-MdtVwkC&amp;pg=PA95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''partition lattice'' of a 4-element set has 15 elements and is depicted in the [[Hasse diagram]] on the left.

Based on the [[cryptomorphism]] between geometric lattices and [[matroid]]s, this lattice of partitions of a finite set corresponds to a matroid in which the base set of the matroid consists of the [[Atom (order theory)|atoms]] of the lattice, namely, the partitions with &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt; singleton sets and one two-element set. These atomic partitions correspond one-for-one with the edges of a [[complete graph]]. The [[Matroid#Closure operators|matroid closure]] of a set of atomic partitions is the finest common coarsening of them all; in graph-theoretic terms, it is the partition of the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the complete graph into the [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] of the subgraph formed by the given set of edges. In this way, the lattice of partitions corresponds to the lattice of flats of the [[graphic matroid]] of the complete graph.

Another example illustrates the refining of partitions from the perspective of equivalence relations. If ''D'' is the set of cards in a standard 52-card deck, the ''same-color-as'' relation on ''D'' – which can be denoted ~&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; – has two equivalence classes: the sets {red cards} and {black cards}.  The 2-part partition corresponding to ~&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; has a refinement that yields the ''same-suit-as'' relation ~&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the four equivalence classes {spades}, {diamonds}, {hearts}, and {clubs}.

==Noncrossing partitions==
A partition of the set ''N'' = {1, 2, ..., ''n''} with corresponding equivalence relation ~ is '''[[noncrossing partition|noncrossing]]''' if it has the following property: If four elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' of ''N'' having ''a'' &lt; ''b'' &lt; ''c'' &lt; ''d'' satisfy ''a'' ~ ''c'' and ''b'' ~ ''d'', then ''a'' ~ ''b'' ~ ''c'' ~ ''d''. The name comes from the following equivalent definition: Imagine the elements 1, 2, ..., ''n'' of ''N'' drawn as the ''n'' vertices of a regular ''n''-gon (in counterclockwise order). A partition can then be visualized by drawing each block as a polygon (whose vertices are the elements of the block). The partition is then noncrossing if and only if these polygons do not intersect.

The lattice of noncrossing partitions of a finite set has recently taken on importance because of its role in [[free probability]] theory.  These form a subset of the lattice of all partitions, but not a sublattice, since the join operations of the two lattices do not agree.

== Counting partitions ==
The total number of partitions of an ''n''-element set is the [[Bell numbers|Bell number]] ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first several Bell numbers are ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1,
''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 5, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 15, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 52, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 203 {{OEIS|A000110}}. Bell numbers satisfy the [[recursion]]

: &lt;math&gt;B_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k} B_k&lt;/math&gt;

and have the [[generating function|exponential generating function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{B_n}{n!}z^n=e^{e^z-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:BellNumberAnimated.gif|right|thumb|Construction of the [[Bell triangle]]]]
The Bell numbers may also be computed using the [[Bell triangle]]
in which the first value in each row is copied from the end of the previous row, and subsequent values are computed by adding two numbers, the number to the left and the number to the above left of the position. The Bell numbers are repeated along both sides of this triangle. The numbers within the triangle count partitions in which a given element is the largest [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]].

The number of partitions of an ''n''-element set into exactly ''k'' nonempty parts is the [[Stirling number of the second kind]] ''S''(''n'', ''k'').

The number of [[noncrossing partition]]s of an ''n''-element set is the [[Catalan number]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_n={1 \over n+1}{2n \choose n}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6282">Many [[statistical analysis|statistical analyses]] are based on distributional assumptions about the [[population (statistics)|population]] from which the data have been obtained. However, distributional families can have radically different shapes depending on the value of the [[shape parameter]]. Therefore, finding a reasonable choice for the shape parameter is a necessary step in the analysis. In many analyses, finding a good distributional model for the data is the primary focus of the analysis.

The '''probability plot correlation coefficient (PPCC) plot''' is a [[graphical technique]] for identifying the shape parameter for a distributional family that best describes the data set. This technique is appropriate for families, such as the [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]], that are defined by a single shape parameter and [[location parameter|location]] and [[scale parameter]]s, and it is not appropriate or even possible for distributions, such as the [[normal distribution|normal]], that are defined only by location and scale parameters.

The technique is simply "plot the [[probability plot correlation coefficient]]s for different values of the shape parameter, and choose whichever value yields the best fit".

==Definition==
The PPCC plot is formed by:
*Vertical axis: [[Probability plot correlation coefficient]];
*Horizontal axis: Value of shape parameter.
That is, for a series of values of the shape parameter, the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] is computed for the [[probability plot]] associated with a given value of the shape parameter. These correlation coefficients are plotted against their corresponding shape parameters. The maximum correlation coefficient corresponds to the optimal value of the shape parameter. For better precision, two iterations of the PPCC plot can be generated; the first is for finding the right neighborhood and the second is for fine tuning the estimate.

The PPCC plot is used first to find a good value of the shape parameter. The probability plot is then generated to find estimates of the location and scale parameters and in addition to provide a graphical assessment of the adequacy of the distributional fit. 

The PPCC plot answers the following questions:
#What is the best-fit member within a distributional family?
#Does the best-fit member provide a good fit (in terms of generating a probability plot with a high correlation coefficient)?
#Does this distributional family provide a good fit compared to other distributions?
#How sensitive is the choice of the shape parameter?

==Comparing distributions==
In addition to finding a good choice for estimating the shape parameter of a given distribution, the PPCC plot can be useful in deciding which distributional family is most appropriate. For example, given a set of [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] data, one might generate PPCC plots for a Weibull, [[lognormal distribution|lognormal]], [[gamma distribution|gamma]], and [[inverse Gaussian distribution]]s, and possibly others, on a single page. This one page would show the best value for the shape parameter for several distributions and would additionally indicate which of these distributional families provides the best fit (as measured by the maximum probability plot correlation coefficient). That is, if the maximum PPCC value for the Weibull is 0.99 and only 0.94 for the lognormal, then one could reasonably conclude that the Weibull family is the better choice.

When comparing distributional models, one should not simply choose the one with the maximum PPCC value. In many cases, several distributional fits provide comparable PPCC values. For example, a lognormal and Weibull may both fit a given set of reliability data quite well. Typically, one would consider the complexity of the distribution. That is, a simpler distribution with a marginally smaller PPCC value may be preferred over a more complex distribution. Likewise, there may be theoretical justification in terms of the underlying scientific model for preferring a distribution with a marginally smaller PPCC value in some cases. In other cases, one may not need to know if the distributional model is optimal, only that it is adequate for our purposes. That is, one may be able to use techniques designed for normally distributed data even if other distributions fit the data somewhat better.

The Tukey lambda PPCC plot, with shape parameter λ, is particularly useful for symmetric distributions. It indicates whether a distribution is short or long tailed and it can further indicate several common distributions. Specifically,
#λ = &amp;minus;1: distribution is approximately [[Cauchy distribution|Cauchy]]
#λ = 0: distribution is exactly [[logistic distribution|logistic]]
#λ = 0.14: distribution is approximately normal
#λ = 0.5: distribution is U-shaped
#λ = 1: distribution is exactly [[continuous uniform distribution|uniform]](&amp;minus;1, 1)
If the Tukey lambda PPCC plot gives a maximum value near 0.14, one can reasonably conclude that the normal distribution is a good model for the data. If the maximum value is less than 0.14, a [[long-tailed distribution]] such as the [[Laplace distribution|double exponential]] or logistic would be a better choice. If the maximum value is near &amp;minus;1, this implies the selection of very long-tailed distribution, such as the Cauchy. If the maximum value is greater than 0.14, this implies a [[short-tailed distribution]] such as the [[Beta distribution|Beta]] or uniform.

The Tukey-lambda PPCC plot is used to suggest an appropriate distribution. One should follow-up with PPCC and probability plots of the appropriate alternatives.

'''Rankism''' is "abusive, discriminatory, or exploitative behavior towards people because of their [[Social class|rank]] in a particular [[hierarchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Rank-based abuse underlies many other phenomena such as [[bullying]], [[racism]], [[hazing]], [[ageism]], [[sexism]], [[ableism]], [[mentalism (discrimination)|mentalism]], [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. The term "rankism" was coined by physicist, educator, and [[Citizen diplomacy|citizen diplomat]] [[Robert W. Fuller]].

== Characteristics ==

Rankism can take many forms, including
* exploiting one's position within a hierarchy to secure unwarranted advantages and benefits (e.g. massive corporate bonuses);
* abusing a position of power (e.g., abusive [[parental abuse of children|parent]] or [[Religious abuse|priest]], [[Corporate corruption|corrupt CEO]], [[Workplace bullying|bully boss]], [[prisoner abuse]]);
* using rank as a shield to get away with [[insulting]] or [[humiliating]] others with impunity;
* using rank to maintain a position of power long after it can be justified;
* exporting the rank achieved in one sphere of activity to claim superior value as a person;
* exploiting rank that is illegitimately acquired or held (as in situations resting on specious distinctions of social rank, such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], or [[classism]]).

Rankism can occur in any [[social hierarchy]], such as governments, corporations, families, non-profit organizations, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of term ==

The term rankism first appeared in print in the ''Oberlin Alumni Magazine'' for fall of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert
 | year = Fall 1997
 | title = Campus Activities (sidebar)
 | journal = Oberlin Alumni Magazine
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared in a book called ''Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank,'' written by Fuller and published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2003
 | title = Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank
 | publisher = New Society Publishers
 | location = Gabriola Island, Canada
 | isbn = 0-86571-486-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the term in a management journal occurred in 2001 in a ''[[Leader to Leader Institute]]'' article. The piece questioned the abuse of rank in work hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W
 |date=Summer 2001
 | title = A New Look at Hierarchy: How do we make sure that rank is exercised appropriately?
 | journal = Leader to Leader
 | volume = 21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of rankism has since been widely covered in the media, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[NPR]]'', ''[[C-SPAN]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[Voice of America]]'', and ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.

Other notable references of rankism include Fuller's second book on the subject, ''All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2006

 | publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers
 | isbn = 978-1-57675-385-9 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and an action-oriented guide titled ''Dignity for All: How to Create a World Without Rankism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies]] (HumanDHS) network has also accepted the concept of rankism as core to its mission. It asserts, "...the mission we have undertaken at Human DHS is the confrontation of abuse, rankism and the humiliation endemic to it, on the historical scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional mediator Julia Ann Wambach uses Fuller's definition of rankism to explore the abuse of position within a hierarchy from both up and down the lines of power, including how rankism feeds on itself in group contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Wambach, Julie Ann (2008). ''Battles between Somebodies and Nobodies: Combat Abuse of Rank at Work and At Home''. Brookside Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9814818-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rankism and dignity ==

According to Fuller, the abuse of rank is experienced by victims as an affront to their [[dignity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url=http://www.breakingranks.net/weblog/dignity
  | accessdate = 2008-09-16
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller and his supporters have launched a new [[social movement]] to promote the creation of a dignitarian society. The Dignity Movement's goal is to overcome rankism in the same way that the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[feminist movement|women's movements]] targeted racism and sexism.

The '''rule consciousness''' as one of the primary factors of [[personality]] out of sixteen was categorized by (Raymond Cattell, 1946) as low and high level. The descriptors of low level rule consciousness are expedient, nonconforming, disregards rules, self-indulgent or having a low [[super ego]] strength while the high level consciousness are rule-conscious, dutiful, conscientious, conforming, moralistic, staid, rule bound or having high super ego strength.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">'''Sensory maps''' are areas of the [[brain]] which respond to sensory [[stimulation]], and are spatially organized according to some feature of the sensory stimulation. In some cases the sensory map is simply a topographic representation of a sensory surface such as the [[skin]], [[cochlea]], or [[retina]]. In other cases it represents other stimulus properties resulting from neuronal computation and is generally ordered in a manner that reflects the periphery. An example is the somatosensory map which is a projection of the skin's surface in the brain that arranges the processing of tactile sensation. This type of somatotopic map is the most common, possibly because it allows for physically neighboring areas of the brain to react to physically similar stimuli in the periphery or because it allows for greater motor control.

The somatosensory cortex is adjacent to the primary motor cortex which is similarly mapped. Sensory maps may play an important role in facilitating motor responses. Other examples of sensory map organization may be that adjacent brain regions are related through proximity of the receptors that they process as in the map of the cochlea in the brain, or that similar features are processed as in the map of the [[feature detectors]] or the retinotopic map, or that time codes are used in organization as in the maps of an owl's sense of direction via interaural time difference between ears. These examples exist in contrast to non-mapped or randomly distributed patterns of processing. An example of a non-mapped sensory processing system is the olfactory system where unrelated odorants are processed side-by-side in the olfactory bulb. In addition to non-mapped and mapped processing, stimuli may be processed under multiple maps as in the human visual system.

==Functions==
Mapped sensory processing areas are a complex phenomenon and must therefore serve an adaptive advantage as it is highly unlikely for complex phenomena to appear otherwise. Sensory maps are also very old in evolutionary history as they are nearly ubiquitous in all species of animals and are found for nearly all sensory systems. Some advantages of sensory maps have been elucidated by scientific exploration:
# '''Filling In''': When sensory stimulation is organized in the brain in some form of topographic pattern, then the animal might be able to “fill in” information that is missing using neighboring regions of the map since they will usually be activated together when all information is present. Loss of signal from one area can be filled in from adjacent areas of the brain if those areas are for physically related parts of the periphery. This is evident in animal studies where the neurons bordering a lesioned, or damaged, brain area (which used to process the sense of touch in a hand) to recover processing of that sensory region because they process information from adjacent hand areas.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, N., Qi, H.X., Collins, C.E., and Kass, J.H. (1989), Large-Scale Reorganization in the Somatosensory Cortex and Thalamus after Sensory Loss in Macaque Monkeys. Journal of Neuroscience. Vol 28(43): 11042–11060&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Lateral Inhibition''': [[Lateral inhibition]] is an organizing principle, it allows contrast in many systems from the visual to the somatosensory. This means that if adjacent areas inhibit one another then stimulation which activates one brain region can simultaneously inhibit the adjoining brain regions to create a sharper resolution between stimuli. This is evident in the visual system of humans where sharp lines can be detected between bright and dark regions because of [[simple cell]]s which inhibit their neighbors.
# '''Summation''': Organization also allows related stimuli to be summed in the neural assessment of sensory information. Examples of this are found in the summation of tactile inputs neurally or visual inputs under low light &lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, S. (1989), The Role of Sensory Adaptation in the Retina. Journal of Experimental Biology. 146, 39-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Topographic Maps===
These maps may be thought of as a mapping of the surface of the body onto the brain structure. Phrased another way, topographic maps are organized in the neural system in a manner that is a projection of the sensory surface onto the brain. This means that the organization in the periphery mirrors the order of the information processing in the brain. This organization can be '''somatotopic''',&lt;ref&gt;Killackey, H.P., Rhoadesb, R.W., Bennet-Clarke, C.A., (1995), The formation of a cortical somatotopic map, Trends in Neurosciences. Vol.18(9), 402-407&lt;/ref&gt; as in the tactile sense of touch, or '''tonotopic''',&lt;ref&gt;Kaltenbach J.A., Czaja J.M., Kaplan CR., (1992), Changes in the tonotopic map of the dorsal cochlear nucleus following induction of cochlear lesions by exposure to intense sound. Hearing Research. 59(2):213-23&lt;/ref&gt; as in the ear, and the retinotopic map which is laid out in the brain as the cells are arranged on the retina.

====Examples====
# [[Wilder Penfield]] &lt;ref&gt;Penfield, W., Rasmussen, T., (1950), The cerebral cortex of man: a clinical study of localization of function, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the original topographic map in the form of the internal somatosensory [[Homunculus]]. His work on human neural systems showed that the brain areas that processed tactile sensations are mapped in the same fashion that the body is laid out. This sensory map exaggerates certain regions that have many peripheral sense cells like the lips and hands while reduces the relative space for processing areas with few receptors like the back.
# Hair cells in the auditory system display tonotopic organization.&lt;ref&gt;R.V., Ibrahim, D., and Mount, R.J., (1998), Plasticity of tonotopic maps in auditory midbrain following partial cochlear damage in the developing chinchilla, Experimental Brain Research. Vol 123(4), 1432-1106&lt;/ref&gt; This tonotopic arrangement means that cells are laid out to range from low frequency to high frequency and processed in that same organization within the brain.

===Computational Maps===
These maps are organized entirely in the neural system or organized in a manner not present in the periphery. This can be any map that is constructed by neural computation which is the brain relating two or more bits of information in order to obtain some new information from them. Often these maps involve comparing, as in performing subtraction to get a time delay, two stimuli, like incoming sound information from different ears, in order to produce a valuable new bit of information about those stimuli, as in where they originated. The process just described takes place in the owl's neural system very rapidly.

====Examples====
# The '''Jeffres Map''' was a theory of how the brain might compute interaural time differences (ITD), or differences in time of stimulus arrival between the two ears. Jeffres was famous for producing a theoretical mechanism for making a place map out of timing information, this explained how some animals could appear to have a "look-up map" for where a sound came from. The neural system computes this ITD in the Owl Auditory System and the real neural system was found to almost exactly match the Jeffres Map theory.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, C.E., Konishi, M., (1988), Axonal delay lines for time measurement in the owl's brainstem. Neurobiology. Vol. 85, pp. 8311-8315&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeffres Map shows how ITD signals are used to determine distance and direction in the owl.
# Feature Detectors in a [[visual system]] are another example of computational maps. No part of the physical system in the eyes actually analyzes for features like simple cells in the brain do. This system is well studied in frogs. It is known that frogs detect specific "worm-like" features in their environment and, controlled entirely by the neural system, will lunge at them even if they are a series of white squares in a line imitating a basic worm.&lt;ref&gt;Carew, T.J. (2000), Behavioral neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior, Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is also an Frequency Modulation to Frequency Modulation Comparison in the [[Bat]] [[Auditory System]] which is used in echolocation. This FM-FM comparison determines flutter of their target and was made famous in work by Suga.&lt;ref&gt;Suga, N. (1989), Principles of auditory information-processing derived from neuroethology. Journal of Experimental Biology. Vol 146(1): 277-286&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50010">{{Sex differences}}
'''Sex differences in cognition''', or mental abilities, are widely studied in the current scientific literature. Biological and genetic differences in combination with environment and culture have resulted in the [[cognition|cognitive]] differences among men and women. Among biological factors, hormones such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]] may play some role mediating these differences. Among differences of diverse mental and cognitive abilities, the largest or most well known are those relating to spatial abilities, social cognition and verbal [[skills]] and abilities.

== Cognitive abilities ==
Cognitive abilities are mental abilities that a person uses in everyday life, as well as  specific demand tasks. The most basic of these abilities are [[memory]], [[executive function]], [[processing speed]] and [[perception]], which combine to form a larger perceptual umbrella relating to different social, [[Affect (psychology)|affective]], verbal and spatial  information. Memory, which is one of the primary core of cognitive abilities can be broken down into [[short-term memory]], [[working memory]] and [[long-term memory]]. There are also other abilities relating to perceptual information such as [[mental rotation]], [[spatial visualization ability]], [[Verbal fluency test|verbal fluency]] and [[reading comprehension]]. Other larger perceptual umbrellas include [[social cognition]], [[empathy]], spatial perception and verbal abilities.

== Sex differences in memory ==

=== Short term memory ===
Various researchers have conducted studies to determine the differences between men and women and their abilities within their short-term memory. For example, a study conducted by Lowe, Mayfield, and Reynolds (2003) examined gender differences among children and adolescents on various short-term memory measures.  This study included 1,279 children and adolescents, 637 males and 642 females, between the ages of 5 and 19. They found that females scored higher on two verbal subtests: Word Selective Reminding and Object Recall, and males scored higher on the Memory for Location and Abstract Visual Memory subtests, the key spatial memory tasks. In two different studies researchers have found that women perform higher on verbal tasks and men perform higher on spatial tasks (Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Saint-Aubin, 2016). These findings are consistent with studies of intelligence with regards to pattern, females performing higher on certain verbal tasks and males performing higher on certain spatial tasks (Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Saint-Aubin, 2016). Same results have been also found cross culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in cognitive abilities: A cross-cultural perspective|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002839329090141A|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 1063–1077|volume = 28|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/0028-3932(90)90141-A|first = Virginia A.|last = Mann|first2 = Sumiko|last2 = Sasanuma|first3 = Naoko|last3 = Sakuma|first4 = Shinobu|last4 = Masaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sex differences in verbal short term memory have been found regardless of age even among adults, for example a review published in the journal ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' which evaluated studies from 1990–2013 found greater female verbal memory from ages 11–89 years old.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why women see differently from the way men see?

=== Working memory ===
There are usually no sex differences in overall working memory except those involving spatial information such as space and object. A 2004 study published in the journal of ''Applied Cognitive Psychology'' found significantly higher male performance on four visuo-spatial working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender effects in spatial orientation: cognitive profiles and mental strategies|journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology|date = 2004-07-01|issn = 0888-4080|pmc = 2909401|pmid = 20676381|pages = 519–532|volume = 18|issue = 5|doi = 10.1002/acp.1000|first = Andrea|last = Bosco|first2 = Anna M|last2 = Longoni|first3 = Tomaso|last3 = Vecchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2010 study published in the journal ''[[Brain and Cognition]]'' found a male advantage in spatial and object working memory on an n-back test but not for verbal working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Male Advantage for Spatial and Object but Not Verbal Working Memory Using the N-Back Task|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ923021|journal = Brain and Cognition|issn = 0278-2626|pages = 191–196|volume = 76|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2010.12.002|pmid = 21411205|first = Lisa|last = Lejbak|first2 = Margaret|last2 = Crossley|first3 = Mirna|last3 = Vrbancic|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly another study published in the journal ''[[Human Brain Mapping (journal)|Human Brain Mapping]]'' found no sex differences in a verbal n-back working memory task among adults from ages 18–58 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = No gender differences in brain activation during the N-back task: an fMRI study in healthy individuals|journal = Human Brain Mapping|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 1097-0193|pmid = 19387979|pages = 3609–3615|volume = 30|issue = 11|doi = 10.1002/hbm.20783|first = Heike|last = Schmidt|first2 = Jigar|last2 = Jogia|first3 = K.|last3 = Fast|first4 = Tessa|last4 = Christodoulou|first5 = Morgan|last5 = Haldane|first6 = V.|last6 = Kumari|first7 = S.|last7 = Frangou}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also no sex differences in verbal working memory among a study of university students published in the ''Journal of Dental and Medical Sciences''.

=== Long term memory ===
Studies have found a greater female ability in episodic memory involving verbal or both verbal and visual-spatial tasks while a higher male ability that only involves complex visual-spatial episodic memory.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; For example, a study published in the journal ''[[Neuropsychology (journal)|Neuropsychology]]'' found that women perform at a higher level on most verbal episodic tasks and tasks involving some or little visual-spatial episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in episodic memory: the impact of verbal and visuospatial ability|journal = Neuropsychology|date = 1999-10-01|issn = 0894-4105|pmid = 10527068|pages = 590–597|volume = 13|issue = 4|first = A.|last = Herlitz|first2 = E.|last2 = Airaksinen|first3 = E.|last3 = Nordström|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.13.4.590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published the following year found that women perform at a higher level in verbal and non-verbal (non-spatial visual) episodic memory but men performed at a higher level in complex visual-spatial episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences favoring women in verbal but not in visuospatial episodic memory|journal = Neuropsychology|date = 2001-04-01|issn = 0894-4105|pmid = 11324860|pages = 165–173|volume = 15|issue = 2|first = C.|last = Lewin|first2 = G.|last2 = Wolgers|first3 = A.|last3 = Herlitz|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.15.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in the journal ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]'' by researcher Agneta Herlitz also conclude that higher ability in women on episodic-memory tasks requiring both verbal and visuospatial episodic memory and on face-recognition tasks.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex Differences in Episodic Memory|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228618349|journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science|pages = 52–56|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00547.x|first = Agneta|last = Herlitz|first2 = J.|last2 = Rehnman|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex differences in semantic memory have also been found with a higher female ability which can be explained by a female advantage in verbal fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective sex differences in declarative memory|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7921958|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|volume = 32|issue = 7|pages = 1160–1169|accessdate = 2016-01-06|doi = 10.3758/BF03196889|year = 2004|last1 = Maitland|first1 = Scott B.|last2 = Herlitz|first2 = Agneta|last3 = Nyberg|first3 = Lars|last4 = Bäckman|first4 = Lars|last5 = Nilsson|first5 = Lars-Göran}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other study also found greater female free-recall and long term retrieval among the ages 5–17.&lt;ref name="Keith 389–404"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in latent cognitive abilities ages 5 to 17: Evidence from the Differential Ability Scales—Second Edition|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232383641|journal = Intelligence|pages = 389–404|volume = 39|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2011.06.008|first = Timothy Z.|last = Keith|first2 = Matthew R.|last2 = Reynolds|first3 = L.

== Sex differences in executive functions ==
There has not been enough literature or studies assessing sex difference in executive functioning, especially since executive functions are not a unitary concept. However, in the ones that have been done, there have been differences found in attention and inhibition.

=== Attention ===
A 2002 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vision]]'' found that males were faster at shifting attention from one object to another as well as shifting attention within objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = JOV {{!}} Sex differences in shifting attention within and between objects|url = http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2120199|journal = Journal of Vision|volume = 2|issue = 7|pages = 13|access-date = 2016-02-12|doi = 10.1167/2.7.13|year = 2010|last1 = Brown|first1 = J.

=== Inhibition and self-regulation ===
A 2008 study published in the journal ''[[Psychophysiology (journal)|Psychophysiology]]'' found faster reaction time to deviant stimuli in women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender differences in behavioral inhibitory control: ERP evidence from a two-choice oddball task|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23244165|journal = Psychophysiology|pages = 986–993|volume = 45|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2008.00693.x|pmid = 18778319|first = Jiajin|last = Yuan|first2 = Yuanyuan|last2 = He|first3 = Zhang|last3 = Qinglin|first4 = Antao|last4 = Chen|first5 = Hong|last5 = Li|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also analyzed past literature and found higher female performance in withholding social behavior such as aggressive responses and improper sexual arousal.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Furthermore, they found evidence that women were better at resisting temptation in tasks, delaying gratification and controlling emotional expressions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; They also found lower female effort in response inhibition in equal performance for the same tasks implying an advantage for females in response inhibition based on [[Neural efficiency hypothesis|neural efficiency]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In another study published in 2011 in the journal ''Brain and Cognition'', it was found that females outperformed males on the ''Sustained Attention to Response Task'' which is a test that measures inhibitory control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inhibitory control and empathy-related personality traits: Sex-linked associations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262611000777|journal = Brain and Cognition|date = 2011-08-01|pages = 364–368|volume = 76|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2011.04.004|pmid = 21570758|first = Stefan|last = Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have hypothesized that any female advantage in inhibition or self-regulation may have evolved as a response to greater parenting responsibilities in ancestral settings.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Sex differences in processing speed ==
Sex differences in processing speed has been largely noted in literature. Studies published in the journal ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' have found faster processing speed in women. For example, a 2006 study published in ''Intelligence'' by researcher Stephen Camarata and Richard Woodcock found faster processing speed in females across all age groups in a sample of 4,213 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in processing speed: Developmental effects in males and females|year=2006|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222702039|journal = Intelligence|pages = 231–252|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2005.12.001|first = Stephen|last = Camarata|first2 = Richard|last2 = Woodcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another study published in 2008 by researchers Timothy Z Keith and Matthew R.

==Sex differences in semantic perception==
Studies of sex differences in semantic perception (attribution of meaning) of words reported that males conceptualize items in terms of physical or observable attributes whereas females use more evaluative concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Haas |first1=A.|year=1979|title= Male and female spoken language difficulties: stereotypes and evidence.|journal= Psychological Bulletin|volume=86|issue=3|pages=616–626|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1982

== Sex differences in spatial abilities ==

Sex differences in [[Spatial ability|spatial abilities]] are widely established in literature. Males have much higher level of performance in three major spatial tasks which include [[Spatial ability|spatial visualization]], [[Spatial ability|spatial perception]] and [[Spatial ability|mental rotation]].&lt;ref name="Linn 1479–1498"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19086027|journal = Child Development|pages = 1479–1498|volume = 56|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00213.x|first = Marcia C.|last = Linn|first2 = Anne C.|last2 = Petersen|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in cognitive functions|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222512913|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 35|issue = 4|pages = 863–875|access-date = 2016-02-01|doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00288-X|year = 2003|last1 = Weiss|first1 = Elisabeth M.|last2 = Kemmler|first2 = Georg|last3 = Deisenhammer|first3 = Eberhard A.|last4 = Fleischhacker|first4 = W.Wolfgang|last5 = Delazer|first5 = Margarete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial visualization elicits the smallest difference with a deviation of 0.13, perception a deviation of 0.44 and mental rotation the largest with a deviation of 0.73.&lt;ref name="Linn 1479–1498"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender differences in cognition: A minefield of research issues|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251566000|journal = The Irish Journal of Psychology|pages = 386–396|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/03033910.1997.1010558158|first = Tadhg|last = Maclntyre|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of cognitive imaging and sex differences on the development of laparoscopic suturing skills|journal = Canadian Journal of Surgery|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0008-428X|pmc = 3211902|pmid = 16248138|pages = 387–393|volume = 48|issue = 5|first = Tyrone|last = Donnon|first2 = Jean-Gaston|last2 = DesCôteaux|first3 = Claudio|last3 = Violato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2013 meta-analysis published in the journal ''Educational Review'' found greater male mental rotation in a deviation of 0.57 which only grew larger as time limits were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Meta-Analysis on Gender Differences in Mental Rotation Ability Measured by the Purdue Spatial Visualization Tests: Visualization of Rotations (PSVT:R)|journal = Educational Psychology Review|date = 2012-12-09|issn = 1040-726X|pages = 69–94|volume = 25|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10648-012-9215-x|first = Yukiko|last = Maeda|first2 = So Yoon|last2 = Yoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These male advantages manifests themselves in math and mechanical tasks for example significantly higher male performance on tests of [[Geometry|geometr]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y, [[measurement]], [[probability]], [[statistics]] and especially [[Mechanical aptitude|mechanical reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Differences"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex Affects Behavior and Perception|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222297/|date = 2001-01-01|first = Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding the Biology of Sex and Gender|last = Differences|first2 = Theresa M.|last2 = Wizemann|first3 = Mary-Lou|last3 = Pardue}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also manifests and largely mediates higher male performance in arithmetic and computational fluency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in spatial cognition, computational fluency, and arithmetical reasoning|journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date = 2000-12-01|issn = 0022-0965|pmid = 11063633|pages = 337–353|volume = 77|issue = 4|doi = 10.1006/jecp.2000.2594|first = D.

=== Empathy ===
Empathy is a large part of [[social cognition]] and facilitates its cognitive components known as [[theory of mind]]. Current literature suggests a consistent higher level of [[empathy]] in woman compared to men.

Throughout prehistory, females nurtured and were the primary caretakers of children, so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14819">'''Sexual bullying''' is a type of [[bullying]] and [[Sexual harassment|harassment]] that occurs in connection with a person's [[sex]], body,  [[sexual orientation]] or with [[sexual activity]]. It can be [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], or [[emotional abuse|emotional]].

==Definition==
The [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] has defined sexual bullying as "any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The erstwhile [[Beatbullying]] organisation (now defunct) had a similar definition.&lt;ref name=BB01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=56 |title=What is sexual bullying?  |publisher=[[Beatbullying]] |date= |accessdate=24 Apr 2010 |quote = {{dead link|date=July 2018}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be the use of sexual words to put someone down, like calling someone a slut, a slag, or gay, or spreading rumours about someone's alleged sex life. In its most extreme form, it can be inappropriate touching, [[sexual assault]] or even [[rape]].&lt;ref name=BB01 /&gt; This term is primarily used in the United Kingdom and is not yet used in other areas.
Definitions and descriptions of bullying and of sexual bullying can be problematic, however. Offensive terms are often deployed in a friendly way, so the context of such exchanges is very important, and adults sometimes misinterpret them. Conversely, while much sexual bullying is overt, a great deal is not, and appears to be ordinary bullying. An example of this is the teasing by tough boys of a 'geeky' boy for his academic ability. What is actually happening is that the boy is being mocked for his lack of machismo, or his lack of engagement in heterosexist banter with girls or boys. Superficially, the bullying has no sexual content, but is underpinned by the aggressors staking a claim to dominance for their 'type of boy' (See Mac An Ghaill, 1994 and Duncan, 1999).

==Prevalence==
As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] programme commissioned a
questionnaire aimed at young people aged 11–19 years in schools and youth clubs across five regions of [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBC01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7811000/7811468.stm |title=Rising problem of sexual bullying in schools |publisher=[[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]  |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey revealed that of the 273 young people who responded to the questionnaire, 28 had been forced to do something sexual and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching.&lt;ref name=NSPCC01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/questions/sexual_bullying_wda70106.html |title=What is sexual bullying and how can I manage it within educational settings? |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Government figures show that in school year 2007/8 there were 3,450 fixed period exclusions and 120 permanent exclusions from schools in [[England]] due to sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name=DCSF01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000860/index.shtml |title=Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions from Schools in England 2007/08 |publisher=UK Government's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That equates to 19 exclusions per school day&lt;ref name=BB02 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=145&amp;Itemid=48 |title=Beatbullying on Panorama tonight to discuss Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[Beatbullying]] |date= |accessdate=24 Apr 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for incidents including groping and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, [[ChildLine]] counselled a total of 156,729 children. Of these, 26,134 children spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of these talked specifically about sexual bullying.&lt;ref name=NSPCC03 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf |title=NSPCC policy summary. |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of children who have attended [[Kidscape]] free ZAP anti-bullying sessions have reported some form of sexual bullying.&lt;ref name=kc01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidscape.org.uk/info/sexualbullying.asp |title=Sexual 7 Bullying |publisher=[[Kidscape]] |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122220056/http://kidscape.org.uk/info/sexualbullying.asp |archivedate=22 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant proportion of LGBT students experience homophobic and transphobic violence in school. This is shown consistently by data from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America and the Pacific, with the proportion affected ranging from 16 per cent in Nepal to 85 per cent in the United States. LGBT students are also more likely to experience such violence at school than at home or in the community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBT students report a higher prevalence of violence at school than their non-LGBT peers. In New Zealand, for example, lesbian, gay and bisexual students were three times more likely to be bullied than their heterosexual peers and in Norway 15–48 per cent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students reported being bullied compared with 7 per cent of heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types of interactions==
A survey by the UK National Union of Teachers suggests that sexual bullying is most often carried out by boys against girls, although girls are increasingly harassing girls and boys in a sexual manner.&lt;ref name=NUT01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/10552 |title=NUT policy statement on preventing sexual harassment and bullying |publisher=[[National Union of Teachers]] |date= |accessdate=25 Apr 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025547/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/10552 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil01 &gt;Sexual Bullying: Gender Conflict and Pupil Culture in Secondary schools, Neil Duncan, Routledge,1999&lt;/ref&gt; shows that sexual bullying starts at primary school level and usually  takes the form of verbal insults by boys directed at girls and women through demeaning sexually abusive and aggressive language. A NUT study&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NUT02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/4954 |title=A Serious Business: an NUT Report on sexism and harassment in schools |publisher=National Union of Teachers |work=University of Warwick |year=2006 |accessdate=25 Apr 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609071015/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/4954 |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that these verbal insults are generally centred on girls' sexual status including terms such as 'bitch', 'slag', 'tart' and 'slut'. Other researchers cite similar evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Divide: Gender in the primary school, M Clark, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents are typically dismissed as playful behaviour or justified through humour, however.&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt; The research also shows that boys are also subjected to a range of sexual bullying by other boys and by girls although this is said to be less obvious. The most prevalent issue is sexual verbal abuse and being called obscene names. The names that cause most offence to boys are homophobic terms and those that are associated with the 'absence' of high status masculinity.&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil01/&gt; Sexual bullying can involve spreading rumours about someone's sexuality or sex life,&lt;ref name="Womankind guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=C.|last2=Wharf|first2=H.|title=Stop sexual bullying: Preventing violence, promoting equality: Act now|url=http://www.womankind.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/published-YP-report-Nov-2010.pdf|website=WOMANKIND Worldwide|publisher=WOMANKIND Worldwide|accessdate=23 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203094243/http://www.womankind.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/published-YP-report-Nov-2010.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or showing or posting sexual comments, photos, or videos,&lt;ref name=Kidshealth&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual harassment and sexual bullying|url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/harassment.html#|website=TeensHealth|publisher=The Nemours Foundation|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[revenge porn]].

Some people, including the UK charity [[Beatbullying]], have claimed that children are being bullied into providing 'sexual favours' in exchange for protection as gang culture enters inner city schools.&lt;ref name=BBC02 &gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6500005.stm |title= Girls bullied for 'sex favours'  |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= 27 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the [[National Union of Teachers]], challenged the charity to provide evidence of this, as they had no evidence that this sort of behaviour was happening in schools.&lt;ref name=BBC02 /&gt;

==Associated effects and risks==
[[Bullying]] victimization occurs more frequently in [[sexual minorities]] than [[heterosexual]] individuals.&lt;ref name="Ref1 Phys Health Disparities"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=J.

[[Anti-gay]] physical bullying, along with [[sexual abuse]] and verbal bullying, can lead to [[psychosocial]] health problems, which can be a predictor of risky sex behaviours.&lt;ref name="Ref4 GBM" /&gt; Men who have sex with men in the United States and Canada have a higher prevalence of [[HIV]] than any other cohort.&lt;ref name="Ref4 GBM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tulloch|first1=T.

On August 12, 2011, the first SlutWalk took place simultaneously in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]] and [[Mar del Plata]], under the name "La Marcha de las Putas". The organizers, most of them belonging to women's and human rights organizations, described the march as "not a strategy to fight, but a union of women and men to demand respect for the individual liberties of women." Participants mentioned the alarming rates of [[Femicide|murdered women]] and [[Human trafficking in Argentina#Sexual abuse|human trafficking for sexual exploitation in Argentina]] as motives to join the SlutWalk.&lt;ref name=todasputas&gt;{{cite news|title=La Marcha de las Putas|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-174298-2011-08-12.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Pagina12|date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monfort"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenne|first=Amelia|title=Slutwalk Argentina|url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/socialissues/urbanlife/slutwalk-argentina/|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=The Argentina Independent|date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist|Feminist deputy]] María José Lubertino, who participated in the protest, said: "Even though it started in a foreign country, this march helps us build a better citizenship and that is what pushes public policies forward."&lt;ref name=marchadelno&gt;{{cite news|last=Magnani|first=Rocío|title=La marcha del no|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-174915-2011-08-20.html|accessdate=December 6, 2013|date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, 2011, La Marcha de las Putas protested in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. The day was selected for being the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]]. A document issued by the organizers states: "we will march to demand an end to all forms of [[violence against women]], the figure of [[femicide]] as [[Aggravation (legal concept)|aggravation]] incorporated into the [[penal code]], budget for the implementation of the [[Domestic Violence]] Act and the processing and approval of the [[Abortion rights|law for voluntary interruption of pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=mendoz&gt;{{cite news|title=La 'Marcha de las Putas' llega a Mendoza para oponerse a la violencia de género|url=http://www.diariouno.com.ar/mendoza/La-Marcha-de-las-Putas-llega-a-Mendoza-para-oponerse-a-la-violencia-de-genero-20111124-0071.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Diario Uno|date=November 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061824/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/mendoza/La-Marcha-de-las-Putas-llega-a-Mendoza-para-oponerse-a-la-violencia-de-genero-20111124-0071.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Marchas de las Putas were held in Buenos Aires, [[Córdoba (city, Argentina)|Córdoba]], [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]] and Mar del Plata on November 3, 2012. The main theme for the protest were [[Gender role#Gender stereotypes|sexual stereotypes]]. The march began with an exposition of photographs from the previous rally. There were also workshops and debate spaces regarding intimate and social respect, non-sexist education and [[Media violence research|media violence]], while several music bands performed on stage. Organizer Verónica Lemi explained: "marching is not enough. We need to raise awareness and create spaces for reflection and debate so we can take our slogans to our daily lives. We need society to stop justifying, tolerating or minimizing sexual abuses, and to stop victim-blaming." She also pointed at the need to promote that "sexual abuse survivors speak of their experiences without being judged for it, and get the help they need to heal." The objective of the protest was to re-signify the word "[[Spanish profanity#Puta|puta]]" (equivalent for "slut", but also for "prostitute"), to take its violent power away so it cannot be used to cause harm, to favor the construction of a society where everyone is respected regardless of gender, sexual orientation or chosen lifestyle.&lt;ref name=telam&gt;{{cite news|title=La 'Marcha de las Putas' dijo "No a los abusos sexuales"|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/42978/|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Télam|date=November 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212104428/http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/42978/|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2013, another Marcha de las Putas took place in Buenos Aires. It began with an open space for sharing experiences of abuse, most of which had happened to the speakers during childhood or as teenagers, and kept silenced during years. "It took me twelve years to tell my family I was abused when I was 10. I only was able to do it after I joined this movement and found other people went through similar situations" explained Deborah, one of the organizers. Rita González, other of the organizers, explained the march is framed in a wider range of "actions done during the whole year, to give legal assistance, emotional support and company to people who have been through difficult situations, which they begin to overcome in healing encounters where they can verbalize their pain." The selected slogan for the protest was: "''Desnudando la cultura de la violación'' (Disclosing [[rape culture]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodríguez|first=Carlos|title=Una tarde de decir y escuchar verdades|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-230662-2013-10-06.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Pagina12|date=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities known to host Slutwalks were [[Posadas, Argentina|Posadas]], [[La Plata]] and [[Formosa, Argentina|Formosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gimena Franchini Díaz|first=Constanza Pastor|title=TU MAMÁ TAMBIÉN: APROPIACIONES DE LA MARCHA DE LAS PUTAS EN ARGENTINA|publisher=Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|isbn=978-950-33-0980-3|url=http://publicaciones.ffyh.unc.edu.ar/index.php/2congresogeneroysociedad/article/view/878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

María José Lubertino, once again participant of the march, said: "in the 21st century, we cannot allow women to be judged for how we dress. A few weeks ago our [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|President Cristina]] was discredited for wearing [[leggings]], a clear example of what we see in a daily basis in different spheres.

On November 19, 2013, La Marcha de las Putas participated among several other organizations in a wider protest to raise awareness on [[child sexual abuse]]. It included activities related to the importance of detection and prevention of child molestation, legal processes, and healing. The protest advocated for better laws, and for the effective application of the existing laws. The day was closed with speeches from the organizations, and artistic activities for the participants.&lt;ref name=elsol&gt;{{cite news|title=Una marcha a Casa Rosada para luchar contra el abuso infantil|url=http://elsolonline.com/noticias/ver/1311/188673/una-marcha-a-casa-rosada-para-luchar-contra-el-abuso-infantil|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=El Sol|date=November 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212200415/http://elsolonline.com/noticias/ver/1311/188673/una-marcha-a-casa-rosada-para-luchar-contra-el-abuso-infantil|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marcha das Vadias Brasília2011.JPG|thumbnail|left|Marcha das Vadias at [[Brasilia]], on June 18, 2011. The sign reads: "Changing the world through [[Feminisms]]" ]]
The first SlutWalk took place in [[Sao Paulo]] under the name "Marcha das Vadias" (also "Marcha de las Vagabundas") on June 4, 2011. Around 300 people gathered, marching in daily outfits. Only a 23 years old student participated in underwear. The organizers of the event, writer Solange De-Ré and publicist Madô Lopez explained: "We do not want [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]]. We want people to dress normally, as they like to wear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toledo Piza|first=Paulo|title=Mulheres com pouca roupa fazem a 'Marcha das Vadias' em SP|url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2011/06/mulheres-com-pouca-roupa-fazem-marcha-das-vadias-em-sp.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 2011 a new Marcha das Vadias gathered one thousand people at [[Brasilia]]. Despite the name, the SlutWalk brought together women, men and families, sometimes including babies. Participants chanted slogans against sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cerca de mil pessoas participam da 'Marcha das Vadias' em Brasília|url=http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2011/06/cerca-de-mil-pessoas-participam-da-marcha-das-vadias-em-brasilia.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2011, hundreds of people attended Marcha das Vadias at [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]], in the South Zone of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Participants advocated for the improvement in hospitals and police stations for women victims of sexual abuse, access to abortion with no paperwork when pregnancy is the result of rape, and the effective implementation of the [[Lei Maria da Penha]], in cases of battered women. During 2011, new Marchas das Vadias were organized at [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Juiz de Fora]], [[Recife]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]].&lt;ref name=brazil1&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha das Vadias reúne mulheres no Rio contra a violência sexual|url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2011/07/marcha-das-vadias-reune-mulheres-no-rio-contra-violencia-sexual.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2012, Marcha das Vadias took place simultaneously in [[Brasilia]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo and Vitoria, among others. During the march in Brasilia, a man participating in the protest began to speak offensive phrases to women and homosexuals, and then dropped his pants to show his penis. He was quickly arrested and taken to a nearby police station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scantily-clad women protest in mass Slut Walk in Brazil|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/scantily-clad-women-protest-in-mass-slut-walk-in-brazil/story-e6frf00i-1226369033307|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Homem é detido por ato obsceno em Marcha das Vadias no DF|url=http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2012/05/homem-e-detido-por-atentado-ao-pudor-em-marcha-das-vadias-no-df.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2013, Marcha das Vadias was held in Recife and Sao Paulo, gathering over  2000 and 1000 people respectively. Késia Salgado, organizer at Recife stated: "The march is to show that women will no longer be silent, that impunity will not happen; we live a social epidemic and have to reeducate ourselves. Marcha das Vadias does not end when the protest is over, we keep working so that daily violence is not forgotten." In this city, the protest included various artistic interventions of groups supporting the cause. Towards the end of the march at Praça da Independência, the group opened space for testimonials. With megaphones, women victims of sexual assault shared their experiences with the rest of the participants.&lt;ref name=ne10uol&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha das Vadias no Recife exige o fim da violência contra a mulher|url=http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cotidiano/grande-recife/noticia/2013/05/25/marcha-das-vadias-no-recife-exige-o-fim-da-violencia-contra-a-mulher-421384.php|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Uol|date=May 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211214350/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cotidiano/grande-recife/noticia/2013/05/25/marcha-das-vadias-no-recife-exige-o-fim-da-violencia-contra-a-mulher-421384.php|archivedate=December 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sao Paulo, the march walked past rue Augusta, a street known for being a gathering point for prostitutes, as a gesture of support. "It's in Augusta where we find the women that society likes to call sluts, or rapeable" explained a member of the collective."Our intention is to create visibility on the fight against violence towards women. We want to encourage women who are suffering violence to break the silence and make men aware of the daily acts of violence they practice." Protesters also handed over to pedestrians a "security card" to be kept in wallets, containing the phone number of services which  help abused women.&lt;ref name=folhauol&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha das Vadias reúne cerca de mil pessoas na av.

There was a new Marcha das Vadias organised at Brasilia on June 22, 2013, gathering around 3000 people. Protesters spoke against the State intervention on women's bodies, and against religious leaders occupying seats in State institutions. A new episode was reported of a man who, in apparent state of drunkenness, insulted the manifestants and dropped his pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Calgaro|first=Fernanda|title=Marcha das Vadias no DF reúne 3.000, diz PM; manifestante admite "cansaço" por atos|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2013/06/22/marcha-das-vadias-no-df-reune-3000-diz-pm.htm|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Uol|date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, Marcha das Vadias was planned to match a visit from [[Pope Francis]] to the city, on June 22, 2013, in the context of the [[World Youth Day]], and the protest was renamed "Jornada Mundial das Vadias (World Slut Day)". Organizer Rogéria Peixinho explained "performing the act during the Pope's visit is also a way to put another youth on the street, establishing a political counterpoint. We want to show that there is another youth and another way of thinking about the world, and the chosen date also has to do with it." There were several participants in costumes representing religious characters such as [[nun]]s and the [[Pope]], and signs with puns and slogans rejecting religious views on women and sexuality. A group called Católicas Pelo Direito de Decidir (Catholic Women for the Right to Choose) in favor of abortion, women priests and married priests, participated in the protest.

Peixinho asserted the importance of the Pope's visit regarding the objectives of Marcha das Vadias: "The presence of the Pope and the public resources allocated for the visit of a spiritual leader calls into question the secular State. (...) This matter falls within the axes of our movement, as well as the right to the body, the complaints about the rape cases that are increasing especially in Rio, and the formulation of public policies to protect women." The participants, during the march, encountered a group of about 50 pilgrims from [[France]], [[Chile]] and [[Italy]], participating in the World Youth Day, who were offended by the act and started insulting the participants. A pilgrim spat in the face of a protester. However, most pilgrims peacefully observed the demonstration and some foreigners, without realizing it, mingled among the protesters.&lt;ref name=brazil2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bertolotto|first=Rosrigo|title=Peregrino cospe no rosto de manifestante da Marcha das Vadias|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2013/07/27/peregrino-cospe-no-rosto-de-manifestante-da-marcha-das-vadias.htm|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Uol|date=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the protest, some of the participants smashed statues of saints. Peixinho assured the action was not planned nor encouraged by the organizers, but after the incident several of them suffered death threats via phone calls, text messages and messages on social networks, and several pages were created on Facebook exposing their phone numbers and addresses. The movement denounced the case to the [[Human Rights Commission]] of Alerj and sought support of [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barros|first=Jorge Antonio|title=Líderes da Marcha das Vadias são ameaçadas de morte|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/ancelmo/posts/2013/08/02/lideres-da-marcha-das-vadias-sao-ameacadas-de-morte-505554.asp|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=August 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212124712/http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/ancelmo/posts/2013/08/02/lideres-da-marcha-das-vadias-sao-ameacadas-de-morte-505554.asp|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the demonstrations women chanted things such as "Claudie Ferreria resists", referring and standing in solidarity to the black woman who was murdered  and then dragged on the street attached to a Military Police Van in Rio de Janeiro. In addition to the chants, phrases such as "This is not an invitation", were written on the bodies of the demonstrators to protest sexual abuse and sexism against black women.

The protest proceeded to divide into two locations, at a Women's Police Station and Cidade Baixa. At the Women's Police Station, the focus was violence against women perpetuated by the police. Open letters with demands, such as better service conditions at the station, increased vacancies in shelters for female victims of violence and violence prevention programs. Protesters as well laid in the street to symbolically depict the systemic violence against black women in Brazil. The sector of the protest that continued to Cidade Baixa, marked the pavement with graffiti at places where sexist, racist and homophobic events occurred. One of the demonstration stops were at Pingium bar in which protestors booed the bar, kissed,and burned the entrance carpet along with their bras.&lt;ref name="blackwomenofbrazil.co"/&gt;}}

On September 19, 2011 the first Slutwalk took place in the city of [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] with the name La Marcha de las Putas y las Maracas, and was appointed to walk from Plaza del Corregidor  to [[Estación Mapocho]]. The protest was organized by collective Rita Lazo, which explained: "this is an answer to the violence still present in many areas of our lives. When we appropriate and re-signify the word "puta", we take down its offensive meaning and fight against the dominance over our bodies. We abort fear: when a woman says NO it means NO. Nothing justifies a rapist's actions. Let us break the [[Stereotype threat|rules on how to "be a woman"]]. This struggle is not only one of women, but of society as a whole. That's why we say: WE ARE ALL PUTAS!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convocan a llamativa marcha contra el sexismo en Santiago|url=http://www.lasegunda.com/Noticias/Nacional/2011/09/681780/Convocan-a-llamativa-marcha-contra-el-sexismo-en-Santiago|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=La Segunda|date=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Marcha de las Putas y las Maracas llegó a Chile|url=http://antropologiadegenero.com/?p=1479|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=EGAL|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214075801/http://antropologiadegenero.com/?p=1479|archivedate=December 14, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2012, over 400 people, mostly female students, marched in the city of Ñuñoa under the name "La Marcha de las Putas" to protest against the city mayor Pedro Sabat for his saying regarding the occupation of the Female National Boarding School. In a debate with the president of the [[Student Federation of the University of Chile|Student Federation]], [[Camila Vallejo]], Sabat described the Boarding School as "a [[harlotry]]", and accused the students of engaging in [[sex trade]] within the institution. Previous to the protest, the students presented legal charges for [[defamation]] against the mayor.

Io Guiria, spokeswoman of the students ensured that they were "ready to carry out the protest to the very end". "We believe the Justice system must take action after such serious declarations" she stated, and also added they expect an [[indemnity]] as well as a public apology "and, if possible, [[jail time]]." The protest ended when Special [[Carabiniers of Chile|Carabiniers]] Forces acted to prevent the crowd from cutting street traffic on Irarrázaval street, and faced protesters with [[tear gas|tear gas bombs]] and [[water cannons]]. Student Natalia Torres was hit by a stone in the head and was left unattended for 40 minutes until she got help from a doctor who walked by. Six people were arrested by the time the protest was over.&lt;ref name=chile&gt;{{cite news|title=Manifestantes realizan 'Marcha de las prostitutas' en rechazo a alcalde Sabat|url=http://cnnchile.com/noticia/2012/01/13/manifestantes-realizan-marcha-de-las-prostitutas-en-rechazo-a-alcalde-sabat|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=CNN Chile|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fotos: La "Marcha de las Putas" contra el alcalde Sabat en Ñuñoa|url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/pais/2012/01/14/fotos-la-marcha-de-las-putas-contra-el-alcalde-sabat-en-nunoa/|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=El Mostrador|date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==

On February 25, 2012, the first Slutwalk  was held with the name "La Marcha de las Putas" in the cities of [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Manizales]], [[Medellín]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], the island of [[San Andrés (island)|San Andrés]], [[Villavicencio, Colombia|Villavicencio]], [[Tunja]], and [[Bogotá]], gathering up to 2000 people in the country's capital, at [[Bolívar Square]]. The participants included men, women, the LGBT community, intellectuals, college students and [[Catholic Church]] representatives. Some men assisted in naked torsos and wearing red lipstick. There were also many topless women, one of which explained: "I came naked today because it must be clear than my body is mine alone, and even walking in bare breasts only I decide who gets to touch me." Mar Candela, one of the organizers, was in charge of the opening speech: "We suffer to be called sluts for living our sexuality freely. When we are victims of violence, there are those who dare say we "asked for it". We are victims of harassment in buses, in streets, in public spaces. This society need to understand that when a woman says no, it's no." In Colombia, a woman is victim of abuse every 6 hours, and an average 245 women are victims of some kind of violence every day. Mar Candela stated La Marcha de las Putas proved that all sections of society are committed to ending it. "We'll do it. We'll make possible that no woman is made victim of violence under the complicity of society's silence." &lt;ref name=colombia2&gt;{{cite news|last=Alsema|first=Adriaan|title=Colombia SlutWalk draws thousands|url=http://colombiareports.co/colombia-slutwalk-draws-thousands/|accessdate=November 26, 2013|newspaper=Colombia Reports|date=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=semana&gt;{{cite news|title=Este sábado se realizará la 'marcha de las putas' en Colombia|url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/este-sabado-realizara-marcha-putas-colombia/253920-3|accessdate=November 26, 2013|newspaper=Semana|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest was closed by a speech from a group of [[sex workers]] who demanded the government and society to [[Sex workers rights|recognize their rights]]. Darly, one of them, expressed: "We want to be respected. We work with our bodies, like everyone else. The shoemaker uses his hands to make shoes, the football player uses his feet to score goals. Therefore, being a prostitute, no one has the right to point a finger at me or treat me with violence."&lt;ref name=eltiempo&gt;{{cite news|last=Sarralde Duque|first=Milena|title='Este es mi cuerpo y se respeta', gritaron mujeres en marcha nacional|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/gente/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-11219502.html|accessdate=November 26, 2013|newspaper=El Tiempo|date=February 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011813/http://www.eltiempo.com/gente/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-11219502.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social [[NGOs]] Opción Colombia and Red Colombiana de Masculinidades no Hegemónicas (Colombian Network of non-[[Hegemonic]] [[Masculinities]]) also participated in the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCMNH y Opción Colombia Apoyan Marcha de las Putas|url=http://opcioncolombia.org/?p=506|publisher=Opción Colombia|accessdate=November 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003533/http://opcioncolombia.org/?p=506|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2013, La Marcha de las Putas was held simultaneously in Bogotá, where over 1000 people attended, Barranquilla, [[Cali, Colombia|Cali]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], Manizales and Medellín. Mar Candela, organiser at Bogotá and coordinator of the protest on the national level, decided to use the word "PUTAS" as an acronym for "''Por Una Transformación Auténtica y Social'' (For An Authentic Social Transformation)", which had been used in [[Peru]] during the protests. She adds: "The word "puta" shouldn't even be used as an offense, and doing so reveals great ignorance. Whatever a woman does with her vagina, she is a human being with full [[individual rights]]. It is commonly said that being a prostitute means losing [[constitutional rights]] and State protection, but [[Legal prostitution#Prostitution legal and regulated|prostitution is legal in Colombia]]. And even if it was illegal, they are still in complete possession of their rights, because [[human rights]] apply even for criminals."

According to Mar Candela, all fractions of society were represented in the march including [[Catholics]], [[protestants]], [[LGBT]], [[atheists]], artists, [[agnostics]] and [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|krishnas]], which allowed to treat the subject outside of the traditional feminist context. She also spoke regarding activities from La Marcha de las Putas apart from the street protests: "we've been collaborating with schools and communities in different neighborhoods, and now we're magnifying those processes. Today, our feminist movement and the urban pedagogy of Slutwalk counts on the presence of [[Sexology|sexual psychologist]] Alejandra Quintero, who's strongly supporting the matter of female body [[empowerment]]."&lt;ref name=colombia&gt;{{cite news|title=Habla la líder de la 'Marcha de las Putas|url=http://www.sercolombiano.com/2013/03/11/habla-la-lider-de-la-marcha-de-las-putas/|accessdate=November 27, 2013|newspaper=Ser Colombiano|date=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcha de las Putas / March of the Whores, 06-04-2013|url=http://vizzorimage.photoshelter.com/gallery/-/G0000VHdlayx1PRc/|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as fighting conservative attitudes, women and women's organizations on the march were concerned about the sexual violence that has been an integral part of the [[Colombian armed conflict|armed conflict]].

Rubiela Valderrama, organiser at Cartagena, stated that many organizations, collectives and foundations were invited to join the protest. She also explained the objective of La Marcha de las Putas is "to create interest among the Cartagena community, to promote its participation in [[affirmative action]] focused on the transformation of individual and collective conscience to break the oppression, injustice and any rule or norm which naturalizes violence against women in the city." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Álvarez|first=Rubén Darío|title=El sábado habrá Marcha de las putas en Getsemaní|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.co/cartagena/local/el-sabado-habra-marcha-de-las-putas-en-getsemani-114528|accessdate=November 27, 2013|newspaper=El Universal|date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2013, La Marcha de las Putas organised a protest in front of a famous restaurant in Bogotá called Andrés Carne de Res. An accusation had been made on November 2, of a 19-year-old woman who was raped by a lawyer in the restaurant's parking lot and Andrés Jaramillo, owner of the restaurant, pointed at the victim's clothes as an explanation. The initiative was spread mainly through social networks. After the events, Jaramillo apologized and denied to have a sexist attitude, and the accused rapist presented himself at the [[public prosecutor]]'s office for questioning, but was not arrested.&lt;ref name=uypress&gt;{{cite news|title=Colombia: Marcha de las Putas denuncia violación en restaurante|url=http://www.uypress.net/uc_46331_1.html|accessdate=November 27, 2013|newspaper=UY Press|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2011, the first Slutwalk of Costa Rica was held in the city of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] with the name "La Marcha de las Putas" and the invitation was spread mainly through social networks. Organizer Montserrat Sagot, [[university professor]] and feminist leader, is the author of several books including "When Violence Against Women Kills: [[Femicide]] in Costa Rica." The protest was directed against remarks made on August 2 by senior Catholic [[clerics]] during a ceremony in [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] honouring Costa Rica's [[patron saint]], the [[Virgen de los Angeles]].

At the event, [[Bishop (Catholicism)|Bishop]] José Francisco Ulloa called on women to dress "modestly" to not be "[[dehumanized]]" and "[[Objectification|objectified]]." "The sexual gift that God gave women is wrapped in love and fidelity for its ultimate purpose: fertilization," Ulloa said. Mexican [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Francisco Robles, representing [[Pope Benedict XVI]], said at the ceremony that a woman's mission "does not consist in emulating men, but rather in creating a more humane world by exercising creativity in the household." Robles urged women to enter public life "without imitating men," and to strengthen their role at home as mothers and family members. "The mandate from the (Catholic) church for women to act with modesty and decency is the same conservative message that intends to blame women for the abuses of which they are victims," Sagot said.&lt;ref name=costarica&gt;{{cite news|title="Slut Walk" In Costa Rica Today|url=http://www.insidecostarica.com/dailynews/2011/august/14/costarica11081401.htm|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Inside Costa Rica|date=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of organizers issued a communication in defense of the right of women to dress as they wish, with no Church or institution imposing limitations. "Our claim is the most basic of [[feminism]]: we decide over our own lives, no one else has to tell us how to dress, what to think or what we should do. On the contrary, it is necessary to teach men not to rape, assault and abuse" says the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Costa Rica tendrá su propia 'Marcha de las putas' el próximo domingo|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/08/11/noticias/1313069543.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=El Mundo|date=August 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also demanded the enforcement of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), ratified by Costa Rica in 1986 and the Convention of Belém do Pará ([[Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women|Inter-American Convention]] on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women) ratified by Costa Rica in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solórzano-Alfaro|first=Gustavo|title="Marcha de las Putas", Costa Rica|url=http://www.gustavosolorzanoalfaro.com/2011/08/marcha-de-las-putas-costa-rica.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=La Casa de Asterión|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the protest, Sagot wrote: "The march proved that in this country exists a new generation, who is not willing to answer with "good manners" to institutions which, like the Catholic hierarchy, disrespect their rights, blame women for the violence they suffer and which, from a position of power ( ... ) attempt to impose norms and lifestyles to people who do not agree with them." She also linked the protests to the "evident commitments" of [[Laura Chinchilla|President Laura Chinchilla]] to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sagot|first=Montserrat|title=La marcha de las putas y la Costa Rica que ya no es|url=http://www.nacion.com/foros/marcha-putas-Costa-Rica_0_1217478266.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=La Nacion|date=September 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230516/http://www.nacion.com/foros/marcha-putas-Costa-Rica_0_1217478266.html|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2013, a second Marcha de las Putas was organised at San José with the slogan "''No es no. La violencia nunca es consentida'' (No means no: violence is never consented)". The choice of the slogan denounced sayings from former deputy [[Óscar López (politician)|Oscar Lopez]], who declared there is "a thin line between consent and rape". Organizers claim such statements minimize the problem of sexual violence against women, justify the actions of rapists, and reinforce misogynistic speech. Their aim was that Lopez retracts his comments and recognises that sexual assault as a serious form of violence against women. They also called for Lopez's political party, [[Accessibility without Exclusion|Partido de Accessibilidad Sin Exclusión]], to commit on taking action, and for all other political parties to pronounce on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Álvarez|first=William|title=Marcha de las Putas buscará que Óscar López se retracte de sus comentarios|url=http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33222-Marcha-de-las-Putas-buscara-que-Oscar-Lopez-se-retracte-de-sus-comentarios.note.aspx|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Teletica|date=November 21, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125010819/http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33222-Marcha-de-las-Putas-buscara-que-Oscar-Lopez-se-retracte-de-sus-comentarios.note.aspx|archivedate=November 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meza|first=Iván|title="Marcha de las putas" llama la atención acerca de la violencia|url=http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33430-Marcha-de-las-putas-llama-la-atencion-acerca-de-la-violencia-.note.aspx|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Teletica|date=November 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002709/http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33430-Marcha-de-las-putas-llama-la-atencion-acerca-de-la-violencia-.note.aspx|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecuador==

On March 11, 2012, the first Slutwalk took place in [[Quito]], with the name "La Marcha de las Putas". [[Sex workers]] and [[transgender]] people attended the event, and the meeting of the organizer previous to the protest was at Casa Transgénero (Transgender House). [[Social movement]] Ruptura also supported the march, stating: "This protest advocates for the right of women to express their reality in their [[clothes]], poses and [[make up]], and this can't be turned into an excuse for [[harassment]] and [[abuse]]."&lt;ref name=universo&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha de las putas se realiza este sábado para protestar contra la violencia|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2012/03/09/1/1355/marcha-putas-realiza-sabado-protestar-contra-violencia.html|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=El Universal|date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2013, another Marcha de las Putas was organized in Quito by [[feminist]] and [[LGBT activism|LGBT collectives]], gathering nearly 3000 people. Organizer Ana Almeida explained: "We want to establish a precedent of this message of no violence against women, because women's bodies must be respected; we can't allow women to be [[stigmatized]] for their clothes. Nothing can justify violence. We make a constant political work to redefine the word "puta" and what it means to both women and men."

At the march, there was an increased number of male participants, as well as people with naked torsos, a fake [[Catholic priest]] in pink robe, many signs with rhymes and slogans, [[live music]]ians and [[stilts|stiltwalkers]]. Halfway through the protest, rain began to pour down, but the protest continued while many chanted: "''¡Que llueva, que llueva, las putas no se ahuevan!'' (Let it rain, let it rain, sluts don't give up!)" &lt;ref name=ecuador&gt;{{cite news|title=La Marcha de las Putas cuenta con más apoyo de los hombres|url=http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/sociedad/item/la-marcha-de-las-putas-cuenta-con-mas-apoyo-de-los-hombres.html|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=El Telégrafo|date=April 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203130728/http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/sociedad/item/la-marcha-de-las-putas-cuenta-con-mas-apoyo-de-los-hombres.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honduras==

On August 6, 2011, Andrea Nuila co-organized the event with her group Atrévete, the [[Tegucigalpa]] chapter of [[Hollaback!]], an international women-led movement to end [[street harassment]]. For Nuila, the march is also about confronting the dangerous combination of [[Patriarchy|male dominance]] and [[impunity]] that puts Honduran women at risk, as seen in the high occurrence of [[femicide]]. "They're increasing every day. We believe that women are not only victims of sexual harassment, they're also victims of domestic violence. And we have a big level of impunity from the state institutions" she said.

Francisco Murillo López, head of the Dirección Nacional de Investigación Criminal (National Direction of Criminal Investigation), was asked to explain the [[Gender inequality in Honduras|rise in the killing of women]]. He said "the most significant factor is [[gender equality]]. Women are participating in roles that were previously carried out by men. Today we see women driving taxis, driving a truck. This shows how much Honduran society is changing, and therefore it is normal to see women dying. Gender equality is the principal reason that women are now involved in violent affairs linked to [[gangs|organized gangs]] and [[common crime]]."

However, according to the research of Ana Carcedo, the region's foremost expert on femicide, 12% of female homicides in Honduras can be linked to organized crime, while in 40% of the cases, the killer is either a current or former lover, while more than 9% of the killings result from sexual attacks, and almost 8% of the women are being killed by their family members. All in all, according to Carcedo, in roughly three-quarters of the cases, the women were killed in one way or another for being women. This is the opposite of the conclusion of the Honduran police chief that they are being killed for taking on male roles.

Sandra Maribel, director of the [[radio station]] Radio Gualcho, was present at the event. According to her analysis: "The use of language to discriminate based on the way we dress is related to the broader [[Women in Honduras|women's struggle in Honduras]]. There's lots of violence inside the home, and we want to change that. Maybe a good place to start is by changing the language used to refer to us women." She also referred to the recent ban on the [[morning-after pill]] approved by the [[Congress of Honduras]]: "The women's struggle isn't isolated from the larger struggle of the Honduran people. It's a liberation struggle, not only in the political sense, but in every sense. And the Honduran women have been active participants in the resistance against the [[Honduras coup d'etat]]. But we're not doing it just to make the crowd bigger. We want the order of things to change in this country."

Maria Victoria, a participant who works as an HIV/AIDS prevention worker, urged people to consider how the word slut is used to discriminate against the trans community as well: "Women and trans people who choose to dress sexy shouldn't be called sluts." Fernando Reyes, of [[National Popular Resistance Front|Honduras' diversity and resistance movement]] considered the march as a response to all forms of intolerance: "Today is the best example, seeing all the youth of the [[sexual diversity]] and various [[Cultural diversity|cultural collectives]] demonstrating and realizing that even as youths they have a right to be who they want to be."

As a closing activity, participants took turns writing messages on the side of the city's main [[Cathedral|Catholic cathedral]]. Nuila explained: "The church is one of the institutions that has oppressed women's rights the most, especially in a [[Catholic country]] like ours. [[Abortion by country#National laws|Abortion is illegal in Honduras]], not only for the women, because it's criminalized from three to six years in jail, but he doctor is also penalized, and their license restricted." &lt;ref name=honduras&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeston|first=Jesse|title=SlutWalk Lands in Tegucigalpa|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=6933|accessdate=December 1, 2013|newspaper=The Real News|date=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2012, hundreds of people participated in the second Marcha de las Putas at Tegucigalpa. Many women assisted with their male partners, and the protest counted on the participation of [[LGBT activism|LGBT organizations]]. "We're marching to protest against the sexual harassment us women suffer for the way we choose to dress" explained Karla Martínez, coordinator of the protest, "we're tired of our clothing being an excuse for men to feel they have the right to [[rape]] us or [[grope]] us, that's why we're here today, demanding an end to violence against women."

Mildred Tejada, from the [[United Nations System]], was present at Marcha de las Putas. "The word "puta" causes aversion, it's an insult to all women regardless of the profession they exercise" she said. Sergio Ulloa, one of the male protesters, commented on the march: "We live in a [[machista]] country, and it's about time men stop harassing and sexually abusing women. Women must have their rights respected, and men must respect and value women."&lt;ref name=pdigital&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha de las Putas en Honduras pide frenar violencia vs mujeres|url=http://periodicodigital.com.mx/notas/marcha_de_las_putas_en_honduras_pide_frenar_violencia_vs_mujeres#.UptBKtLuI7p|accessdate=December 1, 2013|newspaper=Periódico Digital|date=December 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203085055/http://periodicodigital.com.mx/notas/marcha_de_las_putas_en_honduras_pide_frenar_violencia_vs_mujeres#.UptBKtLuI7p|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==

[[File:Marcha de las putas en Costa Rica, 2011 -10.jpg|thumb|left|Sign from La Marcha de las Putas saying: "I don't want your [[catcalling]], I want your respect"]]
On June 12, 2011 Slutwalk took place in [[Mexico City]], with the name Marcha de las Putas. Women, men and children, mostly in [[casual wear]] but some in heels and [[Schoolgirl uniform|schoolgirl]] miniskirts, marched with signs saying "No means No" and "prostitutes are [[sacred]]." One self-described grandmother in a low-cut blouse advised women to dress as they pleased. "This is a problem of all society" said Edith López, spokeswoman of the protest, "we need to re-educate ourselves, because victims of [[sexual violence]] are not the ones responsible." &lt;ref name=mexico&gt;{{cite news|title=La 'Marcha de las putas' reclama respeto para las mujeres en Ciudad de  México|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/06/12/mexico/1307914626.html|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=El Mundo|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar walks were held in [[Cancún]],  [[Guadalajara]], [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] and [[Sinaloa]].

According to different [[non-government organizations]], [[violence against women]] has raised by 30%, and an average 1200 women each year receive medical assistance for [[Domestic violence|domestic]] or [[workplace violence]]. Official data from Mexico show that during the years 1999 to 2005, over six thousand girls and women were [[Femicide|murdered for being women]].&lt;ref name=cnnmex2&gt;{{cite news|last=Muñoz|first=Brisa|title=Mujeres protestan en 'Marcha de las Putas' contra la violencia de género|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/06/12/mujeres-protestan-en-marcha-de-las-putas-contra-la-violencia-de-genero|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=CNN Mexico|date=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriela Amancaya, from Atrévete [[Mexico DF|DF]], the local version of [[Hollaback!]], participated in the protest in Mexico City, and explained the goal was to "raise consciousness around the fact that we are tired of [[street harassment]], of abuse in general, and of the silence which always surrounds those subjects."

On June 27, 2011, Marcha de las Putas was organized at [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], with the participation of [[activists]], [[students]], [[housewives]], [[academics]], [[professionals]], [[mothers]] and a few female [[politicians]], whose presence was questioned by some participants who considered they were not so interested in [[gender equality]] as they were in being seen among the crowd. About a dozen women were dressed as [[prostitutes]], and at least one was in a [[nun]] [[costume]]. They explained their goal was to show that in either of those outfits, they must be equally respected. There was also a runway with different types of shoe wear, including high heels, sandals, boots and sport shoes, with colorful signs about their pretended owners: "one who kisses whoever she wants", "one who works". They were beneath a bigger sign stating: "Putas somos todas, o ninguna (Either all of us or none of us is a slut)." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernández Alcántara|first=Martín|title=Efectúan una réplica de La marcha de las putas en Puebla|url=http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2011/06/27/puebla/jus208.php|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=La Jornada de Oriente|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 2011, Marcha de las Putas was held in [[Uruapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Marcha de las Putas llega a Uruapan|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-635986|website=CNN iReport|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2012, a new Marcha de las Putas was held at Puebla. Natali Hernández participated with her [[non-profit organization]], Red por los Derechos Sexuales y Reproductivos (Network for [[Reproductive Rights|Sexual and Reproductive Rights]]), which denounced in the [[Puebla|State of Puebla]] there's an accusation of sexual violence against a woman every 12 hours, making that state the fifth in sexual violence occurrence, in a country where the average of denounces is one every 17 hours. The protest finished in front of Puebla's City Hall, where the protesters pronounciated against sexual violence. They stressed that in the previous six years, [[femicide|murders of women]] raised up to three times. Figures show 341 femicides in 2005 against 619 in 2011, marking an 81% increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Espinoza|first=Maribel|title=Celebran la Marcha de las Putas|url=http://www.ultra.com.mx/noticias/puebla/Local/58552-celebran-la-marcha-de-las-putas.html|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=Ultra Noticias|date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2012, a new Marcha de las Putas was organized in [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]] to match the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]]. Martha Figuero Mier participated in the protest with her  [[NGO]] Colectivo de Mujeres (Colem), and as an activist is representing several cases of [[women's rights]] violations in [[Chiapas]] at the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]]. Previous to the march, her organization had denounced 67 [[femicide]]s of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous women]] during 2012. She explained the number was based only in the cases covered by the media, since the Attorney General's Office of Chiapas did not respond to their requests for information about number and status of the processes of femicides.

"When a woman is [[assault]]ed or [[murder]]ed, the authorities qualify it as a [[crime of passion]], disregarding the [[Patriarchy|larger social structure]] which minimizes and violates the rights of women. We demand [[public policies]] to eliminate all forms of violence against women" added the participants of the protest. Alejandra Peralta, head of the Secretaría para el Desarrollo y Empoderamiento de las Mujeres (Secretary for the Development and Empowerment of Women) at the State Government, also participated in La Marcha de las Putas. She admitted there are high records of violence against women, but the numbers and statistics on femicides and accusations for assault must be administered by the Attorney General's Office.&lt;ref name=cnnmex&gt;{{cite news|last=Mariscal|first=Angeles|title=Mujeres marchan en Chiapas contra el aumento de los feminicidios|url=http://blogs.cnnmexico.com/ultimas-noticias/2012/11/26/mujeres-marchan-en-chiapas-contra-el-aumento-de-los-feminicidios/|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=CNN Mexico|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicaragua==

On June 11, 2011, the first Slutwalk was held in [[Matagalpa]] under the name "Marcha de las Putas", with the objective of bringing an end to the naturalization of [[violence against women]] and [[Victim blaming|blaming of victims]] based on their appearance. According to the Network of Women Against Violence, 89 women in Nicaragua were murdered by their partner or another individual known to them on 2012. Edume Larracochea, Spanish leader of Red de Mujeres de Matagalpa (Matagalpa Women Network) and organizer of the event, said dozens of women assisted, wearing jeans or skirts, high heels or flats, as they chose. "The march was a great success, we feel people were interested and we want everyone to reflect on [[sexual violence]]" she added.

At the end of the protest, Red de Mujeres de Matagalpa read a document denouncing society for "using the word "puta" to [[stigmatize]] and [[discredit]] those women who are courageous enough to decide over our bodies and our lives." It also states the protersters "are tired of hearing us women provoke, and therefore are guilty" of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mujeres exigen respeto en 'Marcha de las putas' en Nicaragua|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/internacional/2011/299163/6/mujeres-exigen-respeto-en-marcha-de-las-putas-en-nicaragua.htm|accessdate=December 2, 2013|newspaper=Informador|date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nicaragua&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's groups will hold a SlutWalk protest in Nicaragua|url=http://latinamericacurrentevents.com/women%E2%80%99s-groups-hold-slutwalk-protest-nicaragua/8160/|accessdate=December 2, 2013|newspaper=Latin America Current Events &amp; News|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2011 the first Slutwalk was held in [[Panama City|Panamá City]] with the name "La Marcha de las Putas".

Colombian journalist Carolina Ángel Idrobo was also present at the protest to cover the story for Panamanian newspaper [[La Prensa (Panama City)|La Prensa]]. On the day following the march, she was given a verbal warning from her [[editor]] for being seen dancing and singing among the protesters, arguing [[activism]] was incompatible with [[journalism]] at La Prensa. Idrobo apologized to the editor, but on November 2 she was called by the director, who informed her she was fired. The FELCOPER (''Federación Colombiana de Periodistas'' - Colombian Federation of Journalists) pronounced in favor of Idrobo, expressing their worry around [[censorship]] and [[discrimination]] inside [[independent media]], as well as unfair layoffs based on [[ideology]]. "[[Freedom of speech]] cannot be a right to be claimed only from the media to society, it must also be guaranteed by the media to its workers" explained Adriana Hurtado, president of FELCOPER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Despedida periodista colombiana en Panamá tras participar en "Marcha de las Putas"|url=http://www.cartagonoticias.com/noticias.php/2011112501/inicio/nacional/despedida-periodista-colombiana-en-panama-tras-participar-en-marcha-de-las-putas/|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=Cartago Noticias|date=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perú==

On November 12, 2011, a Slutwalk was held in [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] with the name "La Marcha de las Putas". Over 100 women in short skirts and [[lingerie]] joined the protest and handed panflets to bystanders. "People are surprised to see women dressed like this, it always catches the eye" explained Fiorella Farje, one of the organizers and member of P.U.T.A.S., ''Por Una Transformación Auténtica y Social'' (For An Authentic Social Transformation). "We were a bit scared for the name of the protest, that we might have problems or the message could be distorted, but the reaction was very positive" she added.&lt;ref name=peru&gt;{{cite news|title=La marcha de las putas recorrió las calles de Lima|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2011-11-12-la-marcha-de-las-putas-recorrio-las-calles-de-lima-foto_421761_5.html|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=RPP Noticias|date=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2012, a new Marcha de las Putas took place in Lima, gathering around 150 people. Ana Lucía Álvarez, spokeswoman of the organization, explained to the local media it was not a march of [[prostitutes]], but rather one of young people against [[violence towards women]] and [[street harassment]]. "We also recognize prostitutes have dignity, deserve respect from all society and we reject the mistreatment they suffer from the police."&lt;ref name=terra&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha contra violencia machista en Perú se solidariza con prostitutas|url=http://noticias.terra.com.pe/nacional/marcha-contra-violencia-machista-en-peru-se-solidariza-con-prostitutas,4949b32de7aea310VgnCLD2000000ec6eb0aRCRD.html|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=Terra|date=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2012, the first Slutwalk was held with the name "La Marcha de las Putas", inviting men, women, [[transgender people]] and children alike. "Each one of us participates with as much or as little clothing as they wish" explained the organizers, "Our demand is that society stops [[Tolerate|tolerating]] and minimizing [[sexual abuse]]s, and instead of [[blaming the victim]], have the perpetrator severely judged."

The protest was also directed to a comment made by [[José Mujica|President José Mujica]] to those who were asking for the resignation of Fernando Calloia, head of the [[Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay|Banco de la República]]. Mujica answered publicly in [[Brasilia]] saying "they had better control their wives." During their speech at the protest, the organizers answered: "We don't want to be controlled, men believe they are owners of any woman. [[Patriarchy]] tells them they are [[Incontinence (philosophy)|incontinent]] and therefore can't stop themselves nor respect us. But we look for partners, not owners."

[[Sociologist]] Teresa Herrera also addressed the remark: "Mr. President, the ideology of men exercising power over women is the eldest in the world, even previous to the [[Social classes|richness-poverty]] relation, and its [[Sexism|ideological justification]] is, unfortunately, supported in all cultures. Because of this, we have deep-rooted behaviors we must "unlearn" and new ways of relating and knowing each other we must apprehend. Us women don't need to be controlled, in fact, control is the first step of violence against us."&lt;ref name=Alerta&gt;{{cite news|title=Alerta que camina la marcha de las putas por América Latina|url=http://www.republica.com.uy/alerta-que-camina-la-marcha-de-las-putas-por-america-latina/|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=República|date=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solidarity''' is unity  (as of a group or class) that produces or is based on unities of interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies.&lt;ref name="dict1"&gt;''Merriam Webster'', http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solidarity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/solidarity|title=solidarity|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[social relations|ties in a society]] that bind people together as one. The term is generally employed in [[sociology]] and the other [[social sciences]] as well as in [[philosophy]] or in [[Catholic social teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2013.013|title=Social Security in Poland – cultural, historical and economical issues|first1=Stanisław|last1=Adamiak|first2=Ewa|last2=Chojnacka|first3=Damian|last3=Walczak|date=1 December 2013|publisher=|journal=Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting|volume=2|issue=2|pages=11–26|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=wydawnictwoumk.pl|doi=10.12775/cjfa.2013.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, solidarity is a core concept in [[Christian democracy]] political ideology.&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickKwon2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Tony |last2=Kwon |first2=Huck-ju |last3= Manning |first3=Nick |author4=James Midgley, Gillian Pascall |title= International Encyclopedia of Social Policy |date= 4 July 2013 |publisher= Routledge |language=English |isbn= 978-1-136-61003-5|page=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What forms the basis of solidarity varies between societies. In simple societies it may be mainly based on [[kinship]] and shared values. In more complex societies there are various theories as to what contributes to a sense of social solidarity.&lt;ref name="dict1" /&gt;

Solidarity is also one of six principles of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union#The text|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], Title IV&lt;/ref&gt; and December 20 of each year is International Human Solidarity Day recognized as an [[international observance]].

== Émile Durkheim ==
According to [[Émile Durkheim]], the types of social solidarity correlate with types of society. Durkheim introduced the terms [[mechanical and organic solidarity|''mechanical'' and ''organic solidarity'']] as part of his theory of the development of societies in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In a society exhibiting mechanical solidarity, its cohesion and integration comes from the homogeneity of individuals—people feel connected through similar work, educational and religious training, and lifestyle. Mechanical solidarity normally operates in "traditional" and small scale societies.&lt;ref name="dict2"&gt;''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', p405-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In simpler societies (e.g., [[tribe|tribal]]), solidarity is usually based on [[kinship]] ties of familial networks. Organic solidarity comes from the interdependence that arises from specialization of work and the complementarities between people—a development which occurs in "modern" and "industrial" societies.&lt;ref name="dict2" /&gt;
* Definition: it is [[social cohesion]] based upon the dependence individuals have on each other in more advanced societies.

Although individuals perform different tasks and often have different values and interest, the order and very solidarity of society depends on their reliance on each other to perform their specified tasks. Organic here is referring to the interdependence of the component parts.  Thus social solidarity is maintained in more complex societies through the interdependence of its component parts (e.g., farmers produce the food to feed the factory workers who produce the tractors that allow the farmer to produce the food).

== Peter Kropotkin ==
A connection between the biological and the social was of principal importance for the idea of solidarity as expressed by the anarchist ideologist and former Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921). In his most famous book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), written partly in response to Huxleyan Social Darwinism, Kropotkin studied the use of cooperation as a survival mechanism in human societies at their various stages, as well as with animals. According to him, [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]], or cooperation, within a species has been an important factor in the evolution of social institutions. Solidarity is essential for mutual aid; supportive activity towards other people does not result from the expectation of reward, but rather from instinctive feelings of solidarity.

In his introduction to the book, Kropotkin wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were developed by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses, during the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the next village-community period, and the immense influence which these early institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of mankind, down to the present times, induced me to extend my researches to the later, historical periods as well; especially, to study that most interesting period&amp;nbsp;– the free medieval city republics, whose universality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet been duly appreciated. And finally, I have tried to indicate in brief the immense importance which the mutual-support instincts, inherited by mankind from its extremely long evolution, play even now in our modern society, which is supposed to rest upon the principle "every one for himself, and the State for all," but which it never has succeeded, nor will succeed in realizing".&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, P. Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution.&amp;nbsp;– L.: Freedom press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Kropotkin advocated an alternative economic and social system, which would be coordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations with goods distributed in compliance with the physical needs of the individual, rather than according to labour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in philosophy ==
Solidarity is an emerging concept in contemporary philosophy&amp;nbsp;– it is subject to ongoing studies in various subfields of [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor=Bayertz, Kurt |year=1999 |title=Solidarity |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |publication-place=Dordrecht |isbn=978-0-7923-5475-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable approach in [[bioethics]] is to identify solidarity primarily as a three-tiered practice enacted at the interpersonal, communal, and contractual and legal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Prainsack, Barbara |author2=Buyx, Alena |year=2012 |title=Solidarity in Contemporary Bioethics&amp;nbsp;– Towards a New Approach |journal=Bioethics |issue=26/7 |pages=343–350 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2012.01987.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is driven by the quest to differentiate between the diverse applications of the concept and to clarify its meaning, both historically and in terms of its potential as a fruitful concept for contemporary moral, social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Prainsack, Barbara |author2=Buyx, Alena |year=2011 |title=Solidarity: reflections on an emerging concept in bioethics |publisher=Nuffield Council on Bioethics |publication-place=London |url=http://nuffieldbioethics.org/project/solidarity/ |accessdate= 2013-11-04 |isbn= 978-1-904384-25-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catholic social teaching ==
Solidarity is an integral element of [[Catholic social teaching]]. According to [[Pope Francis]]:
{{blockquote|No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world ... the Brazilian people, particularly the humblest among you, can offer the world a valuable lesson in solidarity, a word that is too often forgotten or silenced because it is uncomfortable ... I would like to make an appeal to those in possession of greater resources, to public authorities and to all people of good will who are working for social justice: never tire of working for a more just world, marked by greater solidarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/themes/solidarity/|title=Solidarity|author=|date=|website=catholicsocialteaching.org.uk|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Church's teaching on solidarity is explained in the [[Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church]], and briefly summarised in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]:
{{blockquote|

* 1939. The principle of solidarity, also articulated in terms of "friendship" or "social charity," is a direct demand of human and Christian brotherhood 

* 1940. Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of goods and remuneration for work ...

* 1941. Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the help of all the forms of solidarity: solidarity of the poor among themselves, between rich and poor, of workers among themselves, between employers and employees in a business, solidarity among nations and peoples. International solidarity is a requirement of the moral order; world peace depends in part upon this

* 1942. The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods. In spreading the spiritual goods of the faith, the Church has promoted, and often opened new paths for, the development of temporal goods as well. And so throughout the centuries has the Lord's saying been verified: "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well."

Given the posited emergent nature of quantum laws in SED, it has been argued that they form a kind of "quantum equilibrium" that has an analogous status to that of thermal equilibrium in classical dynamics. In principle therefore, SED allows other "[[quantum non-equilibrium]]" distributions, for which the statistical predictions of quantum theory are violated. It is controversially argued that quantum theory is merely a special case of a much wider nonlinear physics, a physics in which non-local ([[Faster-than-light|superluminal]]) signalling is possible, and in which the uncertainty principle can be violated.&lt;ref name="Valentini2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valentini|first1=Antony|title=Beyond the quantum|journal=Physics World|volume=22|issue=11|year=2009|pages=32–37|issn=0953-8585|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/22/11/36|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2758v1.pdf|arxiv=1001.2758|bibcode=2009PhyW...22k..32V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musser|first1=George|title=Cosmological Data Hint at a Level of Physics Underlying Quantum Mechanics|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/cosmological-data-hint-at-a-level-of-physics-underlying-quantum-mechanics-guest-post/|website=blogs.scientificamerican.com|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that [[inertia]] is one such emergent law.&lt;ref name="HaischRueda1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haisch|first1=Bernhard|last2=Rueda|first2=Alfonso|last3=Puthoff|first3=H.

==Classical background field==

The background field is introduced as a [[Lorentz force]] in the (classical) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation (see: [[Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force]]), where the classical statistics of the electric and magnetic fields and quadratic combinations thereof are chosen to match the vacuum expectation values of the equivalent operators in QED. The field is generally represented as a discrete sum of [[Fourier series|Fourier components]] each with amplitude and phase that are independent classical random variables, distributed so that the statistics of the fields are isotropic and unchanged under boosts. This prescription is such that each Fourier mode at frequency (f) is expected to have an energy of hf/2, equaling that of the ground state of the vacuum modes of QED. Unless [[cutoff frequency|cut off]], the total field has an infinite energy density, with a spectral energy density (per unit frequency per unit volume) [2h/c&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]f&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; where h is [[Planck's constant]]. Consequently, the background field is a classical version of the electromagnetic ZPF of QED, though in SED literature the field is commonly referred to simply as 'the ZPF' without making that distinction. It should be noted that any finite cutoff frequency of the field itself would be incompatible with Lorentz invariance.  For this reason, some researchers prefer to think of cutoff frequency in terms of the response of particles to the field rather than as a property the field itself.

==Brief history==
{{Quantum mechanics|Interpretations}}
Stochastic electrodynamics is a term for a collection of research efforts of many different styles based on the [[ansatz]] that there exists a [[Lorentz invariant]] random [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The basic ideas have been around for a long time; but Marshall (1963) and Brafford seem to have been the originators of the more concentrated efforts starting in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marshall, T.

A separate thread has been the investigation of an earlier proposal by [[Walther Nernst]] attempting to use the SED notion of a classical ZPF to explain ''inertial mass'' as due to a vacuum reaction.

In 2000, Trevor Marshall derived an experimental prediction of SED dubbed "spontaneous parametric up-conversion" (SPUC) as a dual process to the well-known [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]] (SPDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Marshall |first=Trevor W. |author-link= |eprint=quant-ph/0203042 |title=Nonlocality - The party may be over |date=9 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPUC was tested in 2009 and 2010 with positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Jinyu |last2=Zhang |first2=Shian |last3=Jia |first3=Tianqing |last4=Wang |first4=Zugeng |last5=Sun |first5=Zhenrong |title=Femtosecond spontaneous parametric upconversion and downconversion in a quadratic nonlinear medium |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B |date=2009 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=549–553 |doi=10.1364/JOSAB.26.000549 |bibcode = 2009JOSAB..26..549S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.

In 2010, Cavalleri ''et al.'' introduced SEDS ('pure' SED, as they call it, plus spin) as a fundamental improvement which they claim potentially overcomes all the known drawbacks to SED. They also claim SEDS resolves four observed effects that are so far unexplained by QED, i.e., 1) the physical origin of the ZPF, and its natural upper cutoff; 2) an anomaly in experimental studies of the [[Neutrino#Mass|neutrino rest mass]]; 3) the origin and quantitative treatment of 1/f noise; and 4) the high-energy tail (~ 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; eV) of [[cosmic rays]]. Two [[double-slit]] electron diffraction experiments are proposed to  discriminate between QM and SEDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Giancarlo Cavalleri |author2=Francesco Barbero |author3=Gianfranco Bertazzi |author4=Eros Cesaroni |author5=Ernesto Tonni |author6=Leonardo Bosi |author7=Gianfranco Spavieri |author8=George Gillies |last-author-amp=yes |year=2010 |title=A quantitative assessment of stochastic electrodynamics with spin (SEDS): Physical principles and novel applications. |journal=Frontiers of Physics in China |volume=5|number=1|pages=107–122 |doi=10.1007/s11467-009-0080-0|bibcode = 2010FrPhC...5..107C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inconclusive but encouraging experiments were carried out in 2012 by Dmitriyeva and Moddel in which emissions in "... infrared was clearly observed" which they could not explain using "...conventional thermodynamic models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Olga Dmitriyeva and Garret Moddel |year=2012 |title=Test of zero-point energy emission from gases flowing through Casimir cavities  |journal=Physics Procedia |volume=38 |pages=8–17 |doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2012.08.007 |bibcode = 2012PhPro..38....8D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Auñon et al. showed that Casimir and Van der Waals interactions are a particular case of stochastic forces from electromagnetic sources when the broad Planck's spectrum is chosen and the wavefields are non-correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Juan Miguel Auñon, Cheng Wei Qiu and Manuel Nieto-Vesperinas |year=2013 |title=Tailoring photonic forces on a magnetodielectric nanoparticle with a fluctuating optical source |journal=Physical Review A |volume=88 |page=043817 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.88.043817|bibcode = 2013PhRvA..88d3817A |url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/95567/1/Tailoring%20photonic%20forces.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing fluctuating partially coherent light emitters with a tailored spectral energy distribution in the optical range, this establishes the link between stochastic electrodynamics and [[coherence theory (optics)|coherence theory]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Leonard Mandel and Emil Wolf |title=Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1995|isbn=9780521417112}}&lt;/ref&gt; henceforth putting forward a way to optically create and control both such zero-point fields as well as Lifshitz forces &lt;ref&gt;E. M. Lifshitz, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 100, 879 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; of thermal fluctuations. In addition, this opens the path to build many more stochastic forces on employing narrow-band light sources for bodies with frequency-dependent responses.

In a 2014 dissertation Carlos Alberto de Oliveira Henriques measured the energy shift in the atomic levels of Xe atoms as they passed through nano-porous Casimir membranes. Some evidence of anomalous radiation were observed, however, he was not able to distinguish this radiation conclusively from the background due to said shortcomings in the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/jspui/bitstream/10316/28082/1/ZPF_extraction_last.pdf |year=2014 |title=Study of atomic energy shifts induced by Casimir cavities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of SED==
SED has been used in attempts to provide a ''classical'' explanation for effects previously considered to require quantum mechanics (here restricted to the [[Schrödinger equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] and QED) for their explanation. It has also been used to motivate a classical ZPF-based underpinning for gravity and inertia. There is no universal agreement on the successes and failures of SED, either in its congruence with standard theories of quantum mechanics, QED, and gravity, or in its compliance with observation. The following SED-based explanations are relatively uncontroversial and are free of criticism at the time of writing:
*The [[Casimir effect]]&lt;ref&gt;QED-based calculations commonly implicitly adopt the SED ansatz to compute Casimir forces. See for example {{cite book|authors=C. Itzykson and J-B. Zuber |title=Quantum Field Theory |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-486-44568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero point energy==
According to Haisch and Rueda, inertia arises as an ''electromagnetic drag force'' on accelerating particles, produced by interaction with the zero-point field.  In their 1998 Ann. Phys. paper (see citations), they speak of a "Rindler flux", presumably meaning the Unruh effect, and claim to have computed a nonzero ''"z.p.f. momentum"''.  This computation rests upon their claim to compute a nonzero ''"z.p.f. Poynting vector"''.

These proposals for [[zero-point energy]] suggest a source of low or no cost [[perpetual motion|free energy]] from the vacuum as well as the hope of developing a [[reactionless drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=G.

==Fictional references==
Arthur C. Clarke describes a "SHARP drive" (for [[Andrei Sakharov|Sakharov]], Haisch, Rueda and [[Harold E. Puthoff|Puthoff]]) in his 1997 novel "[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]".

[[File:Copper plates NMND-9.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Copper plate inscriptions in ''Kannada-Telugu script'']]
Between 1100 CE and 1400 CE [[Kannada script]] and [[Telugu script]] separated from Old-Kannada script ([[Halegannada]] script) or [[Kadamba script]] or [[Bhattiprolu script]]. The [[Chalukyas]] influenced the modern form of Telugu script and its similarity with modern Kannada script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/telugu/language/script/script1d.html | title=Evolution of Telugu Character Graphs | accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Kannada]] script is the continuation of the [[Kadamba script]], which was used for writing [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages. Telugu and Kannada Scripts are strikingly similar. 

The Dravidian family comprising about ''73 languages'' including Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. Kannada [[abugida]] was developed between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE from '''Chalukya and Kadamba scripts''', descendants of Brahmi. Old Kannada script is about 1800 years old, developed into Modern Telugu and Modern Kannada scripts. The Telugu script is closely related to Kannada, earliest known inscriptions dates back to the 6th century CE, poetry begins to appear in the 11th century. New written standard emerged in Telugu during the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/unger26/Wrtg%20sys%20exhibit.pdf | title=A sampler of the world’s writing systems | publisher=J.

==History==
During 4th to 7th centuries AD the Early [[Chalukyas|Bādāmi Chālukyās]] and Early [[Kadambas|Banavasi Kadambās]] used early form of ''Kannada script'' in inscriptions. The early [[Eastern Chalukyas]] and  [[Salankayana]] who ruled the [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_epigraphical_sans_indiaabroad.asp | title=Epigraphical Studies in India - Sanskrit and Dravidian, Scripts used in India, Scripts Abroad | accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Kannada-Telugu Script==
Kannada and Telugu belongs to Dravidian family of languages in southern India, Saatavaahanas introduced the Brahmi to present day Telugu and Kannada speaking regions. Kannada and Telugu scripts are categorized under Old Kannada script. Kannada became a literate language much ahead of Telugu language. Both Kannada and Telugu produced the poetry during the eighth century. The full-fledged literary works in Kannada produced in ninth century, two centuries before the works available in Telugu&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kavirajamarga-a-tour-with-a-difference/article20919519.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavirajamarga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Hans/2014-11-12/Aadi-Kavi-Nannayas-brilliant-translation-of-the-Mahabharata/115876&lt;/ref&gt;. The combined Kannada-Telugu script called as ''Old Kannada''. Telugu writers waited till 11th century because of socio-political factors (royal patronage, influence of Buddhism and Jainism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/telugu/language/script/script1a.html | title=Origins of Telugu Script | accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, the number of [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] children in the world was about the same as the number of [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] children.&lt;ref&gt;Paradis, J., Genesee, F., &amp; Crago, M. (2011). ''Dual Language Development and Disorders: A handbook on bilingualism &amp; second language learning''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; TCKs are often exposed to a second (or third, fourth, etc.) language while living in their host culture, being physically exposed to the environment where the native language is used in practical aspects of life. "TCKs learn some languages in schools abroad and some in their homes or in the marketplaces of a foreign land. ... Some pick up languages from the nannies in the home or from playmates in the neighborhood" (Bell-Villada et al. 23). This [[language immersion]] is why TCKs are often bilingual, and sometimes even multilingual.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:National Multicultural Festival (6856303265).jpg|thumb|A banner from the National Multicultural Festival in Canberra, Australia]]
The term "third culture kid" was first coined by researchers John and [[Ruth Hill Useem|Ruth Useem]] in the 1950s, who used it to describe the children of American citizens working and living abroad.&lt;ref name="melles" /&gt; Ruth Useem first used the term after her second year-long visit to [[India]] with her fellow [[sociologist]]/[[anthropologist]] husband and three children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/footnotes/dec03/departments.html Ruth Useem's obituary in Footnotes, the Newsletter of the American Sociological Association], December 2003. Retrieved 2010-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Useem et al. (1963) depicted individuals who have undergone such an experience as having distinct standards of interpersonal behavior, work-related [[Norm (social)|norms]], codes of lifestyle and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], and communication. This creates a new cultural group that does not fall into their home or host culture, but rather share a culture with all other TCKs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Useem | first1 = J. | last2 = Useem | first2 = R. | year = 1967 | title = The interfaces of a binational third culture: A study of the American community in India | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 130–143 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1967.tb00567.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she wrote:
{{Quote|text=In summarizing that which we had observed in our cross-cultural encounters, we began to use the term "third culture" as a generic term to cover the styles of life created, shared, and learned by persons who are in the process of relating their societies, or sections thereof, to each other. The term "Third Culture Kids" or TCKs was coined to refer to the children who accompany their parents into another society.|sign=Ruth Hill Useem|source=[http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art1.html TCK World: The Official Home of Third Culture Kids]}}

Kay Branaman Eakin, the former Education Counselor for the [[United States Department of State]], worked with American families returning to the United States after having lived abroad. She described a TCK as "someone who, as a child, has spent a significant period of time in one or more culture(s) other than [his/her] own, thus integrating elements of those cultures and their own birth culture, into a third culture."&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, K.B. (1998). According to my passport, I'm coming home. ''U.S. Department of State'', 18. Retrieved from http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/2065.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, K.B. Our consultants: Kay Branaman Eakin. ''Bennett Schoolplacment Worldwide.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, author and researcher Norma McCaig used the term "[[global nomad]]", which is synonymous with TCK, but was used in order to take into account that the child's situation was as a result of a parent or parents' [[career]] or life choice(s).&lt;ref&gt;McCaig, N. (1994, September). Growing up with a world view. ''Foreign Service Journal'', 32–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Third culture kids can also be referred to as cultural hybrids, cultural chameleons, and global nomads.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; TCKs are particularly adept at building relationships with other cultures while not possessing a [[cultural identity]] of their own.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; It has been discussed in the past that the characteristics that have been put forth by prominent researchers in the TCK field have only been discussed when referring to American children who have lived abroad. However, there has been further research done on TCKs that shows that the same characteristics described by Pollock and Useem in the most prominent TCK literature also apply to individuals from other nations who have also lived abroad for extended periods of time during their developmental years.&lt;ref name ="pollock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="useem"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "bonebright"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonebright | first1 = D.A. | year = 2010 | title = Adult third culture kids: HRD challenges and opportunities | url = | journal = Human Resources Development International | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 351–359 | doi=10.1080/13678861003746822}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are benefits and challenges to being a TCK according to various researchers on the subject.  The term TCKs may be applied to all social classes and although there are certain distinctions between TCKs and immigrants, it can include immigrant and refugee students (Dewaele 8c van Oudenhoven, 2009).&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Limberg | first1 = D. | last2 = Lambie | first2 = G. W. | year = 2011 | title = Third Culture Kids: Implications for Professional School Counseling | url = | journal = Professional School Counseling | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 45–54 | doi=10.5330/psc.n.2011-15.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
*Expanded [[World view|worldview]]: TCKs have an understanding that there is more than one way to look at situations that they are exposed to or experience. This can also be a challenge however, when TCKs return to a culture that is [[homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogenous]] in their belief system, as an expanded worldview is perceived as offensive or useless.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lyttle" /&gt;
*Third-dimensional view of the world: With an increased number of hands-on [[experience]]s in multiple cultures, there is a difference in the way that the world is perceived. For example, there has been an increase in [[cross-cultural]] authors, such as [[Khaled Hosseini]], author of ''[[The Kite Runner]]'', who have received awards for their works that are written from a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] perspective. These authors are able to provide vivid descriptions about the cultures they have directly experienced and thus their work appears to be "three-dimensional."&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Interpersonal sensitivity: Increased exposure to a variety of perceptions and lifestyles allow TCKs to monitor their emotions, and register societal norms and cues more adeptly so as to produce higher [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to other cultures and ways of life.&lt;ref name="lyttle" /&gt;
*Cross-cultural competence or [[cultural intelligence]]: the capacity to function effectively across national, ethnic, and organizational cultures. 
*TCK have been found to have higher levels of general adjustment as opposed to mono cultural children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selmer | first1 = J. | last2 = Lauring | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Self-initiated expatriates: An exploratory study of adjustment of adult third-culture kids vs. Adult mono-culture kids | url = | journal = Cross Cultural Management | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 422–436 | doi = 10.1108/CCM-01-2013-0005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural adaptability is also a benefit, although may also come as a challenge which results from lack of cultural balance.&lt;ref name="Tokuhama-Espinosa"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2i0h2Oxh7EoC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=third+culture+kids#v=onepage&amp;q=third%20culture%20kids&amp;f=false|title=The Multilingual Mind: Issues Discussed By, For, and about People Living with Many Languages|last=Tokuhama-Espinosa|first=Tracey|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780897899185|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The major benefit, however, is related to language exposure. As pointed out by Tokuhama-Espinosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Multilingual Mind: Issues Discussed By, For and about People Living with Many Languages|last=Tokuhama-Espinisa|first=Tracy|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2003|isbn=978-0897899192|location=Santa Barbara|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; language opens the doors to new realms including that of new cultures. TCKs, through prolonged exposure to native language use, can thus also learn to see themselves through the eyes of others.

===Challenges===
*Confused [[Loyalty|loyalties]]: Third culture kids can experience a lot confusion with politics and values. This is especially the case when moving from [[collectivism|collectivist]] to [[individualism|individualist]] cultures, or vice versa, as the values within each culture are different from the other.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt; This issue is also related with the [[identity crisis]], on a cultural level, not being able to feel a sense of oneness with any one nationality or culture. Oftentimes, TCKs cannot answer the question: "Where is home?"&lt;ref name="Tokuhama-Espinosa"/&gt;  
*Painful awareness of reality: difficulty adjusting to cultures where the only culture that is discussed or focused on is itself.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Ignorance of home culture: TCKs are often lacking in knowledge about their home nation, culture, town, and/or family. With current technology leading to the globalization of information, this is becoming increasingly less of a challenge provided the TCKs use modern technology in their host cultures to connect to their home culture. Understanding a culture’s sense of humor, however, is a commonly cited difficulty with the transition back to a home culture. There are also general societal norms and practices that will not be known when a TCK is first re-introduced to his/her home culture but those are eventually learned.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Difficulties with adjusting to adult life: the mixture of influences from the various cultures that the individual has lived can create challenges in developing an identity as well as with a sense of belonging. Feelings of rootlessness and restlessness can make the transition to [[emerging adulthood and early adulthood|adulthood]] a challenging period for TCKs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hervey | first1 = E | year = 2009 | title = Cultural transitions during childhood and adjustments to college | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 3–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"American ATCKs reported significantly higher levels of prejudice than non-American ATCKs on the Cognitive subscale of the QDI and the Social Dominance Orientation scale (SDO)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Melles | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Does the third culture kid experience predict levels of prejudice? | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 260–267 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is a need for special attention of young TCK in educational settings to make sure they are supported when and if entering a new school. This would allow for an optimal learning experience for the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = P. L. | year = 2013 | title = It's not all about academic achievement: supporting the social and emotional needs of migrant worker children | url = | journal = Pastoral Care in Education | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 173–190 | doi = 10.1080/02643944.2012.747555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Walters and Auton-Cuff (2009) found that female TCKs hesitate to develop relationships and have less emotional affect as compared to non-TCKs. Furthermore, female TCKs' identity development was delayed because of their focus on adjusting rather than creating a sense of belonging (Walters &amp; Auton-Cuff, 2009)."&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"/&gt;

==Psychological effect==

===Identity===
One of the challenges of being a third culture kid during childhood is developing a sense of [[Belongingness|belonging]], commitment, and [[attachment theory|attachment]] to a culture. These factors play a strong role in one's [[self-esteem]] and [[Identity (psychology)|identity]], and are especially apparent as present or not present among TCKs.&lt;ref name="hoersting"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoersting | first1 = R.C. | year = 2010 | title = No place to call home: Cultural homelessness, self-esteem, and cross-cultural identities | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc10991/| journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 17–30 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are psychological benefits to being a bi-culturally competent individual, meaning that adjustment to the host culture and [[repatriation]] do not pose a difficulty for the individual. Individuals who do not experience this same smooth transition into the new culture are referred to as "culturally rootless" and "cultural homelessness". Culturally homeless (CH) individuals often experience confusion over their identity and especially because the TCK is frequently abroad during the adolescent development years when identity is most solidified psychologically.&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;

When individuals who have spent a significant number of their developmental years in a host culture and have not been able to adapt, develop an identity, and do not feel as though they belong, they are considered "culturally homeless". Cultural homelessness has been found to have both advantages and disadvantages, at times to being associated with low self-esteem, perceiving less control over one's own life, and an unsatisfactory level of experience with belonging and attachment.&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism===
TCKs have the unique experience of being exposed to and living in cultures different from their home culture for extended periods of time. Based on only one source, this has been found to affect their level of [[authoritarian personality|authoritarianism]], both positively and negatively depending on the circumstance of the TCK. Within the context of the methodology and subjects selected in the study, authoritarianism measurements were used by the researchers on individuals, and high scores on the [[right-wing authoritarianism|right-wing authoritarian]] scale (RWA) have been found to possess the following three personality characteristics: a tendency to submit themselves to [[authority]] figures, a willingness to commit an act of aggression for the sake of this authority or authorities, and possessing significant concern with acting according to the rules and norms of their group.&lt;ref name="peterson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = B.E. | last2 = Plamondon | first2 = L.T. | year = 2009 | title = Third culture kids and the consequence of international sojourns on authoritarianism, acculturative balance, and positive affect | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2009.04.014 | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 755–763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Though research initially largely focused on children in missionary families or children of [[diplomat]]s, it has since expanded to other populations, including non-U.S. citizens. The researchers who pioneered the TCK research, such as Ruth Useem, were not expecting to find as many participants as they did. Useem and Cottrell, for example, were seeking at least 100 participants to respond to a survey that they believed to be "unconsciously long" but instead had 680 participants (ranging in age from 25–84 years) respond to the [[questionnaire]]. Instances like this one indicate to researchers the potential in exploring a subject matter that is still open to much research.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt;

===Increased tolerance===
From the research that has been conducted on TCKs, it has been found that subjects are generally more [[tolerant]] of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments.&lt;ref name="sheard"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheard | first1 = W | year = 2008 | title = Lessons from our kissing cousins: Third culture kids and gifted children | url = | journal = Roeper Review: A Journal on Gifted Education | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 31–38 | doi=10.1080/02783190701836437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either [[fluency|fluent]] in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.&lt;ref name="sheard" /&gt;
 
In a study by Dewaele and van Oudenhoven (2009), it was found that TCKs scored higher on the open-mindedness scale on the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). According to the study, "this dimension [of the test] evaluates for open and unprejudiced attitudes toward out-group members, as well as diverse cultural norms and values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewaele | first1 = J.M. | last2 = van Oudenhoven | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = The effect of multilingualism/multiculturalism on personality: no gain without pain for third culture kids? | url = | journal = International Journal of Multilingualism | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 443–459 | doi=10.1080/14790710903039906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual effect===
Though the intellectual effect of being a TCK has not yet been widely explored, there has been some research in the area. One particular study by Lee and Bain (2007) that was found to have significant findings was conducted on young native [[Koreans]] who had recently moved to the United States and were attending school in America. The researchers were looking to see how these students would respond to explicit instruction aimed to work with their [[originality]] and [[fluency]] and that is specific to TCKs. This was measured through the level of [[creativity]] demonstrated in assigned tasks given to the students. TCKs were found to be able to demonstrate significantly higher levels of creativity and originality for [[problem solving]] than TCKs not given this same explicit instruction. This study has implications for the ways that TCKs can be instructed differently from the traditional [[curriculum]] to enhance their creativity and problem solving abilities because of their third culture experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Y.J. | last2 = Bain | first2 = S.K. | last3 = McCallum | first3 = R.S. | year = 2007 | title = Improving creative problem-solving in a sample of third culture kids | url = | journal = School Psychology International | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 449–463 | doi = 10.1177/0143034307084135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual effect is also possible through differences in choosing to continue studies in [[higher education]] after high school. In 2001, it was found by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] that 61.7 percent of 2001 high school graduates were enrolled in college. That same year, it was found that 95 percent of the TCK population were either enrolled or had some college education. Twenty-nine percent of this population had received an advanced degree, which is also higher than the percentage of the general population.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt;

===Gender differences===
Much of the literature and research surrounding TCKs has found that these individuals are more open to learning new languages, demonstrate more flexibility when interacting with a novel culture than their monoculture peers, and a greater interest in continuing a global nomad lifestyle, which includes an interest in international careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerner | first1 = M | year = 1993 | title = A profile of an American international school | url = | journal = Global Nomad Quarterly | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that women are more inclined to seek out [[interpersonal relationships]] while men are more task-oriented in their relationships and choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cann | first1 = A. | last2 = Siegfried | first2 = W. D. | year = 1990 | title = Gender stereotypes and dimensions of effective leader behavior | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 23 | issue = 7–8| pages = 413–419 | doi=10.1007/bf00289229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such findings were used in the hypothesis of a study conducted by Gerner &amp; Perry (2000) that predicted that [[gender role|gender differences]] would also be found in the cultural acceptance and experiences of TCKs.&lt;ref name="gerner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerner | first1 = M.E. | last2 = Perry | first2 = F. | year = 2000 | title = Gender differences in cultural acceptance and career orientation among internationally mobile and non-internationally mobile adolescents | url = | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 29 | issue = | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both non-U.S. citizen females and U.S. citizen females were found to have more positive ratings of cultural acceptance, acquisition or exposure to a new language, travel, and interest in going into an international career in the future and were less prone to stereotypes.&lt;ref name="sheard" /&gt;

==Education and counseling==
With the growing number of international business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and teachers need to be aware of the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have  been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"/&gt;

===Emotions===
An empirical research was done by Katholiki Georgiades, Michael H. Boyle, and Kelly A. Fife over the Emotional and Behavior Problems Among Adolescent Students, in specific immigrant students. They examined the relationship between immigrants and racial/ethnic congruence in school. They hypothesized that school belonging is the connection between the congruency and the emotional problems. Although their study was unable to find enough evidence to support their hypothesis they agree that school belonging will influence emotional behavioral problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgiades | first1 = K. | last2 = Boyle | first2 = M. | last3 = Fife | first3 = K. | year = 2003 | title = Emotional and Behavioral Problems Among Adolescent Students: The Role of Immigrant, Racial/Ethnic Congruence and Belongingness in Schools | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 42 | issue = 9| pages = 1473–1492 | pmid = 23192451 | doi=10.1007/s10964-012-9868-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other studies, TCKs are proven to have less emotional stability than those who grew up in more culturally and socially stable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14790710903039906|pages=443–459|title=The effect of multilingualism/multiculturalism on personality: no gain without pain for Third Culture Kids?|journal=International Journal of Multilingualism|volume=6|issue=4|year = 2009|last1 = Dewaele|first1 = Jean-Marc|last2=Van Oudenhoven|first2=Jan Pieter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers that lead to third culture kids==

===Military===
TCKs who have parents or guardians affiliated with the military have varying levels of exposure to local culture. This is due to the possibility of living on base or off base. TCKs who live off base or who are not closely affiliated with the military (such as contractors) will have higher exposure and cultural shaping, while those who spend the majority of their time on the base will have lower exposure and minimal cultural shaping.&lt;ref name="Pearce2002" /&gt; Military children who are immersed in local culture from birth tend to show an extremely high level of cultural shaping, and upon relocation they are likely to cling to said culture for years, if not their lifetime. Relocation for these particular TCKs has shown to be particularly marring for them emotionally.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|title=Children's International Relocation and the Development Process, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|location=Portland|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|pages=157, 168–170|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-military government===
Some of these TCKs may grow up moving from country to country in the diplomatic corps (see [[Foreign Service Brat]]) while others may live their lives near military bases.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

===Religious===
[[Missionary Kids]] (MKs) typically spend the most time overseas, of any TCKs, in one country. 85% of MKs spend more than 10 years in foreign countries and 72% lived in only one foreign country. Of all TCKs, MKs generally have the most interaction with the local populace and the least interaction with people from their passport country. They are also the most likely of the TCKs to integrate themselves into the local culture.&lt;ref name = "sponsor"&gt;Cotrell (2002) p 231{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  83% of missionary kids have at least one parent with an advanced degree.&lt;ref name=Cottrell2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Cottrell|first=Ann|title=Educational and Occupational Choices of American Adult Third Culture Kids, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Missionary kids struggle adjusting to the parents culture; the majority of MKs identify mostly with the country in which their parents served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bikos|first=L.H.|author2=Kocheleva, J. |author3=King, D. |author4=Chang, G.C. |author5=McKenzie, A. |author6=Roenicke, C. |author7=Eckard, K. |title=A consensual qualitative investigation into the repatriation experiences of young adult, missionary kids|journal=Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture|year=2009|volume=7|issue=7|series=12|pages=735–754|doi=10.1080/13674670903032637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preacher's kid|Priests' Kids (PKs) or Pastor's Kids]] are sometimes considered TCKs because they, like military brats, grow up moving from place to place regularly, but are sometimes excluded because they do not often grow up outside their passport country.

===Business===
Another career that can lead to TCKs is a career in business. Sixty-three percent of business TCKs have lived in foreign countries at least 10 years but are more likely than children in missionary families to live in multiple countries.  Business TCKs have fairly high interaction with both their host nationals and people from their host country.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

===Other===
Not all TCK families have one of the fours careers listed above. Other careers include working for an intergovernmental agency (for example, the [[Nuclear Energy Agency]], the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie#Intergovernmental agency|International Agency of the Francophonie]]), an international non-governmental organization (for example, an international school or serving as international staff of the United Nations or one of their agencies), and a local organization such as a [[hospital]]. Working in media and/or athletic industries (for example, [[Wally Szczerbiak]]) can also mean being moved abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2002) p 227.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the other careers that send employees abroad, involvement with the host culture can vary greatly.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

Recent research into the 'other' category has identified a subgroup of TCKs now labelled EdKids. These are children who relocate to various countries with their parents who are educators in the international schools.  This creates a unique paradigm of a nuclear family whose family-work-school-social experiences are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Zilber, E. (2009). Third Culture Kids: Children of International School Educators. London: John Catt Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career decisions==

===Effect on the workforce===
Third culture kids, with their international experience, generally value the international aspect of their lives. In a [[survey methodology|survey]] given to TCKs in 2001, there was a strong interest among TCK participants to continue to travel as they move into adulthood and their future careers, and many continued to maintain their internationally acquired languages. It was also found in these surveys that approximately half of the participants continue to travel at least once a year and that just a little under 15 percent travel for business.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt; TCKs have also been found to report selecting to study majors while in college that could have the options of having international careers. Some of these fields of study include business, [[nursing]], and [[teaching English as a foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell, A.B. (2002). ''Educational and occupational choices of American adult third culture kids''. In Military brats and other global nomads: Growing up in organizational families, ed. M.G. Ender.

Below are tables showing some of the fields that TCK go into.

==Language and third culture kids==
[[File:Languages world map.svg|thumb|A map of the world's major language families.]]
Most international TCKs are expected to speak English and some countries require their expatriate families to be proficient with the English language.&lt;ref name="Pearce2002"/&gt; This is largely because most international schools use the English language as the norm.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002 /&gt;

Families tend to seek out schools whose principal languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow one of the three [[International Baccalaureate]] programs. These will be populated by [[expatriate]]s' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, families will often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their children when they are adults, and because their children are more likely to have prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly different experience from TCKs for whom English is a native language.&lt;ref name=Hylmo&gt;{{cite book|last=Hylmö|first=Annika|title=Other Expatriate Adolescents: A Postmodern Approach to Understanding Expatriate Adolescents Among Non-U.S. Children, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|location=Portland|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|pages= 196, 201|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on TCKs from Japan, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the United States and Africa has shown that TCKs from different countries share more in common with other TCKs than they do with their own peer group from their passport country.&lt;ref name=Hylmo /&gt;

A few sociologists studying TCKs, however, argue that the commonality found in international TCKs is not the result of true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture. They believe that some of the superficial attributes may mirror each other, but that TCKs from different countries are really different from one another.&lt;ref name=Hylmo /&gt; The exteriors may be the same, but that the understanding of the world around them differs.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002 /&gt;

===Kikokushijo===
In Japan, the use of the term "third culture kids" to refer to children returned from living overseas is not universally accepted; they are typically referred to both in Japanese and in English as ''[[kikokushijo]]'', literally "returnee children", a term which has different implications. Public awareness of ''kikokushijo'' is much more widespread in Japan than awareness of TCKs in the United States, and government reports as early as 1966 recognised the need for the school system to adapt to them. However, views of ''kikokushijo'' have not always been positive; in the 1970s, especially, they were characterised in media reports and even by their own parents as "educational orphans" in need of "rescue" to reduce their foreignness and successfully reintegrate them into Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kano Podolsky|first=Momo|title=Crosscultural upbringing: A comparison of the "third culture kids" framework and "Kaigai/Kikokushijo" studies|journal=Gendai Shakai Kenkyū|volume=6|pages=67–78|url=http://www.cs.kyoto-wu.ac.jp/bulletin/6/kanou.pdf|format=PDF|date=2004-01-31|accessdate=2007-11-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306105426/http://www.cs.kyoto-wu.ac.jp/bulletin/6/kanou.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;nCottrell, Ann Baker (2011).

==Statistics (U.S. TCKs)==
Research has been done on American TCKs to identify various characteristics:&lt;ref name=McCaig1994&gt;McCaig NM (1994). [https://web.archive.org/web/20010423103155/http://www.kaiku.com/nomads.html Growing up with a world view – nomad children develop multicultural skills]. ''Foreign Service Journal, pp. 32–41''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Useem2001&gt;Useem RH (2001). [http://www.iss.edu/pages/kids.html Third Culture Kids: Focus of Major Study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041102091837/http://www.iss.edu/pages/kids.html |date=2004-11-02 }}. ''International Schools Services''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive and emotional development===
* Teenage TCKs are more mature than non-TCKs, but in their twenties take longer than their peers to focus their aims.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1993b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1993 | title = TCKs Experience Prolonged Adolescence | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art3.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Depression is comparatively prevalent among TCKs.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1993b" /&gt;
* TCKs' sense of identity and well-being is directly and negatively affected by repatriation.&lt;ref name=Plamondon2008&gt;Plamondon, Laila (2008). Third Culture Kids: Factors that Predict Psychological Health after Repatriation. Honors Thesis, Smith College.&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the effect from repatriation may also depend on the degree of cultural and linguistic differences between the TCK's place of recent residence and place of repatriation (e.g. relocating from London to Sydney vs London to Seoul for a Korean individual that spent most of his/her childhood away from Korea in a Western environment).  
* TCKs are highly linguistically adept (not as true for military TCKs).&lt;ref name=Cottrell1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1994 | title = ATCKs maintain global dimensions throughout their lives | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art5.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**A study whose subjects were all "career military brats"—those who had a parent in the military from birth through high school—shows that brats are linguistically adept.&lt;ref&gt;Ender, Morten, "Growing up in the Military" in Strangers at Home: Essays on the effects of living overseas and Coming 'home' to a strange land. Edited Carolyn Smith, Alethia Publications: New York. 1996. pp&amp;nbsp;88–90&lt;/ref&gt;
*Like all children, TCKs may experience [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and even [[grief]] from the [[Relocation (personal)|relocation]] experience.&lt;ref name="NITLC Brief Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlcinst.org/Moving.html|title=Moving Can Become Traumatic|last=Sheppard|first=Caroline H.|author2=William Steele |year=2003|work=Trauma and Loss: Research and Interventions|publisher=Nat'l Inst for Trauma and Loss in Children|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa State University paper by Lesia Oesterreich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1529G.pdf|title=Understanding children: moving to a new home|last=Oesterreich|first=Lesia|date=April 2004|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and career===
* TCKs are 4 times as likely as non-TCKs to earn a bachelor's degree (81% vs 21%)&lt;ref name=Cottrell1993a&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1993 | title = TCKs Four Times More Likely to Earn Bachelor's Degrees | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art2.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 44 percent earned undergraduate degree after the age of 22.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1994" /&gt;
* Education, medicine, business management, self-employment, and highly skilled positions are the most common professions for TCKs.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1994" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">'''Tone policing''' (also '''tone trolling''', '''tone argument''' and '''tone fallacy''') is an ''[[ad hominem]]'' and antidebate appeal based on [[genetic fallacy]].  It attempts to detract from the validity of a statement by attacking the tone in which it was presented rather than the message itself.

In Bailey Poland's book, ''Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online'', she suggests that tone policing is frequently aimed at women&lt;ref name="Poland"&gt;Bailey Poland (2016) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ywcXDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online], p. 46.  University of Nebraska Press.  {{ISBN|9781612348728}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to derail or silence opponents who may be lower on the "privilege ladder". She writes that "In changing their tactics to criticizing how the women spoke instead of what the women said, the men created an environment in which the outcome of a dispute was not decided on the merits of an argument but on whether the men chose to engage with the arguments in good faith."&lt;ref name="Poland" /&gt; and adds that tone policing is frequently aimed at women as a way to prevent them from making points in discussions.&lt;ref name="Poland" /&gt;.

In Keith Bybee's ''How Civility Works'', he notes that feminists, [[Black Lives Matter]] protesters, and anti-war protesters have been told to "calm down and try to be more polite". He argues that tone policing is a means to deflect attention from injustice and relocate the problem in the style of the complaint, rather than address the complaint itself.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Bybee (2016) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8S_3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 How Civility Works], p. 30. Stanford University Press.  {{ISBN|9781503601543}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Letter from a Birmingham Jail]]'', [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] condemned this type of silencing, writing that he was "gravely disappointed" with the "white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/column/millennial-athwart/article/2016/4/8/stop-tone-policing/|title=The Myth of Tone Policing|first=Shubhankar|last=Chhokra|publisher=The Harvard Crimson|date=2016-04-08|accessdate=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''ad hominem'' fallacies of relevance are often [[wikt:autology|autologies]], critics have argued that tone policing is a flawed concept simply because it is autological. As discussed by ''The Frisky's'' Rebecca Vipond Brink, the act of labeling tone policing may itself be considered tone policing, as "The problem with telling someone that you have a right to express yourself as angrily as you want to without them raising an objection is that you’re also inherently telling them that they don’t have a right to be angry about the way you’re addressing them."&lt;ref name=Frisky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2014-09-07/calling-out-tone-policing-has-become-tone-policing/|author=Rebecca Vipond Brink|title=Calling Out Tone-Policing Has Become Tone-Policing|date=2014-09-07|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Byfield]] has written that steering observers away from the validity of an argument is only one of many possible motivations for raising concerns about tone during a heated debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brucebyfield.com/2014/03/20/separating-discussions-of-tone-from-tone-arguments/|title=Separating discussions of tone from tone arguments|first=Bruce|last=Byfield|date=2014-03-20|accessdate=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article on [[The Good Men Project]] has argued that moderating tone, whether or not one cares about civility, is useful for increasing persuasive impact on the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goodmenproject.com/noseriouslywhatabouttehmenz/in-defense-of-the-tone-argument/|title=In Defense of the Tone Argument|first=Ozy|last=Frantz|publisher=The Good Men Project|date=2012-06-27|accessdate=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transmissibility''' is the ratio of [[Input/output|output]] to [[Input/output|input]].

Transmissibility: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{output}{input}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; means [[Amplifier|amplification]] and maximum amplification occurs when forcing [[frequency]] (&lt;math&gt;f_f&lt;/math&gt;) and natural frequency (&lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt;) of the system coincide.

There is no unit designation for transmissibility, although it may sometimes be referred to as the ''[[Q factor]]''.

The transmissibility is used in calculation of [[passive heave compensation]] efficiency.

==Origin==

Vulgar auteurism derives its name&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; from the [[auteur theory]], a key component of [[film criticism]] which posits that the director is the author ("auteur") of a film and that films should be analyzed in terms of how they fit into a director's larger body of work.&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; Also known as "auteurism," the auteur theory was introduced by French critics associated with the film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' during the 1950s and popularized in the [[United States]] in the 1960s by [[Andrew Sarris]].&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;

Several critics, including Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', have drawn parallels between the earliest French and American proponents of the auteur theory and vulgar auteurism.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; However, many commentators on the movement consider vulgar auteurism to be distinct from the classical auteur theory, pointing to its concern with visual style over theme.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; The question of whether vulgar auteurism is a legitimate separate movement or a subset of the auteur theory remains a source of controversy in the [[film critic]] community.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;
According to film critic Peter Labuza, vulgar auteurism "seems to have been an unconscious movement before it ever had a name."&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; The earliest criticism identified as exhibiting "vulgar auteurism" was published in the Canadian film magazine ''Cinema Scope'' in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; ''Cinema Scope'' writer Andrew Tracy coined the term&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; in his 2009 article, "Vulgar Auteurism: The Case of Michael Mann".&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; Initially pejorative,&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; the term was repurposed by [[Mubi (website)|Mubi]] user John Lehtonen.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; In the early-going, the theory was explored not through text, but through images via a [[Tumblr]] simply entitled "Vulgar Auteurism",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://vulgarauteurism.tumblr.com/ Vulgar Auteurism]"&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by Lehtonen and filmmaker Kurt Walker, with contributions from Mubi critics Adam Cook and Daniel Kasman. Over the years which followed, Mubi's online film magazine began to publish more and more articles defending genres and directors which were unpopular with the critical mainstream.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; 

Vulgar auteurist ideas gained currency&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; when one of the movement's leading proponents,&lt;ref name=patches /&gt; critic [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]], became the co-host of the television program ''[[Ebert Presents: At the Movies]]'', produced by [[Roger Ebert]]. However, while "vulgar auteurist" criticism was becoming popular, the term and the movement to which it corresponded remained obscure until the publication of an article by Calum Marsh, "Fast &amp; Furious &amp; Elegant: Justin Lin and the Vulgar Auteurs", in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' on May 24, 2013.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt;&lt;ref name=kenigsberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenigsberg|first=Ben|title=From the Wire: Pinkerton's Notes on Vulgar Auteurism|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/from-the-wire-pinkertons-notes-on-vulgar-auteurism|publisher=Indiewire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===

Marsh's article was immediately controversial.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt; While some took issue with the films and filmmakers being championed by the proponents of vulgar auteurism,&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt; others took issue with the idea that vulgar auteurism was a movement distinct from the auteur theory.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;

One of the most vocal opponents of vulgar auteurism is former ''Village Voice'' critic Nick Pinkerton,&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt; 
&lt;ref name=kenigsberg /&gt; who has written essays in praise of directors championed by the movement&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt; and whose 2012 article "The Bigger and Better Mousetraps of [[Paul W.S. Anderson]]" has been described as vulgar auteurist.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt; Writing in his SundanceNow column following the publication of Marsh's article, Pinkerton described vulgar auteurism as "a shameless attention grab",&lt;ref name=pinkerton&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinkerton|first=Nick|title=BOMBAST #96|url=http://blog.sundancenow.com/weekly-columns/bombast-96|publisher=SundanceNow|access-date=2014-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302090231/http://blog.sundancenow.com/weekly-columns/bombast-96|archive-date=2014-03-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding: "Even more galling is the assumed attitude that the VA position stands alone against a vast, unsympathetic critical conspiracy to marginalize and underrate the products of industrial filmmaking. [...] The numbers, meanwhile, do not bear out claims of a highbrow conspiracy: ''[[Fast &amp; Furious 6]]'', which we’re assured is scorned by critics the world over, currently stands at 61% at [[Metacritic]], above ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' (54%), and within striking distance of arty jazz like ''[[Simon Killer]]'' and ''[[Post Tenebras Lux (film)|Post Tenebras Lux]]''."&lt;ref name=pinkerton /&gt;

The '''western snowy plover''' (''Charadrius nivosus nivosus'') is a small [[wader]] in the [[plover]] [[bird]] family. It breeds in the southern and western [[United States]] and the [[Caribbean]]. 

On March 5, 1993 the western snowy plover was listed as a [[threatened species]] under the [[Endangered Species Act|Endangered Species Act of 1973]]. As of June 19, 2012, the habitat along the California, Oregon, and Washington Coasts have been listed as critical.&lt;ref name=FWS&gt;{{Cite web |title=Western Snowy Plover Species Profile |url=http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html |website=www.fws.gov |accessdate=8 February 2016 |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
