'''Abdul Gaffar Choudhury''' ({{lang-bn|আবদুল গাফফার চৌধুরী}}; born 12 December 1934) is a Bangladeshi-born British writer, journalist, columnist, [[Political science|political analyst]] and poet. He is perhaps best known for writing the lyrics to "[[Amar Bhaier Rokte Rangano|Amar Bhaier Rôkte Rangano]]" which is the most widely celebrated song commemorating the [[Bengali Language Movement]].

==Early life==
Choudhury was born [[Ulania]], [[Mehendiganj Upazila|Mehendiganj]], [[Barisal Division]], [[Bengal Presidency]] (now [[Bangladesh]]), [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]].&lt;ref name="sahos24"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sahos24.com/english/2014/12/12/2300|title=Abdul Gaffar Choudhury- An Expatriate Bangladeshi Writer|location=Bangladesh|publisher=Sahos24.com|date=12 December 2012|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Dhaka University]] in 1959 and came to England on 5 October 1974.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho10"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karim|first1=Mohammed Abdul|last2=Karim|first2=Shahadoth|title=British Bangladeshi Who's Who|url=http://www.bbwhoswho.co.uk/images/who%27%20who%20website%202010.pdf|date=October 2010|publisher=British Bangla Media Group|page=36|isbn= |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho11"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karim|first1=Mohammed Abdul|last2=Karim|first2=Shahadoth|title=British Bangladeshi Who's Who|url=http://www.bbwhoswho.co.uk/images/who_%20who_2011.pdf|date=October 2011|publisher=British Bangla Media Group|page=36|isbn= |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choudhury's father, Hazi Wahed Reza Choudhury, was a landlord and freedom fighter of British India. He was the president of [[Barisal District]] Congress and a member of the All India Congress Working Committee. His father was imprisoned in 1942 August Movement. He served as secretary to [[Motilal Nehru]]. Zohra Khatun was Choudhury's mother.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho11"/&gt;

They are three brothers and five sisters, Ali Reza Choudhury (Mehdi) his younger brother, Hossain reja Choudhury his elder brother. His sisters name is; Manik bibi choudhury, Laili Khatun choudhury, Saleha Khatun choudhury, Masuma Begum choudhury and his younger sister name Fazilatun Nesa Choudhury.

==Career==
Before moving to the United Kingdom, Choudhury worked as a journalist in different national newspapers in Dhaka. During the 1971 [[Bangladeshi Liberation War]], he worked for ''Joy Bangla'', ''Jugantar'' and ''Anandabazar Patrika''.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho11"/&gt;

He is perhaps best known for writing the lyrics to ''[[Amar Bhaier Rokte Rangano]]'' which is recognised as the most influential song of [[Bengali Language Movement]] and was initially set to music by him. Later, however, [[Altaf Mahmud]]'s composed music and adapted the song. It has been regarded by listeners of BBC Bengali Service as the third best song in Bengali.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thedailystar"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mallick |first=Sadya Afreen |date=21 March 2014 |title=Spirit of Ekushey |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/spirit-of-ekushey-12250 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |location=Dhaka |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Choudhury founded the newspaper ''Notun Din''. He has written 35 five books. He lives in London from where he regularly writes columns in national Bangladeshi dailies, in Bengali newspapers of Bangladeshi community and in a daily paper in Kolkata.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho11"/&gt;

Some of his notable works are "Dan Pithe Shawkat", "Chandrodwiper Upakhyan", "Nam Na Jana Bhore", "Nil Jamuna", "Shesh Rajanir Chand", "Polashi Thekey Dhanmondi", "Bastobotar Nirikhey" and others.&lt;ref name="observerbd"&gt;{{cite news |title=Birthday Celebrations for Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury today at Bangla Academy |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/12/12/60256.php |work=The Daily Observer |location=Dhaka |date=12 December 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="risingbd"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mukul |first=Manzurul Alam |date=12 December 2014 |url=http://www.risingbd.com/english/Gaffar_Chowdhury%E2%80%99s_birthday_today/20297 |title=Gaffar Chowdhury's birthday today |publisher=RisingBD.com |location=Dhaka |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Adamic language''' is, according to [[Jews|Jewish]] tradition (as recorded in the ''[[midrash]]im'') and some [[Christians]], the language spoken by [[Adam]] (and possibly [[Eve]]) in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by [[God]] to address Adam (the [[divine language]]), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in the [[Genesis creation narrative]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|2:19|KJV}}).

== Middle Ages ==
{{further|Confusion of tongues|Lingua ignota}}

Traditional Jewish exegesis such as [[Midrash]] ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 38) says that Adam spoke the [[Hebrew language]] because the names he gives Eve – ''Isha'' ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:23) and ''Chava'' (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast, [[Kabbalism]] assumed an "eternal Torah" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, [[Abulafia]]{{which|date=July 2016}} in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in [[Paradise]] had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then-current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), p. 32 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umberto Eco]] (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the [[confusion of tongues]] (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]] addresses the topic in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (1302-1305). He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing [[Serpents in the Bible|the serpent]], and not to Adam.&lt;ref&gt;''mulierem invenitur ante omnes fuisse locutam''. Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (c. 1308-1320), however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'' 26.133f.; Mazzocco, p. 178f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early modern period ==
=== Proponents ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Elizabethan scholar [[John Dee]] makes references to an [[occult]] or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of [[spirit medium]] [[Edward Kelley]]. Dee's journals did not describe the language as "[[Enochian]]", instead preferring "Angelical", the "Celestial Speech", the "Language of Angels", the "First Language of God-Christ", the "Holy Language", or "Adamical" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the [[Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

Dutch physician, linguist, and humanist [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]] (1519–1572) theorized in ''Origines Antwerpianae'' (1569) that [[Antwerp]]ian [[Brabantic]], spoken in the region between the [[Scheldt]] and [[Meuse]] Rivers, was the original language spoken in Paradise. Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words. Since Brabantic has a higher number of short words than do Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, Goropius reasoned that it was the older language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gorporius Becanus |first=Johannes |date=2014 |title=Van Adam tot Antwerpen: Een bloemlezing uit de Origines Antwerpianae en de Opera van Johannes Goropius Becanus |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bgWyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=265 |location=Hilversum |publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren |page=265–277 |isbn=9789087044312 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced that of [[Simon Stevin]] (1548–1620), who espoused similar ideas in "Uytspraeck van de weerdicheyt der Duytse tael", a chapter in ''[[De Beghinselen Der Weeghconst]]'' (1586).

=== Opponents ===
By the 17th century, the existence and nature of the alleged Adamic language was commonly discussed amongst European Jewish and Christian mystics and primitive linguists.&lt;ref name="Noordegraaf"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Noordegraaf |first=Jan |date=1983 |title=Nog eens Hedendaagsch fetischisme |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_voo004198301_01/_voo004198301_01_0009.php |journal=Voortgang |publisher= Stichting Neerlandistiek VU |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=193–230 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) was skeptical that Hebrew was the language best capable of describing the nature of things, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could never find, that the Hebrew names of animals, mentioned in the beginning of Genesis, argued a (much) clearer insight into their natures, than did the names of the same or some other animals in Greek, or other languages (1665:45).&lt;ref name="Noordegraaf"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) expressed similar skepticism in his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref name="Noordegraaf"/&gt;

== Modern period ==

=== Latter Day Saint movement ===
[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], in his [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|revision of the Bible]], declared the Adamic language to have been "pure and undefiled".&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Moses]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6/6#6 6:6].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Latter Day Saints]] believe it to be the language of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= John S. |last= Robertson |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5449 |contribution= Adamic Language |pages= 18–19 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |year= 1992 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glossolalia]], or speaking in tongues, was commonplace in the early years of the movement, and it was commonly believed that the incomprehensible language spoken during these incidents was the language of Adam.

The '''Anti-Hindi imposition agitation of 1937–40''' is a series of protests that happened in [[Madras Presidency]] of the [[British Raj]] during 1937-40. It was launched in 1937 in opposition to the introduction of compulsory teaching of [[Hindi]] in the schools of the presidency by the [[Indian National Congress]] government led by [[C. Rajagopalachari]] (Rajaji). This move was immediately opposed by [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] (Periyar) and the opposition [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] (later [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]). The agitation, which lasted three years, was multifaceted and involved [[Fasting|fasts]], conferences, marches, picketing and protests. The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1,198 persons including women and children. The mandatory Hindi education was later withdrawn by the British Governor of Madras [[John Erskine, Lord Erskine|Lord Erskine]] in February 1940 after the resignation of the Congress government in 1939.

==Background==
{{main article|Languages of India}}
The Republic of India has hundreds of languages. According to the Census of 2001, there are 1,635 rationalized mother tongues and 122 languages with more than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[British Raj]], English was the [[Official Language|official language]]. When the Indian Independence Movement gained momentum in the early part of the 20th century, efforts were undertaken to make [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] as a common language to unite various linguistic groups against the British Government. As early as 1918, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] established the ''Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha'' (Institution for the Propagation of Hindi in South India). In 1925, the Indian National Congress switched to Hindustani from English for conducting its proceedings.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy421"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|1997| loc=ch. 4.21 (Battling the Demoness Hindi)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Gandhi and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] were supporters of Hindustani and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindustani in non-Hindi speaking Provinces of India.&lt;ref name="nehru1"&gt;{{cite book | first=Jawaharlal| last=Nehru|  first2=Mohandas| last2=Gandhi| authorlink=Jawaharlal Nehru | origyear=| year=1937| title= The question of language: Issue 6 of Congress political and economic studies|edition= | publisher=K.

The Indian National Congress won the [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1937|1937 elections]] in Madras Presidency. Rajaji became the Chief Minister on 14 July 1937. He was a supporter of propagating Hindi in South India. Even before the elections, he had expressed support for Hindi in a newspaper article (''Sudesamithran'', 6 May 1937): "Government employment is limited. All cannot get it. Therefore one has to search for other jobs. For that and for business, knowledge of Hindi is necessary. Only if we learn Hindi, the south Indian can gain respect among the others."&lt;ref name="more"/&gt; On 11 August 1937,&lt;ref name="venu2"&gt;{{cite book | first= E.Es. | last=Venu| authorlink=| origyear=| year=1979| title= Why South opposes Hindi|edition= | publisher=Justice Publications| location= | id= | pages=54| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83xIAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; within a month of coming to power, he announced his intention to introduce Hindi language teaching in secondary schools by issuing a policy statement.&lt;ref name="more"/&gt; This move followed lobbying by pro-Hindi organisations like ''Hindustani Seva Dal'' and ''Hindustani Hitashi Sabha''. These organisations had earlier convinced many [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] led local governments to introduce compulsory Hindi in schools in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy421"/&gt; Periyar and the opposition Justice Party led by [[A. T. Panneerselvam]] immediately opposed the move. An Anti-Hindi conference was organised on 4 October 1937 to protest the announcement. On 21 April 1938, Rajaji went ahead and passed a government order (G.O) making the teaching of Hindi compulsory in 125 Secondary schools in the Presidency. Rajaji's persistence was viewed by Hindi's opponents as an attempt to destroy Tamil and promote Hindi. They started statewide protests against Rajaji and Hindi. The agitation was marked by protest marches, anti-Hindi conferences, observing an anti-Hindi day (1 July&lt;ref name="ravichandran174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ravichandran|1982|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3 December 1938&lt;ref name="baliga1"&gt;{{cite book | first= B.

It was active in Tamil speaking districts of the Presidency - [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramnad]], [[Tirunelveli District|Tirunelveli]], [[Salem District|Salem]], [[Thanjavur District|Tanjore]] and [[North Arcot]].&lt;ref name="more"/&gt; The agitation lasted till the order was withdrawn in February 1940. Two persons -Thalamuthu and Natarajan - lost their lives. Around 1,200 people including Periyar were imprisoned.

==Support for the agitation==

[[File:Kudiyarasu.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Frontpage of ''Kudiyarasu'' dated 20 November 1938. The story is about the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference]]
The anti-Hindi agitation was backed by Periyar's [[Self-Respect Movement]] and Justice Party. The Justice party was led by older, established leaders like [[Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu]] and Pannirselvam, who did not have reputations as agitators and derived their power from patronage. Their representatives in the [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly|Madras Legislature]] demanded that the Hindi teaching be made optional.&lt;ref name="Irschick1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irschick|1986| pp=212–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more militant agitators led by Periyar did not have any patronage, but derived their influence from activism and politics of agitation. Periyar eventually became the president of the Justice Party during the course of the agitation. The agitation was also supported by Tamil scholars like [[Maraimalai Adigal]], Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan, [[K. A. P. Viswanatham]] and [[S. Ilakkuvanar|Ilakkuvanar]]. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars were among the first to announce their opposition to the Hindi teaching in the ''Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja'' conference at [[Velur, Tamil Nadu|Velur]].&lt;ref name="saivite1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venkatachalapathy|first=A. R.|date=8 April 1995|title=Dravidian Movement and Saivites: 1927-1944|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|publisher=[[Economic and Political Weekly]]|volume=30|issue=14|pages=761–768|issn=0012-9976|oclc=46735231|jstor=4402599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers. [[Moovalur Ramamirtham]], Narayani, Va. Ba. Thamaraikani, Munnagar Azhagiyar, Dr. Dharmambal, Malar Mugathammaiyar, Pattammal and Seethammal were some of the women who were arrested for participating in the agitation.&lt;ref name="sarkar"/&gt; On 13 November 1938,&lt;ref name="ravichandran175"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ravichandran|1982|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference was convened to demonstrate women's support for the movement.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy522"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|1997| loc=ch. 5.22 (The Woman Devotee)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srilata"&gt;{{cite book | first=K.| last=Srilata| authorlink=| origyear=| year=2003| title=The other half of the coconut: women writing self-respect history: an anthology of self-respect literature (1928-1936) |edition= | publisher=Zubaan| location= | id= {{ISBN|978-81-86706-50-3}}| pages=11–12| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AOnhw_0UREC&amp;pg=PA11 | isbn=81-86706-50-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the anti-Brahmin sentiments of the backers of the agitation, a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy530" /&gt;
The Tamil speaking Muslims in the Madras presidency supported the agitation (in contrast to the [[Urdu]] speaking Muslims, who supported the propagation of Hindi). [[P. Kalifulla]], a [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] member representing [[Trichy]] in the Legislative Assembly, declared "I may at once say that I am a [[Rowther]] myself; my mother tongue is Tamil and not Urdu. I am not ashamed of it; I am proud of it.. We have not been told why Hindi after all has been chosen as the common language of India".&lt;ref name="more"/&gt; Financial support for the agitation was provided by industrialists and landlords like [[W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar]] and [[G. D. Naidu]].&lt;ref name="Irschick2"/&gt; Acknowledging the agitation's popular support, Lord Erskine, the then Governor of Madras wrote to Viceroy [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Linlithgow]] in July 1938 that "Compulsory Hindi has been the cause of great trouble in this province and is certainly contrary to the wishes of the bulk of the population..."&lt;ref name="more"/&gt;

==Fasts==
On 1 May 1938, a young man named Stalin Jagadeesan went on a fast demanding the withdrawal of compulsory Hindi teaching. He became a symbol for the anti-Hindi agitators. In an interview published in Periyar's magazine ''Viduthalai'' he declared that his fast was to prove that ''Tamil Thai'' (lit. Mother Tamil) still had loyal sons. On 1 June, another man named Ponnusamy began a fast in front of Rajaji's house. Periyar did not approve of fasting as a form of protest. But other leaders of the agitation like [[C. N. Annadurai]] used Jagadeesan as an example. Annadurai declared in an anti-Hindi meeting that "If Jagadeesan dies, I am ready to take his place, and die along with ten others. As soon as Jagadeesan dies, you should also be prepared to die". Jagadeesan's fast was called off after ten weeks and it was reported that he had been eating regularly during the nights.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kannan7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kannan|2010| p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Picketing and processions==
[[File:Periyarkutiarasu.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Front page of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy's periodical ''Kudiyarasu'' (03 September 1939). The headline reads "Veezhga Indhi" (Down with Hindi)]]
A major feature of the agitation was the picketing of government offices and the schools where Hindi was being taught compulsorily. A boycott committee was formed on 1 June 1938 to coordinate the picketing. Rajaji's house in [[Mambalam]], the Board High School at [[Tiruvarur]] and the [[The Hindu Higher Secondary School|Hindu Theosophical School]] at [[Triplicane]], [[Madras]] became popular targets for the picketers. Most of the picketers in Madras city were not residents of the city and were bought from the outlying areas. Some of them were paid "spending money" to take part in the protests. Until October 1938, the picketing was relatively ineffective and contained. In that month Periyar started playing an active role in the agitation and the movement heated up. In November an anti-Hindi procession in Madras city turned violent and developed into a riot with protesters stoning the offices of ''[[Indian Express]]'', ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'', ''[[Dina Mani]]'' and ''Tamil Mani''. With Periyar's fiery speeches motivating them, the agitators succeeded in provoking disproportionate response from the Police. The agitation which started relatively small, began to gain momentum.&lt;ref name="Irschick2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irschick|1986| pp=220–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tamil brigade==
In August–September 1938, a protest march was jointly organised by the Self-Respect movement and the Muslim league. It was flagged of by Periyar and Khaliffullah. The marchers who called themselves ''Tamilar Padai'' (lit. Tamil brigade), started from [[Trichy]] on 1 August 1938. They were led by Kumarasamy Pillai and Moovalur Ramamirtham. In the next 42 days, the marchers covered 234 villages and 60 towns. They addressed 87 public meetings and received widespread coverage in the press. They reached Madras on 11 September 1938 and were arrested for picketing government offices. The march succeeded in raising anti-Hindi and pro-Tamil support in smaller towns and villages they covered.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="more"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baliga1"/&gt;

== Natarajan and Thalamuthu ==
Two persons died during the agitation and were claimed as martyrs by the agitators. Their deaths fueled the protests further. Natarajan (a [[Paraiyar]]) was arrested On 5 December 1938. He was admitted to the hospital on the 30 December and died on 15 January 1939. On 13 February 1939, Thalamuthu Nadar was arrested with others for picketing the Hindu Theological High School in Madras. While imprisoned, he fell ill on 6 March and died on 11 March. The government claimed that his death was due to [[Cellulitis]] and [[Amoebic dysentery]] and he was already in poor health when he died. It dismissed their deaths and claimed they were illiterates. When the issue was raised in the Assembly, Rajaji dismissed it casually. The agitators were incensed by the government attitude and turned the dead men into martyrs. Their funeral processions in Madras were attended by hundreds of mourners and witnessed fiery speeches denouncing the government. Annadurai proclaimed that Natarajan’s name and deeds should be inscribed in gold in the history of the world. The agitators praised their sacrifices and claimed that the dead men had refused early release in exchange for ending their activities. In an interview given to the ''Sunday Observer'' on 27 January 1939, Natarajan's father K. Lakshmanan said when his son was hospitalized he refused to apologize to get an early release.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy530"&gt;{{cite book | first=Sumathy| last=Ramaswamy| authorlink=| origyear=| year=1997| title= Passions of the tongue: language devotion in Tamil India, 1891-1970 |edition= | publisher=University of California Press| location= | id= {{ISBN|978-0-520-20805-6}}| pages=Chapter 5.30| url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;chunk.id=s1.5.30&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ch5&amp;brand=ucpress | isbn=0-520-20805-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geetha"&gt;{{cite book | first=V| last=Geetha|first2=S.

==Anti Brahminism==
The anti-Hindi movement viewed the Hindi legislation as an attempt by [[Brahmins]] to impose Hindi and [[Sanskrit]] over Tamil.&lt;ref name="kannan9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kannan|2010| pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phadnis"&gt;{{cite book | first=Urmila | last=Phadnis|first2=Rajat| last2=Ganguly| authorlink=| origyear=| year=2001| title=Ethnicity and nation-building in South Asia |edition= | publisher=SAGE| location= | id= {{ISBN|978-0-7619-9439-8}}| pages=221| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbf2wzyuWkUC&amp;pg=PA221 | isbn=0-7619-9439-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajaji's earlier attempt to translate an English Language Physics book into Tamil using Sanskrit words was viewed as proof of his preference of Sanskrit over Tamil. The anti-Hindi movement portrayed the Brahmin-dominated Tamil Nadu Congress party as a stooge of "Hindi Imperialists" from the North. The resistance of the Brahmin Tamil scholars for removing Sanskrit words from Tamil was viewed by some in the agitation as proof of Brahmin complicity in the attempt to destroy Tamil.&lt;ref name="venkatachalapathy"&gt;{{cite book | title=andha kalathil kaapi illai| last=Vēṅkaṭācalapati|first=Ā.

Dravidian movement newspapers carried cartoons depicting Rajaji hurling a dagger at ''Tamil Thai'' and disrobing her. Similar banners were displayed in the processions taken out by anti-Hindi agitators. In an anti-Hindi meeting organised in August 1938, Pavalar Balasundaram accused the Brahmin community of "killing Tamil Thai". Rajaji's dismissal of Natarasan's death in the Assembly was denounced as "Aryans laughing while Tamils shed tears for their hero". Rajaji complained that the agitators were describing their opponents "by caste, by their sacred thread, by the tuft of the hair on their head". In a riot that happened in Madras city in November 1938, acts of violence were committed against Brahmins by the agitators.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irschick2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramaswamy524"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|1997| loc=ch. 5.24 (The Brahman Devotee)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kannan8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kannan|2010| p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response==
{{Rajaji}}
The ruling Congress Party was divided on the Hindi issue. While Rajaji and his supporters stuck to their position, [[S. Satyamurti|Sathyamurti]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] were against it. They wanted Rajaji to make Hindi optional or to provide a conscience clause for allowing parents to withhold their children from Hindi Classes. Satyamurti also disagreed with the use of Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1932 against the anti-Hindi agitators.&lt;ref name="ramanathan"/&gt; In a letter written to [[Mahatma Gandhi]] on 7 July 1938, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I personally believe that where a parent or guardian swears an affidavit before a magistrate stating his reasons that it is against his conscience that his boy or girl should learn Hindustani compulsorily, the child may be exempted. I personally believe very few parents or guardians will claim this exemption. This will expose the hollowness of the agitation and kill it. I wish you to write to Sri. C. Rajagopalachari suggesting this to him. Moreover, I am not very happy over the use by the Madras Government of the Criminal Law Amendment Act against these picketers.&lt;ref name="ramanathan"&gt;{{cite book | first=K.V.| last=Ramanathan| authorlink=| origyear=| year=2008| title=The Satyamurti Letters, Volume II |edition= | publisher=Pearson Education India| location= | id= {{ISBN|978-81-317-1684-7}}| pages=3, 34| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glA6t2p7arwC | isbn=81-317-1684-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rajaji defended his action in another G.O. issued on 14 June 1938:
&lt;blockquote&gt; The attainment by our Province of its rightful place in the national life of India requires that our educated youth should possess a working knowledge of the most widely spoken language in India. Government have therefore decided upon the introduction of Hindustani in the secondary school curriculum of our province. Government desire to make it clear that Hindi is not to be introduced in any elementary school whatsoever, the mother tongue being the only language taught in such schools. Hindi is to be introduced only in secondary schools and there too only in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd forms, that is to say in the 6th, 7th and 8th years of school life. It will not therefore interfere in any way with the teaching of the mother tongue in the secondary schools....Hindi will be compulsory only in the sense that attendance in such classes will be compulsory and pupils cannot take Hindi as a substitute for Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam or Kannada, but must learn Hindi only in addition to one of these languages.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy421"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He refused to give in to the demands of the agitators. He claimed they were motivated by their "prejudices of anti-aryanism" and "hatred of the Congress".&lt;ref name="ramaswamy421"/&gt; The police response to the agitation grew progressively brutal in 1939. Rajaji used the Criminal Law Amendment Act against the agitators, so that they could be charged of "non-bailable" criminal offenses.&lt;ref name="kannan8"/&gt; Displeased by his high handedness, Governor Erskine complained: "..[Rajaji] was too much of a [[Tory]] for me, for though I may want to go back twenty years, he wishes to go back two thousand and to run India as it was run in the time of [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]]". During the agitation, a total of 1,198 protesters were arrested and out of them 1,179 were convicted (73 of those jailed were women and some of them went to jail with their children; 32 children accompanied their mothers to prison).&lt;ref name="sarkar"&gt;{{cite book | first=Tanika| last=Sarkar| authorlink=| origyear=| year=2008| title=Women and social reform in modern India: a reader |edition= | publisher=Indiana University Press| location= | id= {{ISBN|978-0-253-22049-3}}| pages=396| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLGBUEs74n4C | isbn=0-253-22049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar was fined 1,000 Rupees and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment for inciting "women to disobey the law" (he was released within six months on 22 May 1939 citing medical grounds)&lt;ref name="ravichandran176"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ravichandran|1982|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Annadurai was jailed for four months.&lt;ref name="baliga2"&gt;{{cite book | first= B.

==Cancellation==
On 29 October 1939, Rajaji's Congress Government resigned protesting the involvement of India in the Second World War. Madras provincial government was placed under Governor's rule. On 31 October, Periyar suspended the agitation and asked the Governor to withdraw the compulsory Hindi order.&lt;ref name="ravichandran176"/&gt; On 21 February 1940, Governor Erskine, issued a press communique withdrawing compulsory Hindi teaching and making it optional.&lt;ref name="sundararajan"&gt;{{cite book | first=Saroja| last=Sundarajan| authorlink=| origyear=| year=1989| title= March to freedom in Madras Presidency, 1916-1947 |edition= | publisher=Lalitha Publications| location= | id=| pages=546| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nr5HAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
{{See also|Rise of Dravidian parties to power in Tamil Nadu}}

The anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 led to a change of guard in the Madras Presidency. The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state, the Justice Party, came under Periyar's leadership on 29 December 1938.&lt;ref name="vasantha2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandasamy|Smarandache|2005| p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam. The political careers of many later leaders of the [[Dravidian Movement]], such as C. N. Annadurai, started with their participation in these agitations. The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state.&lt;ref name="ramaswamy421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramaswamy530"/&gt; The agitations also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base, when it shifted from its earlier pro-Tamil (and anti-Brahmin) stance to a more inclusive one, which was both anti-Hindi and pro-English. 
In the words of Sumathi Ramaswamy (Professor of History at [[Duke University]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The anti-Hindi agitations knit] together diverse, even incompatible, social and political interests... Their common cause against Hindi had thrown together religious revivalists like Maraimalai Atikal (1876-1950) with avowed atheists like Ramasami and [[Bharathidasan]] (1891-1964); men who supported the Indian cause like [[V. Kalyanasundaram|T.V. Kalyanasundaram]] (1883-1953) and M. P. Sivagnanam with dravidian movement supporters like Annadurai; university professors like Somasundara Bharati (1879-1959) and M.S. Purnalingam Pillai (1866 -1947) with uneducated street poets, populist pamphleteers and college students.&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;{{cite book | first=Andrew| last=Simpson | authorlink=| origyear=| year=2007| title=Language and national identity in Asia |edition= | publisher=Oxford University Press| location= | id={{ISBN|9780199267484}}| pages=71| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3XvBbdWCKYC | isbn=0-19-926748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ramaswamy2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramaswamy|first=Sumathy |title=The demoness, the maid, the whore, and the good mother: contesting the national language in India|journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language | publisher =[[Walter de Gruyter]]|volume=140 |issue=1 | pages =1–28 |year=1999 |url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/ijsl.1999.140.1 |doi=10.1515/ijsl.1999.140.1}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">The '''appearance of impropriety''' is a [[phrase]] referring to a situation which to a [[layperson]] without knowledge of the specific circumstances might seem to raise [[ethics]] questions.  For instance, although a person might regularly and reliably collect money for her employer in her personal wallet and later give it to her employer, her putting it in her personal wallet may appear improper and give rise to suspicion, etc.    It is common business practice to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

'''COSMOS''' (computer system for main frame operations) was a record-keeping system for [[main distribution frame]]s (MDFs) in the [[Bell System]], the [[American Bell Telephone Company]] and then, subsequently, [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]–led system which provided telephone services to much of the United States and Canada from 1977 to 1984. 

COSMOS was introduced in the 1970s after MDFs were found to be congested in large urban [[telephone exchange]]s.  It assigns terminals so jumpers need not be so long, thus leaving more space on the shelves.  COSMOS also converts customer service orders into printed work orders for staff who connect the jumpers.  COSMOS orders are usually coordinated with [[Recent Change Memory Administration Center|RCMAC]] to ensure that translations match wiring.  With good computer records, jumpers are often left in place for reuse when one customer replaces another, resulting in a great reduction in labor.

More modern modular MDFs were developed around the same time called '''COSMIC''' (Common System Main Interconnecting) frames

'''''Capo di tutti i capi''''' or '''''capo dei capi''''' is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "boss of all bosses" or "boss of [the] bosses". It is a phrase used mainly by the media, public and the law enforcement community to indicate a supremely powerful [[crime boss]] in the [[Sicilian Mafia|Sicilian]] or [[American Mafia]] who holds great influence over the whole organization. The term was introduced to the U.S. public by the [[Kefauver Commission]] (1950).&lt;ref name="Stefano118"&gt;De Stefano, ''An Offer We Can't Refuse'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Mafia==
[[File:Frank Costello - Kefauver Committee.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Frank Costello]] testifying before the [[Kefauver Commission|Kefauver Committee]]]]

The word was applied by mobsters to [[Giuseppe Morello]] around 1900, according to [[Nick Gentile]].&lt;ref name=critchley46&gt;Critchley, ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891-1931'', p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Bosses [[Joe Masseria]] (1928–1931) and [[Salvatore Maranzano]] (1931) used the title as part of their efforts to centralize control of the Mafia under themselves. When Maranzano won the [[Castellammarese War]], he set himself up as boss of all bosses and ordered every Mafia family to pay him tribute. This provoked a rebellious reaction which led to him being murdered. [[Lucky Luciano]] then created [[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]] in 1931 as an alternative.&lt;ref name=critchley196&gt;Critchley, ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891-1931'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission consisted of the bosses of the [[Five Families]] in New York and some non New York families.&lt;ref name=critchley232&gt;Critchley, ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891-1931'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; These men had equal say in Mafia matters. Since then, the title of boss of all bosses has been given by the media to the most powerful boss, although the Mafia never recognized the position itself. [[Genovese crime family]] bosses Lucky Luciano (1931–1946), [[Frank Costello]] (1946–1957) and [[Vito Genovese]] (1957–1959) were given the title. Following Genovese, [[Joseph Bonanno]], boss of the [[Bonanno crime family]], chaired the commission in 1959–1962.

With the rise of [[Carlo Gambino]], the [[Gambino crime family]] became the most powerful crime family and he was given the title from 1962–1976, as were his successors [[Paul Castellano]] (1976–1985), and [[John Gotti]] (1985–1992).&lt;ref name=raab201&gt;Raab, ''Five Families'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of Gotti, Genovese Boss [[Vincent Gigante]] held the title from 1992–1997. The term has since fallen out of use. Bonanno family boss [[Joseph Massino]] was recognized by four of the five families as chairman of the Commission from 2000 to 2004;&lt;ref name="time magazine"&gt;Corliss, Richard. Crittle, Simon. "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993685,00.html "The Last Don]", ''[[Time Magazine]]'', March 29, 2004. Accessed June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; during this time he was the only full-fledged boss in New York not in prison.

In the [[Sicilian Mafia]] the position does not exist. For instance, the old-style Mafia boss [[Calogero Vizzini]] was often portrayed in the media as the "boss of bosses" – although such a position does not exist according to later Mafia ''[[Pentito|pentiti]]'', such as [[Tommaso Buscetta]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlacchi, ''Addio Cosa nostra'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; They also denied Vizzini ever was the ruling boss of the Mafia in Sicily. According to Mafia historian [[Salvatore Lupo]] "the emphasis of the media on the definition of 'capo dei capi' is without any foundation".&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.narcomafie.it/2006/04/10/larresto-di-bernardo-provenzano/ Zu Binnu? Non è il superboss] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905213413/http://www.narcomafie.it/2006/04/10/larresto-di-bernardo-provenzano/ |date=2012-09-05 }}, Intervista a Salvatore Lupo di Marco Nebiolo, Narcomafie, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the title has frequently been given to powerful Mafia bosses to this day. During the 1980s and 1990s the bosses of the [[Corleonesi]] clan [[Salvatore Riina]] and [[Bernardo Provenzano]] were bestowed with the title by the media.

In April 2006, the Italian government arrested Bernardo Provenzano in a small farmhouse near the town of [[Corleone]]. His successor is reported to be either [[Matteo Messina Denaro]] or [[Salvatore Lo Piccolo]]. This presupposes that Provenzano has the power to nominate a successor, which is not unanimously accepted among Mafia observers. "The Mafia today is more of a federation and less of an authoritarian state", according to anti-Mafia prosecutor Antonio Ingroia of the [[Direzione distrettuale antimafia]] (DDA) of Palermo, referring to the previous period of authoritarian rule under [[Salvatore Riina]].&lt;ref name="Ingroia"&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/international/467681/the_mafia_after_provenzanopeace_or_allout_war/index.html The Mafia after Provenzano - peace or all-out war?], Reuters, April 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenzano "established a kind of directorate of about four to seven people who met very infrequently, only when necessary, when there were strategic decisions to make". According to Ingroia "in an organization like the Mafia, a boss has to be one step above the others otherwise it all falls apart. It all depends on if he can manage consensus and if the others agree or rebel." Provenzano "guaranteed a measure of stability because he had the authority to quash internal disputes".&lt;ref name="Ingroia" /&gt;

In [[Italy]] a fictional six-part television miniseries called ''[[Il Capo dei Capi]]'' relates the story of Salvatore Riina.&lt;ref name=nyt181107&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/technology/18iht-mafia19.1.8374072.html A Mafia saga keeps Italians tuned in], The New York Times, November 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Ndrangheta==
In the [['Ndrangheta]], a Mafia-type organisation in [[Calabria]], the [[capo crimine]] is the elected boss of the ''[[crimine]]'', an annual meeting of the 'Ndrangheta ''[[Locale ('Ndrangheta)|locali]]'' near the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Polsi]] in the municipality of [[San Luca]] during the September Feast.&lt;ref name=paoli59&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Far from being the "boss of bosses", the ''capo crimine'' actually has comparatively little authority to interfere in family feuds or to control the level of interfamily violence.&lt;ref name=varese&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3757/is_200606/ai_n17176956/print How Mafias Migrate: The Case of the 'Ndrangheta in Northern Italy], by Federico Varese, Law &amp; Society Review, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters in Tiwana's novels and short-stories are the downtrodden and the innocent rural folk with suppressed desires and passions. Tragedy and irony mark the main elements of her fiction. Complex inner duality of the female psyche is the chief theme of Tiwana. Besides her achievement in fiction, Tiwana has written two books on literary criticism too.

'''East Franconian''' ({{lang-de|Ostfränkisch}}), usually referred to as Franconian (''{{lang|de|Fränkisch}}'') in German, is a dialect which is spoken in [[Franconia]], the northern part of the federal state of [[Bavaria]] and other areas in [[Germany]] around [[Nuremberg]], [[Bamberg]], [[Coburg]], [[Würzburg]], [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]], [[Bayreuth]], [[Meiningen]], [[Bad Mergentheim]], and [[Crailsheim]]. The major subgroups are ''{{lang|de|Unterostfränkisch}}'' (spoken in [[Lower Franconia]] and southern [[Thuringia]]), ''{{lang|de|Oberostfränkisch}}'' (spoken in [[Upper Franconia|Upper]] and [[Middle Franconia]]) and ''{{lang|de|Südostfränkisch}}'' (spoken in some parts of [[Middle Franconia]] and [[Hohenlohe (district)|Hohenlohe]]).

[[File:Franconia details.png|thumb|250px|left|East Franconian German]]
In the transitional area between [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]] in the northwest and the [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] dialects in the southeast, East Franconian has elements of [[Central German]] and [[Upper German]]. The same goes only for [[South Franconian German]] in adjacent [[Baden-Württemberg]]. East Franconian is one of the German dialects with the highest number of speakers.

The scope of East Franconian is disputed, because it overlaps with neighbour dialects like Bavarian and [[Swabian German|Swabian]] in the south, [[Rhine Franconian]] in the west and [[Upper Saxon]] in the north.

East Franconian is researched by "Fränkisches Wörterbuch" project  in Fürth, which is run by Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften and Erlangen-Nuremberg university.

'''Full spectrum diplomacy''' is a combination of traditional, government-to-government diplomacy with the many components of [[public diplomacy]] as well as the integration of these two functions with other instruments of [[Power in international relations|statecraft]]. The term was coined by Dr. [[John Lenczowski]], the Founder and President of the [[Institute of World Politics]] in Washington, D.C. in his book ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy and Grand Strategy:  Reforming the Structure and Culture of U.S. Foreign Policy'' which was released in May, 2011.

== Origin ==
Lenczowski's book appears to be the first attempt to isolate and define the term.  In it, he references the military concept of "full spectrum operations" (or "[[full spectrum dominance]]") indicating that it inspired his derivation for diplomatic use.&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, John (2010). ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy and Grand Strategy: Reforming the Structure and Culture of U.S. Foreign Policy''. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes that the diplomatic community does not have a comparable term to full spectrum operations, "but there should be, in order to end the systematic neglect of some dimensions of the larger art of diplomacy."&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a chapter of the ''Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy'', Matthew Armstrong provides a historical perspective on the use of full spectrum diplomatic action:

{{cquote|In 1948, George Kennan developed a plan for “organized political warfare” to counter the Soviet Union’s growing power and influence. To be effective, it required the United States to employ all means possible to achieve its national objective, including overt activities such as political alliances, economic measures, and “white” propaganda, to covert operations such as clandestine support of foreign elements, “black” psychological warfare, to encouraging underground resistance movements in hostile states.

This was not the “diplomacy in public” we know today, but a full-spectrum “diplomacy with publics” that engaged people at all levels and with all means available. Seven years later, Nelson Rockefeller recognized the struggle as “shifting more than ever from the arena of power to the arena of ideas and international persuasion.” A then-young Henry Kissinger, stressing the importance of the people, noted the “predominant aspect of the new diplomacy is its psychological dimension.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Matthew "Operationalizing Public Diplomacy" |title=Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|pages=65–66|editor=Snow, Nancy and Philip M. Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Components ==
[[File:US Navy 060227-N-1194D-009 Seventh Fleet band member Musician 1st Class Frank Newton demonstrates how his saxophone keys operate to Aurora Sribuapun, headmaster of the Pattaya Redemptorist School for the Blind.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Members of the Seventh Fleet band engaging in cultural diplomacy at the Pattaya Redemptorist School for the Blind]]

Full spectrum diplomacy is an integrated strategy that encompasses all instruments of engagement including traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy.  Of particular note is advocacy for the use of [[cultural diplomacy]] to enhance contact with people at the grassroots level.

To increase the role of public diplomacy, Lenczowski advocates the foundation of a U.S. Public Diplomacy Agency.  This would not only take the place of the former [[USIA|United States Information Agency (USIA)]], but would expand to coordinate all aspects of the public diplomacy instrument.  Dr. [[Juliana Pilon]] advocates a similar organization in her book ''Why America is Such a Hard Sell'' in which she promotes an "American Global Outreach and Research Agency."  Her idea culminates in a system that links the instruments of public diplomacy throughout the whole of government.&lt;ref&gt;Pilon, Juliana G. (2007). ''Why America is Such a Hard Sell:  Beyond Pride and Prejudice''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet another proposal is that of Professor Carnes Lord of the [[Naval War College]] writing for the creation of a "Policy Coordinating Committee on Foreign Information, Assistance, and Democracy Promotion" that would serve to integrate the leadership of the many organizations involved in public diplomacy to other agencies of strategic influence.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes (2006). ''Losing Hearts and Minds? Public Diplomacy and Strategic Influence in the Age of Terror''. Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenczowski provides further explanation of the construct here:

{{cquote|Thus, a full realization of the possibilities of public diplomacy must take into account the necessity of its proper integration with other arts of statecraft where, for example, military strategy incorporates public diplomacy into its calculations (e.g., in behavior toward foreign populations, the treatment of prisoners, etc.), or where the need to exert political influence requires the collection of “opportunities intelligence” on targets of potential political influence, or the use of offensive political counterintelligence operations. It is the entire range of these public diplomatic instruments combined with traditional diplomacy, and finally integrated with the other arts of statecraft that comprise what is missing in U.S. foreign policy: full spectrum diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Orchestra analogy ==
[[File:MITO Orchestra Sinfonica RAI.jpg|right|250px|MITO Orchestra Sinfonica RAI]]
In support of the concept of full spectrum diplomacy, Lenczowski writes that "the achievement of foreign policy goals requires a multiplicity of means that can be likened to instruments in an orchestra."&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy'', 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he states that "the conduct of full spectrum diplomacy thus involves the proper orchestration of both traditional and public diplomacy in such a fashion that the policies governing each function do not jeopardize the effectiveness of the other."&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy'', xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

This collected orchestration becomes a part of what Lenczowski calls an “integrated strategy” defined by "a concept that requires the coordination of all the instruments of statecraft, including military policy, intelligence, counterintelligence, economic policy, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy'', xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous use of this musical ensemble analogy for an instrument of statecraft is found in a [[World War II]] Soviet anti-Nazi espionage element commonly known as the [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]].

== Purpose ==
The purpose of full spectrum diplomacy is to promote what Lenczowski calls an "influence culture."&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy'', 115-135.&lt;/ref&gt;  This environment includes a more versatile diplomatic corps to accompany an increased focus on public diplomacy. It is a comprehensive approach that will employ many of the elements of what Harvard professor [[Joseph Nye]] calls [[soft power]] and what a number of scholars and government officials refer to as [[smart power]].  The influence culture and resulting integrated strategy of the "orchestra" allow for a broader international approach.  In lieu of too quickly resorting to [[hard power]] such as military action, the engagement of full spectrum diplomacy provides for a variety of possible non-military actions that could pre-empt the need for armed conflict.

Scholars have been calling for this approach to American grand strategy for years.  [[Paul Kennedy]] writes that the U.S. "needs to integrate its political, economic, and military aims in a coherent fashion, for years of peace as well as the possibility of war."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul (1991). ''Grand Strategies in War and Peace''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, x.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Soft Power'', Joseph Nye asserts that "America's success will depend upon our developing a deeper understanding of the role of soft power and developing a better balance of hard and soft power in our foreign policy.".&lt;ref&gt;Nye, Joseph (2004). ''Soft Power:  The Means to Success in World Politics''. New York: PublicAffairs, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting "smart power" provides a distinct tie-in to the idea of full spectrum diplomacy.  Finally, Professor [[Colin S. Gray]] calls for a "fully functioning 'strategy bridge' that binds together, adaptably, the realms of policy and military behavior.".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Colin S. (2009). ''After Iraq:  The Search for a Sustainable National Security Strategy''. Carlisle, PA: Strategic Studies Institute, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of the concept in academia and journalism ==
Though a relatively new term in the lexicon of statecraft, full spectrum diplomacy is already found in reference to contemporary events.  In a February 28, 2011 commentary piece from the ''U.N. Dispatch'', Mark Leon Goldberg references the term in the title: "The Obama Administration’s Full Spectrum Diplomacy on Libya."  In defense of the Obama Administration's strategy in the North African nation, he writes that: "After the unanimous passage of a strong Security Council resolution on Libya on Saturday, there appears to be a full spectrum diplomatic push led by the Obama administration to make sure that the provisions called for in the resolution are swiftly and effectively imposed."&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Mark (February 28), The Obama Administration’s Full Spectrum Diplomacy on Libya, http://www.undispatch.com/the-obama-administrations-full-specturm-diplomacy-on-libya, Retrieved March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other references, which occur prior to Lenczowski's initial use of the term, utilize similar terminology or imply the same conceptual framework.

In March 2009 Congressional testimony, [[George Moose]], former [[Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs|U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs]], urged the development of a larger and more versatile diplomatic corps:

{{cquote|...the first and most urgent step required to restore balance in the conduct of our foreign policy is the rebuilding of the capacities of our civilian foreign affairs agencies. We can no longer pretend that State and USAID can responsibly assume the burgeoning list of diplomatic tasks central to protecting and advancing America's global interests without substantial increases in staff. This is true across the full spectrum of diplomatic activity, but it is especially true with respect to our response to situations of conflict and the threats they to our national security interests.&lt;ref&gt;Moose, George (March). [http://www.usip.org/publications/role-civilian-and-military-agencies-advancement-americas-diplomatic-and-development-object The Role of Civilian and Military Agencies in the Advancement of America's Diplomatic and Development Objectives (Congressional Testimony)]. Retrieved March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a July 2006 article promoting 'full spectrum analysis' at the strategic level, Adrian Wolfberg,  the director of the Knowledge Laboratory at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], wrote that "the warfighter now operates along many lines at once and across a full spectrum of possible actions, either diplomatic, intelligence-driven, military, or economic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfberg, Adrian (July–August 2006).

For example, the [[United States House of Representatives]] had two bills in June 2018 about immigration to consider: the hard-line and centrist options.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/21/conservative-immigration-bill-fails-in-house-gop-leaders-delay-vote-on-compromise-measure.html&lt;/ref&gt; The House failed to pass the centrist bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/reversing-course-last-minute-trump-calls-house-gop-pass-immigration-n886916|title=House overwhelmingly rejects compromise immigration bill despite Trump support|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House did not vote on the more extreme bill.

== Words Implying Hard-Line Stances ==

=== Hawk ===
A [[War hawk|hawk]] is someone who prefers an extreme or aggressive stance, typically on [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hawk|title=Definition of HAWK|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to war, a hawk is always in favor of war. The opposite is a [[Dove of peace|dove]], who prefers peace. However, the term hawk can also be used for other issues, like the [[Deficit spending|deficit]]. [[John McCain]], the American [[United States Senate|senator]] and [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential nominee]] was a [war] hawk because of his policies on the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/john-mccain-hero-home-hawk-middle-east-180826065142381.html|title=John McCain: Hero at home, hawk in Middle East|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A current example of a hawk is [[John R.

'''"Heaven"''' is a song recorded by [[Romanians|Romanian]] recording artist [[Inna]]. It was released for [[Music download|digital download]] on 10 June 2016 through [[Roton (label)|Roton]]. The recording was written by [[Axident|Andreas Schuller]], Leroy Clampitt, [[Play &amp; Win|Sebastian Barac]], [[Play &amp; Win|Marcel Botezan]], Laila Samulesen, Trey Campbell and Theea Eliza Miculescu, while production was handled by Barac and Botezan. A [[dance-pop]] and [[tropical house]] recording, the single was generally acclaimed by [[music journalism|music critics]], who praised it as an [[earworm]] with Middle Eastern influences. While reviews noted lyrics in English, French, and Spanish, the singer explained that the refrain was written in a language she invented with her label. At the 2017 [[RRA Awards 2011|Radio România Actualități Awards]], "Heaven" was nominated in three categories.

An accompanying music video was posted onto [[YouTube]] on 7 June 2016 after a teaser premiered on 3 June 2016; it was shot by John Perez in Shangri-La, [[Mauritius]], in April 2016. The clip portrays Inna at a seaside resort community with a love interest, played by Mauritian actor Olivier Phineas Boissard. To promote the single, Inna performed in Mauritius, and sang "Heaven" in stripped-down versions for Romanian radio stations. The track was commercially successful in Eastern Europe, peaking within the top ten in Bulgaria, Romania and Poland.

Several remixes of the track were also made available for consumption as stand-alone releases or on a remix extended play.&lt;ref name="remix1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="remix2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="remix3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="remix4"/&gt; About the track, Inna said that she was "very happy to release 'Heaven'.

So we thought to create an own language. If the ones from ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' can do it, then why can't we do it as well?"&lt;ref name="Kiss FM language"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kissfm.ro/article/8061/Inna-despre-Heaven-Refrenul-e-ntro-limb-inventat-de-noi-cei-de-la-Global-Records-|title=Inna, despre "Heaven": "Refrenul e într-o limbă inventată de noi, cei de la Global Records"|trans-title=Inna on "Heaven"; "The refrain is written in a language created by use, the ones from Global Records"|language=Romanian|accessdate=24 November 2016|date=21 June 2016|publisher=[[Kiss FM (Romania)|Kiss FM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''People Magazine'' called the track a "catchy" [[tropical house]] song that "effortlessly blends together" tropical sounds with a Middle Eastern flair, along with "simple and cheesy" lyrics.&lt;ref name="people magazine"/&gt; Jonathan Currinn from ''Outlet Magazine'' labelled "Heaven" an "exotic anthem",&lt;ref name="jonni"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Currinn|title=Inna captures the essence of summer in new song and video "Heaven"|url=http://outletmag.co/inna-captures-the-essence-of-summer-in-new-song-and-video-heaven/|accessdate=1 July 2016|publisher=''Outlet Magazine''|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Urban.ro called it a [[dance-pop]] song with exotic elements.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.urban.ro/muzica/videoclipuri/inna--heaven-videoclip-nou|title=Inna – Heaven (videoclip nou)|accessdate=1 July 2016|publisher=Urban.ro|date=7 June 2016|trans-title=Inna – Heaven (new video)|language=Romanian|author=Scris de Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio 21 noted that the track seemed to be influenced by Arabic rhythms.&lt;ref name="radio21"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inna lanseaza o piesa de vara – "Heaven"|url=http://www.radio21.ro/inna-lanseaza-o-piesa-de-vara-heaven-videoclip/|accessdate=1 July 2016|publisher=Radio 21|date=7 June 2016|trans-title=Inna releases a summer song – "Heaven"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release, the recording was met with mostly positive reviews. ''People Magazine'' praised the song's production, calling it "the perfect track to play at the pool or a beach holiday" and "something different from anything on radio at the moment".

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}
In [[professional wrestling]], a '''heel''' (also known as a ''rudo'' in ''[[lucha libre]]'') is a wrestler who portrays a [[villain]] or a "bad guy" and acts as an [[antagonist]]&lt;ref name=torchterms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|title=Torch Glossary of Insider Terms |publisher=[[PWTorch.com]] |accessdate=2007-07-10|year=2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606073745/http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|archivedate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Steel Chair to the Head|last=Sammond|first=Nicholas|page=264|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8223-3438-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]], who are the [[hero]]ic [[protagonist]] or "good guy" characters. 

To gain [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] (with boos and jeers from the audience), heels are often portrayed as behaving in an immoral manner by breaking rules or otherwise taking advantage of their opponents outside the bounds of the standards of the match. Others do not (or rarely) break rules, but instead exhibit unlikeable, appalling and deliberately offensive and demoralizing personality traits such as arrogance, cowardice or contempt for the audience. Many heels do both, cheating as well as behaving nastily. No matter the type of heel, the most important job is that of the antagonist role, as heels exist to provide a foil to the face wrestlers. If a given heel is cheered over the face, a promoter may opt to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that heel to face or the other way around, or to make the wrestler do something even more despicable to encourage heel heat.

In American wrestling it was common for the faces to be American (e.g. [[Hulk Hogan]]) and the heels to be portrayed as foreign (e.g. [[Alberto El Patrón]], [[Ivan Koloff]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Rusev (wrestler)|Rusev]], [[Jinder Mahal]] and [[Muhammad Hassan (wrestler)|Muhammad Hassan]]).

In the world of ''lucha libre'' wrestling, heels are generally known for being brawlers and for using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size, often having outfits akin to [[demon]]s, [[devil]]s, or other [[trickster]]s. This is contrasted with the heroic ''técnicos'' that are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial maneuvers]].

== History ==
Common heel behavior includes cheating to win (e.g. using the ropes for leverage while [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] or attacking with [[Glossary of professional wrestling#Foreign object|foreign objects]] while the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] is looking away), employing [[Professional wrestling attacks#Illegal attacks|dirty tactics]] such as [[Chokes|blatant chokes]] or [[Professional wrestling attacks#Eye rake|raking the eyes]], attacking other wrestlers backstage, interfering with other wrestlers' matches, insulting the fans or city they are in (referred to as "[[Heat (professional wrestling)#Cheap heat|cheap heat]]") and acting in a haughty or superior manner.&lt;ref name=mf117&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 117).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gorgeous George robe.jpg|thumb|With his flamboyant gimmick, [[Gorgeous George]] became one of the most famous wrestlers of his era]]
More theatrical heels would feature dramatic outfits giving off a nasty or otherwise dangerous look, such as wearing [[corpse paint]] over their faces, putting on demonic masks, covering themselves in dark leather and the like. [[Gorgeous George]] is regarded as the father of the wrestling gimmick and by extension the heel gimmick. Starting in the 1940s, he invented an extravagant, flamboyant "pretty boy" gimmick who wore wavy blonde hair, colorful robes and ritzy outfits and was accompanied by beautiful valets to the ring for his matches. The crowd widely jeered his persona and came out to his matches in hopes of seeing him defeated. He in turn relished in it and exploded in to the one of the most famous (and hated) heels not only of his era, but of all time. Another example of a dramatic looking heel is the wrestler [[The Undertaker]] (in his heel roles). During his period in [[The Ministry of Darkness]], he undertook performances where he would appear as a priest of the [[Occultism|occult]] in a hooded black robe and sit on a devilish throne.

Occasionally, faces who have recently turned from being heels still exhibit characteristics from their heel persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/03/15/382634.html|title='WWE WrestleMania XX' Results|last=Powell|first=John|accessdate=2008-03-15|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs due to fans being entertained by a wrestler despite (or because of) their heel persona, often due to the performer's charisma or charm in playing the role. Certain wrestlers such as [[Eddie Guerrero]] and [[Ric Flair]] gained popularity as faces by using tactics that would typically be associated with heels, while others like [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], and [[Scott Hall]] displayed heelish behavior through most of their careers yet got big face reactions, leading them to be marketed as [[Antihero]]es.

On other occasions, wrestlers who are positioned as faces receive a negative audience reaction despite their portrayal as heroes. An example is [[Roman Reigns]], who in 2018 is a top face in [[WWE]], but gets booed in his matches while his opponents gets cheered regardless of them being face or heel, due to [[Persona and reception of Roman Reigns|perceived favoritism from WWE bookers and executive and a lack of character development]]. Such characters often (but not always) become nudged into becoming villains over time or retooled to present a different public image, such as [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]'s heel turn from a clean-cut face to self-absorbed narcissist in the heel [[Nation of Domination]] stable. The term heel does not describe a typical set of attributes or audience reaction by itself, but simply a wrestler's presentation and booking as an antagonist. 

Depending on the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], a heel can act cowardly or overpowering to their opponents. For instance, a "closet champion" in particular is a term for a heel in possession of a title belt who consistently dodges top flight competition and attempts to back down from challenges. One of many examples is [[Seth Rollins]] during his first [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] run, [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] during her [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas]]/[[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Championship]] reign, [[the Honky Tonk Man]] during his long [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] reign, and [[Tommaso Ciampa]] during his [[NXT Championship]] reign. This helps to affirm the intended [[kayfabe]] reactions that the face(s) that said heel is feuding with is/are more deserving of the title. Heels may in fact beg for mercy during a beat down at the hands of faces, even if they have delivered similar beat downs with no mercy, with Ric Flair in particular being well known for this. Other heels may act overpowering to their opponents as to play up the scrappy [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] success story for the face instead. [[Brock Lesnar]] has played heel in both capacities, but has become quite famous (either as a heel or a face) as an [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#monster|almost-unstoppable machine]] who can take down anything in his path.

'''Jakub Bart-Ćišinski''' (20 August 1856 in [[Panschwitz-Kuckau|Kuckau]] – 16 October 1909 in [[Panschwitz-Kuckau|Panschwitz]]), also known as '''Łužičan''', '''Jakub Bart Kukowski''', was [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] poet, writer and playwright, translator of [[Czech literature|Czech]], [[Polish literature|Polish]], [[Italian literature|Italian]] and [[German literature]]. He produced his works in [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]. He is also an inventor of modern Upper Sorbian poetic language. He has been described as "the classical writer of Sorbian literature."&lt;ref&gt;p. 1. Hose, Susanne. 2004. ''Sorbian proverbs: Serbske prislowa''. (Supplement series of [[Proverbium]]: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship, 14.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Sorbian writer, he felt that writing the Sorbian language and using it for literature and for education would be important for preserving the vitality and distinctiveness of Sorbian culture. But he also realized that it was a double-edged sword, in that education would reduce the isolation of Sorbian culture, making it more vulnerable to outside (mostly German) influence.&lt;ref&gt;p. 1. Hose, Susanne. 2004. ''Sorbian proverbs: Serbske prislowa''. (Supplement series of [[Proverbium]]: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship, 14.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Francis Ross''' (October 9, 1931 – July 12, 2010) was an [[American philosopher]]. James Ross, a creative thinker in philosophy of religion, law, metaphysics and philosophy of mind, was a member of the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1962 until his death.  He published widely.

==Biography==
James Ross was born October 9, 1931, in Providence, Rhode Island, and died in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 12, 2010. He was son of the James Joseph and Teresa (Sullivan) Ross.  His father was a pharmacist and his mother a school teacher. In 1956 he married Kathleen Fallon, a nurse from Providence, who died on May 23, 2010.

He received his A.B. (1953) and A.M. (1954) from [[Catholic University of America]], Ph.D. (1958) from [[Brown University]], and J.D. (1974) from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1975. James Ross began his academic career in the Philosophy Department at the University of Michigan initially as an instructor (1959–61) and then as an Assistant Professor (1961–62).  In 1962 he joined the University of Pennsylvania and remained there until his death, as an assistant professor from 1962 to 1965, an associate professor from 1965 to 1968, and from 1968 onwards as a full professor. He held a number of visiting appointments including Visiting Lecturer Johns Hopkins (1964–65), the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) during the 1975–6 academic year, and Darwin College Cambridge University from September 1982 through December 1983. His research at the Institute for Advanced Study was supported by an NEH grant to the Institute,.&lt;ref&gt;Grant number: FC10503.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also led a 1977 NEH Summer Seminar at Brown University, titled  Faith, Meaning and Religious Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Grant FA-26537-77-163 to Brown University&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984 to 1986 he was the president of the [[Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smrphil.org/society.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113525/http://www.smrphil.org/society.html |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He researched, taught, and wrote in the fields of medieval philosophy, philosophy of language, law, and religion. In a career that spanned more than five decades, he produced more than 100 articles, a number of translations, and four books.  In the last book published before he died,  ''Thought and World'' (2008) he argues that meaning, truth, impossibility, natural necessity, and our intelligent perception of nature fit together into a distinctly realist account of thought and world.  He articulates a moderate realism about repeatable natural structures and our abstractive ability to discern them that poses a challenge to many of the common assumptions and claims of contemporary analytic philosophy. He develops a broadly Aristotelian metaphysics that recognizes the "hidden necessities" of things, which are disclosed through the sciences.

James Ross' scholarly examination of Analogy began with his doctoral thesis at Brown University (1958), led to such seminal articles as "Analogy as a Rule of Meaning for Religious Language" (1961) and "Analogy and the Resolution of Some Cognitivity Problems" (1970), and eventually to a monograph, ''Portraying Analogy'' (1981), which was the first fundamental examination of the topic since Cajetan ([[Thomas Cajetan]]) in 1498.

==Biography==
Abriol was ordained to the [[priesthood]] on May 14, 1942.  He translated the [[Holy Bible]] from the original [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].

He was fluent in nine languages, namely [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin language|Latin]], Greek, Hebrew, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]],&lt;ref name="ManilaStandard"&gt;Macairan, Evelyn Z.

He translated the Holy Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek while serving as rector of the [[Cathedral of Manila]], a period encompassing ten years of his life.  From 1953 to 1963, he allotted five hours a day for this task.&lt;ref name=MCathedral/&gt;&lt;ref name=MC2/&gt;&lt;ref name=RCam2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ManilaStandard/&gt; Among the 69 to 70 books he authored – excluding his other translation works – were lives of saints, prayers to the [[Virgin Mary]], Sunday [[missals]], the ''[[Via Crucis]]'' (or [[Way of the Cross]]), and the ''Siete Palabras'' (Spanish for the [[Seven Last Words]] of Christ).&lt;ref name="RCam2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ManilaStandard" /&gt; Before the year 2000, he was also able to finish his translation of [[Pope John Paul II]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (''[[Faith and Reason]]''), which became ''Pananampalataya at Katwiran'' in Tagalog.&lt;ref name=RCam2/&gt;

==As a priest==
Apart from being rector of the Manila Cathedral and chancellor for the Archdiocese of Manila from 1962 to 1975, Abriol served as parish priest for the parishes of St. Michael the Archangel at [[Jala-Jala, Rizal]] (1947–1951), of San Rafael, Balut, [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] in [[Manila]] (1951–1962), and of the Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene at [[Quiapo, Manila]] (1976–1993).

He died of [[cardiac arrest]] at the Cardinal Santos Memorial Hospital on July 6, 2003.&lt;ref name=RCam2/&gt;  His wake was held at the ''Arzobispado de Manila'' (the Archbishopric of Manila) inside [[Intramuros]], while the interment was held on July 10, 2003 at the Manila Cathedral, with Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]] as the main celebrant of the Mass.&lt;ref name=RCam2/&gt;  Abriol was the friend and confessor of Cardinal Sin.&lt;ref name=ManilaStandard/&gt;

'''Katharevousa''' ({{lang-el|Καθαρεύουσα}}, {{IPA-el|kaθaˈrevusa|pron}}, literally "purifying [language]") is a conservative form of the [[Modern Greek|Modern Greek language]] conceived in the late 18th century as a compromise between [[Ancient Greek]] and the [[Demotic Greek]] of the time. Originally, it was widely used both for literary and official purposes, though seldom in daily language. In the 20th century, it was increasingly adopted for official and formal purposes, until minister of education [[Georgios Rallis]] made Demotic Greek the official language of Greece in 1976, and later in 1982 Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] abolished the [[Greek diacritics|polytonic]] system of writing both for Demotic and Katharevousa.

Katharevousa was conceived by the intellectual and revolutionary leader [[Adamantios Korais]] (1748–1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Language as a Factor of National Identity in the Balkans of the Nineteenth Century |author=Stavro Skendi |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=119 |issue=2 |date=April 1975 |pages=186–189 |jstor=986634}}&lt;/ref&gt; A graduate of the [[University of Montpellier]], Korais spent most of his life as an [[expatriate]] in Paris. Being a [[Classics|classical scholar]], he was repelled by the [[Byzantine]] and later influence on Greek society and was a fierce critic of the clergy and their alleged subservience to the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://invenio.lib.auth.gr/record/56228/files/arc-2006-23343.pdf Adamantios Korais, Αδελφική Διδασκαλία, pages 3sq.]&lt;/ref&gt; He held that education was a prerequisite to [[Greek War of Independence|Greek liberation]].

Part of Katharevousa's purpose was to mediate the struggle between the "archaists" favouring full reversion to archaic forms and the "modernists".

==History==
{{See also|Greek language question}}
The first known use of the term ''katharevousa'' is in a work by the Greek polymath [[Nikephoros Theotokis]], in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onassis.gr/enim_deltio/foreign/01/story_05.php The Phenomenon of Diglossia: Language and National Identity], interview with [[Peter Mackridge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Katharevousa was widely used in public documents and whatever was conceived as work of formal activity by Greek scholars. The name ''Katharevousa''  implies a pure form of Greek as it might hypothetically have  evolved from ancient Greek without external influences, while in its modern  connotation the word  has come to mean "formal language".

In later years, Katharevousa was used for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting), while Demotic Greek (δημοτική, ''dimotiki'') or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a [[diglossia|diglossic situation]] whereby most of the Greek population was excluded from the public sphere and advancement in education unless they conformed to Katharevousa. In 1976, Demotic was made the official language, and in 1982 [[Andreas Papandreou]] abolished the polytonic system of writing; by the end of the 20th century full Katharevousa in its earlier form had become obsolete. Much of the vocabulary of Katharevousa and its grammatical and syntactical rules have influenced the Demotic language, so that the project's emphasis has made an observable contribution to the language as it is used today. [[Modern Greek]] might be argued to be a combination of the original Demotic and the traditional Katharevousa as stressed in the 19th century, also with institutional input from [[Koine Greek]]. Amongst Katharevousa's later contributions is the promotion of classically based compounds to describe items and concepts that did not exist in earlier times, such as "newspaper", "police", "automobile", "aeroplane", "television" and many others, rather than borrowing new words directly from other languages.

==Present-day use==
The [[Church of Greece]] and other churches of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] tradition still use Katharevousa in official communications.&lt;ref&gt;Argyropoulou, Christina (2015): Γλώσσα και εξουσία μέσα από ποικίλα κείμενα στην καθαρεύουσα και τη δημοτική μορφή της ελληνικής γλώσσας. ''Έρκυνα: Επιθεώρηση Εκπαιδευτικών'' 7: 52–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text sample==
This is a text sample of Katharevousa from the ''[[Great Greek Encyclopedia]]'', published in 1930. The text has to do with [[Adamantios Korais]]'s relations with the [[Greek Church]]. It is rendered in Demotic and translated into English.

*'''Katharevousa:''' Ἡ δ' ἀπὸ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἀποδημία του ἐγένετο πρόξενος πολλῶν ἀδίκων κρίσεων περὶ προσώπων καὶ πραγμάτων καὶ πρῶτα πρῶτα τῆς περὶ ἧς ἀνωτέρω ἔγινε λόγος πρὸς τὸν κλῆρον συμπεριφορᾶς του. Ἂν ἔζη ἐν Ἑλλάδι καὶ ἤρχετο εἰς ἐπικοινωνίαν πρὸς τὸν κλῆρον καὶ ἐγνώριζεν ἐκ τοῦ πλησίον ὄχι μόνον τὰς κακίας, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς ἀρετὰς αὐτοῦ, ὄχι μόνον πολὺ θὰ συνετέλει εἰς διόρθωσίν τινων ἐκ τῶν κακῶν ἐν τῇ Ἐκκλησίᾳ ἐχόντων, ἀλλὰ καὶ δὲν θὰ ἤκουεν ὅσα ἤκουσεν ἐκ τῶν ὑπερβολικῶν κατὰ τοῦ κλήρου ἐκφράσεών του.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Greek Encyclopedia'', Vol. XIV, 1930, p. 864.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Hē d' apò tē̂s Helládos apodēmía tou egéneto próxenos pollō̂n adíkōn kríseōn perì prosṓpōn kaì pragmátōn kaì prō̂ta prō̂ta tē̂s perì hē̂s anōtérō égine lógos pròs tòn klē̂ron symperiphorâs tou. Àn ézē en Helládi kaì ḗrcheto eis epikoinōnían pròs tòn klē̂ron kaì egnṓrizen ek toû plēsíon óchi mónon tàs kakías, allà kaì tàs aretàs autoû, óchi mónon polỳ thà synetélei eis diórthōsín tinōn ek tō̂n kakō̂n en tē̂i Ekklēsíāi echóntōn, allà kaì dèn thà ḗkouen hósa ḗkousen ek tō̂n hyperbolikō̂n katà toû klḗrou ekphráseṓn tou.''

*'''Standard Modern Greek:''' Η αποδημία του από την Ελλάδα έγινε πρόξενος πολλών άδικων κρίσεων για πρόσωπα και πράγματα και πρώτα πρώτα, για την οποία έγινε λόγος παραπάνω, της συμπεριφοράς του προς τον κλήρο. Αν ζούσε στην Ελλάδα και ερχόταν σε επικοινωνία με τον κλήρο και γνώριζε από κοντά όχι μόνο τις κακίες, αλλά και τις αρετές αυτού, όχι μόνο θα συντελούσε πολύ στη διόρθωση μερικών από τα κακά που υπάρχουν στην Εκκλησία, αλλά και δεν θα άκουγε όσα άκουσε εξαιτίας των υπερβολικών εκφράσεών του εναντίον του κλήρου.

:''Ē apodēmía tou apó tēn Elláda égine próxenos pollṓn ádikōn kríseōn gia prósōpa kai prágmata kai prṓta prṓta, gia tēn opoía égine lógos parapánō, tēs symperiphorás tou pros ton klḗro. An zoúse stēn Elláda kai erchótan se epikoinōnía me ton klḗro kai gnṓrize apó kontá óchi móno tis kakíes, allá kai tis aretés autoú, óchi móno tha synteloúse polý stē diórthōsē merikṓn apó ta kaká pou ypárchoun stēn Ekklēsía, allá kai den tha ákouge ósa ákouse exaitías tōn yperbolikṓn ekphráseṓn tou enantíon tou klḗrou.''

*'''English:''' His expatriation from Greece was a cause for many unjust judgements about situations and people and mainly for his behaviour towards the clergy, which was discussed above. If he had lived in Greece and been in contact with the clergy and known closely not only its turpitude but also its virtues, not only would he have contributed greatly to correcting some of the problems within the Church, but also would not have listened to all that he listened to due to his exaggerated sentiments against the clergy.

Later in his life he acquired Japanese citizenship. Due to early influence from his [[Marxist-Leninist]] father, he studied at the [[Chongryon]]-affiliated elementary school and middle school. Afterwards his father switched his affiliation for [[Mindan]], he instead studied at Hozen High School (保善高等学校) in Tokyo Shibuya. He graduated in Law at [[Keio University]]. With the strong confusions with Chongryon, Mindan, and Japanese politics he wanted to promote an alternative "Korean-Japanese" (コリアン・ジャパニーズ) identity to overcome social obstacles, but later he abandoned this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Su-gyeong | last=Kim | script-title=ko:가네시로 가즈키 소설의 매력 |trans-title=The Beauty of Novels by Kaneshiro Kazuki | date=2006-09-01 | url =http://www.cine21.com/Article/article_view.php?mm=003003001&amp;article_id=40977 | work =CINE21.com | pages =2 | accessdate = 2010-04-12 | language = Korean | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120716181232/http://www.cine21.com/do/article/article/typeDispatcher?mag_id=40977 | archivedate = 2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Kutang is spoken in Dyang, Rana, Bihi, Ghap, Chak, Kwak, and Krak villages of [[Bihi]] VDC, [[Gorkha District]], [[Gandaki Zone]], Nepal (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

==Dialects==
There are three Kutang dialects, Bihi, Chak, and Rana, which have limited intelligibility. The varieties spoken in Chhak and Kwak villages are reportedly similar to each other, and different from the varieties spoken in all of the other villages.

'''Laha''' (Chinese: 拉哈, Vietnamese: La Ha) is a [[Kra language]] spoken by approximately 1,400 people out of a total population of 5,686 [[Laha people|Laha]]. It is spoken in [[Lào Cai Province|Lào Cai]] and [[Sơn La Province|Sơn La]] provinces, Vietnam. Laha dialects had been documented in 1986 by Russian linguists and in 1996 by American linguist [[Jerold A. Edmondson]]. Many Laha can also converse in the [[Khmu language]], and Laha-speaking areas also have significant Black Thai ([[Tai Dam people|Tai Dam]]), [[Khang people|Kháng]], Ksongmul ([[Ksingmul language|Ksingmul]], Xinh-mun), and Hmong populations.

Ostapirat (2000) considers the Laha dialects to form a subgroup of their own (Southern Kra) within the Kra branch.&lt;ref name="Ostapirat"&gt;Ostapirat, Weera (2000). "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/weera2000proto.pdf Proto-Kra]". ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'' '''23''' (1): 1-251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Gregerson &amp; Edmondson (1997) and Wardlaw (2000) report the following locations of two Laha dialects, namely the Wet Laha and Dry Laha dialects.

'''Wet Laha''' ('''Laha Ung''', ''{{IPA|la˧ha˨˩ ʔuŋ˧˩}}'') of [[Lào Cai Province|Lào Cai]] and [[Lai Châu Province|Lai Châu]]
*Tà Mít Commune, [[Tân Uyên, Lai Châu Province|Tân Uyên]], Lai Châu, Vietnam (just north of the [[Black River (Vietnam)|Black River]]) &amp;mdash; known as the "Wet Laha". Edmondson's informant is from Bản Muot Village, Tà Mít Commune (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 1997). There are 8 Laha villages numbering no more than 1,000 people in [[Than Uyên District]], Lai Châu, Vietnam.

The official '''language of Nicaragua''' is [[Spanish Language|Spanish]]; however, [[Nicaragua]]ns on the Caribbean coast speak indigenous languages and also [[English language|English]]. The communities located on the Caribbean coast also have access to education in their native languages. Additionally, Nicaragua has four extinct indigenous languages.

==Languages==
{{Table of languages spoken in Nicaragua}}

===Spanish===
{{main|Spanish language|Central American Spanish|Nicaraguan Spanish}}

[[Spanish language|Spanish]], or Nicañol as Nicaraguan Spanish is sometimes referred to, is spoken by 90% of the country's population. In Nicaragua the [[Voseo]] form is common, just as in other countries in Central and South America such as [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Costa Rica]], coastal parts of [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]] or [[Paraguay]]. Spanish has many different dialects spoken throughout Latin America, [[Central American Spanish]] is the dialect spoken in Nicaragua.

;Phonetics and phonology

Some characteristics of Nicaraguan phonology include:
* /s/ at the end of a syllable or before a consonant is pronounced like [h].
* ''j'' (/x/), is aspirated; it is soft as the /h/ in English (e.g.: Yahoo).
* There is no confusion between /l/ and /r/, as in the Caribbean.
* /s/, /z/ and in some cases /c/ (as in ''cerrar'') are pronounced as [s].

===English===

English is also spoken among Nicaraguans, [[expats]] from the United States and Canada, and widely used by the tourism sector. On the Caribbean coast, due to the African and English heritage, in places like [[Bluefields]] and on the [[Corn Islands]], the English language is spoken in the form of [[English creole]] by the majority of the population there, coexisting with indigenous languages.

==Indigenous languages==
[[File:BluefieldsSign.jpg|right|thumb|A sign in [[Bluefields]] in English (top), Spanish (middle) and Miskito (bottom).]]
Several indigenous peoples on the Caribbean coast still use their native language, the main languages being [[Miskito language]], [[Sumo language]], and [[Rama language]]. Other Indigenous languages spoken include [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]].

;Miskito
Miskito is a [[Misumalpan language]] spoken by the [[Miskito people]] in northeastern Nicaragua along the Caribbean coast, especially in the [[North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]]. The Miskito language is the most widely spoken indigenous language in Nicaragua, this is because the Miskito people also hold the highest population of Indigenous people in the country.

;Sumo
Sumo (also known as Sumu) is a Misumalpan language spoken in [[Nicaragua]] by the [[Sumo (people)|Sumo people]]. There is wide dialectal variation, and sometimes the major dialects may be listed as separate languages.

;Rama
Rama is one of the [[indigenous language]]s of the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan family]] spoken by the [[Rama (people)|Rama people]] on the island of [[Rama Cay]] and south of lake [[Bluefields]] on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. The Rama language is severely [[endangered language|endangered]]. Their language was described as "dying quickly for lack of use" as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Pim, Bedford &amp; Seemann, Berthold (1869). Dottings on the Roadside, in Panama, Nicaragua, and Mosquito. London: Chapman and Hall&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, the Rama were noted as having "all but lost their original ethnic language", and had become speakers of a form of [[English-based creole languages|English creole]] instead, [[Rama Cay Creole]] which is spoken by 8,000–9,000 people.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;Craig, Colette (1990). Review: Dictionary of the Rama Language. International Journal of American Linguistics 56.2:293-304&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language revival]] efforts began in 1980–1981 under the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] however, they were not successful.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; The fieldwork for the first dictionary of Rama was done during this time by Robin Schneider, a graduate student from the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nora Rigby |title=Dictionary of the Rama language: Rama, English, Rama-Creole, Spanish, English, Rama (Speaking with the tiger) |publisher=D. Reimer |location=Berlin |year= 1989|isbn=3-496-00459-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, only approximately 36 fluent speakers could be found among an ethnic population of 649 individuals in 1992, of whom only a few scattered individuals live outside Nicaragua. The number of speakers on Rama Cay island was only 4 in 1992, due to language shift to English that engendered [[Rama Cay Creole]].

;Nicaraguan Sign Language
[[Nicaraguan Sign Language]] has been of particular interest to [[linguist]]s as one of the few languages whose birth was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~langacq/E105/Nicaragua.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minority languages==
Nicaragua has many minority groups. Many [[ethnic group]]s in Nicaragua, such as the [[Chinese Nicaraguan]]s and [[Palestinian Nicaraguan]]s, have maintained their ancestral languages while also speaking Spanish and/or English. Minority languages include [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] among others.

==Extinct languages==
Nicaragua has a total of 4 [[extinct language]]s:

;Nahuat
[[Pipil language|Nahuat]], also known as Pipil-Nicarao, is a  dialect of the [[Nahuatl language]], belonging to the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language family]]. This language was spoken by the [[Pipil people|Pipil-Nicarao]] people, also referred to simply as the Nicaraos. Nahuat became the [[lingua franca]] during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, William Roy, The Pipil-Nicarao of Central America, Thesis or Dissertation. Ph.D., Archaeology, University of Calgary, 1981 also published as a book by Univ of Oklahoma Press (June 1989), {{ISBN|0-8061-2197-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hybrid form of Nahuat-Spanish was spoken by many Nicaraguans up until the 19th century.

;Mangue
The [[Mangue language]], also known as Chorotega, consisted of several dialects spoken in western Nicaragua by Chorotega natives. Mangue is a language closely related to the [[Chiapanec language]] spoken in Mexico, and is classified as belonging to the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Brinton, M.D., Notes on the Mangue; an extinct Dialect formerly spoken in Nicaragua, lecture before the American Philosophical Society, November 10, 1885, published by Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 23, No. 122, (Apr., 1886), pp. 238–257.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Monimbó neighborhood of the city of [[Masaya]], there are many Chorotega natives but the language that they speak is Spanish.

;Subtiaba
The [[Subtiaba language]] was an [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean language]] which was spoken on the Pacific slope of Nicaragua by the indigenous Subtiaba people (also sometimes referred to as Maribios, Hokan Xiu, or Xiu-Subtiabas). In 1925, [[Edward Sapir]] wrote an article based on scant evidence arguing for the inclusion of Subtiaba in his hypothesized [[Hokan languages]] group. Others have linked Subtiaba to the [[Jicaquean languages|Jicaque]] and [[Tol language|Tol]] languages of Honduras, but it is generally accepted that Subtiaba is an Oto-Manguean language that shares a close affinity with the [[Tlapanec language]] of Mexico. When Sapir wrote about Subtiaba in 1925, it was already very endangered or moribund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sapir, Edward   |authorlink=Edward Sapir |year=1925 |title=The Hokan affinity of Sutiaba in Nicaragua |journal=American Anthropologist |series=New Series |volume=27 |issue=3,4 |pages=402–435, 491–527 |doi=10.1525/aa.1925.27.3.02a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Matagalpa
The [[Matagalpa language]] was a Misumalpan language spoken by the indigenous [[Matagalpa people]]. In 1981, the population of the Matagalpa people was estimated at 18,000–20,000. The Matagalpa people live in the Central highlands of Nicaragua in the departments of [[Matagalpa (department)|Matagalpa]] and [[Jinotega (department)|Jinotega]]. Matagalpa became extinct in the 19th century; the eponymous people now speak Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Matagalpa | publisher= | url =http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mtn | work =Ethnologue | accessdate = 2007-09-09 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few short word lists remain. It was closely related to the [[Cacaopera language]].

'''Mewari''' is one of the major dialects of [[Rajasthani language]] of [[Indo-Aryan languages]] family. It is spoken by about five million speakers in [[Rajsamand]], [[Bhilwara]], [[Udaipur, Rajasthan|Udaipur]], and [[Chittorgarh]] districts of Rajasthan state of India. It has [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] [[word order]].

There are 31 consonants, 10 vowels, and 2 [[diphthongs]] in Mewari. [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] is prominent. [[Dental fricative]] is replaced by [[glottal stop]] at initial and medial positions. [[Inflection]] and [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] are the forms of [[word formation]]. There are two numbers—singular and plural, two genders—masculine and feminine, and three cases—simple, oblique, and vocative. [[Case marking]] is partly [[inflectional]] and partly [[postposition]]al. [[agreement (linguistics)|Concord]] is of [[nominative–accusative|nominative]] type in the [[imperfective aspect]] but [[Ergative–absolutive|ergative]] in the [[perfective aspect]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahl, KC.(1979). A Structural Grammar of Rajasthani. Chicago: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns are declined according to their endings. Pronouns are inflected for number, person, and gender. Third person is distinguished not only in gender but also in remote-proximal level. There are three tenses—present, past, and future; and four [[Grammatical mood|moods]]. Adjective are of two types—marked or unmarked. Three [[participles]] are there—present, past, and perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Gusain, Lakhan.(2006). Mewari Grammar (LW/M 431).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4690">'''Michel de Pure''', abbott, ([[Lyon]], 1620 – [[Paris]], March 1680) was chaplain and adviser to King [[Louis XIV of France]] (named as such in 1647). Author, translator, he notably wrote a manual on dancing as well as books criticizing the development of [[préciosité]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120803153442/http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/ehm/Pure/181916 Larousse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/michel-de-pure/ universalis]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also appointed [[Historiography|historiographer]] of France in 1653.

His name, more than the character, remains attached to the mockery which Nicolas Boileau covered him with. However, in his day, he was recognized for his scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;"In his time however, Michel Pure was recognized as a learned polygraph, at turn biographer, novelist, poet, playwright, historian, theorist and translator; he wrote in both French and Latin and he also knew Italian". Lise Leibacher-Ouvrard, Daniel Maher, annotated edition of ''Épigone, histoire du siècle futur (1659)''&lt;/ref&gt;

If Michel de Pure was best known for his valuable book on dance and [[ballet de cour|ballets de cour]] of his time, ''Idée des spectacles anciens et nouveaux'' (Paris, Michel Brunet, 1668), we now know, thanks to the research work of Lise Leibacher-Ouvrard and Daniel Maher, that he also was one of the first authors of [[social science fiction|science fiction novels]], ''Épigone, histoire du siècle futur'' (1659), recognized as "the first true [[Alternate history|uchrony]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13447">In mathematics, the '''Muller–Schupp theorem''' states that a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' has [[context-free language|context-free]] [[Word problem for groups|word problem]] if and only if ''G'' is [[virtually free group|virtually free]]. The theorem was proved by [[David E. Muller|David Muller]] and [[Paul Schupp]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=MS83&gt;David  E. Muller, and Paul E.

==Word problem for groups==
{{main|Word problem for groups}}

Let ''G'' be a [[finitely generated group]] with a finite [[Generating set of a group|marked generating set]] ''X'', that is a set ''X'' together with the map &lt;math&gt;\pi:X\to G&lt;/math&gt; such that the subset &lt;math&gt;\pi(X)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; generates ''G''. Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_X:=X\sqcup X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; be the group alphabet and let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_X^\ast&lt;/math&gt; be the [[free monoid]] on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_X,&lt;/math&gt; that is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_X^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all words (including the empty word) over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_X&lt;/math&gt;. 
The map &lt;math&gt;\pi: X\to G&lt;/math&gt; extends to a surjective monoid homomorphism, still denoted by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi: \Sigma_X^\ast\to G&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''word problem'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' with respect to ''X'' is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(G,X):= \{w\in \Sigma_X^\ast\mid \pi(w) =e \text{ in } G \},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e\in G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity element]] of ''G''.

That is, if ''G'' is given by a [[group presentation|presentation]] &lt;math&gt;G=\langle X\mid R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with ''X'' finite, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; consists of all words over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;X\sqcup X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; that are equal to &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; in ''G''.

==[[Virtually|Virtually free groups]]==

A group ''G'' is said to be '''virtually free''' if there exists a subgroup of finite index ''H'' in ''G'' such that ''H'' is isomorphic to a [[free group]].  If ''G'' is a finitely generated virtually free group and ''H'' is a free subgroup of finite index in ''G'' then ''H'' itself is finitely generated, so that ''H'' is free of finite rank.
The trivial group is viewed as the free group of rank 0, and thus all finite groups are virtually free.

A basic result in [[Bass–Serre theory]] says that a finitely generated group ''G'' is virtually free if and only if ''G'' splits as the fundamental group of a [[graph of groups|finite graph of finite groups]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Karrass, A. Pietrowski, and D. Solitar,  ''Finite and infinite cyclic extensions of free groups''. 
[[Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society]] '''16''' (1973), 458–466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precise statement of the Muller–Schupp theorem==

The modern formulation of the Muller–Schupp theorem is as follows:&lt;ref name=DW/&gt;

Let ''G'' be a finitely generated group with a finite marked generating set ''X''. Then ''G'' is [[virtually free group|virtually free]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; is a context-free language.

==Sketch of the proof==

The exposition in this section follows the original 1983 proof of Muller and Schupp.&lt;ref name=MS83/&gt;

Suppose ''G'' is a [[finitely generated group]] with a finite generating set ''X'' such that the word problem &lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-free language]]. One first observes that for every finitely generated [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G''  is [[finitely presented group|finitely presentable]] and that for every finite marked generating set ''Y'' of ''H'' the word problem &lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(H,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is also context-free.  In particular, for a finitely generated group the property of having context word problem does not depend on the choice of a finite marked generating set for the group, and such a group is finitely presentable.

Muller and Schupp then show, using the [[context-free grammar]] for the language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(G,X)&lt;/math&gt;, that the [[Cayley graph]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' with respect to ''X'' is ''K-triangulable'' for some integer ''K''&gt;0. This means that every closed path in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; can be, by adding several ``diagonals", decomposed into triangles in such a way that the label of every triangle is a relation in ''G'' of length at most ''K'' over ''X''.

They then use this triangulability property of the Cayley graph to show that either ''G'' is a finite group, or ''G'' has more than one end. Hence, by [[Stallings theorem about ends of groups|a theorem of Stallings]], either ''G'' is finite or ''G'' splits nontrivially as an amalgamated free product &lt;math&gt;G=A\ast_C B&lt;/math&gt; or an HNN-extension &lt;math&gt;G=A\ast_C&lt;/math&gt; where ''C'' is a finite group. Then &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are again finitely generated groups with context-free word-problem, and one can apply the entire preceding argument to them.

Since ''G'' is finitely presentable and therefore accessible,&lt;ref name=Dunwoody/&gt; the process of iterating this argument eventually terminates with finite groups, and produces a decomposition of ''G'' as the fundamental group of a finite [[Graph of groups|graph-of-groups]] with finite vertex and edge groups. By a basic result of [[Bass–Serre theory]] it then follows that ''G'' is virtually free.

The converse direction of the Muller–Schupp theorem is more straightforward.  If ''G'' is a finitely generated virtually free group, then ''G'' admits a finite index [[normal subgroup]] ''N'' such that ''N'' is a finite rank [[free group]]. Muller and Schupp use this fact to directly verify that ''G'' has context-free word problem.

==Remarks and further developments==

*The Muller–Schupp theorem is a far-reaching generalization of a 1971 theorem of Anisimov which states that for a finitely generated group ''G'' with a finite marked generating set ''X'' the word problem &lt;math&gt;\mathcal W(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[regular language]] if and only if the group ''G'' is finite.&lt;ref&gt;A.V. Anisimov, ''Group languages'' {{icon ru}},
Kibernetika, '''4''' (1971), pp. 18-24&lt;/ref&gt;
*At the time the 1983 paper of Muller and Schupp was published, accessibility of finitely presented groups has not yet been established. Therefore, the original formulation of  the Muller–Schupp theorem said that a finitely generated group is virtually free if and only if this group is accessible and has context-free word problem. A 1985 paper of [[Martin Dunwoody|Dunwoody]] proved that all finitely presented groups are accessible.&lt;ref name=Dunwoody&gt;M. J.  Dunwoody, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01388581 ''The accessibility of finitely presented groups''.] [[Inventiones Mathematicae]] '''81''' (1985), no. 3, 449–457&lt;/ref&gt; Since finitely generated groups with context-free word problem are finitely presentable, Dunwoody's result together with the original Muller–Schupp theorem imply that a finitely generated group is virtually free if and only if it has context-free word problem (which is the modern formulation of the Muller–Schupp theorem).
* A 1983 paper of Linnell &lt;ref&gt;P. A. Linnell, ''On accessibility of groups''. [[Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra]] '''30''' (1983), no. 1, 39–46&lt;/ref&gt; established accessibility of finitely generated groups where the orders of finite subgroups are bounded. It was later observed (see &lt;ref&gt;T. Ceccherini-Silberstein, M. Coornaert, F. Fiorenzi, and P.E. Schupp, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669812000492 ''Groups, graphs, languages, automata, games and second-order monadic logic''.] [[European Journal of Combinatorics]] '''33''' (2012), no. 7, 1330–1368&lt;/ref&gt;) that Linnell's result together with the original Muller–Schupp theorem were sufficient to derive the modern statement of the Muller–Schupp theorem, without having to use Dunwoody's result.
* In the case of [[torsion-free group]]s, the situation is simplified as the accessibility results are not needed and one instead uses [[Grushko theorem]] about the rank of a free product. In this setting, as noted in the original Muller and Schupp paper,&lt;ref name=MS83/&gt; the Muller–Schupp theorem says that a finitely generated torsion-free group has context-free word problem if and only if this group is free.&lt;ref name=MS83/&gt;
* In a subsequent related paper, Muller and Schupp proved that a ``finitely generated" graph  Γ has finitely many end isomorphism types if and only if  Γ is the transition graph of a [[push-down automaton]].&lt;ref&gt;D. E. Muller, and P. E. Schupp, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397585900878 ''The theory of ends, pushdown automata, and second-order logic''.] [[Theoretical Computer Science]] '''37''' (1985), no. 1, 51–75&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, they show that the [[Monadic second-order logic|monadic theory]] of a ``context-free" graph (such as the Cayley graph of a virtually free group) is decidable, generalizing a classic result of [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin]] for binary trees.&lt;ref&gt;M. O. Rabin, [http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1969-141-00/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1.pdf ''Decidability of second-order theories and automata on infinite trees''.]  [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] '''141''' (1969),  1–35&lt;/ref&gt; Later Kuske and Lohrey&lt;ref&gt;D. Kuske, M. Lohrey, ''Logical aspects of Cayley-graphs: the group case''. [[Annals of Pure and Applied Logic]] '''131''' (2005), no. 1–3, 263–286&lt;/ref&gt; proved that virtually free groups are the only finitely generated groups whose Cayley graphs have decidable monadic theory.
*[[Martin Bridson|Bridson]] and Gilman&lt;ref&gt;M. Bridson, and R. H. Gilman, ''A remark about combings of groups''. 
[[International Journal of Algebra and Computation]] '''3''' (1993), no. 4, 575–581&lt;/ref&gt; applied the Muller–Schupp theorem to show that a finitely generated group admits a ``broom-like" combing if and only if that group is virtually free.

*[[Géraud Sénizergues|Sénizergues]] used the Muller–Schupp theorem to show&lt;ref&gt;G. Sénizergues, ''On the finite subgroups of a context-free group''. Geometric and computational perspectives on infinite groups (Minneapolis, MN and New Brunswick, NJ, 1994), 201--212, DIMACS Ser. Discrete Math. Theoret. Comput. Sci., 25, [[American Mathematical Society]], Providence, RI, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Group isomorphism problem|isomorphism problem]] for finitely generated virtually free group is [[primitive recursive]].
*Gilman, [[Susan Hermiller|Hermiller]], Holt and Rees used the Muller–Schupp theorem to prove that a finitely generated group ''G'' is virtually free if and only if there exist a finite generating set ''X'' for ''G'' and a finite set of length-reducing rewrite rules over ''X'' whose application reduces any word to a geodesic word.&lt;ref&gt;R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">'''Paradiastole''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παραδιαστολή from παρά ''para'' "next to, alongside", and διαστολή ''diastole'' "separation, distinction") is the reframing of a vice as a virtue, often with the use of [[euphemism]],&lt;ref name="para1"&gt;Silva Rhetoricae (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20020817235913/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/P/paradiastole.htm Paradiastole]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, "Yes, I know it does not work all the time, but that is what makes it interesting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/paradiastole.htm Paradiastole]. Changing Minds.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used [[Irony|ironically]]. In [[Bible|biblical]] studies, it has come to mean the repetition of disjunctive words in a list. Another example is referring to manual labour as a "workout". Perhaps the most familiar usage today comes from the software world: "It's not a [[Bug (software)|bug]]; it's a feature!" (This is used both euphemistically and literally, as many features in software originated as bugs.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood and Cantrell (2011), [http://www.cracked.com/article_19262_6-glitches-that-accidentally-invented-modern-gaming.html 6 Glitches That Accidentally Invented Modern Gaming].)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical usage==
In biblical studies, paradiastole is a type of [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]] (the repetition of one word at the beginning of successive sentences). Paradiastole uses a few words—either, or, neither, not, and nor—used as disjunctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holybibleinstitute.com/files/Bullinger-Figures_of_Speech_used_in_the_Bible_b_.pdf Figures of Speech used in the Bible] , page 2&lt;/ref&gt; A ''dis''junction differs from a ''[[Conjunction (grammar)|con]]''[[Conjunction (grammar)|junction]] because it separates things, whereas a conjunction joins them.

An example of this technique can be found in the [[Gospel of John]], clarifying the meaning of τέκνα θεοῦ (God's children):

:οἳ [πιστεύοντες]
:οὐκ ἐξ αἱμάτων
:οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος σαρκὸς
:οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος ἀνδρὸς
:ἀλλ' ἐκ θεοῦ ἐγεννήθησαν. (John 1.13).&lt;ref name="para3"&gt;University of York (2006).  [http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/gnt/ Greek New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt;

:They [the believers],
:'''not''' of blood,
:'''nor''' of the flesh's desire,
:'''nor''' of a man's desire,
:'''but''' of God were born.

In this passage, οὐκ and οὐδὲ (here translated ''not'' and ''nor'') function as the disjunctions. The paradiastole emphasizes that those who believed (οἳ πιστεύοντες) and became "God's children" were not
''physically'' ("of blood", etc.) born again, but ''divinely.''

The French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer [[Voltaire]] remarked sardonically:  "This agglomeration which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was '''neither''' holy, '''nor''' Roman, '''nor''' an empire."&lt;ref&gt;Original text:  ''Ce corps qui s'appelait et qui s'appelle encore le saint empire romain n'était en aucune manière ni saint, ni romain, ni empire.'' In ''Essai sur l'histoire générale et sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations'', Chapter 70 (1756)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parcel post''' is a postal service for [[mail]] that is too heavy for normal letter post. It is usually slower than letter post. The development of the parcel post is closely connected with the development of the [[Railways|railway network]] which enabled parcels to be carried in bulk, to a regular schedule and at economic prices. Today many parcels also travel by road and international shipments may travel by sea or [[airmail]].

==Development of domestic parcel posts==
The idea of a parcel post may be credited to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought uniform postal rates throughout Germany and Austria in 1857. The practice of forwarding parcels with the mail, however, had been in use in Austria since the seventeenth century and in some German states is said to date to the fifteenth century. In the first year after the establishment of the domestic parcel post in Germany (1874), 38,862,654 parcels were carried, rising to 62,946,100 by 1881.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, Chester Lloyd, [https://archive.org/details/jstor-1820220 "The Parcel Post in Foreign Countries"], ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 22, No. 6 (June 1914), pp. 509–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

==UPU international parcel post agreement==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-22350-0001, Berlin, Postamt O 17, Päckchenverteilung.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sorting parcels in Berlin 1953.]]
The international parcel service, which allowed the orderly shipment of mailed packages and parcels from one country to another according to predetermined rates, was established by the [[Universal Postal Union]] on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the agreement of 1880 in Paris during a three-week conference on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scc-online.org/ph02may.pdf The 1880 UPU Parcel Post Convention and Swedish Foreign Parcel Mail, 1881 - 1921] by Sören Andersson in ''The Posthorn'', [[Scandinavian Collectors Club]], May 2002. [https://www.webcitation.org/6IVeZU7LR?url=http://www.scc-online.org/ph02may.pdf Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; The service was difficult to introduce as in several countries the carriage of parcels was a monopoly of the railway companies, and Egypt, Great Britain, India, Canada and Italy all initially claimed that there was no parcel service in their country.&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Postal Union: Its History and Progress. A paper read before the Leeds Philatelic Society by E. Egly, President, on December 19th, 1905." in ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. XV, No. 169, January 1906, pp. 2-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States, as a signatory, started foreign parcel services in 1887&lt;ref name="parcel1"&gt;''[[The New York Times]]''. "The Parcel Post System". 24 April 1887&lt;/ref&gt; but did not institute domestic services until 1913.&lt;ref name="sil1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Parcel Post: Delivery of Dreams: Introduction |work= |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Libraries |date=2004 | url =http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/parcelpost/intro.htm |accessdate=11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USPS, successor to the U.S. Post Office, officially ended International Parcel Post service in May 2007 after some 120 years of existence. International Parcel Post service was replaced by First-class Mail International service for parcels up to four pounds. For heavier parcels and/or printed matter, Priority Mail International, Priority Mail International Flat-Rate, Express Mail International, Airmail M-Bags, and Global Express Guaranteed service is available to foreign countries allowing these types of mail delivery.

USPS Domestic Parcel Post was an affordable method of sending large parcels of up to seventy pounds and a maximum combined length and girth of one hundred and thirty inches via ground transportation across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.usps.com/send/parcel-post.htm USPS.Com: Parcel Post]'', retrieved 26 January 2012 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124082921/https://www.usps.com/send/parcel-post.htm |date=January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective January 27, 2013, the USPS renamed its parcel post service from 'Parcel Post' to 'Standard Post'.&lt;ref group="USPS Standard Post"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheehan|first1=Brian|title=Parcel Post renamed "Standard Post"|url=http://postalnews.com/postalnewsblog/2013/01/18/parcel-post-renamed-standard-post/|website=postalnews blog|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="USPS Standard Post"&gt;{{cite web|title=USPS New Prices and Services for 2013|url=http://www.endicia.com/price-change-2013|publisher=Endicia|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective January 17, 2016, the USPS renamed the service again, from "Standard Post" to "USPS Retail Ground", a name intended to resemble those of competing services UPS Ground and FedEx Ground.

Commercial Parcel Post service is now under the "Parcel Select" name.

==Private couriers==
[[File:FedEx MD-11F N607FE.jpg|thumbnail|right|A ''Federal Express'' aircraft.]]
Private [[couriers]] have existed since goods first needed to be transported from place to place.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Before the development of state-run parcel posts, many railway companies had a thriving parcel service and private companies continue to run their own delivery networks today through firms like [[FedEx Express]] or [[DHL Express]], even owning their own aircraft for long distance deliveries. Numerous smaller firms provide domestic and international courier services.

==Road transport services==
[[File:Great Britain private parcel service stamps - 4.jpg|thumbnail|right|Road transport private parcel service stamps from Great Britain. Circa mid twentieth century.]]
Before the development of the railway network, road transport was the principal means of parcel transport.

Adapted from Patten and Kelly (2010)&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;]]
A '''perceptual trap''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] scenario in which [[environmental change]], typically [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], leads an organism to avoid an otherwise high-quality [[habitat]]. The concept is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.

==History==
In a 2004 article discussing [[source-sink dynamics]], James Battin did not distinguish between high-quality habitats that are preferred or avoided, labelling both "sources."&lt;ref name=Battin&gt;Battin, J. (2004) [http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf "When good animals love bad habitats: ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813074823/http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }} (PDF), ''Conservation Biology,'' '''18''': 1482–1491&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scenario, in which a high-quality habitat is avoided, was first recognised as an important phenonmenon in 2007 by Gilroy and Sutherland,&lt;ref name=Gilroy&gt;Gilroy, J. J., and W. J. Sutherland. (2007) "Beyond ecological traps: perceptual errors and undervalued resources," ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution,'' '''22''': 351–356&lt;/ref&gt; who described them as "undervalued resources." The term "perceptual trap" was first proposed by Michael Patten and Jeffrey Kelly in a 2010 article.&lt;ref name=Patten&gt;Patten, M.A., and Kelly, J.F. (2010) "Habitat selection and the perceptual trap," ''Ecological Applications,'' '''20''': 2148–2156.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Van Dyck&lt;ref name=VanDyck&gt;Van Dyck, H. (2012) "Changing organisms in rapidly changing anthropogenic landscapes: the significance of the ‘Umwelt’-concept and functional habitat for animal conservation," ''Evolutionary Applications,'' '''5(2)''': : 144–153.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the term is misleading because perception is also a major component in other cases of trapping.

==Description==
Animals use discrete environmental cues to select habitat.&lt;ref name=Kristan&gt;Kristan, W. B. (2003) "The role of habitat selection behavior in population dynamics: source–sink systems and ecological
traps," ''Oikos,'' '''103''': 457–468&lt;/ref&gt; A perceptual trap occurs if change in an environmental cue leads an organism to avoid a high-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; It differs, therefore, from simple habitat avoidance, which may be a correct decision given the habitat's quality.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; The concept of a perceptual trap is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; There is expected to be strong [[natural selection]] against ecological traps, but not necessarily against perceptual traps, as [[Allee effect]]s may restrict a population’s ability to establish itself.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Lesser Prairie Chicken.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; propose that a perceptual trap is acting on populations of the [[lesser prairie chicken]]]]
To support the concept of a perceptual trap, Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; cited a study of the [[lesser prairie chicken]] (''Tympanuchus pallidicinctus''). The species' natural environment, [[shinnery oak]] [[grassland]], is often treated with the [[herbicide]] [[tebuthiuron]] to increase grass cover for [[grazing|cattle grazing]].&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Herbicide treatment resulted in less shrub cover, a habitat cue that caused female lesser prairie-chickens to avoid the habitat in favour of untreated areas. However, females who nested in  herbicide-treated areas achieved comparable nesting successes and [[clutch size]]s to those in untreated areas.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Patten and Kelly suggest that the adverse effects of tebuthiuron treatment on nesting success are countered by various effects, such as greater nest concealment through increased grass cover.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Therefore, female birds are erroneously avoiding a high-quality habitat. Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; also cited as a possible perceptual trap the cases of the [[spotted towhee]] (''Pipilo maculatus'') and [[rufous-crowned sparrow]] (''Aimophila ruficeps''), which tend to avoid habitat fragments, even though birds nesting in habitat fragments achieve increased nesting success due to a reduction in [[snake]] predation.&lt;ref name=Patten2&gt;Patten, M. A., and D. T. Bolger (2003) "Variation in top-down control of avian reproductive success across a fragmentation gradient", ''Oikos,'' '''101''':479–488&lt;/ref&gt;

Tito is commonly known as 'warrior' in the early 1800's and would be given to sons of soldiers that would enter battle and is a symbolization of death in historical mythology in foreign entities. 
Simply put, "Kuya" is used to address an older male relative or friend (especially ones own brother), and means "brother".

"Ate", is in reference to an older female relative or respected friend (especially ones own sister or kapatid), and means "Sister".
 
'''Philippine kinship''' uses the generational system (see [[Kinship terminology]]) to define family. It is one of the more simple classificatory systems of kinship (especially if compared to the complex English-language kinship system, e.g., [[cousin]]). One's genetic relationship or bloodline is often overridden by the desire to show proper respect that is due in the Philippine culture to age and the nature of the relationship, which are considered more important.

In it, the literal differences are distinguished by generation, age, and in some cases by gender. However, non-Filipinos can be confused by apparently similar relationships being handled verbally differently by the same person, which generally occurs because of the circumstantial relationship or because some authority is represented by the addressee. Other factors that affect how a person is addressed are whether the two are familiar with each other, new to each other's acquaintance, or perhaps involved in a secondary relationship that imparts authority, such as one person being the supervisor of another at work.

As an example, a teenage girl would call her older brother "kuya". She would also tend to call her older male cousin "kuya". That he is an older, blood-related male is more important than that a brother is not genetically related to the same degree that a cousin is. The term ''kuya'' is actually likely to be applied to any older male who is within her generation and should be treated with respect, perhaps even the very close friends of her brother. Thus, the terms used are often intended to show the degree of the relationship and the type of relationship, rather than literal biological relationship.

This can be seen in social settings like [[Facebook]], where Filipino teenagers include contemporaries in the "brothers" and "sisters" categories (the equivalent of a "best friend" in U.S. culture).

==Influences on language==

Scholars generally disagree on the genetic origin of the "original" Filipino people, if there is any one dominant progenitor. For centuries there have been migrations from Asia, the Middle East, all the nearby island countries, and Europe (primarily the Spanish) who have all given something genetically and etymologically to the Philippines. Over 170 languages are recognized but do not have official status; [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and English are the official languages of the Philippines,&lt;ref name=article_xiv /&gt; and basic English is more effective for communicating with far-flung peoples in the Philippines than any one dialect, including Tagalog. English's prominence is a reflection of the [[Philippines–United States relations|Philippines' close relationship]] with the United States, especially since [[World War II]], and a testament to the broad reach of television, which broadcasts in a mix of Tagalog and English.

Tagalog is an [[Austronesian language]] that has borrowed heavily from the Philippines' geographical neighbors ([[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) as well as from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], a legacy of Spain's [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|prolonged colonization]]. For example, Tagalog has incorporated words like the greeting "Kumusta", from the Spanish "Cómo está". Familial greetings tend to be borrowed from Chinese.

As a child, one would refer to one's parents as '''"Ama"''' or '''"Tatay"''' ("Father", in formal and informal Filipino, respectively)  and '''"Ina"''' or '''"Nanay"''' (Mother, in formal and informal Filipino, respectively).  One's parents' siblings and their cousins would be called '''"mga Tiyo"''' ("uncles"), or '''"Tiyo"''' ("uncle")  or '''"mga Tiya"''' ("aunts") or '''"Tiya"''' ("aunt").  One would call one's godparents '''"Ninong"''' and '''"Ninang"''',
meaning godfather and godmother,  respectively.

Family friends one generation above, like parent's friends, are called '''"Tito"''' (for males) and '''"Tita"''' (for females), although they should not be confused with '''Tiyo''' and '''Tiya''' which are for blood relatives.  Filipinos are very clannish and are known for recognizing relatives up to the 10th or even the 20th degree.

A person's siblings ('''"mga kapatid"''') would be one's brothers or sisters.  The terms '''"Kuya"''' and '''"Ate"''' are used to address an older brother and sister respectively as a sign of respect.  Any children of their '''Tiyo''' (Uncle) or '''Tiya''' (Aunt) would be called '''"mga pinsan"''' (cousins) so one can either address them as '''"pinsan"''' or use the more commonly used "'''Kuya''' [cousin's first name]" or "'''Ate''' [cousin's first name]" if they are older, or simply address them with their first name or nickname.  Their godparent's children are called '''kinakapatid''', which literally means someone made into a sibling.  The term '''"Kuya"''' is used in Filipino for older brother and '''"Ate"''' is used in Filipino for older sister, and those terms are what one also usually use to refer to or respect other people (including cousins and other strangers) who are in the same generation but a little older, or one could use the older term '''Manong''' ("big brother") and '''Manang''' ("big sister") for the much older people that one does not know up to two generations ahead, unless they are too old and then they should be called '''Lolo''' and '''Lola'''. 

The children of one's '''"mga kapatid"''' (siblings) and '''"mga pinsan"''' (cousins) would be called '''"mga pamangkin"''' (nephews/nieces).

If a person is a '''"Amang'''" or "'''Lolo"''' ("Grandfather", in formal and informal Filipino, respectively) or '''"Inang'''" or "'''Lola"''' ( "Grandmother", in formal and imformal Filipino, respectively), those called '''"mga apo"''' ("grandchildren") would be the offsprings not only of their children ('''"mga anak"''') but also the offspring of their children's cousins ('''"mga pinsan"''').  Not unless a person have a different title (like "Attorney"/"Atty.", "Dr.", "Mayor", etc.) that one are known for, one may also be addressed as '''"Lolo"''' or '''"Lola"''' by complete strangers or neighbors just by virtue of their age (usually when they are above 60 years old or already considered a senior citizen), as a form of respect.

== Non-literal usage of familiar terms ==

"Kuya" and "Ate" are also titles used to address older male and female cousins (regardless if they are the eldest or not, but older than cousin addressing them) as a sign of respect. It may also be used for people who aren't necessarily relatives but are older. The criteria would be gender (first), age (second), degree of affiliation (third), with actual blood or non-blood relationship being the least important.

"Tiyo" and "Tiya", used literally for uncle and aunt, are often confused with "Tito" and "Tita" which are used in reference to your parents' close friends. Again, the degree of affiliation in the relationship overrides the literal meaning.

This hierarchy of conditions would be consistently applied to other familial terms that are used for relationship of further distance, such as "Ninang" and "Ninong", which are often applied to people who have no actual blood relationship but have earned a showing of respect which also defines their age, gender, and station in life.

Filipinos would generally greet each other using their title like: "Kumusta '''Ate''' Jhen", or "Kumusta '''Kuya''' Jay"; because doing otherwise is considered rude and disrespectful.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Horace Day Pick-Up Game Chapel St.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of a pick-up game by [[Horace Day]].]] --&gt;
In [[sports]], a '''pick-up game''' is a game that has been spontaneously started by a group of players.  Players are generally invited to show up beforehand, but unlike [[exhibition game]]s there is no sense of obligation or commitment to play. Pick-up games usually lack officials and [[referee]]s, which makes them more disorganized and less structured than regular games, but the total number of players in such games globally is likely to be greater than the number playing in formal competitions and leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=14 |title=Play Practice |year=2001 |isbn=9780736030052}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without formal rules and regulations, pick-up games are often played with a less rigid set of rules.

A '''port''' is a [[maritime law|maritime]] commercial facility which may comprise one or more [[Wharf|wharves]] where ships may dock to load and discharge passengers and [[Affreightment|cargo]]. Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, some ports, such as [[Port of Hamburg|Hamburg]], [[Port of Manchester| Manchester]] and [[Duluth]], are many miles inland, with access from the sea via [[river]] or [[canal]].

Today, by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the [[World's busiest ports|world's largest and busiest ports]], such as [[Port of Singapore| Singapore]] and the [[China|Chinese]] ports of [[Port of Shanghai| Shanghai]] and [[Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan|Ningbo-Zhoushan]].

==Ancient ports==
{{main|Historical Ports}}
Whenever ancient civilisations engaged in maritime trade, they tended to develop sea ports. One of the world's oldest known artificial harbors is at [[Wadi al-Jarf]] on the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name=Discovery&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Ancient Port, Hieroglyphic Papyri Found|author=Rossella Lorenzi|work=Discovery News|date=12 April 2013|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-egypt/worlds-oldest-port-and-egyptian-papyrus-uncovered-130412.htm|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the finding of harbor structures, ancient anchors have also been found. 

Other ancient ports include [[Port of Guangzhou|Guangzhou]] during [[Qin Dynasty]] China and [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]], the principal Egyptian port for Greek trade before the foundation of [[Alexandria]]. In ancient Greece, Athens' port of [[Piraeus]] was the base for the Athenian fleet which played a crucial role in the [[Battle of Salamis]] against the Persians in 480 BCE. In ancient India from 3700 BCE, [[Lothal]] was a prominent city of the Indus valley civilisation, located in the Bhāl region of the modern state of Gujarāt.{{reference needed|date=April 2018}} [[Ostia Antica]] was the port of ancient Rome with [[Portus]] established by [[Claudius]] and enlarged by [[Trajan]] to supplement the nearby port of Ostia. In Japan, during the [[Edo period]], the island of [[Dejima]] was the only port open for trade with Europe and received only a single Dutch ship per year, whereas [[Osaka]] was the largest domestic port and the main trade hub for rice.

Nowadays, many of these ancient sites no longer exist or function as modern ports. Even in more recent times, ports sometimes fall out of use. [[Rye, East Sussex]], was an important English port in the Middle Ages, but the coastline changed and it is now {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the sea, while the ports of [[Ravenspurn]] and [[Dunwich]] have been lost to [[coastal erosion]].

==Modern ports==
Whereas early ports tended to be just simple harbours, modern ports tend to be [[Multimodal transport|multimodal]] distribution [[Food hubs|hubs]], with transport links using sea, river, canal, road, rail and air routes. Successful ports are located to optimize access to an active [[hinterland]], such as the [[London Gateway]]. Ideally, a port will grant [[Navigability|easy navigation]] to ships, and will give shelter from wind and waves. Ports are often on estuaries, where the water may be shallow and may need regular [[dredging]]. Deep water ports such as [[Milford Haven Waterway|Milford Haven]]  are less common, but can handle larger ships with a greater draft, such as [[Tanker (ship)|super tankers]], [[Panamax|Post-Panamax vessels]] and large [[container ship]]s. Other businesses such as [[Food hubs|regional distribution centre]]s, warehouses and freight-forwarders, [[canning|canneries]] and other processing facilities find it advantageous to be located within a port or nearby. Modern ports will have specialised [[cargo]]-handling equipment, such as [[Crane (machine)|gantry cranes]], [[Reach stacker|reach stackers]] and [[forklift|forklift trucks]].

Ports usually have specialised functions: some tend to cater mainly for [[passenger ferry|passenger ferries]] and [[cruise ship]]s; some specialise in [[Intermodal container|container]] traffic or general cargo; and some ports play an important military role for their nation's navy. Some third world countries and small islands such as [[Ascension Island,|Ascension]] and [[St Helena]] still have limited port facilities, so that ships must anchor off while their cargo and passengers are taken ashore by [[barge]] or [[Launch (boat)|launch]] (respectively).

In modern times, ports survive  or decline, depending on current economic trends.  In the UK, both the ports of [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[Port of Southampton|Southampton]] were once significant in the transatlantic passenger liner business. Once airliner traffic decimated that trade, both ports diversified to container cargo and cruise ships. Up until the 1950s the [[Port of London]] was a major international port on the [[River Thames]], but changes in shipping and the use of containers and larger ships, have led to its decline. [[Thamesport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[London Thamesport]] |url=http://www.londonthamesport.co.uk |title=Welcome |access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small semi-automated container port (with links to the [[Port of Felixstowe]], the UK's largest container port) thrived for some years, but has been hit hard by competition from the emergent London Gateway port and logistics hub.

In mainland Europe, it is normal for ports to be publicly owned, so that, for instance, the ports of [[Port of Rotterdam|Rotterdam]] and [[Port of Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] are owned partly by the state and partly by the cities themselves. By contrast, in the UK all ports are in private hands, such as [[The Peel Group|Peel Ports]] who own the Port of Liverpool, [[John Lennon Airport]] and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. 

Even though modern ships tend to have bow-thrusters and stern-thrusters, many port authorities still require vessels to use [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]s and [[tugboat]]s for manoeuvering large ships in tight quarters. For instance, ships approaching the Belgian [[port of Antwerp]], an inland port on the [[Scheldt|River Scheldt]], are obliged to use Dutch pilots when navigating on that part of the estuary that belongs to the Netherlands.

Ports with international traffic have [[customs]] facilities.

==Types==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
The terms "port" and "seaport" are used for different types of port facilities that handle ocean-going vessels, and '''river port''' is used for river traffic, such as [[barge]]s and other shallow-draft vessels.

===Dry port===
{{main|Dry port}}
A '''dry port''' is an inland [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] terminal directly connected by [[road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] to a seaport and operating as a centre for the [[transshipment]] of sea cargo to inland destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feasibility Study on the network operation of Hinterland Hubs (Dry Port Concept) to improve and modernise ports' connections to the hinterland and to improve networking |publisher=InLoc |date=January 2007 |url=http://www.inloc.info/internal/wp1/activity_15_feasibility_study_dry_ports.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413200609/http://www.inloc.info/internal/wp1/activity_15_feasibility_study_dry_ports.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing port===
A '''fishing port''' is a port or [[harbor]]  for landing and distributing fish. It may be a recreational facility, but it is usually commercial. A fishing port is the only port that depends on an ocean product, and depletion of fish may cause a fishing port to be uneconomical.

===Inland port===
{{main|Inland port}}
An '''inland port''' is a port on a navigable lake, river (fluvial port), or canal with access to a sea or ocean, which therefore allows a ship to sail from the ocean inland to the port to load or unload its cargo. An example of this is the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] which allows ships to travel from the Atlantic Ocean several thousand kilometers inland to Great Lakes ports like [[Toronto]], [[Twin Ports|Duluth-Superior]], and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/|title=Seaway System|work=greatlakes-seaway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seaport===
A '''seaport''' is further categorized as a "cruise port" or a "cargo port". Additionally, "cruise ports" are also known as a "home port" or a "port of call". The "cargo port" is also further categorized into a "bulk" or "break bulk port" or as a "container port".

====Cargo port====
'''Cargo ports''', on the other hand, are quite different from cruise ports, because each handles very different cargo, which has to be loaded and unloaded by very different mechanical means. The port may handle one particular type of cargo or it may handle numerous cargoes, such as grains, liquid fuels, liquid chemicals, wood, automobiles, etc.  Such ports are known as the "bulk" or "break bulk ports". Those ports that handle containerized cargo are known as container ports. Most cargo ports handle all sorts of cargo, but some ports are very specific as to what cargo they handle. Additionally, the individual cargo ports are divided into different operating terminals which handle the different cargoes, and are operated by different companies, also known as terminal operators or [[stevedore]]s.

====Cruise home port====
A '''cruise home port''' is the port where cruise ship passengers board (or [[Embarkation|embark]]) to start their cruise and [[disembarkment|disembark]] the cruise ship at the end of their cruise. It is also where the cruise ship's supplies are loaded for the cruise, which includes everything from fresh water and fuel to fruits, vegetables, champagne, and any other supplies needed for the cruise. "Cruise home ports" are very busy places during the day the cruise ship is in port, because off-going passengers debark their baggage and on-coming passengers board the ship in addition to all the supplies being loaded. Currently, the ''Cruise Capital of the World'' is the [[Port of Miami]], [[Florida]], closely followed behind by [[Port Everglades]], Florida and the [[Port of San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].

====Port of call====
A '''port of call''' is an intermediate stop for a ship on its sailing itinerary. At these ports, cargo ships may take on supplies or fuel, as well as unloading and loading cargo while cruise liners have passengers get on or off ship.

===Warm-water port===
A '''warm-water port'''{{anchor|warm water port}} is one where the water does not freeze in wintertime. Because they are available year-round, warm-water ports can be of great geopolitical or economic interest. Such settlements as [[Dalian]] in China, [[Vostochny Port]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vpnet.ru/eng/geo/main_geo.htm |title=Vostochny Port JSC, Geography, Location |work=Vostochny Port website |year=2007 |accessdate=13 December 2012 |quote=...&amp;nbsp; Vostochny Port is located in the south of Primorsky Region, in the southeast of Nakhodka bay, in Vrangel bay. This is unique natural harbor is no ice restrictions even in severe winters.&amp;nbsp;... |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129011546/http://www.vpnet.ru/eng/geo/main_geo.htm |archivedate=29 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murmansk]] and [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] in Russia, [[Odessa]] in Ukraine, [[Kushiro, Hokkaidō|Kushiro]] in Japan and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] at the terminus of the [[Alaska Pipeline]] owe their very existence to being ice-free ports. The Baltic Sea and similar areas have ports available year-round beginning in the 20th century thanks to [[icebreaker]]s, but earlier access problems prompted Russia to expand its territory to the [[Black Sea]].

==Environmental impact==
There are several initiatives to decrease negative environmental impacts of ports. These include [[SIMPYC]], the [[World Ports Climate Initiative]], the [[African Green Port Initiative]] and [[EcoPorts]].&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, 6,2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudo-Geber'''  (or "Latin Pseudo-Geber") refers to a corpus of [[Middle Latin|Latin]] 
alchemist writing dated to the late 13th and early 14th centuries, attributed to Geber
([[Jābir ibn Hayyān]]), an early [[Alchemy|alchemist]] of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].
The most important work of the corpus is '''''Summa perfectionis magisterii''''' ("The Height of the Perfection of Mastery"), likely written before 1310 and sometimes attributed to [[Paul of Taranto]].&lt;ref&gt;William R. Newman. ''New Light on the Identity of Geber", Sudhoffs Archiv 69 (1985): 79-90&lt;/ref&gt;
The work was influential in the domain of alchemy and metallurgy in late medieval Europe.

The historicity of Jābir ibn Hayyān itself is in question, and most of the numerous Islamic works attributed to him are, themselves, pseudepigraphic. But it is common practice to refer to the earlier, Greek-inspired body of Islamic texts as the ''Corpus Jabirianum'' or Jabirian Corpus, and to the later, 13th to 14th century Latin corpus as Pseudo-Geber or Latin Pseudo-Geber, a term introduced by [[Marcellin Berthelot]]. The "Pseudo-Geber problem" is the question of a possible relation between the two corpora. This question has long been controversially discussed. It is now mostly thought that at least parts of Latin Pseudo-Geber are based on earlier Islamic authors such as [[Al-Razi]].

==Corpus==
The following set of books is called the "Pseudo-Geber Corpus" (or the "Latin Geber Corpus"). 
The works were first edited in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;''Alchemy and Early Modern Chemistry'', [[Allen G. Debus]], Jeremy Mills Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-9546484-1-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but had been in circulation in manuscript form for roughly 200 years beforehand. 
The stated author is ''Geber'' or ''Geber Arabs'' (Geber the Arab), and it is stated in some copies that the translator is ''Rodogerus Hispalensis'' (Roger of Hispania).
The works attributed to Geber include:
*''Summa perfectionis magisterii'' ("The Height of the Perfection of Mastery").
*''Liber fornacum'' ("Book of Furnaces"),
*''De investigatione perfectionis'' ("On the Investigation of Perfection"), and
*''De inventione veritatis'' ("On the Discovery of Truth").

Being the clearest expression of alchemical theory and laboratory directions available until then&amp;mdash;in a field where mysticism, secrecy, and obscurity were the usual rule&amp;mdash;Pseudo-Geber's books were widely read and influential among European alchemists.&lt;ref name="HolmyardJabir1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmyard|first1=E. J.|last2=Jabir|last3=Russell|first3=Richard|title=The Works of Geber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=siLPmQew3AoC&amp;pg=PR10|accessdate=8 June 2010|date=September 1997|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-0015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Summa Perfectionis'' in particular was one of the most widely read alchemy books in western Europe in the late medieval period.&lt;ref name=WRNewman1991 /&gt; 
Its author assumed that all [[metal]]s are composed of unified [[sulfur]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] corpuscles&lt;ref&gt;"The Mineral Exhalation Theory of Metallogenesis in Pre-Modern Mineral Science". John A Norris. ''Ambix'' vol.&amp;nbsp;53 no.&amp;nbsp;1, March 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;43-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave detailed descriptions of metallic properties in those terms. 
The use of an [[elixir]] for transmuting base metals into [[gold]] is explained (see [[philosopher's stone]]) and a lengthy defense is given defending alchemy against the charge that transmutation of metals was impossible.

The practical directions for laboratory procedures were so clear that it is obvious the author was familiar with many chemical operations. It contains early recipes for producing [[mineral acids]],&lt;ref name=Karpenko /&gt; much like the earlier Arabic corpus.&lt;ref name=hassan/&gt; It was not equaled in chemistry until the 16th century writings of chemist [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]], mineralogist [[Georgius Agricola]] and assayer [[Lazarus Ercker]].&lt;ref&gt;See German article [[:de:Lazarus Ercker]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three books on the list above are shorter and are, to a substantial degree, condensations of the material in the ''Summa Perfectionis''.

Two further works,  ''Testamentum Geberi'' and ''Alchemia Geberi'', are "absolutely spurious, being of a later date [than the other four]", as [[Marcellin Berthelot]] put it,&lt;ref name=JCBrown /&gt; and they are usually not included as part of the Pseudo-Geber corpus. 
Their author is not the same as the others, but it is not certain that the first four have the same author either.&lt;ref name="Long2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Pamela O.|title=Openness, secrecy, authorship: technical arts and the culture of knowledge from antiquity to the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_k91r2u6NgC|accessdate=14 June 2010|year=2001|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6606-7|pages=146 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''De Inventione Veritatis'' has the earliest known recipe for the preparation of [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref name=Karpenko /&gt;

==Authorship==
[[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Islamic alchemy]] was held in high esteem by 13th century European alchemists, and the author [[pseudepigraphy|adopted the name]] of an illustrious predecessor, as was usual practice at the time. 
The authorship of Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyam) was first questioned in the late 19th century by  the studies of [[Hermann Franz Moritz Kopp|Kopp]],&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Kopp, ''Beitraege zur Geschichte der Chemie'' Drittes Stueck (Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1875), 28-33n.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand Hoefer|Hoefer]], [[Marcellin Berthelot|Berthelot]], and [[Edmund Oscar von Lippmann|Lippmann]]. The corpus is clearly influenced by medieval Islamic writers (especially by [[Al-Razi]], and to a lesser extent, the eponymous Jabir). 
The identity of the author remains uncertain. 
He may have lived in Italy or Spain, or both. Some books in the Geber corpus may have been written by authors that post-date the author of the ''Summa Perfectionis'', as most of the other books in the corpus are largely recapitulations of the ''Summa Perfectionis''.&lt;ref name=JCBrown /&gt;  
[[William R. Newman]] in his 1991 crtitical edition of the ''Summa perfectionis''  argues that the author of the ''Summa perfectionis'' was [[Paul of Taranto]].&lt;ref name=WRNewman1991&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZ-WXuo84ioC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''The Summa perfectionis of Pseudo-Geber: A critical edition, translation, and study''], by William R. Newman (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;
Crosland (2004) refers to Geber as "a Latin author" while still emphasizing the identity of the author being "still in dispute".
&lt;ref&gt;P. Crosland, Maurice, ''Historical Studies in the Language of Chemistry'', Courier Dover Publications, 2004 1962, {{ISBN|0-486-43802-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43802-3}}, p. 15 and p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated date for the first four books is 1310, and they could not date from much before that because no reference to the ''Summa Perfectionis'' is found anywhere in the world before or during the 13th century. For example, there is no mention in the 13th century writings of [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Szabadvary&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=53APqy0KDaQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=geber&amp;f=false ''History of Analytical Chemistry''], by Ferenc Szabadváry (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of dependence of the corpus from actual Islamic sources is somewhat disputed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
Brown (1920) asserted that the Pseudo-Geber Corpus contained "new and original facts" not known from Islamic alchemy, specifically mention of 
[[nitric acid]], [[aqua regia]], [[oil of vitriol]] and [[silver nitrate]].&lt;ref name=JCBrown&gt;Chapter VI: "The Pseudo-Geber" in [https://archive.org/details/historyofchemist00browuoft ''A History of Chemistry from the Earliest Times'' (2nd ed., 1920)], by J.C. Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the 1920s, [[Eric John Holmyard]] criticized the claim of Pseudo-Geber being "new and original" compared to medieval Islamic alchemy, arguing for direct derivation from Islamic authors.&lt;ref&gt;"[Berthelot] deliberately wanted to underrate Jābir […], the choice of Jābir’s works made by Berthelot is entirely misleading." 
"It is here that Berthelot’s ignorance of Arabic led him astray. As a matter of fact, the Summa is full of Arabic phrases and turns of speech, and so are the other Latin works", cited after Hassan (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Holmyard later argued that the then-recent discovery of Jabir's ''The Book of Seventy'' diminished the weight of the argument of there being "no Arabic originals" corresponding to Pseudo-Geber,&lt;ref name=Holmyard&gt;[https://archive.org/details/makersofchemistr029725mbp ''Makers of Chemistry''], by Eric John Holmyard (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 1957, Holmyard was willing to admit that "the general style of the works is too clear and systematic to find a close parallel in any of the known writings of the Jabirian corpus" and that they seemed to be "the product of an occidental rather than an oriental mind" while still asserting that the author must have been able to read Arabic and most likely worked in [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric John Holmyard, ''Alchemy'', 1957, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Bt-kwKRUzUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134 page 134]: "The question at once arises whether the Latin works are genuine translations from the Arabic, or written by a Latin author and, according to common practice, ascribed to Jabir in order to heighten their authority. That they are based on Muslim alchemical theory and practice is not questioned, but the same may be said of most Latin treatises on alchemy of that period; and from various turns of phrase it seems likely that their author could read Arabic. But the general style of the works is too clear and systematic to find a close parallel in any of the known writings of the Jabirian corpus, and we look in vain in them for any references to the characteristically Jabirian ideas of "balance" and the alphabetic numerology. Indeed for their age they have a remarkably matter of fact air about them, theory being stated with a minimum of prolixity and much precise practical detail being given. The general impression they convey is that they are the product of an occidental rather than an oriental mind, and a likely guess would be that they were written by a European scholar, possibly in [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Spain]]. Whatever their origin, they became the principal authorities in early Western alchemy and held that position for two or three centuries."&lt;/ref&gt;

With Brown (1920), Karpenko and Norris (2001) still assert that the first documented occurrence of aqua regia is in Pseudo-Geber.&lt;ref name=Karpenko&gt;Vladimir Karpenko and John A. Norris (2001), [http://www.chemicke-listy.cz/docs/full/2002_12_05.pdf Vitriol in the history of Chemistry].&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[Ahmad Y. Al-Hassan]] (2005) claimed that Islamic texts dated to before the 13th century, including the works of Jabir and Al-Razi, did in fact contain detailed descriptions of substances such as nitric acid, aqua regia, vitriol, and various nitrates,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Y.

'''Purna Kaji Tamrakar''' ([[Devanagari]]: पूर्णकाजी ताम्रकार) (1920 - 2009) was a Nepalese merchant, author and journalist who worked to develop [[Nepal Bhasa]] during difficult times when writers were being persecuted by the government.&lt;ref name="Kayastha2009"&gt;{{cite news|last= Kayastha|first= Chhatra Bahadur|title= Bhasa Thuwa Purna Kaji Tamrakar Lumanka|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Thaunkanhe|date=April 2009}} Pages 60-67.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

[[Tamrakar]] was born at [[Maru, Kathmandu]] to father Jagat Muni and mother Pun Laxmi Tamrakar. The neighborhood lies at the western edge of [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]]. Tamrakar's ancestral home stands near a large [[stupa]] and is known as Tagwah Chibha meaning "large stupa". He attended high school in [[Kolkata]], India and returned to Kathmandu and married Hira Devi.

==Career==

Tamrakar was a [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa trader]]. In 1940, he went to [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]] and joined his maternal uncle's business house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/26487/2/Nepal_cat.pdf&amp;ei=n8eCT5LqMcXZrQeatOHRBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q7gEwAjge&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dpurna%2Bkaji%2Btamrakar%26start%3D30%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26prmdo%3D1%26biw%3D1015%26bih%3D575%26prmd%3Dimvnso| title =Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School of Arts and Graduate School of Regional| work = | publisher =| date=31 March 2007| accessdate = 9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamrakar engaged in business, and also served as secretary of the [[Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Tuladhar|first= Kamal Ratna|title= Pioneers on the Roof of the World|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Matina|date=August 2009}} {{BLCAT|ZK.9.b.25686}}. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Lhasa, he came into contact with another Nepalese merchant [[Pushpa Ratna Sagar]], and was inspired to write and serve his mother tongue. His first article was published in ''[[Dharmodaya]]'' magazine in 1948. Tamrakar returned to Kathmandu in 1948. 

Restrictions on publication in Nepal Bhasa were removed after the [[Rana dynasty]] was overthrown and democracy established in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://npi10month.blogspot.com/2010/02/history-of-nepali-journalism.html| title =History of Nepali Journalism| work = | publisher =Nepal Press Institute| date=15 February 2010| accessdate = 9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Tamrakar, Sagar and another merchant Ratna Man Singh [[Tuladhar]] started a monthly magazine named ''[[Thaunkanhe]]'' (थौंकन्हे) with the money donated by Nepalese traders in Lhasa. The three partners were editor, deputy editor and publisher respectively. It was the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa to be published from Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Malla, Kamal Prakash (ed.) (1967). ''Nahli Swana.'' Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Page 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamrakar was editor of ''Thaunkanhe'' from 1951 to 1957.

==Printing press==

In 1952, the three partners established their own printing press named Nepal Press in a bid to promote publishing in Nepal Bhasa. It was located at 11/122 Asan Tyouda Tol, Kathmandu. They also set up Thaunkanhe Publications Division which published a number of books.  

Meanwhile, Tamrakar acquired a BA degree (Sahitya Ratna) from Nepal Rastriya Vidyapeeth, [[Birgunj]] in 1953. He was among the first batch of four students.&lt;ref name="Kayastha2009" /&gt;

Besides writing, Tamrakar was involved in Buddhist activities, and was elected assistant secretary of Dharmodaya Sabha in 1956 when it held the landmark fourth international conference of the [[World Fellowship of Buddhists]] in Kathmandu. Dharmodaya Sabha is a Buddhist organization formed in 1944 in [[Sarnath]], India by Buddhist monks expelled from Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.dharmodaya.org/history.htm| title =History of Dharmodaya Sabha| work = | publisher =| date=2011| accessdate = 10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Tamrakar and Sagar sold their shares in Nepal Press to Tuladhar, and it was shifted to New Road. Tamrakar continued writing and published six books on culture, literature, historical sites and his experiences in Tibet. He also served as editor of ''Nepal Ritu Pau'', a literary quarterly. From 2000 to 2005, he was president of Nepal Bhasa Parisad (Nepal Bhasa Council).&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (2002). ''Mimmanahpau: letter from a Lhasa merchant to his wife.''

==Honors==

In 2004, the Nepal Bhasha Academy awarded Tamrakar the Danyahira Sirpa Award for literature for his outstanding service and contribution in the field of Nepal Bhasha and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.nepalbhashaacademy.org.np/awards.htm| title =Danyahira Sirpa Award| work = | publisher =Nepal Bhasha Academy| date=| accessdate = 9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal Bhasa Parisad declared him a Bhasa Thuwa ("patron of the language") in 2009.&lt;ref name="Kayastha2009" /&gt;

'''Radio''' is the [[technology]] of using [[radio wave]]s to carry [[information]], such as [[sound]], by systematically [[modulation|modulating]] properties of [[electromagnetic energy]] waves transmitted through [[space]], such as their [[amplitude]], [[frequency]], [[phase (waves)|phase]], or [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse width]].{{refn | group = n |While the term 'radio-' is actually the [[combining form]] of [[radiant (disambiguation)|radiant]] (e.g., [[radioactive]], [[radiotherapy]]), the process that was originally called [[radiotelegraphy]] has become so common that it is nearly always called just 'radio' and the associated electromagnetic waves are called ''[[radio wave]]s''. In practice, [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]] are significantly below that of [[visible light]] from about {{val|3|ul=kHz}} to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Electronics By Rudolf F. Graf (1974). Page 467.&lt;/ref&gt; 
}} When radio waves strike an [[electrical conductor]], the oscillating fields induce an [[alternating current]] in the [[conductor]]. The information in the waves can be [[demodulation|extracted]] and transformed back into its original form.

Radio systems need a [[transmitter]] to [[modulation|modulate (change)]] some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it, for example using [[amplitude modulation]] or [[angle modulation]] (which can be [[frequency modulation]] or [[phase modulation]]). Radio systems also need an antenna to convert [[electric current]]s into [[radio wave]]s, and radio waves into an electric current. An antenna can be used for both transmitting and receiving. The [[electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in radios allow individual frequencies to be selected. The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. A [[radio receiver]] receives its input from an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] and converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |title=Radio-Electronics, '&amp;#39;Radio Receiver Technology'&amp;#39; |publisher=Radio-electronics.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio frequencies occupy the range from a 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz, although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;''The Electromagnetic Spectrum'', University of Tennessee, Dept. of Physics and Astronomy&lt;/ref&gt;

A radio [[communication system]] requires a [[transmitter]] and a receiver, each having an antenna and appropriate [[terminal equipment]] such as a [[microphone]] at the transmitter and a [[loudspeaker]] at the receiver in the case of a voice-communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Solid State Physics and Electronics |author=R.

==Etymology==
The term "radio" is derived from the Latin word "radius", meaning "spoke of a wheel, beam of light, ray". It was first applied to communications in 1881 when, at the suggestion of French scientist [[:fr:Ernest Mercadier|Ernest Mercadier]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]] adopted "radiophone" (meaning "radiated sound") as an alternate name for his [[photophone]] optical transmission system.&lt;ref&gt;"Production of Sound by Radiant Energy" by Alexander Graham Bell, ''Popular Science Monthly'', July, 1881, pages 329-330: "[W]e have named the apparatus for the production and reproduction of sound in this way the "photophone", ''because an ordinary beam of light contains the rays which are operative.'' To avoid in future any misunderstandings upon this point, we have decided to adopt the term "''radiophone''", proposed by M. Mercadier, as a general term signifying the production of sound by any form of radiant energy..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, this invention would not be widely adopted.

Following [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s establishment of the existence of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the late 1880s, a variety of terms were initially used for the phenomenon, with early descriptions of the radiation itself including "Hertzian waves", "electric waves", and "ether waves", while phrases describing its use in communications included "spark telegraphy", "space telegraphy", "aerography" and, eventually and most commonly, "wireless telegraphy". However, "wireless" included a broad variety of related electronic technologies, including [[electrostatic induction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and [[Electrical conductor|aquatic and earth conduction]], so there was a need for a more precise term referring exclusively to electromagnetic radiation.

The first use of ''radio-'' in conjunction with electromagnetic radiation appears to have been by French physicist [[Édouard Branly]], who in 1890 developed a version of a [[coherer]] receiver he called a ''[[:fr:radioconducteur|radio-conducteur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Genesis of Wireless Telegraphy" by [[Archie Frederick Collins|A. Frederick Collins]], ''Electrical World and Engineer'', May 10, 1902, page 811.&lt;/ref&gt; The radio- prefix was later used to form additional descriptive compound and hyphenated words, especially in Europe. For example, in early 1898 the British publication ''The Practical Engineer'' included a reference to "the radiotelegraph" and "radiotelegraphy",&lt;ref&gt;"Wireless Telegraphy", ''The Practical Engineer'', February 25, 1898, page 174. "Dr. O. J. Lodge, who preceded Marconi in making experiments in what may be called "ray" telegraphy or radiotelegraphy by a year or two, has devised a new method of sending and receiving the messages. The reader will understand that in the radiotelegraph electric waves forming the signals of the message start from the sending instrument and travel in all directions like rays of light from a lamp, only they are invisible."&lt;/ref&gt; while the French text of both the 1903 and 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Conventions includes the phrases ''radiotélégraphique'' and ''radiotélégrammes''.

The use of "radio" as a standalone word dates back to at least December 30, 1904, when instructions issued by the British Post Office for transmitting telegrams specified that "The word 'Radio'... is sent in the Service Instructions".&lt;ref&gt;"Wireless Telegraphy", ''The Electrical Review'' (London), January 20, 1905, page 108, quoting from the British Post Office's December 30, 1904 ''Post Office Circular''.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was universally adopted, and the word "radio" introduced internationally, by the 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Convention, which included a Service Regulation specifying that "Radiotelegrams shall show in the preamble that the service is 'Radio'".

The switch to "radio" in place of "wireless" took place slowly and unevenly in the English-speaking world. [[Lee de Forest]] helped popularize the new word in the United States—in early 1907 he founded the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and his letter in the June 22, 1907 ''Electrical World'' about the need for legal restrictions warned that "Radio chaos will certainly be the result until such stringent regulation is enforced".&lt;ref&gt;"Interference with Wireless Messages", ''Electrical World'', June 22, 1907, page 1270.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Navy would also play a role. Although its translation of the 1906 Berlin Convention used the terms "wireless telegraph" and "wireless telegram", by 1912 it began to promote the use of "radio" instead. The term started to become preferred by the general public in the 1920s with the introduction of broadcasting. ("Broadcasting" is based upon an agricultural term meaning roughly "scattering seeds widely".) British Commonwealth countries continued to commonly use the term "wireless" until the mid-20th century, though the magazine of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] in the UK has been called ''[[Radio Times]]'' since its founding in the early 1920s.

In recent years the more general term "wireless" has gained renewed popularity, even for devices using electromagnetic radiation, through the rapid growth of short-range computer networking, e.g., [[Wireless LAN|Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)]], [[Wi-Fi]], and Bluetooth, as well as mobile telephony, e.g., [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]] cell phones. Today, the term "radio" specifies the transceiver device or chip, whereas "wireless" refers to the lack of physical connections; thus equipment employs embedded ''radio'' transceivers, but operates as ''wireless'' devices over ''wireless'' sensor networks.

==Processes==
[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Radio communication works by transducer|Radio communication.  Information such as sound is converted by a transducer such as a [[microphone]] to an electrical signal, which modulates a [[radio wave]] sent from a [[transmitter]]. A receiver intercepts the radio wave and extracts the information-bearing electronic signal, which is converted back using another transducer such as a [[loudspeaker|speaker]].]]
Radio systems used for [[telecommunications|communication]] have the following elements. With more than 100 years of development, each process is implemented by a wide range of methods, specialised for different communications purposes.

===Transmitter and modulation===
{{main|Radio transmitter}}
{{see also|Radio transmitter design}}

Each system contains a [[transmitter]]. This consists of a source of electrical energy, producing alternating current of a desired [[frequency]] of oscillation. The transmitter contains a system to [[modulation|modulate (change)]] some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it. This modulation might be as simple as turning the energy on and off, or altering more subtle properties such as amplitude, frequency, phase, or combinations of these properties. The transmitter sends the modulated electrical energy to a tuned [[resonance|resonant]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]; this structure converts the rapidly changing alternating current into an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]] that can move through free space (sometimes with a particular [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]).

[[File:Amfm3-en-de.gif|thumb|right|An audio signal (top) may be carried by an AM or FM radio wave.]]

[[Amplitude modulation]] of a [[carrier wave]] works by varying the strength of the transmitted signal in proportion to the information being sent.  For example, changes in the signal strength can be used to reflect the sounds to be reproduced by a speaker, or to specify the light intensity of television pixels. It was the method used for the first audio radio transmissions, and remains in use today. "AM" is often used to refer to the [[medium wave]] broadcast [[band (electronics)|band]] (see [[AM radio]]), but it is used in various [[radiotelephone]] services such as the [[Citizens band radio|Citizens Band]], [[amateur radio]] and especially in aviation, due to its ability to be received under very weak signal conditions and its immunity to [[capture effect]], allowing more than one signal to be heard simultaneously.

[[Frequency modulation]] varies the [[frequency]] of the carrier. The instantaneous frequency of the carrier is directly proportional to the instantaneous value of the input signal.  FM has the "[[capture effect]]" whereby a receiver only receives the strongest signal, even when others are present.  Digital data can be sent by shifting the carrier's frequency among a set of discrete values, a technique known as [[frequency-shift keying]].  FM is commonly used at [[Very high frequency]] (VHF) [[radio frequencies]] for [[high-fidelity]] [[radio broadcasting|broadcasts]] of music and [[Speech communication|speech]] (see [[FM broadcasting]]). Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM.

[[Angle modulation]] alters the instantaneous [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the carrier wave to transmit a signal.  It may be either FM or [[phase modulation]] (PM).

===Antenna===
{{main|Antenna (radio)}}
[[File:Antenna.jpg|upright|thumb|Rooftop [[television antenna]]s. [[Yagi-Uda antenna]]s like these six are widely used at [[Very High Frequency|VHF]] and [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] frequencies.]]

An ''antenna'' (or ''aerial'') is an electrical device which converts [[electric current]]s into [[radio wave]]s, and vice versa. It is usually used with a [[transmitter|radio transmitter]] or [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]]. In [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. high frequency AC) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]]s (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be [[Amplifier|amplified]].  Some antennas can be used for both transmitting and receiving, even simultaneously, depending on the connected equipment.

===Propagation===
{{main|Radio propagation}}
Once generated, electromagnetic waves travel through space either directly, or have their path altered by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] or [[diffraction]]. The intensity of the waves diminishes due to geometric dispersion (the [[inverse-square law]]); some energy may also be absorbed by the intervening medium in some cases. [[Signal noise|Noise]] will generally alter the desired signal; this [[electromagnetic interference]] comes from natural sources, as well as from artificial sources such as other transmitters and accidental radiators. Noise is also produced at every step due to the inherent properties of the devices used. If the magnitude of the noise is large enough, the desired signal will no longer be discernible; the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] is the fundamental limit to the range of radio communications.

===Resonance===

{{Main|Electrical resonance}}
{{see also|LC circuit}}

[[Electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in radios allow individual stations to be selected. A resonant circuit will respond strongly to a particular frequency, and much less so to differing frequencies. This allows the radio receiver to discriminate between multiple signals differing in frequency.

===Receiver and demodulation===
{{main|Radio receiver}}
{{see also|Radio receiver design|Crystal radio|Communications receiver}}

[[File:Crystal radio receiver.PNG|thumb|A [[Crystal radio|crystal receiver]], consisting of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], adjustable [[electromagnetic coil]], [[cat's whisker|crystal rectifier]], [[capacitor]], [[headphone]]s and [[Ground (electricity)|ground connection]].]]

The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]; this structure captures some of the energy of the wave and returns it to the form of oscillating electrical currents. At the receiver, these currents are [[Demodulation|demodulated]], which is conversion to a usable signal form by a [[Detector (radio)|detector]] sub-system. The receiver is "[[Tuner (electronics)|tuned]]" to respond preferentially to the desired signals, and reject undesired signals.

Early radio systems relied entirely on the energy collected by an antenna to produce signals for the operator. Radio became more useful after the invention of [[electronics|electronic]] devices such as the [[vacuum tube]] and later the [[transistor]], which made it possible to amplify weak signals. Today radio systems are used for applications from [[walkie-talkie]] children's toys to the control of [[Pioneer program|space vehicles]], as well as for broadcasting, and many other applications.

A ''[[radio receiver]]'' receives its input from an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], uses [[electronic filter]]s to separate a wanted radio signal from all other signals picked up by this antenna, [[electronic amplifier|amplifies]] it to a level suitable for further processing, and finally converts through [[demodulation]] and decoding the signal into a form usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |title=Radio-Electronics, '&amp;#39;Radio Receiver Technology'&amp;#39; |publisher=Radio-electronics.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio frequencies occupy the range from a 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz, although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;''The Electromagnetic Spectrum'', University of Tennessee, Dept. of Physics and Astronomy&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of electromagnetic radiation, with frequencies above the RF range, are [[infrared]], visible light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s. Since the energy of an individual [[photon]] of radio frequency is too low to remove an [[electron]] from an [[atom]], radio waves are classified as [[non-ionizing radiation]].

A ''radio communication system'' sends signals by radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wireless Network Performance Handbook |author=Clint Smith, Curt Gervelis |year=2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=0-07-140655-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZAVGBoPevUC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=F4-sSKuzO6XmtgO4393BBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U0g0vtYCOzP0LCCzdRfr7bgKwvTNg#PPA24,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of radio communication systems deployed depend on technology, [[Technical standard|standards]], regulations, [[radio spectrum allocation]], [[User requirements document|user requirements]], [[Positioning (marketing)|service positioning]], and investment.&lt;ref&gt;Macario, R. C. V. (1996). Modern personal radio systems. IEE telecommunications series, 33. London: Institution of Electrical Engineers. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[radio equipment]] involved in [[communication system]]s includes a [[transmitter]] and a receiver, each having an antenna and appropriate [[terminal equipment]] such as a [[microphone]] at the transmitter and a [[loudspeaker]] at the receiver in the case of a voice-communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Solid State Physics and Electronics |author=R. K. Puri |year=2004 |publisher=S. Chand |isbn=81-219-1475-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mmzW0IT6JwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA514&amp;dq=%22radio+communication+system%22+definition&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=LousSKT9Noa2tgOUtpXEBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U3iFs0FzCamdZGWy-eglKfVjuXnAA#PRA1-PA515,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power consumed in a transmitting station varies depending on the distance of communication and the transmission conditions. The power received at the receiving station is usually only a tiny fraction of the transmitter's output, since communication depends on receiving the information, not the energy, that was transmitted.

Classical radio communications systems use [[frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM) as a strategy to split up and share the available [[radio-frequency]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for use by different parties' communications concurrently.  Modern radio communication systems include those that divide up a radio-frequency band by [[time-division multiplexing]] (TDM) and [[code-division multiplexing]] (CDM) as alternatives to the classical FDM strategy.  These systems offer different tradeoffs in supporting multiple users, beyond the FDM strategy that was ideal for broadcast radio but less so for applications such as [[mobile telephony]].

A radio communication system may send information only one way. For example, in broadcasting a single transmitter sends signals to many receivers. Two stations may take turns sending and receiving, using a single radio frequency; this is called "simplex." By using two radio frequencies, two stations may continuously and concurrently send and receive signals - this is called "[[Duplex (telecommunications)|
duplex]]" operation.
&lt;!-- The defining characteristics of a radio communication system are the amount of information it can send per uit of time ([[Bandwidth (telecommunications)|bandwidth]]), the distance, signal to noise ratio, reliability, operator interface --&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of radio}}
In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed mathematically that electromagnetic waves could propagate through free space.&lt;ref&gt;web.pdx.edu/~bseipel/Lecture%20notes%206-%20203%20EMwaves.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of electromagnetic waves (then-unexplained "[[action at a distance]]" sparking behavior) were actually observed before and after Maxwell's work by many inventors and experimenters including [[George Adams (optician, younger)|George Adams]] (1780-1784), [[Luigi Galvani]] (1791), Peter Samuel Munk (1835), [[Joseph Henry]] (1842), Samuel Alfred Varley (1852), [[Edwin Houston]], [[Elihu Thomson]], [[Thomas Edison]] (1875) and [[David Edward Hughes]] (1878).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02564602.1988.11438340 |volume=5 |title=EM Wave Detectors |journal=IETE Technical Review |pages=329–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Sarkar, Robert Mailloux, Arthur A. Oliner, M. Salazar-Palma, Dipak L. Sengupta , History of Wireless, John Wiley &amp; Sons - 2006, pages 258-261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher H. Sterling, Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume, Routledge - 2004, page 831&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anand Kumar Sethi, The Business of Electronics: A Concise History, Palgrave Macmillan - 2013, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Edison gave the effect the name "[[etheric force]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Etheric_Force ieeeghn.org, IEEE Global History Network, Etheric Force]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hughes detected a spark impulse up to 500 yards (460 m) with a portable receiver, but none could identify what caused the phenomenon and it was usually written off as [[electromagnetic induction]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Innovation as a Social Process: Elihu Thomson and the Rise of General Electric, Cambridge University Press - 2003, pages 57-58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] noticed the same sparking phenomenon and, in published experiments (1887-1888), was able to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves in an experiment confirming Maxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]].

The discovery of these "Hertzian waves" (radio waves) prompted many experiments by physicists. An August 1894 lecture by the British physicist [[Oliver Lodge]], where he transmitted and received "Hertzian waves" at distances up to 50 meters, was followed up the same year with experiments by Bengali physicist [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] in [[extremely high frequency]] radio [[microwave]] [[optics]] and a year later with the construction of a radio based lightning detector by Russian physicist [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]]. Starting in late 1894, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began pursuing the idea of building a [[wireless telegraphy]] system based on Hertzian waves (radio). Marconi gained a patent on the system in 1896 and developed it into a commercial communication system over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=320&amp;invol=1 |title=U.S. Supreme Court |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 20th century radio systems transmitted messages by [[continuous wave]] code only. Early attempts at developing a system of [[amplitude modulation]] for voice and music were demonstrated in 1900 and 1906, but had little success. [[World War I]] accelerated the development of radio for [[military communications]], and in this era the first [[vacuum tube]]s were applied to radio transmitters and receivers. Electronic amplification was a key development in changing radio from an experimental practice by experts into a home appliance. After the war, commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s and became an important mass medium for entertainment and news. [[David Sarnoff]], an early exponent of broadcast radio,&lt;ref&gt;Bilby, K. (1986). The General: David Sarnoff and the Rise of the Communications Industry. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; persuaded the [[Radio Corporation of America]] to begin an [[AM broadcasting]] service which rapidly grew in popularity. [[World War II]] again accelerated development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, radio navigation and radar.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jr., R.J. (2011). Crystal Clear: The Struggle for Reliable Communications Technology in World War II, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium. Stereo [[FM broadcasting]] of radio was taking place from the 1930s onwards in the United States and displaced AM as the dominant commercial standard by the 1960s, and by the 1970s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Théberge, P., Devine, K. &amp; Everrett, T. (2015). Living Stereo: Histories and Cultures of Multichannel Sound. New York: Bloomsbury Publishing USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of radio==
{{broader|Radio spectrum#Applications}}
Early uses were maritime, for sending telegraphic messages using [[Morse code]] between ships and land. The earliest users included the Japanese Navy scouting the Russian fleet during the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905. One of the most memorable uses of marine telegraphy was during the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912, including communications between operators on the sinking ship and nearby vessels, and communications to shore stations listing the survivors.

Radio was used to pass on orders and communications between armies and navies on both sides in World War I; Germany used radio communications for diplomatic messages once it discovered that its submarine cables had been tapped by the British. The United States passed on President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] to Germany via radio during the war. Broadcasting began from [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bayarearadio.org/schneider/kqw.shtml |title=The History Of KQW Radio - KCBS |publisher=Bayarearadio.org |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became feasible in the 1920s, with the widespread introduction of radio receivers, particularly in Europe and the United States. Besides broadcasting, point-to-point broadcasting, including telephone messages and relays of radio programs, became widespread in the 1920s and 1930s. Another important application of radio, in the years just before and during World War II, was its development and active use for detecting and locating aircraft and ships by the use of [[radar]] (''RA''dio ''D''etection ''A''nd ''R''anging).

Today, radio takes many forms, including [[wireless network]]s and [[mobile communication]]s of all types, as well as radio broadcasting. Before the advent of television, commercial radio broadcasts included not only news and music, but dramas, comedies, variety shows, and many other forms of entertainment (the era from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s is commonly called radio's "Golden Age"). Radio was unique among methods of dramatic presentation in that it used only sound. For more, see [[radio programming]].

===Audio===

====One-way====
{{main|Radio broadcasting}}

[[File:Bakelite radio.jpg|thumb|Bakelite radio at the Bakelite Museum, Orchard Mill, Williton, Somerset, UK.]]
[[File:Fisher 500 radio.jpg|thumb|A Fisher 500 AM/FM [[hi-fi]] receiver from 1959.]]
AM radio uses amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the transmitted signal is made proportional to the sound amplitude captured (transduced) by the microphone, while the transmitted frequency remains unchanged. Transmissions are affected by static and interference because lightning and other sources of radio emissions on the same frequency add their amplitudes to the original transmitted amplitude.

In the early part of the 20th century, American AM radio stations broadcast with powers as high as 500&amp;nbsp;kW, and some could be heard worldwide; these stations' transmitters were commandeered for military use by the US Government during World War II. Currently, the maximum broadcast power for a civilian AM radio station in the United States and Canada is 50&amp;nbsp;kW, and the majority of stations that emit signals this powerful were grandfathered in (see [[List of 50 kW AM radio stations in the United States]]). In 1986 [[KTNN]] received the last granted 50,000-watt class A license. These 50&amp;nbsp;kW stations are generally called "[[Clear-channel station|clear channel]]" stations (not to be confused with [[Clear Channel Communications]]), because within North America each of these stations has exclusive use of its broadcast frequency throughout part or all of the broadcast day.

[[File:Bush house.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bush House, London|Bush House]], old home of the [[BBC World Service]].]]

FM broadcast radio sends music and voice with less noise than AM radio. It is often mistakenly thought that FM is higher fidelity than AM, but that is not true. AM is capable of the same audio bandwidth that FM employs. AM receivers typically use narrower filters in the receiver to recover the signal with less noise. AM stereo receivers can reproduce the same audio bandwidth that FM does due to the wider filter used in an AM stereo receiver, but today, AM radios limit the audio bandpass to 3–5&amp;nbsp;kHz. In frequency modulation, amplitude variation at the [[microphone]] causes the transmitter frequency to fluctuate. Because the audio signal modulates the frequency and not the amplitude, an FM signal is not subject to static and interference in the same way as AM signals. Due to its need for a wider bandwidth, FM is transmitted in the Very High Frequency (VHF, 30&amp;nbsp;MHz to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz) radio spectrum. &lt;!-- FM requires more radio frequency spectrum than AM and there are more frequencies available at higher frequencies, so there can be more stations, each sending more information. --&gt;

VHF radio waves act more like light, traveling in straight lines; hence the reception range is generally limited to about {{Convert|50|–|200|miles}}. During unusual upper atmospheric conditions, FM signals are occasionally reflected back towards the [[Earth]] by the [[ionosphere]], resulting in [[TV and FM DX|long distance FM reception]]. FM receivers are subject to the [[capture effect]], which causes the radio to only receive the strongest signal when multiple signals appear on the same frequency. FM receivers are relatively immune to lightning and spark interference.

High power is useful in penetrating buildings, diffracting around hills, and refracting in the dense atmosphere near the [[horizon]] for some distance beyond the horizon. Consequently, 100,000-watt FM stations can regularly be heard up to {{Convert|100|miles}}  away, and farther, {{Convert|150|miles}}, if there are no competing signals. A few old, "grandfathered" stations do not conform to these power rules. [[WBCT-FM]] (93.7) in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], US, runs 320,000 watts ERP, and can increase to 500,000 watts ERP by the terms of its original license. Such a huge power level does not usually help to increase range as much as one might expect, because VHF frequencies travel in nearly straight lines over the horizon and off into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/fm-max.html |title=The Most Powerful FM Stations |website=jeff560.tripod.com|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FM subcarrier]] services are secondary signals transmitted in a "piggyback" fashion along with the main program. Special receivers are required to utilize these services. Analog channels may contain alternative programming, such as reading services for the blind, background music or stereo sound signals. In some extremely crowded metropolitan areas, the sub-channel program might be an alternate foreign-language radio program for various ethnic groups. Sub-carriers can also transmit digital data, such as station identification, the current song's name, web addresses, or stock quotes. In some countries, FM radios automatically re-tune themselves to the same channel in a different district by using sub-bands.

====Two-way====
{{main|Two-way radio}}

Aviation voice radios use [[Aircraft band]] VHF AM. AM is used so that multiple stations on the same channel can be received. (Use of FM would result in stronger stations blocking out reception of weaker stations due to FM's [[capture effect]]). Aircraft fly high enough that their transmitters can be received hundreds of miles away, even though they are using VHF.
[[File:Degen de1103.jpg|thumb|Degen DE1103, an advanced world mini-receiver with single sideband modulation and dual conversion]]

Marine voice radios can use [[single sideband]] voice (SSB) in the shortwave [[High frequency|High Frequency]] (HF—3&amp;nbsp;MHz to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) radio spectrum for very long ranges or [[Marine VHF radio]] / ''narrowband FM'' in the VHF spectrum for much shorter ranges. Narrowband FM sacrifices fidelity to make more channels available within the radio spectrum, by using a smaller range of radio frequencies, usually with five kHz of deviation, versus the 75&amp;nbsp;kHz used by commercial FM broadcasts, and 25&amp;nbsp;kHz used for TV sound.

Government, police, fire and commercial voice services also use narrowband FM on special frequencies. Early police radios used AM receivers to receive one-way dispatches. Civil and military HF (high frequency) voice services use [[shortwave]] radio to contact ships at sea, aircraft and isolated settlements. Most use [[single sideband]] voice (SSB), which uses less bandwidth than AM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamuniverse.com/ssbaudio.mp3 |title=Audio example of SSB |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an AM radio SSB sounds like ducks quacking, or the adults in a [[Charlie Brown]] cartoon. Viewed as a graph of frequency versus power, an AM signal shows power where the frequencies of the voice add and subtract with the main radio frequency. SSB cuts the bandwidth in half by suppressing the carrier and one of the sidebands. This also makes the transmitter about three times more powerful, because it doesn't need to transmit the unused carrier and sideband.

TETRA, [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio]] is a digital cell phone system for military, police and ambulances. Commercial services such as [[XM Radio|XM]], [[WorldSpace]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] offer encrypted digital [[satellite radio]].

===Telephony===
Mobile phones transmit to a local [[cell site]] (transmitter/receiver) that ultimately connects to the public switched telephone network ([[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]]) through an optic fiber or microwave radio and other network elements. When the mobile phone nears the edge of the cell site's radio coverage area, the central computer switches the phone to a new cell. Cell phones originally used FM, but now most use either [[GSM]] or [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] digital modulation schemes.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=George M. Calhoun|title=Third Generation Wireless Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVte4vrh89UC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2003|publisher=Artech House|isbn=978-1-58053-583-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satellite phone]]s use satellites rather than cell towers to communicate.

===Video===
Analog television sends the picture as AM and the sound as AM or FM, with the sound carrier a fixed frequency (4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[NTSC]] system) away from the video carrier. Analog television also uses a [[vestigial sideband]] on the video carrier to reduce the bandwidth required.

Digital television uses [[8VSB]] modulation in North America (under the [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] digital television standard), and [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|COFDM]] modulation elsewhere in the world (using the [[DVB-T]] standard). A [[Reed–Solomon error correction]] code adds redundant correction codes and allows reliable reception during moderate data loss. Although many current and future codecs can be sent in the [[MPEG transport stream]] [[container format (digital)|container format]], as of 2006 most systems use a standard-definition format almost identical to DVD: [[MPEG-2]] video in [[Anamorphic widescreen]] and [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MPEG layer 2]] (''MP2'') audio. [[High-definition television]] is possible simply by using a higher-resolution picture, but [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264/AVC]] is being considered as a replacement video codec in some regions for its improved compression. With the compression and improved modulation involved, a single "channel" can contain a high-definition program and several standard-definition programs.

===Navigation===
{{main|Radio navigation}}

All [[satellite navigation]] systems use satellites with precision clocks. The satellite transmits its position, and the time of the transmission. The receiver listens to four satellites, and can figure its position as being on a line that is tangent to a spherical shell around each satellite, determined by the [[time-of-flight]] of the radio signals from the satellite. A computer in the receiver does the math.

[[Radio direction finder|Radio direction-finding]] is the oldest form of radio navigation. Before 1960 navigators used movable loop antennas to locate commercial AM stations near cities. In some cases they used marine radiolocation beacons, which share a range of frequencies just above AM radio with amateur radio operators. [[LORAN]] systems also used time-of-flight radio signals, but from radio stations on the ground.

[[VHF omnidirectional range|Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range]] (VOR), systems (used by aircraft), have an antenna array that transmits two signals simultaneously. A directional signal rotates like a lighthouse at a fixed rate. When the directional signal is facing north, an omnidirectional signal pulses. By measuring the difference in phase of these two signals, an aircraft can determine its bearing or radial from the station, thus establishing a line of position. An aircraft can get readings from two VORs and locate its position at the intersection of the two radials, known as a "[[Position fixing|fix]]."

When the VOR station is collocated with DME ([[Distance measuring equipment|Distance Measuring Equipment]]), the aircraft can determine its bearing and range from the station, thus providing a fix from only one ground station. Such stations are called VOR/DMEs. The military operates a similar system of navaids, called [[TACAN]]s, which are often built into VOR stations. Such stations are called [[VORTAC]]s. Because TACANs include distance measuring equipment, VOR/DME and VORTAC stations are identical in navigation potential to civil aircraft.

===Radar===
{{main|Radar}}
Radar (Radio Detection And Ranging) detects objects at a distance by bouncing radio waves off them. The delay caused by the echo measures the distance. The direction of the beam determines the direction of the reflection. The polarization and frequency of the return can sense the type of surface. Navigational radars scan a wide area two to four times per minute. They use very short waves that reflect from earth and stone. They are common on commercial ships and long-distance commercial aircraft.

General purpose radars generally use navigational radar frequencies, but modulate and polarize the pulse so the receiver can determine the type of surface of the reflector. The best general-purpose radars distinguish the rain of heavy storms, as well as land and vehicles. Some can superimpose sonar data and map data from [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] position.

Search radars scan a wide area with pulses of short radio waves. They usually scan the area two to four times a minute. Sometimes search radars use the [[Doppler effect]] to separate moving vehicles from clutter. Targeting radars use the same principle as search radar but scan a much smaller area far more often, usually several times a second or more. Weather radars resemble search radars, but use radio waves with circular polarization and a wavelength to reflect from water droplets. Some weather radar use the Doppler effect to measure wind speeds.

===Data (digital radio)===
[[File:Radio DAB.JPG|thumb|2008 Pure One Classic digital radio]]

Most new radio systems are digital, including [[Digital television|Digital TV]], satellite radio, and [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]]. The oldest form of digital broadcast was spark gap [[telegraphy]], used by pioneers such Popov&lt;ref&gt;Electronics World, Volume 64, Ziff-Davis Publishing Company – 1960, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; or Marconi. By pressing the key, the operator could send messages in [[Morse code]] by energizing a rotating commutating spark gap. The rotating commutator produced a tone in the receiver, where a simple spark gap would produce a [[Background radiation|hiss]], indistinguishable from static. [[Spark-gap transmitter]]s are now illegal, because their transmissions span several hundred megahertz. This is very wasteful of both radio frequencies and power.

The next advance was continuous wave [[telegraphy]], or CW ([[Continuous wave|Continuous Wave]]), in which a pure radio frequency, produced by a [[vacuum tube]] [[electronic oscillator]] was switched on and off by a key. A receiver with a local oscillator would "[[heterodyne]]" with the pure radio frequency, creating a whistle-like audio tone. CW uses less than 100&amp;nbsp;Hz of bandwidth. CW is still used, these days primarily by amateur radio operators (hams). Strictly, on-off keying of a carrier should be known as "Interrupted Continuous Wave" or ICW or [[on-off keying]] (OOK).

[[Radioteletype]] equipment usually operates on short-wave (HF) and is much loved by the military because they create written information without a skilled operator. They send a bit as one of two tones using [[frequency-shift keying]]. Groups of five or seven bits become a character printed by a teleprinter. From about 1925 to 1975, radioteletype was how most commercial messages were sent to less developed countries. These are still used by the military and weather services.

Aircraft use a 1200 Baud radioteletype service over VHF to send their ID, altitude and position, and get gate and connecting-flight data. Microwave dishes on satellites, telephone exchanges and TV stations usually use [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM). QAM sends data by changing both the phase and the amplitude of the radio signal. Engineers like QAM because it packs the most bits into a radio signal when given an exclusive (non-shared) fixed narrowband frequency range. Usually the bits are sent in "frames" that repeat. A special bit pattern is used to locate the beginning of a frame.
[[File:GPS Receivers.jpg|thumb|right|Modern [[GPS]] receivers.]]
Communication systems that limit themselves to a fixed narrowband frequency range are vulnerable to [[Radio jamming|jamming]]. A variety of jamming-resistant [[spread spectrum]] techniques were initially developed for military use, most famously for [[Global Positioning System]] satellite transmissions. Commercial use of spread spectrum began in the 1980s. [[Bluetooth]], most cell phones, and the 802.11b version of Wi-Fi each use various forms of spread spectrum.

Systems that need reliability, or that share their frequency with other services, may use "coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing" or [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|COFDM]]. COFDM breaks a digital signal into as many as several hundred slower subchannels. The digital signal is often sent as QAM on the subchannels. Modern COFDM systems use a small computer to make and decode the signal with [[digital signal processing]], which is more flexible and far less expensive than older systems that implemented separate electronic channels.

COFDM resists [[fading]] and [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] because the narrow-channel QAM signals can be sent slowly. An adaptive system, or one that sends error-correction codes can also resist interference, because most interference can affect only a few of the QAM channels. COFDM is used for Wi-Fi, some cell phones, [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], [[Eureka 147]], and many other local area network, digital TV and radio standards.

===Heating===
{{main|Radio-frequency heating}}
Radio-frequency energy generated for heating of objects is generally not intended to radiate outside of the generating equipment, to prevent interference with other radio signals. [[Microwave oven]]s use intense radio waves to heat food. [[Dielectric heating|Diathermy]] equipment is used in surgery for sealing of blood vessels.

===Amateur radio service===
[[File:NX1Z Radio.jpg|thumb|[[Amateur radio station]] with multiple receivers and transceivers]]
[[Amateur radio]], also known as "ham radio", is a [[hobby]] in which enthusiasts are licensed to communicate on a number of bands in the [[radio frequency spectrum]] non-commercially and for their own experiments. They may also provide emergency and service assistance in exceptional circumstances. This contribution has been very beneficial in saving lives in many instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2004/12/29/100/?nc=1 |title=''Amateur Radio "Saved Lives" in South Asia'' |publisher=Arrl.org |date=2004-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013184249/http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2004/12/29/100/?nc=1 |archivedate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio amateurs use a variety of modes, including efficient ones like [[Morse code]] and experimental ones like [[Lowfer|Low-Frequency Experimental Radio]]. Several forms of radio were pioneered by radio amateurs and later became commercially important, including FM, [[Single sideband|single-sideband]] (SSB), AM, digital packet radio and [[amateur radio satellite|satellite repeaters]]. Some amateur frequencies may be disrupted illegally by [[Power line communication|power-line internet service]].

===Unlicensed radio services===
Unlicensed, government-authorized personal radio services such as [[Citizens' band radio]] in Australia, most of the Americas, and Europe, and [[Family Radio Service]] and [[Multi-Use Radio Service]] in North America exist to provide simple, usually short range communication for individuals and small groups, without the overhead of licensing. Similar services exist in other parts of the world. These radio services involve the use of handheld units.

Wi-Fi also operates in unlicensed radio bands and is very widely used to network computers.

Free radio stations, sometimes called [[pirate radio]] or "clandestine" stations, are unauthorized, unlicensed, illegal broadcasting stations. These are often low power transmitters operated on sporadic schedules by hobbyists, community activists, or political and cultural dissidents. Some pirate stations operating offshore in parts of Europe and the United Kingdom more closely resembled legal stations, maintaining regular schedules, using high power, and selling commercial advertising time.&lt;ref&gt;''Free radio: electronic civil disobedience'' by Lawrence C. Soley. Published by Westview Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8133-9064-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8133-9064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Radio: The Full Story of British Pirate Radio'' by John Hind, Stephen Mosco. Published by Pluto Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-7453-0055-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7453-0055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio control (RC)===
[[Radio control|Radio remote controls]] use radio waves to transmit control data to a remote object as in some early forms of [[guided missile]], some early TV remotes and a range of model boats, [[Radio-controlled car|cars]] and airplanes. Large industrial remote-controlled equipment such as [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and switching [[locomotive]]s now usually use digital radio techniques to ensure safety and reliability.

In [[Madison Square Garden]], at the Electrical Exhibition of 1898, [[Nikola Tesla]] successfully demonstrated a radio-controlled boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ins/lab_remotec.html |title=Tesla - Master of Lightning: Remote Control |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded U.S. patent No. 613,809 for a "Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vessels or Vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/613809.html |title=Tesla - Master of Lightning: Selected Tesla Patents |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Tudományos Akadémia Nyelvtudományi Intézete}})  was created in 1949, is under supervision of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] since 1951. Its primary tasks include research in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] [[linguistics]], general, theoretical and applied linguistics, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] linguistics, and [[phonetics]], as well as the preparation of a comprehensive [[dictionary]] of the Hungarian language, and the maintenance of its archive materials. Other research projects investigate various aspects and different variants of Hungarian. Further tasks include the assembly of linguistic corpora and databases, and laying the linguistic groundwork for computational software and applications. The Institute also operates a public advice service on language and linguistics, prepares expert reports on relevant affairs on demand, and runs the Theoretical Linguistics Undergraduate and Doctoral Program jointly with [[Eötvös Loránd University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1795">The '''Royal Proclamation Against Seditious Writings and Publications''' was issued by [[George III of Great Britain]] on 21 May 1792 in response to the growth of [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] in Britain inspired by the [[French Revolution]], in particular the phenomenal popularity of [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Philp (ed.), ''Thomas Paine: Rights of Man, Common Sense and Other Political Writings'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April a group of [[Foxite]] [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] MPs formed the [[Society of the Friends of the People]] to agitate for parliamentary reform, which alarmed the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]].&lt;ref&gt;John Ehrman, ''The Younger Pitt. The Reluctant Transition'' (London: Constable, 1983), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The draft of the Proclamation had been shown to Opposition leaders and incorporated their criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt had given a draft to the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]], who showed it to Fox and other Whigs.

The historian [[John Ehrman]] said that while the Proclamation was not occasioned solely by the ''Rights of Man'' it was nevertheless "a remarkable tribute to a single book".&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Proclamation, enforced at a local level by magistrates, had some success at limiting radical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine responded to the Proclamation by publishing the ''Letter Addressed to the Addressers on the Late Proclamation''.&lt;ref&gt;Philp, pp. 333-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SHRDLU''' was an early  [[natural language understanding]] [[computer program]], developed by [[Terry Winograd]] at [[MIT]] in 1968–1970. In it, the user carries on a conversation with the computer, moving objects, naming collections and querying the state of a simplified "[[blocks world]]", essentially a virtual box filled with different blocks.

SHRDLU was written in the [[Planner programming language|Micro Planner]] and [[Lisp programming language]] on the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-6]] computer and a DEC graphics [[computer terminal|terminal]]. Later additions were made at the [[computer graphics]] labs at the [[University of Utah]], adding a full 3D rendering of SHRDLU's "world".

The name SHRDLU was derived from [[ETAOIN SHRDLU]], the arrangement of the letter keys on a [[Linotype machine]], arranged in descending order of usage frequency in English.

==Functionality==
SHRDLU was primarily a language parser that allowed [[Natural language user interface|user interaction using English terms]]. The user instructed SHRDLU to move various objects around in the "blocks world" containing various basic objects: blocks, cones, balls, etc. What made SHRDLU unique was the combination of four simple ideas that added up to make the simulation of "understanding" far more convincing.

One was that SHRDLU's world was so simple that the entire set of objects and locations could be described by including as few as perhaps 50 words:  nouns like "block" and "cone", verbs like "place on" and "move to", and adjectives like "big" and "blue". The possible combinations of these basic language building blocks were quite simple, and the program was fairly adept at figuring out what the user meant.

SHRDLU also included a basic memory to supply context. One could ask SHRDLU to "put the green cone on the red block" and then "take the cone off"; "the cone" would be taken to mean the green cone one had just talked about. SHRDLU could search back further through the interactions to find the proper context in most cases when additional adjectives were supplied. One could also ask questions about the history, for instance one could ask "did you pick up anything before the cone?"

A side effect of this memory, and the original rules SHRDLU was supplied with, is that the program could answer questions about what was possible in the world and what was not. For instance, SHRDLU would deduce that blocks could be stacked by looking for examples, but would realize that triangles couldn't be stacked, after having tried it. The "world" contained basic [[physics]] to make blocks fall over, independent of the language [[parser]].

Finally, SHRDLU could also remember names given to objects, or arrangements of them. For instance one could say "a steeple is a small triangle on top of a tall rectangle"; SHRDLU could then answer questions about steeples in the blocks world, and build new ones.

Here is a famous demonstration of SHRDLU:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/|title=SHRDLU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

:Person: Pick up a big red block.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Grasp the pyramid.
:Computer: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH PYRAMID YOU MEAN.
:Person (changing their mind): Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box.
:Computer: BY "IT", I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER THAN THE ONE I AM HOLDING.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: What does the box contain?
:Computer: THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLUE BLOCK.
:Person: What is the pyramid supported by?
:Computer: THE BOX.
:Person: How many blocks are not in the box?
:Computer: FOUR OF THEM.
:Person: Is at least one of them narrower than the one which i told you to pick up?
:Computer: YES, THE RED CUBE.
:Person: Is it supported?
:Computer: YES, BY THE TABLE.
:Person: Can the table pick up blocks?
:Computer: NO.
:Person: Can a pyramid be supported by a block?
:Computer: YES.
:Person: Can a pyramid support a pyramid?
:Computer: I DON'T KNOW.
:Person: Stack up two pyramids.
:Computer: I CAN'T.
:Person: Will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid?
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Which cube is sitting on the table?
:Computer: THE LARGE GREEN ONE WHICH SUPPORTS THE RED PYRAMID.
:Person: Is there a large block behind a pyramid?
:Computer: YES, THREE OF THEM: A LARGE RED ONE, A LARGE GREEN CUBE, AND THE BLUE ONE.
:Person: Put a small one onto the green cube which supports a pyramid.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Put the littlest pyramid on top of it.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Does the shortest thing the tallest pyramid's support supports support anything green?
:Computer: YES, THE GREEN PYRAMID.
:Person: What color is it?
:Computer: BY "IT", I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SHORTEST THING THE TALLEST PYRAMID'S SUPPORT SUPPORTS.
:Computer: RED
:Person: How many things are on top of green cubes?
:Computer: I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY "ON TOP OF "IN THE PHRASE "ON TOP OF GREEN CUBES " .
:DO YOU MEAN:
:
:1 - DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE
:2 - ANWHERE ON TOP OF ?
:
:Person: 2
:Computer: THREE OF THEM.
:Person: Had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the little cube?
:Computer: YES, THE GREEN ONE.
:Person: When did you pick it up?
:Computer: WHILE I WAS STACKING UP THE RED CUBE, A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE.
:Person: Why?
:Computer: TO GET RID OF IT.
:Person: Why did you do that?
:Computer: TO CLEAN OFF THE RED CUBE.
:Person: Why did you clear off that cube?
:Computer: TO PUT IT ON A LARGE GREEN CUBE.
:Person: Why did you do that?
:Computer: TO STACK UP THE RED CUBE , A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE.
:Person: Why did you do that?
:Computer: BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO.
:Person: How did you do it?
:Computer: BY PUTTING A LARGE RED BLOCK ON THE TABLE ; THEN LETTING GO OF IT ; THEN PUTTING A LARGE GREEN CUBE ON IT ; THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE ; THEN PUTTING THE RED CUBE ON THAT CUBE; THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE.
:Person: How many objects did you touch while you were doing it?
:Computer: FOUR OF THEM.
:Person: What did the red cube support before you started to clean it off?
:Computer: THE GREEN PYRAMID.
:Person: There were five blocks to the left of the box then.
:Computer: NO, ONLY FOUR OF THEM: THE RED CUBE, TWO LARGE GREEN CUBES AND A LARGE RED BLOCK.
:Person: Put the blue pyramid on the block in the box.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Is there anything which is bigger than every pyramid but is not as wide as the thing that supports it?
:Computer: YES, THE BLUE BLOCK.
:Person: Does a steeple
:Computer (interrupting): SORRY, I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STEEPLE".
:Person: A "steeple" is a stack which contains two green cubes and a pyramid.
:Computer: I UNDERSTAND.
:Person: Are there any steeples now?
:Computer: NO.
:Person: Build one.
:Computer: OK.

==Consequences==
SHRDLU was considered a tremendously successful demonstration of [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]. This led other AI researchers to excessive optimism which was soon lost when later systems attempted to deal with situations with a more realistic level of ambiguity and complexity. Subsequent efforts of the SHRDLU type, such as [[Cyc]], have tended to focus on providing the program with considerably more information from which it can draw conclusions.

Though not intentionally developed as such, SHRDLU is considered the first known formal example of [[interactive fiction]], as the user interacts with simple commands to move objects around a virtual environment, though lacking the distinct story-telling normally present in interactive fiction. The 1976-1977 game ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' is broadly considered to be the first true work of interactive fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Montfort | first = Nick | year = 2003 | title = Twisty Little Passages: An Approach To Interactive Fiction | publisher = Cambridge: The MIT Press | isbn = 0-262-13436-5| pages = 84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saltego trans Jarmiloj''''' (English: ''Leap across the Millennia'') is the second novel originally written in Esperanto by [[Jean Forge]].  It appeared in 1924 (192 pages).  It is a fantasy, whose characters are transported out of our time into a past epoch.  Written in a simple lively style, despite its humor and other attractions, it does not reach the level of Forge's first novel, ''[[Abismoj]].''

The '''Senagi''' languages are a small independent [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]] in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]], that had been part of [[Stephen Wurm]]'s [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] proposal.

The Angor language is unusual in that it distinguishes gender in the second- and third-person [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and plural ''(you'' and ''they),'' but not in the singular. It is not clear if Dera does the same.

==Classification==
The Senagi family consists of only two languages:

* '''Senagi''' family: [[Angor language|Angor]], [[Dera language|Dera]]

The most promising external links are with the [[Sepik languages|Sepik]] and [[Torricelli languages|Torricelli]] languages. The pronoun for "I" is reconstructed as ''*wan'' for both proto-Senagi and proto-Sepik, while the Angor masculine dual and plural pronominal suffixes ''-fa-'' and ''-mu-'' appear to reflect the proto-Sepik and proto-Torricelli dual and plural pronominal suffixes ''*-p'' and ''*-m.''

In [[site construction]], as in construction development, a '''soil stockpile''' is formed with soil ''excavated'' to provide proper building elevations.  Stockpiled soil is later replaced to contour the surface to the desired ''[[Grade (slope)|grade]]'', or the material is used for reclamation/restoration of the region following the removal of all roads and facilities.

[[File:Stella14.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Vermont copper|Vermont copper coinage]] with the motto ''STELLA QUARTA DECIMA.'']]
'''''Stella quarta decima''''' ([[Latin]] for "The Fourteenth Star") is a motto appearing on [[Vermont copper|Vermont copper coinage]] struck in 1785 and 1786. The coins were issued during the period when [[Vermont]] was an independent state (1777–1791), sometimes referred to as the [[Vermont Republic]].

The motto appears on the reverse of the coin and  encircles a corona of 13 small stars representing the existing [[U.S. state]]s, with a large central star with an eye contained within. The motto expresses the then independent state's aspiration to join the United States as the fourteenth. The [[United States Congress]] [[Admission to the Union|admitted]] Vermont into the Union, as the fourteenth state, on March 4, 1791.

"Stella quarta decima fulgeat" became the official state motto on April 10, 2015. The [[Latin]] words translate as "May the 14th star shine bright."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcax.com/story/28771780/vermonts-new-latin-motto-becomes-official State motto becomes official]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">'''Submaximal performance testing''' is a way of estimating either VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max or "aerobic fitness" in [[sports medicine]]. The test protocols do not reach the maximum of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Submaximal tests are used because maximal tests can be dangerous in individuals who are not considered normal healthy subjects and for elite athletes maximal tests would disrupt training load balance.&lt;ref name="LSCT"&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38208">'''Text mining''', also referred to as '''''text data mining''''', roughly equivalent to '''text analytics''', is the process of deriving high-quality [[information]] from [[Plain text|text]]. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as [[pattern recognition|statistical pattern learning]]. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a [[database]]), deriving patterns within the [[structured data]], and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]], [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], and interest. Typical text mining tasks include [[text categorization]], [[text clustering]], concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, [[sentiment analysis]], [[document summarization]], and entity relation modeling (''i.e.'', learning relations between [[named entity recognition|named entities]]).

Text analysis involves [[information retrieval]], [[lexical analysis]] to study word frequency distributions, [[pattern recognition]], [[tag (metadata)|tagging]]/[[annotation]], [[information extraction]], [[data mining]] techniques including link and association analysis, [[information visualization|visualization]], and [[predictive analytics]]. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) and analytical methods.

A typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a [[natural language]] and either model the document set for [[predictive classification]] purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.

The term '''text analytics''' describes a set of [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[statistical]], and [[machine learning]] techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for [[business intelligence]], [[exploratory data analysis]], [[research]], or investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/blog/archives/2007/02/defining_text_a.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129171151/http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/blog/archives/2007/02/defining_text_a.html |date=November 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, [[Ronen Feldman]] modified a 2000 description of "text mining"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dunja/CFPWshKDD2000.html |title=KDD-2000 Workshop on Text Mining - Call for Papers |publisher=Cs.cmu.edu |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 to describe "text analytics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ir.iit.edu/cikm2004/tutorials.html#T2]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303042253/http://www.ir.iit.edu/cikm2004/tutorials.html#T2 |date=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while "text mining" is used in some of the earliest application areas, dating to the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.3115/991813.991833 |title=Proceedings of the 9th conference on Computational linguistics |year=1982 |last1=Hobbs |first1=Jerry R. |last2=Walker |first2=Donald E. |last3=Amsler |first3=Robert A. |volume=1 |pages=127–32|chapter=Natural language access to structured text }}&lt;/ref&gt; notably life-sciences research and government intelligence.

The term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems, whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded, numerical data. It is a truism that 80 percent of business-relevant information originates in unstructured form, primarily text.&lt;ref name="breakthroughanalysis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2008/08/01/unstructured-data-and-the-80-percent-rule/ |title=Unstructured Data and the 80 Percent Rule |publisher=Breakthrough Analysis |accessdate=2015-02-23|date=August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge – facts, [[business rule]]s, and relationships – that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.

==Text analysis processes==
Subtasks—components of a larger text-analytics effort—typically include:

*[[Information retrieval]] or identification of a [[text corpus|corpus]] is a preparatory step: collecting or identifying a set of textual materials, on the Web or held in a file system, database, or content [[corpus manager]], for analysis.
* Although some text analytics systems apply exclusively advanced statistical methods, many others apply more extensive [[natural language processing]], such as [[part of speech tagging]], syntactic [[parsing]], and other types of linguistic analysis.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
*[[Named entity recognition]] is the use of gazetteers or statistical techniques to identify named text features: people, organizations, place names, stock ticker symbols, certain abbreviations, and so on.
* Disambiguation—the use of contextual clues—may be required to decide where, for instance, "Ford" can refer to a former U.S. president, a vehicle manufacturer, a movie star, a river crossing, or some other entity.
* Recognition of Pattern Identified Entities: Features such as telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, quantities (with units) can be discerned via regular expression or other pattern matches.
*Document clustering: identification of sets of similar text documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Wui Lee|last2=Tay|first2=Kai Meng|last3=Lim|first3=Chee Peng|date=2017-02-06|title=A New Evolving Tree-Based Model with Local Re-learning for Document Clustering and Visualization|journal=Neural Processing Letters|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=379–409|doi=10.1007/s11063-017-9597-3|issn=1370-4621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Coreference]]: identification of [[noun phrase]]s and other terms that refer to the same object.
* Relationship, fact, and event Extraction: identification of associations among entities and other information in text
*[[Sentiment analysis]] involves discerning subjective (as opposed to factual) material and extracting various forms of attitudinal information: sentiment, opinion, mood, and emotion. Text analytics techniques are helpful in analyzing, sentiment at the entity, concept, or topic level and in distinguishing opinion holder and opinion object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2010/06/14/2514/ |title=Full Circle Sentiment Analysis |publisher=Breakthrough Analysis |accessdate=2015-02-23|date=2010-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quantitative text analysis is a set of techniques stemming from the social sciences where either a human judge or a computer extracts semantic or grammatical relationships between words in order to find out the meaning or stylistic patterns of, usually, a casual personal text for the purpose of [[psychological profiling]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1037/11383-011 |title=Handbook of multimethod measurement in psychology |year=2006 |last1=Mehl |first1=Matthias R. |isbn=978-1-59147-318-3 |page=141|chapter=Quantitative Text Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Text mining technology is now broadly applied to a wide variety of government, research, and business needs. All three groups may use text mining for records management and searching documents relevant to their daily activities. Legal professionals may use text mining for [[e-discovery]]. Governments and military groups use text mining for [[national security]] and intelligence purposes. Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data (i.e., addressing the problem of [[unstructured data]]), to determine ideas communicated through text (e.g., [[sentiment analysis]] in [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pang|first=Bo|last2=Lee|first2=Lillian|date=2008|title=Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis|journal=Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval|volume=2|issue=1–2|pages=1–135|doi=10.1561/1500000011|issn=1554-0669|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.2755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paltoglou|first=Georgios|last2=Thelwall|first2=Mike|date=2012-09-01|title=Twitter, MySpace, Digg: Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis in Social Media|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2337542.2337551|journal=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)|volume=3|issue=4|pages=66|doi=10.1145/2337542.2337551|issn=2157-6904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task4/|title=Sentiment Analysis in Twitter &lt; SemEval-2017 Task 4|website=alt.qcri.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and to support [[scientific discovery]] in fields such as the [[life sciences]] and [[bioinformatics]]. In business, applications are used to support [[competitive intelligence]] and automated [[ad serving|ad placement]], among numerous other activities.

===Security applications===
Many text mining software packages are marketed for [[security appliance|security applications]], especially monitoring and analysis of online plain text sources such as [[Internet news]], [[blog]]s, etc. for [[national security]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-88181-0_7 |title=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Security for Information Systems CISIS'08 |series=Advances in Soft Computing |year=2009 |last1=Zanasi |first1=Alessandro |isbn=978-3-540-88180-3 |volume=53 |page=53|chapter=Virtual Weapons for Real Wars: Text Mining for National Security }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also involved in the study of text [[encryption]]/[[decryption]].

===Software applications===
Text mining methods and software is also being researched and developed by major firms, including [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]], to further automate the mining and analysis processes, and by different firms working in the area of search and indexing in general as a way to improve their results.
Within public sector much effort has been concentrated on creating software for tracking and monitoring [[Information Awareness Office|terrorist activities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/texor-a-chat-mining-program.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224652/http://yatsko.zohosites.com/texor-a-chat-mining-program.html |date=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online media applications===
Text mining is being used by large media companies, such as the [[Tribune Company]], to clarify information and to provide readers with greater search experiences, which in turn increases site "stickiness" and revenue. Additionally, on the back end, editors are benefiting by being able to share, associate and package news across properties, significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content.

===Business and marketing applications===
Text mining is starting to be used in marketing as well, more specifically in analytical [[customer relationship management]].&lt;ref name="Text Analytics: The “Why” Behind the Score"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medallia.com/text-analytics/ |title=Text Analytics |publisher=Medallia |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coussement and Van den Poel (2008)&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:08/502 |title=Integrating the voice of customers through call center emails into a decision support system for churn prediction |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Information &amp; Management |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=164–74|citeseerx=10.1.1.113.3238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2007.10.010 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:07/481 |title=Improving customer complaint management by automatic email classification using linguistic style features as predictors |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=870–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; apply it to improve [[predictive analytics]] models for customer churn ([[customer attrition]]).&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005" /&gt; Text mining is also being applied in stock returns prediction.&lt;ref name="Galvez2017"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750317300091 | title=Assessing the usefulness of online message board mining in automatic stock prediction systems |author1=Ramiro H.

&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

Text has been used to detect emotions in the related area of affective computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/T-AFFC.2010.1 |title=Affect Detection: An Interdisciplinary Review of Models, Methods, and Their Applications |year=2010 |last1=Calvo |first1=Rafael A |last2=d'Mello |first2=Sidney |journal=IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=18–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text based approaches to affective computing have been used on multiple corpora such as students evaluations, children stories and news stories.

===Scientific literature mining and academic applications===

The issue of text mining is of importance to publishers who hold large [[database]]s of information needing [[index (database)|indexing]] for retrieval. This is especially true in scientific disciplines, in which highly specific information is often contained within written text. Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature's]] proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s common Journal Publishing [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access.

Academic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:

* The [[National Centre for Text Mining]] (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. NaCTeM is operated by the [[University of Manchester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk |title=The University of Manchester |publisher=Manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in close collaboration with the Tsujii Lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html |title=Tsujii Laboratory |publisher=Tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html |title=The University of Tokyo |publisher=UTokyo |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; NaCTeM provides customised tools, research facilities and offers advice to the academic community. They are funded by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and two of the UK [[Research Council]]s ([[EPSRC]] &amp; [[BBSRC]]). With an initial focus on text mining in the [[biology|biological]] and [[biomedical]] sciences, research has since expanded into the areas of [[social sciences]].
* In the United States, the [[UC Berkeley School of Information|School of Information]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] is developing a program called BioText to assist [[biology]] researchers in text mining and analysis.
* The [[Text Analysis Portal for Research]] (TAPoR), currently housed at the [[University of Alberta]], is a scholarly project to catalogue text analysis applications and create a gateway for researchers new to the practice.

==== Methods for scientific literature mining ====
Computational methods have been developed to assist with information retrieval from scientific literature. Published approaches include methods for searching,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shen|first=Jiaming|last2=Xiao|first2=Jinfeng|last3=He|first3=Xinwei|last4=Shang|first4=Jingbo|last5=Sinha|first5=Saurabh|last6=Han|first6=Jiawei|date=2018-06-27|title=Entity Set Search of Scientific Literature: An Unsupervised Ranking Approach|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3209978.3210055|publisher=ACM|pages=565–574|doi=10.1145/3209978.3210055|isbn=9781450356572}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining novelty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Lothar|last2=Radauer|first2=Alfred|last3=Moehrle|first3=Martin G.|date=2017-02-06|title=The beauty of brimstone butterfly: novelty of patents identified by near environment analysis based on text mining|journal=Scientometrics|language=en|volume=111|issue=1|pages=103–115|doi=10.1007/s11192-017-2267-4|issn=0138-9130}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and clarifying [[Homonym|homonyms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roll|first=Uri|last2=Correia|first2=Ricardo A.|last3=Berger-Tal|first3=Oded|date=2018-03-10|title=Using machine learning to disentangle homonyms in large text corpora|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=716–724|doi=10.1111/cobi.13044|pmid=29086438|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; among technical reports.

=== Digital humanities and computational sociology ===
The automatic analysis of vast textual corpora has created the possibility for scholars to analyze
millions of documents in multiple languages with very limited manual intervention. Key enabling technologies have been parsing, machine translation, topic categorization, and machine learning.

[[File:Tripletsnew2012.png|thumb|right|Narrative network of US Elections 2012&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Automated analysis of the US presidential elections using Big Data and network analysis; S Sudhahar, GA Veltri, N Cristianini; Big Data &amp; Society 2 (1), 1-28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data.  The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora; S Sudhahar, G De Fazio, R Franzosi, N Cristianini; Natural Language Engineering, 1-32, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Quantitative Narrative Analysis; Roberto Franzosi; Emory University © 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[Content analysis]] has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a "[[big data]]" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. [[Gender bias]], [[readability]], content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lansdall-Welfare|first=Thomas|last2=Sudhahar|first2=Saatviga|last3=Thompson|first3=James|last4=Lewis|first4=Justin|last5=Team|first5=FindMyPast Newspaper|last6=Cristianini|first6=Nello|date=2017-01-09|title=Content analysis of 150 years of British periodicals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1606380114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=4|language=en|pages=E457–E465|doi=10.1073/pnas.1606380114|issn=0027-8424|pmid=28069962|pmc=5278459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.

===Situation in Europe===
[[File:FixCopyright- Copyright &amp; Research - Text &amp; Data Mining (TDM) Explained.webm|thumb|Video by Fix Copyright campaign explaining TDM and its copyright issues in the EU, 2016 [3:52]]Because of a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and [[Database Directive|database law]], the mining of in-copyright works (such as [[web mining]]) without the permission of the copyright owner is illegal.  In the UK in 2014, on the recommendation of the [[Hargreaves review]] the government amended copyright law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609020315/http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ |date=June 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow text mining as a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitation and exception]]. It was only the second country in the world to do so, following [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan]], which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009. However, owing to the restriction of the [[Copyright Directive]], the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.

The [[European Commission]] facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and [[data mining]] in 2013, under the title of Licenses for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licences for Europe - Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013|url=http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/about-site|website=European Commission|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the focus on the solution to this legal issue was licenses, and not limitations and exceptions to copyright law, led representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and [[open access]] publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text and Data Mining:Its importance and the need for change in Europe|url=http://libereurope.eu/news/text-and-data-mining-its-importance-and-the-need-for-change-in-europe/|website=[[Association of European Research Libraries]]|accessdate=14 November 2014|date=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in the United States===
By contrast to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, and in particular [[fair use]], means that text mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea, is viewed as being legal. As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one such use being text and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books — a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Until recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a [[semantic web]], text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events.  For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or [[counter-intelligence]].  In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an [[intelligence analyst]] or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email [[spam filter]]s as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial [[market sentiment]].

==Future==
Increasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining: the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning. Popular text analytics tools includes [[Accern]], [[Lexalytics]], and Repustate. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.efinancialcareers.com/ch-en/285462/the-top-big-data-companies-to-work-for-by-j-p-morgan|title=43 of the top big data companies to work for, by J.P. Morgan|date=2017-06-01|work=eFinancialCareers|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in "unstructured" form has been recognized for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics by Seth Grimes|date=2007-10-30|publisher=Beyenetwork|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognized in the earliest definition of [[business intelligence]] (BI), in an October 1958 IBM Journal article by H.P. Luhn, A Business Intelligence System, which describes a system that will:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the 'action points' in an organization. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s, and as BI emerged in the '80s and '90s as a software category and field of practice, the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases. This is not surprising: text in "unstructured" documents is hard to process. The emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application, as described by Prof. Marti A. Hearst in the paper Untangling Text Data Mining:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics|last1=Hearst|first1=Marti A.|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55860-609-8|pages=3–10|chapter=Untangling text data mining|doi=10.3115/1034678.1034679|chapter-url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/acl99/acl99-tdm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms. In this paper, I have attempted to suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself. I suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hearst's 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14781">The '''''Winnipeg Statement''''' is the [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]]' statement on the encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' from a [[plenary session|plenary assembly]] held at [[Saint Boniface, Manitoba|Saint Boniface]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].{{citation needed |date=May 2018 |reason=The city of Saint Boniface wasn't part of Winnipeg until 1971}} Published on September 27, 1968, it is the Canadian bishops' controversial document about [[Pope Paul VI]]'s July 1968 encyclical on human life and the regulation of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://therosarium.ca/indextemps/winnipeg.html Winnipeg Statement (together with opposing editorial commentary)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some bishops within the [[Catholic Church in Canada]] had already made moves to dissent from traditional [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] teaching on contraception.  An expert, or [[peritus]], accompanying the Canadian bishops to the [[Second Vatican Council]], [[Gregory Baum]] was a prominent dissident on the subject and at the third session of Vatican II Cardinal [[Paul-Émile Léger]] of Montreal advocated that the duty to bearing children should be a duty pertaining to the state of matrimony as a whole rather than to an individual act, saying that "Confessors are assailed by doubts. They no longer know what to answer."&lt;ref name="dissent"&gt;Page 2 Foy, Msgr. Vincent (1988).  "[http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2004_docs/tragedyatwinnipeg.pdf Tragedy at Winnipeg]" ''Challenge Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Published two months after ''[[Humanae vitae]]'', the Winnipeg Statement was an attempt by the [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]] to address widespread concern within the church about the prohibition of all forms of [[artificial contraception]], and to counsel its members on how to respond to those who have difficulty accepting the directives.

It recognized that "a certain number of Catholics", in spite of being bound by the encyclical, find it "either extremely difficult or even impossible to make their own all elements of this doctrine". These
{{quote|should not be considered, or consider themselves, shut off from the body of the faithful. But they should remember that their good faith will be dependent on a sincere self-examination to determine the true motives and grounds for such suspension of assent and on continued effort to understand and deepen their knowledge of the teaching of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (Sep. 27, 1968). ''[http://www.catholic-legate.com/articles/winnipeg.html Canadian Bishops' Statement on the Encyclical "Humanae vitae"]'' (para. 17). Public statement.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
With regard to those in that situation, "the confessor or counsellor must show sympathetic understanding and reverence for the sincere good faith of those who fail in their effort to accept some point of the encyclical."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (Sep. 27, 1968). ''[http://www.catholic-legate.com/articles/winnipeg.html Canadian Bishops' Statement on the Encyclical "Humanae vitae"]'' (para. 25).&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 26 stated:
{{quote|In accord with the accepted principles of moral theology, if these persons have tried sincerely but without success to pursue a line of conduct in keeping with the given directives, they may be safely assured that, ''whoever honestly chooses that course which seems right to him does so in good conscience'' [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (Sep. 27, 1968). ''[http://www.catholic-legate.com/articles/winnipeg.html Canadian Bishops' Statement on the Encyclical "Humanae vitae"]'' (para. 26).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In its conclusion, the document referred to the moment of the publication of the encyclical as an "hour of crisis", but added:
{{quote|The unity of the Church does not consist in a bland conformity in all ideas, but rather in a union of faith and heart, in submission to God's will and a humble but honest and ongoing search for the truth.&amp;nbsp;... We stand in union with the Bishop of Rome the successor of Peter, the sign and contributing cause of our unity with Christ and with one another. But this very union postulates such a love of the Church that we can do no less than to place all of our love and all of our intelligence at its service. If this sometimes means that in our desire to make the Church more intelligible and more beautiful we must, as pilgrims do, falter in the way or differ as to the way, no one should conclude that our common faith is lost or our loving purpose blunted.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (Sep. 27, 1968). ''[http://www.catholic-legate.com/articles/winnipeg.html Canadian Bishops' Statement on the Encyclical "Humanae vitae"]'' (para. 34).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==
Although many [[episcopal conference]]s published statements regarding ''Humanae vitae'', it is the Canadian bishops' statement which has been the subject of the most controversy, as has been widely interpreted as a loophole whereby Catholics may feel permitted to use [[birth control]]. Central to the debate is the role and importance of personal religious freedom of [[conscience]].

===Support===
Some see the statement as an honest [[pastoral care|pastoral]] attempt to maintain unity in the Canadian church. As Bishop [[Alexander Carter]] (then President of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops) explained,
{{quote|We faced the necessity of making a statement which many felt could not be a simple '[[Amen]],' a total and formal endorsement of the doctrine of the encyclical&amp;nbsp;– we had to reckon with the fact of widespread dissent from some points of his teaching among the Catholic faithful, priests, theologians, and probably some of our own number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sheridan |first=Edward |date=October 19, 1968 |title=Canadian Bishops on 'Of Human Life' |magazine=America |page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Supporters contend that the Canadian bishops were merely trying to defend those who had not matured sufficiently in their faith, and that they were simply upholding the established doctrine expressed in ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]'', the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] Declaration on Religious Freedom. They argue that it was this document which compelled the bishops "to support the need for personal freedom when dealing with the Church's rejection of artificial contraception... [and to insist] that married couples could only form their consciences in an atmosphere free of coercion."&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;MacDonald, Neil. "[http://www.peace.mb.ca/07.Mission_of_HS/xneil07.htm Freedom and Responsibility]" Olive Leaf Journal. Retrieved May 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have claimed that the statement was accepted "with satisfaction" by Pope Paul VI.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"/&gt; Although this allegation is strongly disputed,&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Joseph (Sep. 1998). "[http://catholicinsight.com/online/church/humanae/printer_124.shtml That Winnipeg Statement Again]". ''Catholic Insight''.&lt;/ref&gt; it is worth noting that the [[Holy See]] has not published an official condemnation of the Winnipeg Statement, per se.

===Opposition===
The statement was met with immediate and vocal opposition, which found root especially among [[conservatism|conservative]] practicing Catholic [[pro-life]] [[activism|activists]]. The objections of opponents to the statement are perhaps best summarized in the writings of [[Vincent Foy]], who contends, among other things, that the Winnipeg Statement:

*is tantamount to [[blasphemy]], has increased [[dissent]] in the church, and is an act of disobedience to the Holy See
*has fostered support for [[homosexuality]], the [[ordination of women#Roman Catholic Church|ordination of women]], the "[[Veritatis Splendor#The "fundamental option," sin, and salvation|fundamental option]]", and [[abortion]]
*is a major factor in the crisis of [[vocations]] to the [[priest]]hood and [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] life
*has facilitated anti-life and immoral government [[legislation]]
*has deprived spouses of married love, has pitted spouses against one another, has made faithful Catholic couples feel betrayed and unsupported, and has been the cause of many marital breakups
*permits [[adultery|extra-marital sex]], and has led to a lowered [[women's rights|respect for women]]
*has not only adversely affected married life in Canada but in many other countries
*has led to the killing of countless persons through [[abortifacient]] pills and devices

Foy further alleges that Cardinal [[Gerald Emmett Carter]], one of the authors, partially repudiated the wording of the most controversial paragraph of the statement, writing in a private letter that "I am not prepared to defend paragraph 26 totally. In a sense, the phraseology was misleading and could give the impression that the bishops were saying that one was free to dissent at will from the Pope's teaching".&lt;ref&gt;Foy, Msgr. Vincent (Dec. 3, 2003). "[http://www.catholic-legate.com/articles/fiftyreasons.html Fifty Reasons Why The Winnipeg Statement Should be Recalled]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics worry that the Canadian bishops have cut themselves off from Rome by rejecting an official teaching of the Catholic Church and, they feel, advancing the idea of a separate national church&lt;ref&gt;Foy, Msgr. Vincent (1988). "[http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2004_docs/tragedyatwinnipeg.pdf Tragedy at Winnipeg]" ''Challenge Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– suggesting that they may have formed "a new non-Catholic church the day they signed this Winnipeg Statement."&lt;ref&gt;Jetchick, Stefan (Oct 22, 2004). "[http://www.inquisition.ca/en/serm/winnipeg.htm The Winnipeg Statement]". Inquisition.ca. Retrieved May 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reiteration in 1969==
In view of calls for the Canadian bishops to officially retract the Winnipeg Statement, they issued a year later a statement in which they declared: "Nothing could be gained and much lost by an attempt to rephrase what we have said in Winnipeg. We stand squarely behind our position but we feel it is our duty to insist on a proper interpretation of that position." They added:
{{quote|We wish to reiterate our positive conviction that a Catholic Christian is not free to form his conscience without consideration of the teaching of the ''magisterium'', in the particular instance exercised by the Holy Father in an encyclical letter. It is false and dangerous to maintain that because this encyclical has not demanded "the absolute assent of faith", any Catholic may put it aside as if it had never appeared. On the contrary, such teaching in some ways imposes a great burden of responsibility on the individual conscience.&lt;br&gt;
The Catholic knows that he or she may not dissent from teaching proposed as infallible. With regard to such teaching one may seek only to understand, to appreciate, to deepen one's insights.&lt;br&gt;
In the presence of other authoritative teaching, exercised either by the Holy Father or by the collectivity of the bishops one must listen with respect, with openness and with the firm conviction that a personal opinion, or even the opinion of a number of theologians, ranks very much below the level of such teaching. The attitude must be one of desire to assent, a respectful acceptance of truth which bears the seal of God's Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grigaitis.net/weekly/2008/plenary1969-04-18.html Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops Plenary Assembly, 18 April 1969, ''Statement on Family Life and Related Matters'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1998, the Canadian bishops voted by secret ballot on a resolution to retract the Winnipeg Statement. It did not pass.

Calls for retraction continue, though some see the Canadian bishops' December 1, 1973, document, ''[http://www.consciencelaws.org/Examining-Conscience-Ethical/Ethical40.html Statement on the Formation of Conscience]'', as evidence that they were trying to distance themselves from the Winnipeg Statement.

In 2008, the Canadian bishops issued a pastoral letter titled [http://www.ccbi-utoronto.ca/documents/bioethic_matters/CCCB_Liberating%20Potential_PastoralMessage_HV40thAnniv.pdf "Liberating Potential"] that was unquestioned as being in full conformity with ''Humanae vitae'', and invited all to "discover or rediscover" its message. Critics of the Winnipeg Statement saw the new document as counterbalancing what it called the "heretical" earlier statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socon.ca/or_bust/?p=1319 Socon or Bust blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, Canadian bishops unanimously stated that they were opposed to the attribution of the [[Order of Canada]] to abortion provider and [[pro-choice]] advocate [[Henry Morgentaler]], directly quoting from the [http://bishophelmsinginstitute.typepad.com/catholic_social_doctrine/ Compendium of Social Doctrine,]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cccb.ca/site/content/view/2640/1152/lang,eng/]&lt;/ref&gt; an action that those who believed they had expressed opposition to ''Humanae vitae'' saw as distancing themselves from that opposition. Cardinal [[Jean-Claude Turcotte]] later announced that he was returning his award of the same order over the affair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/sep/08091101.html Lifesite article]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the bishops generally advocate pro-life views through the [[Catholic Organization for Life and Family]], the official episcopal agency dedicated to life issues.

'''Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli''' ({{lang-az|Yusif Vəzir Çəmənzəminli}}), also spelled '''Chemenzeminli''', born '''Yusif Mirbaba oghlu Vazirov''' (12 September 1887, [[Shusha]] - 3 January 1943, Sukhobezvodnoye [[Gulag]] camp near the present-day [[Nizhny Novgorod]]) was an [[Azerbaijan]]i statesman and writer known for his novels, short stories, essays, and diaries. Evidence points to the fact that Chamanzaminli was the primary core author of the famous romance novel ''[[Ali and Nino]]''&lt;ref&gt;"The Business of Literature: [http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Who Wrote Azerbaijan's Most Famous Novel 'Ali and Nino]'?

==Life and career==
Chamanzaminli was born the second son of seven children to Mirbaba Mirabdulla oghlu Vazirov (died 1906)&lt;ref&gt;Biography: The Lives of Two Writers: Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli and Lev Nussimbaum/Essad Bey, in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Seyid Aziza Seyid Husein gizi (died 1910)  in the town of Shusha, which was then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. His father was a [[mugham]] teacher and a connoisseur of  literature, who spoke [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and had travelled considerably throughout the region.

After graduating from the primary school of Blindman Khalifa in 1895, Chamanzaminli pursued his studies at the [[Realschule]] of Shusha. But then, the Armenian-Azerbaijani civil war broke out (1905–1906) and his family fled Shusha. As his father had just died, his mother, younger brother and sisters settled in [[Ashgabad]], Turkmenistan, to be closer to relatives. Vazirov managed to get a meagre stipend with a few other students from Shusha to finish his education (1906–1909) at Realni High School in [[Baku]]. He published his first work in the local Azeri-language periodicals ''Sada'' and ''[[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the Editor of "Molla Nasraddin" periodical, complaining about religious superstition, 1907, Issue No. 37&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the summer of 1907 when Yusif Vazirov went to visit his mother in Ashgabad that he met Berta Maiseyeva,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, "Who was Nino? [http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_pdf/152_pdf_english/ai_152_index_eng.pdf Yusif Vazirov's Diary Suggest Identity of Nino: Jewish Girl was Prototype]," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, pp. 254-261.&lt;/ref&gt; a Third Year Student at Ashgabad Gymnasium. She seems to be the prototype for the character of "Nino" in the novel "Ali and Nino," eventually published in 1937 in Vienna. In fact, many of the historical references in the novel can be traced back to the period of time when Vazirov was a high school student in Baku, as revealed in his diaries.&lt;ref&gt;See "Life Experiences: 101 Reasons, Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli as Core Writer of Ali and Nino, [http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4], pp. 262-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Chamanzaminli left for St. Petersburg to enroll in St. Petersburg State University of Architecture and Construction Institute for Civil Engineers but having realized that he would not pass the placement test in [[mathematics]], since he was weak in math and hated it,&lt;ref&gt;Numerous references in Chamanzaminli's diaries allude to the fact that he hated math.&lt;/ref&gt; Chamanzaminli withdrew his application. While in St. Petersburg, he wrote ''Jannatin gabzi'' ("A Pass to Heaven").

In 1910 Chamanzaminli was admitted to the [[Kiev University|St. Vladimir University]] in [[Kiev]] to study law. When [[World War I]] broke out, the students and staff of the university were transferred to [[Saratov]] ([[Volga economic region|Volga region]] of [[Russia]]), where Chamanzaminli graduated in 1915. For a while he worked at the judiciary chamber of Saratov and later travelled to [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)]]. There, reflecting on the [[February Revolution]] in Russia, he began ''Studentlar'' ("Students") and "In the Year 1917".

In late 1917, he returned to Kiev to establish an Azerbaijani cultural association. In 1918 he was appointed to represent the newly established [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] but there was so much political unrest and turmoil in the region, he was not able to establish an office there. He then moved to [[Simferopol]], [[Crimea]], where he worked for a while as a judiciary advisor.

There he published his research work ''Lithuanian Tatars'' dedicated to the history and culture of [[Lipka Tatars]]. At the same time, he popularized Azeri culture by publishing related articles, especially about literature,&lt;ref&gt;Review by Austrian Friedrich Kraelitz-Greifenhorst about Yusif Vazirov's "Survey of Azerbaijani Literature (Istanbul).” Mitteilungen zur osmanischen Geschichte. 1, 1921/22, (1922), pp. 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; in the local newspapers. Then in 1919, he was appointed to open the Azerbaijan Embassy in [[Constantinople]], Turkey. He managed only to set it up only briefly for a few months before the Bolsheviks took control of Baku, leaving him without job, salary, guidance as to what to do—essentially, without a country.

Vazirov wrote at least two books that were published while he was in Turkey: (1) "A Survey of Azerbaijani Literature" (1921), and (2) "The History, Geography and Economy of Azerbaijan" (1921). Vazirov then left for [[France]] to join his younger brother Mir Abdulla, who was studying at the [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]] and from which he graduated in 1925.

In Paris where thousands of émigrés had fled in desperation after the collapse of the Russian Empire, Vazirov was unable to find a job in his field. He tried to get a job driving a taxicab but twice failed the exam. He eventually managed to get a job working in an automobile locomotive factory in the Paris suburb of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;Vazirov, Orkhan.Orkhan Vazirov, “About My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli” (Baku: Azerneshr, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote for a local publication, entitled ''Les lettres orientales'' ("Eastern Letters").

== Return to Soviet Baku ==
After Miri's quite unexpected death,&lt;ref&gt;Mir Vazirov, age 31, died within three months after coming down with tuberculosis, later complicated by an appendicitis attack. Source: Letter from Yusif Vazirov to [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in Orkhan Vazirov's book, "About My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli" (Baku Azerneshr, 1997), pp. 57-61. In Azeri.&lt;/ref&gt; Vazirov saw little reason to continue living in Europe. He blamed Miri's death on poverty since they had not had enough money for medical care. Vazirov wrote Stalin: "Miri's death left me with no reason not to return to Azerbaijan. I promised myself to defend the new Azerbaijan by embracing education and culture with all my strength. For me, Motherland is like a long-awaited shore after a turbulent voyage at sea."&lt;ref&gt;Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli's letter to Stalin on May 20, 1937, which he wrote in desperation, asking for a job after he had been stripped of his membership from the Azerbaijan Writers' Union a few months earlier. Orkhan Vazirov, "About My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli," edited by Gilman Ilkin (Baku: Azerneshr, 1997), pp. 57-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vazirov resolved, despite serious danger,&lt;ref&gt;Vazirov's decision to return to Baku was extremely risky as he had been appointed by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) as Ambassador to Turkey. The ADR had tried to resist the Bolshevik takeover and, consequently, most government officials had been killed.&lt;/ref&gt; to try to return to his Homeland and work for the strength of the Azerbaijani people. Vazirov applied for permission to return to [[Azerbaijan SSR]] from Musabeyov who sought permission from [[Sergey Kirov]] for Vazirov's return. Permission was granted in late 1925 and Vazirov returned to Baku in the spring of 1926.

Upon his return, he taught languages at Azerbaijani colleges and translated various works of [[Russian literature|Russian writers]] into [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]. In literary circles, he wrote several novels and became known by his penname Chamanzaminli. He took part in compiling the first Russian-Azeri Dictionary (1934).

== Stalin's repressions - 1937 ==
In 1937, one of the most notorious years of Stalin's purges, there was an enormous effort on the part of Azerbaijan Writers' Union (as well as other Soviet entities) to "purge the ranks." Vazirov was among the 20 or so writers targeted. He tried to defend himself, claiming that he had been one of the most courageous writers fighting against religious abuse during the pre-Soviet days. At the Third Plenum of the Azerbaijan Writers' Union (March 1937), Chairman Seyfulla Shamilov criticized a list of Azerbaijani writers including Vazirov.&lt;ref&gt;Adabiyyat Qazeti (Literature Newspaper), March 27, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 1937, at least seven articles appeared in the newspaper Adabiyyat, accusing him of being a counter-revolutionary. He was criticized for introducing counter-revolutionary ideas in his antagonist characters, especially in his novels "Students" and "Maiden Spring."&lt;ref&gt;Orkhan Vazirov, About My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli (Baku: Nargiz, 2007), p. 51. In Azeri.&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing the danger he was in, Chamanzaminli burned a large collection of his manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Personal recollection of his son Orkhan Vazirov (1928-2010) to Editor Betty Blair in 2007, describing how one day when he was about 10 years old, he came in the apartment from playing outside and saw his father stuffing the stove with a pile of manuscripts about four-five inches thick. According to Orkhan, Vazirov had said: "One day these manuscripts would have been invaluable."&lt;/ref&gt; He was stripped of his membership in Azerbaijan's Writers' Union in 1937, which greatly paralyzed his efforts to gain any employment in his field.

Eager and willing to work and support his wife Bilgeyiz Ajalova and three children (Orkhan, 1928–2010), Fikrat (1929–2004) and Gulara (who was probably born around 1932 and who died shortly after World War II), he wrote a letter to [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]], First Secretary of the Communist Party. A few weeks later, realizing that no answer was forthcoming, in desperation, Chamanzaminli wrote Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]], providing a review of his literary career up to that point in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Chamanzaminli was 50 years old at the time. His letter to Stalin was dated May 20, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; No answer came from Stalin and so he made trips to [[Ashgabad]] and [[Moscow]] in a desperate attempt to find work but none was to be found. Returning late one night to Baku, he went underground, and remained hidden away for months in his apartment - while neighbors thought he was still in Moscow. At  that time he wrote one of his most important novels - "Between Two Worlds" (meaning [[Iran]] and Russia). The novel was never published during his lifetime.

Finally, he gained a position as a teacher of the Russian language in [[Urganj]], Uzbekistan in 1938.

== Death in the GULAG - Stalin's political prison camps ==
But authorities eventually managed to track Vazirov down in Urganj in 1940 and they arrested him. He was brought back to Baku for a drawn-out interrogation that lasted six months. Chamanzaminli learned that [[Bekir Çobanzade|Bakir Chobanzade]], a [[Crimean]] [[Tatar]] poet, had implicated him.&lt;ref&gt;Ziya Bunyadov, "Trial of Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli," in “Red Terror” (Girmizi Terror, Azeri)(Baku: Azernashr, 1993), pp. 199-204&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly from photos, it can be seen that Vazirov was tortured during his interrogation period. None of his family members were allowed to visit him during this time but transcripts of the "interrogations" show that he never admitted to the Soviet government's false accusations, nor did he implicate any fellow Azerbaijanis in an attempt to get his own sentence reduced. Condemned on fabricated charges, Vazirov was sentenced to eight years of [[labor camp]]s, which he served at [[Unzhlag]] at [[Sukhobezvodnaya]] railway station, [[Gorky Oblast]], Russia. He died of [[malnutrition]], disease, and heart break,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} three years after his arrest in January 1943.

==Authorship of Ali and Nino==
Extensive research&lt;ref&gt;Research was carried out by Azerbaijan International staff over a six-year period (2004-2010). It included studying documents in 10 languages (Azeri, Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Georgian, Turkish, Persian and Swedish). Documents were gathered from major archives and libraries in Baku, Tbilisi, Vienna, Berlin, Istanbul and Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Azerbaijan International|Azerbaijan International magazine]] into the authorship of the novel [[Ali and Nino]], which was published under the pseudonym Kurban Said, points to the following conclusions:

(1) The core author of the novel "Ali and Nino" is Azerbaijani writer and statesman Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli (1887–1943) as evidenced from the content of his diaries, autobiographical essays, short stories and articles.&lt;ref&gt;"101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of "Ali and Nino" (pp. 262-333). Also "Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of 'Ali and Nino' (pp. 52-137) in "Who Wrote Azerbaijan's Most Famous Novel "Ali and Nino" [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that [[Lev Nussimbaum]], who wrote under the pen name of [[Essad Bey]], was the exclusive author.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Tom. "The Orientalist: Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life" (NY: Random House, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Some even dismiss the possibility that Chamanzaminli could possibly have authored this novel as it was first published in German, a language they insist he did not know. However, archival documents indicate that Yusif Vazirov did reasonably well in his German class in high school.&lt;ref&gt;Yusif Vazirov's grades in German class at Baku Realni High School for the two school terms (1907-1908) were 3 / 5 (5, being the highest mark possible) in the oral component and 4 / 4 in the written component. See Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives: Fund 315, List 1, Case 864, Page 15. Photo published in "Secrets in the Archives: Lev Nussimbaum's Early School Records in Baku," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), p. 158. Research was carried out by Konul Samadova and Sevinj Mehdizade Seyidova in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to discredit Chamanzaminli's authorship simply on the grounds that he didn't know German is to ignore the political crisis in the 1920s and 1930s between world wars when hundreds of thousands of foreign refugees flocked to European capitals to escape the economic collapse of four of the world's six empires (Russian, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and German). In their new setting, displaced intellectuals lost their reading public and were often at the mercy of literary brokers to get their works published. When Chamanzaminli left Paris and returned to Baku (which by that time had come under Soviet rule), one of his first short stories (1927)—"Notebook of a Refugee"—described the poverty-stricken conditions that refugee authors experienced, which forced them to accept 25 percent of whatever the European literary agents received.&lt;ref&gt;Yusif Vazirov, "Notebook of a Refugee" ("Bir Gachginin Daftarindan"), in Selected Works of Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli. Vol. 1 (Baku: Azerbaijan SSR, Publishing House of the Academy of Sciences, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) The fingerprints of [[Lev Nussimbaum]] (1905–1942), who wrote under the penname of Essad Bey, can be traced in the folkloric and legendary material in the novel (although much of it is neither culturally or ethnically reliable). Identical descriptions of such material can be traced to his earlier works as he had a tendency to repeat himself in subsequent works.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Wegner, a contemporary of Lev Nussimbaum, wrote in his diaries in September 1942 that Lev was "a typical literary swindler, gifted but irresponsible for he invariably made four or five books out of one," in Gerhard Höpp, "Mohammed Essad Beg Nur Orient für Europäer? Asien Afrika Lateinamericka 25:1 (Berlin Akademie Verlag, 1997), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Cut and Paste' Author: Essad Bey's Fingerprints in 'Ali and Nino'," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), pp. 230-251.&lt;/ref&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Lev's lack of knowledge of the Azerbaijani language also contributed to his tendency to further distort historical record which is also evident in the novel. Archival documents indicate that Lev failed the one Azerbaijani language class that he took in high school&lt;ref&gt;During the school year of 1918-1919 when Lev Nussimbaum was in Grade 3 at Men's Gymnasium No. 2 in Baku, he failed his Azerbaijani class, receiving a mark of 2 out of possible 5. Note that he was also enrolled in Russian, German and French at the time. Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives, Fund 392, List 1, Case 470, Page 13. Photo of document published in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), p. 153. Research was carried out by Konul Samadova and Sevinj M. Seyidova in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage was that Lev did not know the Arabic script, the official alphabet at that time in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Essad Bey's inscription in a book gifted to Baron Omar Rolf Ehrenfels in 1937 (the year in which Ali and Nino was first published) indicates that he did not know how to write the Azerbaijani Arabic script. Of the four words in the inscription, all are misspelled including (1) his own name (Essad Bey), (2) the country Azerbaijan, and (3) the city Vienna. This book "Der Islamische Orient" is housed in the Ehrenfels' castle in Lichtenau, Austria. A photo of the book and Essad Bey's inscription is published in "Frequently Asked Questions About the Authorship of Ali and Nino," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), pp. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

(3) Essad Bey took materials about Tbilisi and Persia directly from Georgian writer [[Ali and Nino – Literary Robbery!|Grigol Robakidze]] (1882–1962) ("Das Schlangenhemd," Snake Slough, 1928).&lt;ref&gt;Injia, Tamar. "Ali and Nino: Literary Robbery" (IM Publishers, Norwalk, Conn. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that Essad Bey personally knew Robakidze.&lt;ref&gt;Research by Georgian historian Dr. Zaza Aleksidze reveals that Lev Nussimbaum (Essad Bey) knew Robakidze who immigrated to Germany where Essad Bey was living.&lt;/ref&gt;

(4) Austrian Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels (1894–1982) registered the work with German authorities, claiming that the pseudonym [[Kurban Said]] belonged to her,&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Bucher Verzeichnis (German Index of Books) and Duetscher Gesamtkatalog (German Collective Catalog) under New Titles, published between 1935-1939, page 5336. See photo in "Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of 'Ali and Nino,'" FAQ No. 19 (Azerbaijan International magazine, Vol. 15:2-4, pp. 55-57.&lt;/ref&gt; though evidence of her involvement in the actual writing of the novel has yet to be proven.

== Pen names ==
Chamanzaminli is one of Yusif Vazirov's pennames. He adopted it in remembrance of the kindness of three brothers from a small remote village in Iran called "Chaman Zamin" which means "green or verdant meadow". In desperation, the brothers had come north to Shusha to escape  the terrible drought in the Tabriz region of Iran at the end of 19th century. Vazirov's father had provided them with a place to stay. In turn, after he died and Yusif himself fell desperately ill with typhoid in 1906, the brothers came to his rescue. Vazirov made a vow that if he ever became a writer he would adopt the name of their village in gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli, “My Life” in Works (Articles, Essays and Memoirs) (Baku: Academy of Science, 1977). Vol. 3, pp. 312-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vazirov began using the Chamanzaminli  penname in his literary works at least as early as 1911.&lt;ref&gt;He referred to himself as "Ali Khan Chamanzaminli" in the 1911 publication of the folk tale Malik Mammad (Baku: Kaspiy Press). A copy is now available in Arabic script on microfilm in the Akhundov National Library, Baku, Azerbaijan. See photo of cover page in "Names: 101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of Ali and Nino, Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; When Vazirov returned to Soviet Azerbaijan in 1926, he again took up the name—this time as "Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli".

However, literary works that are kept at the Baku Institute of Manuscripts show that Yusif Vazirov used at least 15 different pseudonyms to protect his identity starting as early as 1904 when he was only 17 years old. Often the names he chose hold symbolic meaning, such as "Badbakht" (Unlucky One), "Hagg Tarafdari" (Protector of Justice), "Musavi" (Equality), "Stradayushiy" (Sufferer), "Sarsam," (Crazy One).&lt;ref&gt;Blair, [http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Biography: Lives of Two Writers]: Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli and Lev Nussimbaum," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Vazirov, 20,  wrote a Letter to the Editor of the satirical magazine "Molla Nasraddin" attacking the Muslim clergy in his hometown of Shusha. As a result, he received death threats. In his diaries, Vazirov acknowledges how foolish he was not to have used a pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;Yusif Vazirov's Diaries: October 5, 1907, in Leyla Majidgizi Imamaliyeva, "Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli: Diaries, Minutes for Myself."

Yusif Vazirov and the "Molla Nasraddin" Fiasco," in [http://azer.com Azerbaijan International, Vol. 16:1].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Vazirov wrote under the name "Ali Khan Chamanzaminili"&lt;ref&gt;See Malik Mammad (Baku: Kaspiy Press 1911). Alternate versions of the name in other short stories in 1911 and 1912 were Ali Gulu Khan Chamanzaminli and A.G. Chamanzaminli. "Gulu" is a traditional name from Arabic which means "servant". Photos of title pages in Arabic script are published in [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4], p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; for the folktale "Malak Mammad" that he published in literary form for the first time. Curiously, "Ali Khan" is exactly the same name of the protagonist in "Ali and Nino".
