'''Abdullah ibn Ja'far''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الله بن جعفر}}) was a [[sahaba|companion]] and relative of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and a nephew of [[Ali]]. [[Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] was his step brother. He was loyal to [[Ahl al-Bayt]] in spite of his absent in Karbala, it is attributed to his credit saying that thanks to Almight Allah, if I could not support Hussain ibn Ali in Karbala my two sons (Aun o Muhammad) did.&lt;ref name="Badr Shahin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shahin|first1= Badr|title=Lady Zaynab| date=2002|publisher= Ansariyan Publications |location=Qum, Iran|page= 82|language=English|isbn=964-438-399-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Richard Francis Burton]] he widely recognized as the most sympathetic amongst Arabs.  His grave is situated near [[Aqeel ibn Abi Talib]] and Abu Sufiyan bin al-Haris (the grandson of [[Abd al-Muttalib]]) in [[Al-Baqi|Janatual Baqi)]]&lt;ref name=" Richard Francis Burton "&gt;{{cite book|last1=  Francis Burton |first1= Sir Richard|title= Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah &amp; Meccah, Volume 2| date=1893 |publisher= The Meccan Press, 3 Soho Square, London, W |location=UK|page= 44|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Grave abdullah bin Jafar(left)and Akil bin abi Talib.jpg|thumb|The Grave of Abdullah bin Jaffar-e-Tayyar in Al-Baqi]]

==Early life==
He was the son of [[Ja'far ibn Abu Talib]] and [[Asma bint Umais]]. They had emigrated to [[Second migration to Abyssinia|Abyssinia]] in 616, and Abdullah and his two brothers were born there.&lt;ref name=Saad8&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad. ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'' vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina''. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}} Abdullah was the first of Muslims to be born in the land of Abyssinia &lt;ref name= "Al Refai"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Dr. Ayman Odaibat |first1= Dr. Mona Borhan Ghazal (Al Refai) |title= Virtuous Women In Mythology and Holy Books (English translation from Arabic)| date= 3 March 2013 |publisher= Author House |location=Bloomington, Indiana |page= 189|language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt; After birth of Abdullah in Abyssinia (Habesha Presently Ethiopia), king of the Kingdom of Aksum ( [[Armah|Al-Najashi]]) was blessed with a son too.  He immediately asked the parents of Abdullah Ibn Jaffar about the name of their child.  Upon knowing the name of Jaffar family, King of Abyssinia also chose the name “Abdullah” for his first son.  It is also stated that Asma bint Umays was the nursing mother of son of Abyssinian King.&lt;ref name= "Excerpt"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Khan |first1= Ashfaq Ahmed |title= Sakhawat Ka Darya  the 5th series of books  "Daur-e-Nabuwat kay bacchay (Children during Prophethood)| date= |publisher= Darus Salam (International publisher)|location=Pakistan, UK, USA &amp; Saudi Arab |page= 12|language=Urdu }} PDF link:[https://pdfbooksfree.pk/daur-e-nabuwat-ke-bache/]&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger brother of Abdullah appears to be the first child in the Muslim history who was named Muhammad after the Prophet of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.

The family returned to Arabia in 628 and settled in [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=Saad8/&gt;{{rp|196}}

===Muhammad's Supplication &amp; instruction===
In addition to [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]' reference,it is said that after 3 days of Jafar’s death Muhammad went to house of Asma and called for children of Jafar.  He then said about each of them “As for Muhammad, he resemble our uncle Abi Talib.  As for Abdullah, he resembles me in terms of both my appearance and character.  Afterward, Muhammad took the right hand of Abdullah and said “O Allah, provide a successor for Jafar in his family, and bless Abdullah in his business, and repeated this appeal to Al-mighty thrice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faisal Shafeeq |first1= Dr.Ali Muhammad As-Sallaabee |title= The Noble Life of the Prophet| date= 2001 |publisher= Kalamullah.com |location=UK|pages= 1661–1662|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Al Refai"/&gt;  Muhammad instructed the sons of Abi Talib, namely Jafar, Aqeel and Ali that they should arrange marriages of their children with their cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Marriage and Family Life==
Ali had particularly wished that his daughters should marry Ja'far's sons.&lt;ref name=Saad8/&gt;{{rp|299}} When Abdullah asked for [[Zaynab bint Ali|Zainab]]'s hand, Ali accepted it.&lt;ref name="Akbar Rizvi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akbar Rizvi|first1= Syed Ali|title=Bibi Zainab (s.a) - Granddaughter of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) | date=2007|publisher=Idara Tarveej-e-Uloom-e-Islamia|location=Karachi, Pakistan|pages= 30|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abdullah and Zainab had five children.
*Ali ibn Abdullah.
*Awn ibn Abdullah.
*Abbas ibn Abdullah.
*Muhammad ibn Abdullah.
*Umm Kulthum bint Abdullah.&lt;ref name=Saad8/&gt;{{rp|300}}

According to [[Abbas Qomi|Shaikh Muhammad Abbas Qummi]], he had 20 sons from different wives, including 5 children from Zainab Binte Ali. Daira-e-Maarif Islamia (Circle of Islamic Knowledge) of [[University of Punjab]] (pages 568-70, Vol.X) describes that Zainabi is a progeny of Abdullah’s son Ali through Zainab binte Ali&lt;ref name="Akbar Rizvi"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Abdullah Bin Jaffar-e-Tayyar was one of the richest people in Madina and a famous [[philanthropist]] who was called as  “Bahrul Joud” which means an ocean of charity.&lt;ref name="Akbar Rizvi"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

When Ali became the Caliph in 656 and moved from Medina to [[Kufa]], Zainab and Abdullah joined him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Aalulbayt Global Information Center| url=http://www.holykarbala.net/english/zainab/ |title= Al-Sayeda Zainab (p.b.u.h.), the Greatest Women Messenger of Imam al-Hussain (p.b.u.h.) Revolution |publisher=Holy Karbala Net | date= 2003{{ndash}}2007 |accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===His wife’s journey with Hussain Ibn Ali===

It is related that Zainab already forecast the journey (journey to [[Karbala]]) before her marriage and permission for accompanying with her brother was obtained during marriage negotiations.&lt;ref name="Zainab"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Nisar Ahmed Zainpuri |first1= Akbar Asadi, Mehdi Raza’í |title=Namoona-e-Sabr (Zainab) translation from Persian to Urdu | date=1951|publisher= Ansarian Publications |location=Qum, Iran|page= 60|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Fatima Naqvi |first1= Dr. Umme |title= The Ultimate Sacrifice for Allah: Karbala| date=December 2011 |publisher= Nashriyat-e-Walayat-e-Elahia |location=|page= 13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With regard to Absent of Abdullah in battle of Karbala, it is said it was due to his poor eye sighting consequently he was unable to bear the rigidities of journey and war.&lt;ref name="Akbar Rizvi"/&gt;{{rp|37}} Knowing Hussain’s journey to Kufa, Zainab, the wife of Abdullah ibn Jaffar begged her husband’s permission to accompany her brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Shaikh Musa Muhammad |url= http://www.alhassanain.com/english/book/book/history_library/islamic_personalities/lady_zaynab_peace_be_upon_her/011.html |title= Lady Zaynab (Peace be Upon Her) - Ubaydullah Ibn Ziyad in Kufa |publisher=Al-Hassanain Com | date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing anxiousness of her husband she stated that:

{{Cquote|
You know that for 55 years my brother and I have never been separated.  Now is the time of our old age and the closing period of our lives.  If I leave him now, how shall I be able to face my mother, who at the time of her death had willed, “Zainab” after me you are both mother and sister for Hussain?  It is obligatory for me to stay with you, but if I do not go with him at this time, I shall not be able to bear the separation.
}}
Abdullah then granted his permission and sent their two sons for the destined journey.&lt;ref name="The Victory of Truth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bilgrami|first1= M.H|title=The Victory of Truth – The Life of Zaynab Binte Ali| date=1986 |publisher= Zahra Publications |location=Karachi, Pakistan|page= 82|language=English |isbn=088059-151-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullah was concurrently married to Layla bint Masud.&lt;ref name=Saad8/&gt;{{rp|300}} With reference to books ‘Nasab e Quraish Page-83’ and ‘Jameerath ul Nasab by Ibn Hazm page 62’ it is described that Layla Binte Masood bin Khalid was “Zoja-e-Sani (second wife)” through  this marriage he had two daughters (Umme Muhammad and Umme Abhiha) and four sons (Yahya, Haroon, Suleh &amp; Musa).&lt;ref name="Mehmood Abbasi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbasi|first1= Mehmood Ahmed|title=Khilafat-e-Muawiya O Yazid| date=1962|publisher=Maktab-e-Mehmoodia|location=Liaquatabad, Karachi, Pakistan|pages=276–77|language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also found in books that after divorcing Zainab,&lt;ref name=Lammens&gt;Lammens, H. (1912). ''Fatima et les filles de Mahomet'', p. 125. Rome: Scripta Pontificii Instituti Biblici.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source| date=December 2017}} Abdullah married her sister, [[Umm Kulthum bint Ali]], who was the widow of his brother [[Muhammad ibn Ja'far|Muhammad]]. This marriage was childless, and Umm Kulthum predeceased Abdullah.&lt;ref name=Saad8/&gt;{{rp|299}}  In line with [[Twelver]]’s rebuttal of divorce, [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]] writes that Zainab died while married to him (Abdullah bin Jafar).  There are many existing descendants of Zaynab and Abdullaah ibn Ja’far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Al-Munajjid |first1= Muhammad Saalih |title= HOW HE TREATED THEM |publisher= Zad Publishing | location= Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |page= 128 |language=English |edition=2014 (First) | isbn= 978-603-01-6237-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
'''Battles:'''With regard to his presence in the [[Battle of Camel]], it is indicated that at the end of Battle, while entrusting save return of mother of Believers to Medina under security of her brother Muhammad Bin Abi Bakar, Ali ordered for payment of  12,000/- Dirhams to Aisha.  Abdullah thinking that amount as too little, brought out a huge sum for Aisha, the wife of the Prophet.&lt;ref name="The History of al-Tabari"/&gt;{{rp|127 (VOL.XVI)}}  According to [[Ahmad ibn A'tham]] in battle of Siffin he was commanding the infantry in the army of Ali bin Abi Talib together with his cousin Muslim bin Aqeel, Muhammad bin Hanfia and step brother Muhammad bin Abi Bakar.&lt;ref name="Aasam Kufi"&gt;{{cite book|last1= [[Ahmad ibn A'tham|Asam Kufi]] |first1= Ahmed bin Abu Muhammad bin Ali |title=Tareekh-e-Asam Kufi| date=2002|publisher= Ali publication |location=Janazga, Mazang, Lahore, Pakistan|page= 278|language=Urdu|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politics:'''He was a staunch supporter of his uncle Ali in the Civil War but later disdained from politics.  He maintained a reputation for liberality and patronage in Medina, earning him the nickname “the Ocean of Generosity”.&lt;ref name= "Mamar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibn Rashid |first1=Mamar |title= The Expeditions: An Early Biography of Muhammad | date=May 2014 |publisher= New York University Press |location=NY, USA |page= 316|language=English}} online ref:[https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=t099BAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=who+was+jafar+ibn+abi+talib&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt; After killing of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Abdullah bin Jaffar together with his cousins Hassan and Hussain participated in washing the body and dressed him for burial in three robes without a Kurta (a long shirt).&lt;ref name="Tabqat Ibn Sad (Akhbar un Nabi)" &gt;{{cite book|last1= Ibn Sad |first1= Allama Abdullah al-Imadi |title=Tabqat Ibn Sad Vol-2 (Parts-3 &amp; 4) |publisher= Darul Ishaat | location=Karachi [[Pakistan]]|page= 192 |language=Urdu |edition=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to some spy reporting  to Ali  Ibn Abi Talib that '''Qays bin Sad bin Ubadah''', his governor at Egypt had given allegiance to Muawiya,  he received his letter which was written in perspective of affairs emerged on account of a conspiracy  caused by opponent of Ali.  Ali called his sons and Abdallah bin Ja'far and consulted the matter.  Upon advice of Abdullah, Ali wrote a letter ordering Qays bin Sad to seek the people to give their allegiance as the Muslims have done (after the 3rd Caliph).  But, if they do not, then fight them.  The governor of Egypt against this communication wrote a letter to Ali Ibn Abi Talib.  Then Abdullah Bin Jaffar requested his father in law to replace Qays bin Sad bin Ubadah with Muhammad Bin Abi Bakar as governor of Egypt and pleaded that if he really has gone over to Mu`awiyah, he will refuse to give up Egypt. However, according to Tabri it was a poor advice consequent to meeting of  Qays bin Sad with Ali during the period of killing of Muhammad bin Abi Bakar.&lt;ref name="The History of al-Tabari"/&gt;{{rp|185–189 (VOL.XVI) }}

Once a Chief of Iraqi village asked Abdullah Bin Jafar to recommend his case before Caliph Ali for accomplishment. He did so and matter of that chief was satisfied by Ali Ibn Abi Talib. As a gratification the chief sent 40,000 Darhims through some people to Abdullah, who refused the money saying that we do not sell our good deeds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Mufti Afzal Hoosen Elias |first1= Shaykh Muhammad Yusuf Kandhelvi |title= Hayat Us Sahaba - (English translation from Urdu) Volume 2 | date=March 2006 |publisher= Zem Zem, Publisher, Urdu Bazar |location= Karachi, Pakistan|page= 282|language=English}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==His vision for Hussain==
Knowing death of his two sons in the battle of Karbala, people were offering condolences to Abdullah, one of his Mawili  (Abu al-Lislas [a companion]) said that “this is what we have met and what has come upon us through Hussain Ibn Ali” on this statement he struck him with his sandal and told that I am pleased that my two sons killed with my brother and cousin.  By God! If I had been present with him, I would have preferred not to leave him in order that I would be killed with him. He then seeking attention of people consoling him, said that “Praise be to God, Who has made life hard, console Hussain Ibn Ali with my own hands, my two sons consoled him.&lt;ref name="The History of al-Tabari"/&gt; {{rp|177}}

===Letter to Hussain===
According to [[Ibn Khaldun]] in chapter 2 volume II title “Yazid-I” from 60 to 64 AH, it is described that Abdullah sent a letter through his sons Awn &amp; Muhammad, to Hussain, requesting that “for God sack come back”.  It is my advice to you in anxiety that you would be killed and Ahle-Bayt destroyed. As a result, earth’s light will come to an end, there would be no leader for Muslims.  Please do not hurry in journey, I would be reaching there after this letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Illabadi |first1= Hakeem Ahmed Hussain |title=Tareekh-e-Ibn Khaldun by Nafees Academy | location=Karachi [[Pakistan]]|page= 522 |language=Urdu |edition=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he went to Amr bin Said who was Yazid's governor of Mecca and asked him to write a letter to Hussain offering him a guarantee of harmless behavior assuring him your kindness and open-handedness. Show trust to him in your letter and request him to return. This letter was replied by Hussain too.&lt;ref name="The History of al-Tabari"&gt;{{cite book|last1=I.K.A.

'''Aistulf''' (died 756) was the [[Duke of Friuli]] from 744, King of [[Lombards]] from 749, and [[Duchy of Spoleto|Duke of Spoleto]] from 751.&lt;ref name="Ulwencreutz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lars Ulwencreutz|title=Ulwencreutz's The Royal Families in Europe V|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpQlBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA350|date=November 2013|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-304-58135-8|page=350–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the [[Pemmo of Friuli|Duke Pemmo]].&lt;ref name="Hodgkin1899"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hodgkin|title=Italy and Her Invaders: Frankish invasions, 744-744|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQQVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA164|year=1899|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his brother [[Ratchis]] became king, Aistulf succeeded him in Friuli. He succeeded him later as king when Ratchis abdicated to a monastery.  Aistulf continued the policy of expansion and raids against the [[papacy]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] [[exarchate of Ravenna]]. In 751, he captured [[Ravenna]] itself and even threatened [[Rome]], claiming a [[tax per head|capitation tax]]. He also conquered the [[Istria]] region from Eastern Roman occupation in the same year.

The popes, thoroughly irritated and alarmed, and despairing of aid from the Roman Emperor, turned to the [[Carolingian]] [[mayors of the palaces|mayors of the palace]] of [[Austrasia]], the effective rulers of the [[Franks|Frankish kingdom]]. In 741, [[Pope Gregory III]] asked [[Charles Martel]] to intervene, but he was too busy elsewhere and declined. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] visited Charles Martel's son [[Pepin the Short]], who had been proclaimed king of the Franks in 751 with the consent of [[Pope Zachary]]. In gratitude for the papal consent to his coronation, Pepin crossed the [[Alps]], defeated Aistulf, and gave to the pope the lands which Aistulf had torn from the ''ducatus Romanus'' and the exarchate ([[Emilia-Romagna]] and the [[Pentapolis]]).

Aistulf died hunting in 756. He was succeeded by [[Desiderius]] as king of the Lombards and by [[Alboin of Spoleto|Alboin]] as duke of [[Spoleto]]. He had given Friuli to his brother-in-law [[Anselm, Duke of Friuli|Anselm]], abbot of [[Nonantula]], whose sister Gisaltruda he had married, when he succeeded to the kingship in 749.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Amrita''' ({{lang-sa|अमृत}}, [[IAST]]: ''amṛta''), '''Amrit''' or '''Amata''' (also called Sudha, Amiy, Ami) is a word that literally means "immortality" and is often referred to in texts as [[nectar]]. "Amṛta" is etymologically related to the Greek ''[[ambrosia]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter W. Skeat]], ''Etymological English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; and carries the same meaning.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Ambrosia" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first occurrence is in the [[Rigveda]], where it is considered one of several synonyms for ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]'', the drink of the devas.

Amrit has varying significance in different [[Indian religions]]. The word ''Amrit'' is also a common first name for Sikhs and North Indian [[Hindu]]s, while its feminine form is ''Amritā''.  The traditional masculine name is ''Amritha'' with the feminine name being ''Amrithi''.

== Hinduism ==
[[File:Mohini with amrit.jpg|thumb|[[Mohini]], the female form of [[Vishnu]], holding the pot of amritha which she distributes amongst all the [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]], leaving the [[asura]]s without. [[Darasuram]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India|alt=A stone carving of a standing woman with a pot in her left hand and lotus in right.]]
The amṛta is repeatedly referred to as the drink of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], which grants them immortality. Despite this, the nectar does not actually offer true immortality: instead, by partaking it, the devas were able to attain a higher level of knowledge and power, which they had lost due to the curse of Sage [[Durvasa]].

The amṛta features in the [[samudra manthan]]a legend, which describes how the devas, because of a curse from the sage [[Durvasa]], begin to lose their immortality. Assisted by their rivals, the [[asura]]s, the devas begin to churn the ocean, releasing (among other extraordinary objects and beings) the amṛta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 66|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amṛta is sometimes said to miraculously form on, or flow from, statues of Hindu gods. The substance is consumed by worshippers and is alleged to be sweet-tasting and not at all similar to honey or sugar water.

Amṛta was the last of the fourteen treasures that emerged from the churning of the ocean and contained in a pot borne by [[Dhanvantari]], the physician of the devas.

== Sikhism ==
Amrit ({{lang-pa|ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ}}) is the name of the holy water used in the [[baptism]] ceremony or [[Amrit Sanchar]] in [[Sikhism]]. This ceremony is observed to initiate the Sikhs into the [[Khalsa]] and requires drinking amrit. This is created by mixing a number of soluble ingredients, including sugar, and is then rolled with a [[Khanda (sword)|khanda]] with the accompaniment of scriptural recitation of five sacred verses.

Metaphorically, God's name is also referred to as a nectar:
&lt;poem&gt;ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਸਬਦੁ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਹਰਿ ਬਾਣੀ ॥ 
अम्रित सबदु अम्रित हरि बाणी ॥ 
Amrit sabad amrit har baṇi.
The [[Shabda]] is Amrit; the Lord's ''bani'' is Amrit. 
 
ਸਤਿਗੁਰਿ ਸੇਵਿਐ ਰਿਦੈ ਸਮਾਣੀ ॥ 
सतिगुरि सेविऐ रिदै समाणी ॥ 
Satgur seviai ridai samāṇi.
Serving the True Guru, it permeates the heart. 
 
ਨਾਨਕ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਨਾਮੁ ਸਦਾ ਸੁਖਦਾਤਾ ਪੀ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤੁ ਸਭ ਭੁਖ ਲਹਿ ਜਾਵਣਿਆ
Nānak amrit nām sadā sukhdāta pi amrit sabh bhukh lėh jāvaṇia.
O Nanak, the Ambrosial Naam is forever the Giver of peace; drinking in this Amrit, all hunger is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guru Granth Sahib]], page 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

== Theravada Buddhism ==
According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], "the deathless" refers to the deathless dimension of the mind which is dwelled in permanently after [[nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;"All About Change", by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 5 June 2010, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/change.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Amata Sutta, [[the Buddha]] advises monks to stay with the four [[Satipatthana]]: "Monks, remain with your minds well-established in these four establishings of mindfulness. Don't let the deathless be lost to you."&lt;ref&gt;"Amata Sutta: Deathless" (SN 47.41), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 17 February 2012, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn47/sn47.041.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Milinda Panha|questions for Nagasena]], King Milinda asks for evidence that the Buddha once lived, wherein Nagasena describes evidence of the Dhamma in a simile:

{{quote|"Revered Nagasena, what is the nectar shop of the Buddha, the Blessed One?"

"Nectar, sire, has been pointed out by the Blessed One. With this nectar the Blessed One sprinkles the world with the [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s; when the devas and the humans have been sprinkled with this nectar, they are set free from birth, aging, disease, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. What is this nectar? It is [[Kayagatasati Sutta|mindfulness occupied with the body]]. And this too, sire, was said by the Blessed One: 'Monks, they partake of nectar (the deathless) who partake of mindfulness that is occupied with the body.' This, sire, is called the Blessed One's nectar shop."

— Miln 335&lt;ref&gt;"The Blessed One's City of Dhamma: From the Milindapañha", based on the translation by I.B. Horner. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/horner/bl130.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Vajrayana Buddhism ==
{{See also|Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Ideas and practices}}
Amritha ({{bo|w=bdud rtsi|s=dütsi}}) also plays a significant role in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] as a sacramental drink which is consumed at the beginning of all important rituals such as the [[abhisheka]], [[ganachakra]], and [[Homa (ritual)|homa]]. In the Tibetan tradition, ''dütsi'' is made during [[drubchen]]s - lengthy ceremonies involving many high [[lama]]s. It usually takes the form of small, dark-brown grains that are taken with water, or dissolved in very weak solutions of alcohol and is said to improve physical and spiritual well-being.&lt;ref name="dutsi"&gt;[http://150.135.84.34/~scar/DrikungKagyu/dutsi.pdf Dutsi], A Brief Description of the Benefits of the Sacred Ambrosial Medicine, The Unsurpassable, Supreme Samaya Substance that Liberates Through Taste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundational text of [[traditional Tibetan medicine]], the Four Tantras, is also known by the name ''The Heart of Amrita'' ({{bo|w=snying po bsdus pa}}).

''The Immaculate Crystal Garland'' ({{bo|w=dri med zhal phreng}}) describes the origin of amrita in a version of the [[samudra manthan]]a legend retold in Buddhist terms. In this Vajrayana version, the monster [[Rahu]] steals the amrita and is blasted by [[Vajrapani]]'s thunderbolt. As Rahu has already drunk the amrita he cannot die, but his blood, dripping onto the surface of this earth, causes all kinds of medicinal plants to grow. At the behest of all the Buddhas, Vajrapani reassembles Rahu who eventually becomes a protector of Buddhism according to the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

''Inner Offering'' ({{bo|w=Nang chod}}, {{zh|t=内供}}) is the most symbolic Amrita offering assembly, and the ''Inner Offering Nectar Pill'' ({{bo|w=Nang chod bdud rtsi rilbu}}, {{zh|t=内供甘露丸}}) is a precious and secret medicine of Tibetan Buddhism, which are only used internally for higher ranking monks in Nyingma school. Its ingredients including Five Amrita and Five Meat, which represents five buddha, and five elements respectively. According to ''[[Tantras]] of [[Chakravarti (Sanskrit term)|Chakravarti]]'', and ''Tantras of [[Vajravārāhī]]'', a ceremony needs to be hold for melting and blessing the Inner Offering Nectar. Five Nectar needs to be arranged in four directions: yellow excrement in the east, green bone marrow in the north, white semen in the west and red blood in the south, blue urine is placed in the center. Four Nectar should come from [[Lama|wise monks]] and the ova should be collected from the first menstruation of a blessed woman. The Five Meats are arranged similiarly, meat of black bull in the southeast, the meat of the blue dog in the southwest, the meast of the white elephant in the northwest, the meat of the green horse in the northeast, and the meat of a red human corpse in the center. After the ceremony, these ingredients will transform into an ''one taste'' (''ekarasa'') elixir, which bestows bliss, vitality, immortality and wisdom. Actual practitioner will take a 'synthesized essence' of the Nectar Pill and combined it with black tea or alcohol, but mostly the "Nectar Pill" are derived from plants.&lt;ref&gt;The handbook of Tibetan Buddhist symbols, Robert Beer. {{ISBN|1590301005}}, Boston, MA. :Shambhala, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese Buddhism describes Amrita ({{zh|t=甘露|p=gānlù}}) as blessed water, food, or other consumable objects often produced through merits of chanting mantras.

{{Euthanasia}}
'''Animal euthanasia''' ([[euthanasia]] from {{lang-el|εὐθανασία}}; "good death") is the act of putting an animal to death or allowing it to die by withholding extreme medical measures. Reasons for euthanasia include incurable (and especially painful) conditions or diseases,&lt;ref&gt;2000 Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia&lt;/ref&gt; lack of resources to continue supporting the animal, or laboratory test procedures. Euthanasia methods are designed to cause minimal pain and distress. Euthanasia is distinct from [[animal slaughter]] and [[pest control]] although in some cases the procedure is the same.

In [[domesticated]] animals, this process is commonly referred to by [[euphemism]]s such as "put down" or "put to sleep".

== Methods ==
The methods of euthanasia can be divided into pharmacological and physical methods. Acceptable pharmacological methods include injected drugs and gases that first depress the central nervous system and then cardiovascular activity. Acceptable physical methods must first cause rapid loss of consciousness by disrupting the [[central nervous system]]. The most common methods are discussed here, but there are other acceptable methods used in different situations.&lt;ref name=Recommendations&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lan.sagepub.com/content/30/4/293|title=Recommendations for euthanasia of experimental animals: Part 1|pmid=8938617|pages=293–316 (295)|year=1996|vauthors=Close B, Banister K, Baumans V, Bernoth EM, Bromage N, Bunyan J, Erhardt W, Flecknell P, Gregory N, Hackbarth H, Morton D, Warwick C |volume=30|issue=4|journal=Laboratory animals|doi=10.1258/002367796780739871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intravenous anaesthetic ===
Unconsciousness, [[respiratory arrest|respiratory]] then [[cardiac arrest]] follow rapidly, usually within 30&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref&gt;UK Veterinary Medicines Directorate Product Notes for 20% Pentobarbital solution. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070610225659/http://www.vmd.gov.uk/espcsite/Documents/128787.DOC]&lt;/ref&gt;  Observers generally describe the method as leading to a quick and peaceful death.

Some veterinarians perform a two-stage process: an initial injection that simply renders the pet unconscious and a second shot that causes death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} This allows the owner the chance to say goodbye to a live pet without their emotions stressing the pet. It also greatly mitigates any tendency toward spasm and other involuntary movement which tends to increase the emotional upset that the pet's owner experiences.

{{anchor|Tributame}}For large animals, the volumes of [[barbiturates]] required are considered by some to be impractical, although this is standard practice in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aaep.org/images/files/2007_%20Euthanasia%20Guidelines.pdf |title=Euthanasia Guidelines |accessdate=19 June 2008 |work=AAEP |date=207 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080626105724/https://www.aaep.org/images/files/2007_%20Euthanasia%20Guidelines.pdf| archivedate= 26 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For horses and cattle, other drugs may be available. Some specially formulated combination products are available, such as Somulose ([[secobarbital]]/[[cinchocaine]]) and '''Tributame''' ([[embutramide]]/[[chloroquine]]/[[lidocaine]]), which cause deep unconsciousness and cardiac arrest independently with a lower volume of injection, thus making the process faster, safer, and more effective.

Occasionally, a horse injected with these mixtures may display apparent [[seizure]] activity before death.  This may be due to premature cardiac arrest. However, if normal precautions (e.g., [[sedation]] with [[detomidine]]) are taken, this is rarely a problem.&lt;ref&gt;NOAH Compendium of Data Sheets for Animal Medicines 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotal reports that long-term use of [[phenylbutazone]] increases the risk of this reaction are unverified.

After the animal has died, it is not uncommon for the body to have posthumous body jerks, or for the animal to have a sudden bladder outburst.

=== Inhalants ===
{{main|Controlled-atmosphere killing}}
Gas anesthetics such as [[isoflurane]] and [[sevoflurane]] [[controlled-atmosphere stunning|can be used for euthanasia]] of very small animals. The animals are placed in [[gas chamber|sealed chambers]] where high levels of anesthetic gas are introduced. Death may also be caused using [[carbon dioxide]] once unconsciousness has been achieved by inhaled anaesthetic.&lt;ref name=ANU&gt;{{cite web|work=Australian National University |title=Laboratory Animal Euthanasia |format=DOC |url=http://www.anu.edu.au/ro/ORI/HumaneEuthanasia.doc |accessdate=30 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819094116/http://www.anu.edu.au/ro/ORI/HumaneEuthanasia.doc |archivedate=19 August 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is often used on its own for euthanasia of wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icwdm.org/wildlife/euthanasia/carbondioxide.asp Animal Euthanasia Information - Carbon doxide gas (Internet Center for Wildlife Damage Management]&lt;/ref&gt; There are mixed opinions on whether it causes distress when used on its own, with human experiments lending support to the evidence that it can cause distress and equivocal results in non-humans.&lt;ref name="pmid15901358"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conlee KM, Stephens ML, Rowan AN, King LA |title=Carbon dioxide for euthanasia: concerns regarding pain and distress, with special reference to mice and rats |journal=Lab. Anim. |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=137–61 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15901358 |doi=10.1258/0023677053739747 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) issued new guidelines for carbon dioxide induction, stating that a flow rate of 10% to 30% volume/min is optimal for the humane euthanization of small rodents.&lt;ref name="2013 AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition"&gt;[https://www.avma.org/kb/policies/documents/euthanasia.pdf 2013 AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon monoxide]] is often used, but some states in the US have banned its use in animal shelters: although carbon monoxide poisoning is not particularly painful, the conditions in the gas chamber are often not humane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/04/0411_050411_peteuthanasia.html Animal Gas Chambers Draw Fire in U.S. - National Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nitrogen]] has been shown to be effective, although some young animals are rather resistant&lt;ref name="pmid17423118"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Quine JP, Buckingham W, Strunin L |title=Euthanasia of small animals with nitrogen; comparison with intravenous pentobarbital |journal=Can. Vet. J. |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=724–6 |date=September 1988 |pmid=17423118 |pmc=1680841 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it currently is not widely used.

=== Cervical dislocation ===
[[Cervical dislocation]], or displacement (breaking or fracturing) of the neck, is an older yet less common method of killing small animals such as mice. Performed properly it is intended to cause as painless  death as possible and has no cost or equipment involved. The handler must know the proper method of executing the movement which will cause the cervical displacement and without proper training and method education there is a risk of not causing death and can cause severe pain and suffering. It is unknown how long an animal remains conscious, or the level of suffering it goes through after a correct snapping of the neck, which is why it has become less common and often substituted with inhalants.

=== Intracardiac or intraperitoneal injection ===
When [[intravenous injection]] is not possible, euthanasia drugs such as [[pentobarbital]] can be injected directly into a heart chamber or body cavity.

While [[intraperitoneal injection]] is fully acceptable (although it may take up to 15 minutes to take effect in dogs and cats&lt;ref name=ANU/&gt;), an [[intracardiac injection|intracardiac (IC) injection]] may only be performed on an unconscious or deeply sedated animal. Performing IC injections on a fully conscious animal in places with humane laws for animal handling is often a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;Calif. Penal Code 597u (a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shooting ===
[[File:Smith and Wesson model 34-1 right side.JPG|thumb|left|[[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 34 Kit Gun|Smith and Wesson Model 34-1 Kit Gun]]]]
[[File:TED Stunner Captive Bolt Technology.jpg|thumb|right|Captive bolt gun]]
This can be a means of euthanasia for large animals—such as horses, cattle, and deer—if performed properly. This may be performed by means of:

; [[Firearms]] : Traditionally used in the field for euthanizing horses, deer or other [[game animals|large game animals]]. The animal is shot in the forehead with the bullet directed down the spine through the [[medulla oblongata]], resulting in instant death.&lt;ref&gt;Tom J. Doherty, Alex Valverde, ''Manual of Equine Anaesthesia and Analgesia'', Blackwell Publishing 2006 (p. 352)&lt;/ref&gt; The risks are minimal if carried out by skilled personnel in a suitable location. 

; [[Captive bolt gun]] : Commonly used by the [[meat packing industry]] to euthanase cattle and other livestock. The bolt is fired through the forehead causing massive disruption of the [[cerebral cortex]]. In cattle, this stuns the animal, though if left for a prolonged period it will die from [[cerebral oedema]]. Death should therefore be rapidly brought about by [[pithing]] or [[exsanguination]]. Horses are killed outright by the captive bolt, making pithing and exsanguination unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Laurence, "Animal welfare consequences in England and Wales of the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease", ''Rev. sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz'', 2002, 21 (3), 863–868)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for euthanasia ==
The reasons for euthanasia of pets and other animals include:
[[File:Lethal Chamber.jpg|thumb|[[gas chamber|Lethal chamber]] in the Royal London Institute and Home for Lost and Starving Cats]]
* [[Terminal illness]], e.g. [[veterinary oncology|cancer]] or [[rabies]]
* Illness or accident that is not terminal but would cause suffering for the animal to live with, or when the owner cannot afford, or when the owner has a [[moral]] objection to the treatment.
* A hunters [[coup de grâce]].
* Behavioral problems (usually ones that cannot be corrected) e.g. [[aggression]] - Canines that have usually caused [[grievous bodily harm]] to either humans or other animals through mauling are usually seized and euthanized ('destroyed' in British legal terms).
* Old age and deterioration leading to loss of major bodily functions, resulting in severe impairment of the quality of life
* Lack of home or caretaker
* [[Animal testing|Research and testing]] – In the course of scientific research or testing, animals may be euthanized in order to be [[dissection|dissected]], to prevent suffering after testing, to prevent the spread of disease, or other reasons.&lt;ref name=Recommendations/&gt;

Small animal euthanasia is typically performed in a veterinary clinic or hospital or in an [[animal shelter]] and is usually carried out by a [[veterinarian]] or a [[veterinary technician]] working under the veterinarian's supervision. Often animal shelter workers are trained to perform euthanasia as well. Some veterinarians will perform euthanasia at the pet owner's home&amp;mdash;this is virtually mandatory in the case of large animal euthanasia. In the case of large animals which have sustained injuries, this will also occur at the site of the accident, for example, on a racecourse.

Some [[animal rights]] organizations support animal euthanasia in certain circumstances and practice euthanasia at shelters that they operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/campaigns/ar-nokillshelters.asp "Animal Rights Uncompromised:'No-Kill' Shelters"], PETA, Retrieved 26 June 2010; [https://web.archive.org/web/20040210045810/http://www.petrescueonline.org/newsinfo/petaeu2.htm "A reply from PETA to a letter inquiring about its euthanization decisions"], Petrescueonline.net, Retrieved 26 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., for companion animals euthanized in [[animal shelter]]s, 14 states prescribe intravenous injection as the required method{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}. These laws date to 1990, when [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia's]] "Humane Euthanasia Act" became the first state law to mandate this method. Before that, [[gas chamber]]s and other means were commonly employed. The Georgia law was resisted by the Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture, [[Tommy Irvin]], who was charged with enforcing the act. In March 2007, he was sued by former State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], who wrote the law, and subsequently ordered by the Court to enforce all provisions of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kittyvillage.com/morton_v_irvin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000320/http://www.kittyvillage.com/morton_v_irvin.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remains ==
Many pet owners choose to have their pets cremated or buried after the pet is euthanized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Allen | first = Moira Anderson | year = 2002 | title = The Final Farewell: How to Handle a Pet's Remains | work = Pet Loss Support Page | url = http://pet-loss.net/funeral.shtml | accessdate =9 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are pet [[funeral home]]s that specialize in animal burial or cremation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Porstner | first = Donna | date = 15 April 2004 | title = Pet funeral home offers services for grieving owners | work = Boston.com | url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2004/04/15/pet_funeral_home_offers_services_for_grieving_owners?mode=PF | accessdate =9 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the animal facility will often freeze the body and subsequently send it to the local landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=21 February 2011 | title=What Do Animal Shelters Do with the Bodies of Dead Pets? | work=Knoji: Consumer Knowledge | url=http://animal-welfare-volunteering.knoji.com/what-do-animal-shelters-do-with-the-bodies-of-dead-pets/ | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashwatthama''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अश्वत्थामा, ''Aśvatthāmā'') or '''Ashwatthaman''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अश्वत्थामन्, ''Aśvatthāman'') or '''Drauni''' is the son of [[guru]] [[Drona]] and the grandson of the sage [[Bharadwaja]]. Ashvatthama is a mighty [[Maharathi (warrior)|Maharathi]]&lt;ref&gt;K M Ganguly (1883–1896). [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05168.htm The Mahabharata, Book 5 Udyoga Parva, Section CLXVIII] sacred-texts.com, October 2003, Retrieved 2014-02-11&lt;/ref&gt; who fought on the [[Kaurava]] side against the [[Pandavas]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Ashvatthama is considered as  avatar of one of the eleven [[Rudras]] and one of the seven [[Chiranjivi]]. Along with his maternal uncle [[Kripa]], Ashvatthama is believed to be a living survivor of the [[Kurukshetra]] War.&lt;ref name="Pilot Baba"&gt;Pilot Baba. [http://www.pilotbaba.org/himalayan-masters/ashwathama.htm Pilot Baba and Maharishi Aswathama] Retrieved 2015-02-15&lt;/ref&gt; The deceptive plot of his rumoured 'death' led to the beheading of his grieving father [[Drona]], who was incapacitated while meditating for his son's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]. Ashwatthama was appointed as the final [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Kauravas]] in the Kurukshetra War. Ashwatthama, overcome with grief and rage, manifests his latent powers as a Rudras. He slaughters most of the [[Pandava]] camp in a single [[Night combat|night offensive]]. When [[Arjuna]] defeated [[Drupada]] of [[Panchala]], [[Drona]] declared Ashwatthama to be the new king of Panchala. 

== Etymology ==

According to ''The Mahabharata'', Ashwatthama means "the horse-voiced".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07193.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is so called because when he was born he cried like a horse.&lt;ref&gt;http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=azvatthAma&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth and Life Prior to the War ==

Ashwatthama was the son of [[Dronacharya]] and [[Kripi]]. Drona did many years of severe penance to please Lord [[Shiva]] in order to obtain a son who possesses the same valiance as Lord Shiva. Born a [[Chiranjivi]], Ashwatthama was born with a gem in his forehead which gives him power over all living beings lower than humans; it protected him from hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Though an expert in warfare, Dronacharya lived the simple life of a [[Brahmin]], with little money or property. As a result, Ashwatthama had a difficult childhood, with his family unable to even afford milk. Wanting to provide a better life for his family, Drona goes to the Panchal Kingdom to seek aid from his former classmate and friend, [[Drupada|King Drupada]]. However, Drupada rebukes the friendship, claiming a king and a beggar cannot be friends, humiliating Drona.

After this incident, and seeing the plight of Drona, [[Kripacharya]], invited Drona to [[Hastinapur]]. There, he came upon the attention of his co-disciple [[Bhishma]]. Thus, Dronacharya became the guru of the [[Pandavas]] and of the [[Kauravas]] in Hastinapur. Ashwatthama was trained in the art of warfare along with them.&lt;ref name="Ganguly1"&gt;K M Ganguly(1883-1896). [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05168.htm The Mahabharata,Book 5 Udyoga Parva,Section CLXVIII] sacred-texts.com,October 2003,Retrieved 2013-11-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in the Kurukshetra war ==
Ashwatthama is a notable figure in the war and engages in many battles, though not scoring any significant kills until after his father's death.

On the 14th day of the war , he killed an Akshuhani of [[Rakshasa]] and when [[Anjanaparvan]] created illusions he penetrated it by [[Vajra]] and Vayavya Astra. He also killed [[Anjanaparvan]] and defeated Ghatotkacha several times by achieving feats of deflecting their celestial weapons at themselves. He also stood against Arjuna several times on equal footing but was eventually defeated by the latter.

=== Death of Drona ===
[[File:Sadiq, bhima uccide l'elefante asvatthama, india del nord, periodo mogul, 1598.jpg |thumb| Bhima kills an elephant named Asvatthama, folio from Razmnama]]
On the 10th day of the war, after [[Bhishma]] falls, and [[Drona]] is named the supreme commander of the armies. He promises Duryodhana that he will capture [[Yudhishthira]], but then he repeatedly fails to do so. Duryodhana taunts and insults him, which greatly angers Ashwatthama, causing friction between Ashwatthama and Duryodhana. [[Krishna]] knew that it was not possible to defeat an armed Drona. So, Krishna suggested to [[Yudhishthira]] and the other Pandavas, if Drona were convinced that his son was killed on the battlefield, then his grief would leave him vulnerable to attack.

Krishna hatched a plan for Bhima to kill an elephant by the name Ashwatthama while claiming to Drona it was Drona's son who was dead. Ultimately, the gambit works (though the details of it vary depending on the version of the Mahabharata), and [[Dhristadyumna]] beheads the grieving sage.

=== Narayanastra usage ===

When the weapon called [[Narayanastra|Narayana]] was invoked, violent winds began to blow, peals of thunder were heard. Then thousands of weapons with blazing mouths appeared, that continued to agitate the Pandavas. Slaughtered by the Narayana weapon, Pandavas inspired with great fright while kings started to flee away. But Kesava while stopping troops said, 'Come down on the earth, all of you from your elephants and steeds and cars and stand weaponless on the earth.' As himself being the part of Narayana he knew about the weapon, as the weapon only targets an armed person while ignores unarmed ones. But [[Bhima]] resist, saying warriors never abandons their weapons, and no man is equal to him in prowess possessing the might of the thousand elephants, who can even pull a mountain he will oppose the weapon. Then he rushed against Drona's son. After all had thrown their weapons and alighted from their vehicles, that weapon of exceeding energy fell upon the head of Bhima. Arjuna and Vasudeva manages to cover him with the [[Varuna]] weapon, and the weapon is rendered ineffective. After that weapon had been baffled, Duryodhana said to Aswatthaman, once more use that weapon speedily, desirous of victory. Then addressed by Duryodhana, Aswatthaman, replied, 'That weapon, O king, cannot be brought back. It cannot be used twice. If brought back, it will, without doubt, slay the person calling it back.' 

According to the Chaturdhar compilation, the Narayana Astra destroyed one Akshauhini of Pandava army completely. After the use of Narayana Astra, a terrible war between both armies took place. Ashwatthama defeated Dhrishtadyumna in direct combat, but failed to kill him as [[Satyaki]] and [[Bhima]] covered his retreat. Terrible war took place between the warriors of both sides as Ashwatthama forced both Satyaki and Bhima to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;K M Ganguly(1883-1896). [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07197.htm The Mahabharatha Book 7: Drona] page 478-479 Aswathama defeated Satyaki, Bhima, Drishtadyumna, October 2003, Retrieved 2015-01-13&lt;/ref&gt; In his fury, Ashwatthama manages to kill King Nila of [[Mahismati]].

=== Becoming commander ===

After the death of [[Dushasana]], Ashwatthama still suggested Duryodhana that he make peace with the Pandavas, keeping in mind the welfare of Hastinapur but he refused. Later, after Duryodhana is struck down by [[Bhima]] and facing death, the last three survivors from the [[Kaurava]] side, Ashwatthama, [[Kripa]] and [[Kritvarma]] rush to his side. Ashwatthama swears to bring Duryodhana revenge, and Duryodhana appoints him as the commander-in-chief.

=== Attack on Pandava Camp ===

Hearing of Duryodhana's fall, he went to meet him and promised him to despatch all the Panchalas, to the abode of Yama. Along with Kripa and [[Kritavarma|Kritavarman]] he planned to attack the Pandavas camp at night.

Ashwatthama first kicked and woke up [[Dhrishtadyumna]], the commander of the Pandava army and the killer of his father Drona.&lt;ref&gt;K M Ganguly(1883-1896). [http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m10/m10007.htm The Mahabharata Book 10: Sauptika Parva section 8] Ashvatthama killing Dhrishtadyumna, October 2003, Retrieved 2015-04-17&lt;/ref&gt; Ashwatthama strangled the half-awake Dhrishtadyumna by choking him to death  as the Panchal prince begged to be allowed to die with a sword in his hand. Ashwatthama proceeds with slaughtering the remaining warriors cutting their limbs off and tearing them in two via his sword, including [[Shikhandi]], [[Yudhamanyu]], [[Uttamaujas]], and many other prominent warriors of the Pandava army, he remained unharmed via all of their combined attack. Those who tried to flee from Ashwatthama's wrath were hacked down by Kripacharya and Kritavarma at the camp's entrance and those who remained were slaughtered by berserker.

After the slaughter, the three warriors go to find Duryodhana. They find Duryodhana already dead and, mourning, they perform the cremation rites.

==Aftermath of the Attack==

The [[Pandavas]] and [[Krishna]] who were away during night, now returned to their camp the next day morning. Hearing the news of these events in the morning [[Yudhishthira]] fainted and the Pandavas become inconsolable. Bhima angrily on hearing this rushed for killing Drona son. The Pandavas, along with Krishna, went to save Bhima. They found him to sage [[Vyasa|Vyasa's]] ashram near the bank of Bhagiratha.

[[File:Narada and Vyasa came to stop Brahmasironamakastra used by Aswatthama and Arjuna.jpg|thumb|Narada and Vyasa came to stop Brahmashirsha astra used by Ashwatthama and Arjuna]]

Out of rage, Ashwatthama instead directed the weapon towards the womb of the pregnant [[Uttarā (Mahabharata)|Uttara]] in an attempt to end the lineage of the Pandavas. The angered Pandavas wanted to kill Ashwatthama, but Sage Vyasa reminded them of the deceitful tactics they had used against the [[Kauravas]].

As a punishment, Ashwatthama was asked by Vyasa to surrender the gem on his forehead to Pandavas for his forgiveness. [[Krishna]] then cursed Ashwatthama that he will roam in the forests with blood and puss oozing out of his injuries and cry for death. Since he had no fear of death during war, death would not meet him. He will have neither any hospitality nor any accommodation; he will be in total isolation without any contact of physical communication from mankind and society. The wound caused by the removal of this gem on his forehead will not heal and his body will suffer from a host of incurable diseases forming  sores and ulcers that would never heal.

|Caption = Cross-section of an [[oligochaete worm]]. The worm's '''body cavity''' surrounds the central [[typhlosole]].
}}
A '''body cavity''' is any fluid-filled space in a [[multicellular organism]] other than those of ''vessels'' (such as [[blood vessel]]s and [[lymph vessel]]s). The human body cavity normally refers to the [[ventral body cavity]], because it is by far the largest.

== Coelom ==
{{main|Coelom}}
A [[coelom]] is a cavity lined by [[mesothelium]], an [[epithelium]] derived from [[mesoderm]]. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.

[[Arthropod]]s and most [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s have a reduced (but still true) coelom, usually the [[pericardial cavity]] and the gonocoel. Their principal body cavity is the ''hemocoel'' or ''haeomocoel'' of an [[open circulatory system]], often derived from the blastocoel.

Mammalian embryos develop two cavities: the [[intraembryonic coelom]] and the [[extraembryonic coelom]] (or [[chorionic cavity]]). The intraembryonic coelom is lined by somatic and splanchnic lateral plate mesoderm, while the extraembryonic coelom is lined by extraembryonic mesoderm. The intraembryonic coelom is the only cavity that persists in the mammal at term, which is why its name is often contracted to simply ''coelomic cavity''. Subdividing the coelomic cavity into compartments, for example, the [[pericardial cavity]] / [[pericardium]], where the heart develops, simplifies discussion of the [[anatomy|anatomies]] of complex animals.

Organisms can be also classified according to the type of body cavity they possess.&lt;ref name="urlAnimals III — Pseudocoelomates and Protostome Coelomates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.bio.psu.edu/fall2005/biol110/tutorials/tutorial39.htm |title=Animals III — Pseudocoelomates and Protostome Coelomates |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406000959/http://courses.bio.psu.edu/fall2005/biol110/tutorials/tutorial39.htm |archivedate=2009-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human body cavities==
[[File:Scheme body cavities-en.svg|thumb|300px|Picture of [[human body cavities]] — dorsal body cavity to the left and ventral body cavity to the right.]]
Anatomical structures are often described in terms of the cavity in which they reside. The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate compartments. The '''dorsal''' (posterior) cavity and the '''ventral''' (anterior) cavity are the largest body compartments. These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and the ventral cavity allows for significant changes in the size and shape of the organs as they perform their functions. The lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, for example, can expand and contract without distorting other tissues or disrupting the activity of nearby organs.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cnx.org/content/col11496/latest/ | title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology | publisher=Openstax college at Connexions | accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ventral cavity includes the '''thoracic''' and '''abdominopelvic''' cavities and their subdivisions. The dorsal cavity includes the '''cranial''' and '''spinal''' cavities.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;
*The cranial cavity is a large, bean-shaped cavity filling most of the upper skull where the brain is located.
*The vertebral cavity is a very narrow, thread-like cavity running from the cranial cavity down the entire length of the spinal cord.
Together the cranial cavity and vertebral cavity can be referred to as the dorsal body cavity.
In the posterior (dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal cord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities that house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral column and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord within the posterior (dorsal) cavity.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;

The thoracic cavity consists of three cavities that fill the interior area of the chest.
*The two pleural cavities are situated on both sides of the body, anterior to the spine and lateral to the breastbone.
*The [[Mediastinum#Superior mediastinum|superior mediastinum]] is a wedge-shaped cavity located between the superior regions of the two thoracic cavities.
*The pericardial cavity within the [[mediastinum]] is located at the center of the chest below the superior mediastinum. The pericardial cavity roughly outlines the shape of the heart.
The diaphragm divides the thoracic and the abdominal cavities. The abdominal cavity occupies the entire lower half of the trunk, anterior to the spine. Just under the abdominal cavity, anterior to the buttocks, is the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity is funnel shaped and is located inferior and anterior to the abdominal cavity. Together the abdominal and pelvic cavity can be referred to as the abdominopelvic cavity while the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities together can be referred to as the ventral body cavity.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;
Subdivisions of the Posterior (Dorsal) and Anterior (Ventral) Cavities
The anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity. The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib cage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The abdominopelvic cavity is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the abdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the digestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;

==Development==
At the end of the third week, the [[neural tube]], which is a fold of one of the layers of the [[trilaminar germ disc]], called the [[ectoderm]], appears. This layer elevates and closes dorsally, while the gut tube rolls up and closes ventrally to create a “tube on top of a tube.” The [[mesoderm]], which is another layer of the trilaminar germ disc, holds the tubes together and the [[lateral plate mesoderm]], the middle layer of the germ disc, splits to form a visceral layer associated with the gut and a parietal layer, which along with the overlying ectoderm, forms the lateral body wall. The space between the visceral and parietal layers of lateral plate mesoderm is the primitive body cavity. When the lateral body wall folds, it moves ventrally and fuses at the midline. The body cavity closes, except in the region of the connecting stalk. Here, the gut tube maintains an attachment to the yolk sac. The yolk sac is a membranous sac attached to the embryo, which provides nutrients and functions as the circulatory system of the very early embryo.&lt;ref name= Langman&gt;{{cite book |last1  = Sadler |title= LANGMAN Embriología médica |publisher = The Point | place = Philadelphia, PA | volume= I | edition = 12 |year= 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lateral body wall folds, pulling the [[amnion]] in with it so that the amnion surrounds the embryo and extends over the connecting stalk, which becomes the [[umbilical cord]], which connects the fetus with the [[placenta]]. If the ventral body wall fails to close, ventral body wall defects can result, such as [[ectopia cordis]], a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located outside the thorax. Another defect is gastroschisis, a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall through which the abdominal contents freely protrude. Another possibility is bladder exstrophy, in which part of the urinary bladder is present outside the body. In normal circumstances, the parietal mesoderm will form the parietal layer of serous membranes lining the outside (walls) of the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The visceral layer will form the visceral layer of the [[serous membrane]]s covering the lungs, heart, and abdominal organs. These layers are continuous at the root of each organ as the organs lie in their respective cavities. The [[peritoneum]], a serum membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity, forms in the gut layers and in places mesenteries extend from the gut as double layers of peritoneum. Mesenteries provide a pathway for vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to the organs. Initially, the gut tube from the caudal end of the foregut to the end of the hindgut is suspended from the dorsal body wall by dorsal mesentery. Ventral mesentery, derived from the septum transversum, exists only in the region of the terminal part of the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper portion of the duodenum.&lt;ref name= Tortis&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard |last2= Derrickson |first2 = Bryan  |title= Principios de anatomía y fisiología |publisher = Panamericana | place= Buenos Aires |volume  = I |edition = 11 | year= 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bradymetabolism''' refers to organisms with a high active [[metabolism]] and a considerably slower resting metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Bligh, J., and Johnson, K.G., 1973. Glossary for terms for thermal physiology. ''Journal of Applied Physiology'' '''35'''(6):941–961.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradymetabolic animals can often undergo dramatic changes in metabolic speed, according to food availability and temperature. Many bradymetabolic creatures in [[desert]]s and in areas that experience extreme winters are capable of "shutting down" their metabolisms to approach near-death states, until favorable conditions return&lt;ref name="Endler"&gt;{{cite book|author=Endler J.

Several variants of bradymetabolism exists. In [[mammal]]s, the animals normally have a fairly high metabolism, only dropping to low levels in times of little food. In most [[reptile]]s, the normal metabolic rate is quite low, but can be raised when needed, typically in short bursts of activity in connection with capturing prey.

==Etymology==
The term is from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''brady'' (βραδύ) "slow" and ''metaballein'' (μεταβάλλειν) "turn quickly."

'''Cartesian genetic programming''' is a form of [[genetic programming]], which uses a graph representation to encode computer programs. It grew from a method of evolving digital circuits developed by Miller et al. in 1997&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J.F., Thomson, P., Fogarty, T.C.: Designing Electronic Circuits Using Evolutionary Algorithms: Arithmetic Circuits: A Case Study. In: D. Quagliarella, J. Periaux, C. Poloni, G. Winter (eds.) Genetic Algorithms and Evolution Strategies in Engineering and Computer Science: Recent Advancements and Industrial Applications, pp. 105–131. Wiley (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;. However the term ‘Cartesian genetic programming’ first appeared in 1999&lt;ref&gt; Miller, J.F.: An Empirical Study of the Efficiency of Learning Boolean Functions using a Cartesian Genetic Programming Approach. In: Proc. Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 1135–1142. Morgan Kaufmann (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and was proposed as a general form of genetic programming in 2000&lt;ref&gt; Miller, J.F., Thomson, P.: Cartesian Genetic Programming. In: Proc. European Conference on
Genetic Programming, LNCS, vol. 1802, pp. 121–132. Springer (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;. It is called ‘Cartesian’ because it represents a program using a two-dimensional grid of nodes. 

Julian F. Miller (the inventor of CGP) has a web site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cartesiangp.com|title=CGP home|website=www.cartesiangp.com|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explains how CGP works.

'''Cryptobiosis''' is a metabolic state of life entered by an [[organism]] in response to adverse environmental conditions such as [[desiccation]], [[freezing]], and [[oxygen]] [[Hypoxia (medical)|deficiency]]. In the cryptobiotic state, all measurable metabolic processes stop, preventing [[reproduction]], development, and repair. When environmental conditions return to being hospitable, the organism will return to its [[metabolism|metabolic]] state of life as it was prior to the cryptobiosis.

Anhydrobiosis is the most studied form of cryptobiosis and occurs in situations of extreme [[desiccation]]. The term ''anhydrobiosis'' derives from the Greek for "life without water" and is most commonly used for the desiccation tolerance observed in certain invertebrate animals such as [[Bdelloidea|bdelloid rotifers]], [[tardigrade]]s, [[brine shrimp]], [[nematode]]s, and at least one insect, a species of [[chironomid]] (''[[Polypedilum vanderplanki]]'').

Invertebrates undergoing anhydrobiosis often contract into a smaller shape and some proceed to form a [[sugar]] called [[trehalose]]. Desiccation tolerance in plants is associated with the production of another sugar, [[sucrose]]. These sugars are thought to protect the organism from desiccation damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; In some creatures, such as bdelloid rotifers, no trehalose has been found, which has led scientists to propose other mechanisms of anhydrobiosis, possibly involving [[intrinsically disordered proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; These are mainly defense mechanisms against [[reactive oxygen species]] and [[xenobiotics]], expression of [[heat shock proteins]] and [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] as well as biosynthesis of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s and [[polyamines]]. Some of them are conserved among anhydrobiotic plants and animals, suggesting that anhydrobiotic ability may depend on a set of common mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms in detail might enable modification of non-anhydrobiotic cells, tissues, organs or even organisms so that they can be preserved in a dried state of [[suspended animation]] over long time periods.

As of 2004, such an application of anhydrobiosis is being applied to [[vaccine]]s. In vaccines, the process can produce a '''dry vaccine''' that reactivates once it is injected into the body. In theory, dry-vaccine technology could be used on any vaccine, including live vaccines such as the one for measles. It could also potentially be adapted to allow a vaccine's slow release, eliminating the need for boosters. This proposes to eliminate the need for refrigerating vaccines, thus making dry vaccines more widely available throughout the developing world where refrigeration, electricity, and proper storage are less accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3754504.stm |work=BBC NEWS |title=High hopes for fridge-free jabs | date=2004-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anoxybiosis ===
{{More footnotes|section|date=October 2013}}
{{cleanup|reason=copyedit needed to shorten and simplify sentences|date=July 2017}}

In situations lacking [[oxygen]] (a.k.a., anoxia), many cryptobionts (such as ''M. tardigradum'') take in water and become turgid and immobile, but can still survive for prolonged periods of time just as with other cryptobiological processes. While survival rate studies of organisms during supposed anoxybiosis in anoxia have historically given some conflicting results, the current consensus is that certain ectothermic vertebrates and some invertebrates (for example, [[brine shrimp]] (Clegg et al. 1999), [[copepod]]s (Marcus et al., 1994), nematodes (Crowe and Cooper, 1971), and sponge [[gemmule]]s (Reiswig and Miller, 1998)) are capable of successfully surviving in a seemingly inactive state during anoxic conditions for periods of time ranging from months to decades. Studies of the metabolic activity of these idling organisms during anoxia have been mostly inconclusive, primarily due to the technical difficulty of measuring very small degrees of metabolic activity with enough reliability to conclusively prove a cryptobiotic state is occurring rather than just an extreme case of the metabolic rate depression (MRD) phenomenon exhibited by all aerobic organisms to some degree (typically 1-10% of aerobic levels) when exposed to anoxia. Thus, anoxybiosis is not considered a legitimate form of naturally occurring cryptobiosis by some comparative biologists because of these inconclusive and conflicting experimental results regarding whether a truly complete metabolic standstill actually occurs in cryptobionts during anoxic conditions, or if the metabolism is merely such a tiny fraction of the aerobic metabolic rate that it falls below the limits of detection. Also, many experts are skeptical of the biological feasibility of anoxybiosis, because any preservation of biological structures during anoxic conditions would imply that a seemingly impossible situation is occurring, wherein the organism is managing to prevent damage to its cellular structures from the environmental negative free energy despite being both surrounded by plenty of water and thermal energy and, most remarkably, it does so without using any free energy of its own. However (as summarized by Professor James Clegg of the UC Davis Bodega Marine laboratory in a 2001 review article), while many studies have failed to find measurable quantities of metabolic activity in potential anoxybiotic organisms, and there is also some evidence that the stress-induced protein p26 may act as a protein chaperone that requires no energy in cystic ''[[Brine shrimp|Artemia franciscana]]'' embryos, more recent data suggest that most likely an extremely specialized and slow guanine polynucleotide pathway continues to provide metabolic free energy to the ''Artemia franciscana'' embryos during anoxic conditions. Although it is inherently difficult to prove that not a single organism in existence anywhere is capable of entering a truly anoxybiotic state, it seems to clearly be the case that most likely at least ''A. franciscana'' (a.k.a. sea monkeys, a well-known and commonly studied cryptobiont) is only capable of approaching, but not reaching, the above-mentioned implied violation of the usual biological conversion of environmental negative free energy into the negative entropy of cellular structures via metabolic processes.

=== Chemobiosis ===

Chemobiosis is the cryptobiotic response to high levels of environmental toxins. It has been observed in [[tardigrades]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møbjerg|first1=N.|last2=Halberg|first2=K. A.|last3=Jørgensen|first3=A.|last4=Persson|first4=D.|last5=Bjørn|first5=M.|last6=Ramløv|first6=H.|last7=Kristensen|first7=R. M.|title=Survival in extreme environments – on the current knowledge of adaptations in tardigrades|journal=Acta Physiologica|date=2011|volume=202|issue=3|pages=409–420|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02252.x|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Halberg/publication/49770874_Survival_in_extreme_environments_-_on_the_current_knowledge_of_adaptations_in_tardigrades/links/02e7e5266519e3cb47000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryobiosis ===

Cryobiosis is a form of cryptobiosis that takes place in reaction to decreased [[temperature]]. Cryobiosis initiates when the water surrounding the organism's cells has been frozen, stopping molecule mobility allows the organism to endure the freezing temperatures until more hospitable conditions return. Organisms capable of enduring these conditions typically feature molecules that facilitate freezing of water in preferential locations while also prohibiting the growth of large ice crystals that could otherwise damage cells.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} One such organism is the [[lobster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Frozen-Lobsters-Brought-Back-To-Life-2807663.php |title=Frozen Lobsters Brought Back to Life |date=18 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Osmobiosis ===

Osmobiosis is the least studied of all types of cryptobiosis. Osmobiosis occurs in response to increased [[solution|solute]] concentration in the solution the organism lives in. Little is known for certain, other than that osmobiosis appears to involve a cessation of metabolism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Examples ==

A commonly known organism that undergoes cryptobiosis is ''Artemia salina'', also known as the [[brine shrimp]] or by its brand name, [[Sea-Monkeys]].  This species, which can be found in the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]] in [[Botswana]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22373&amp;mode=&amp;order=0''Makgadikgadi'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt; survives over the dry season when the water of the pans evaporates, leaving a virtually desiccated lake bed.

The [[tardigrade]], or water bear, is a widely studied and notable example,&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Wesleyan University&lt;/ref&gt; partially because it can undergo all five types of cryptobiosis. While in a cryptobiotic state, the tardigrade's [[metabolism]] reduces to less than 0.01% of what is normal, and its water content can drop to 1% of normal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; It can withstand extreme [[temperature]], [[radiation]], and [[pressure]] while in a cryptobiotic state.

Some [[nematode]]s and [[rotifer]]s can also undergo cryptobiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watanabe|first=Masahiko|title=Anhydrobiosis in invertebrates|journal=Appl. Entomol. Zool.|year=2006|volume=41|issue=1|pages=15–31|doi=10.1303/aez.2006.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Neil Genzlinger]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted, "Documentaries about [[prehistory]] and [[paleoanthropology]] are usually interesting, sometimes even thought-provoking. But you don’t often encounter one that’s thrilling. Yet that is a fitting adjective for ''Dawn of Humanity'', a program... that brings an aura of [[breaking news]] to a field that can often seem musty."&lt;ref name="NYT-20150914"&gt;{{cite news |last=Genzlinger |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil Genzlinger |title=Review: PBS’s ‘Dawn of Humanity’ Puts Prehistory in a New Light |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/arts/television/review-pbss-dawn-of-humanity-puts-prehistory-in-a-new-light.html |date=September 14, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooke Cain of the ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'' reports that the documentary features "exclusive footage of the hair-raising descent deep into a nearly inaccessible cave to retrieve more than 1,500 hominid fossils."&lt;ref name="CO-20150916"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cain |first=Brooke |title=What to Watch on Wednesday: NOVA examines ‘Dawn of Humanity’ |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/tv/article35363601.html |date=September 16, 2015 |work=[[Charlotte Observer]] |accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to archaeologist K. Kris Hirst, ''Dawn of Humanity'' provides "a rich context for the discovery [of the fossils of ''Homo naledi''], setting the historical and evolutionary background so that viewers can understand the significance of the discovery.... [[Lee Rogers Berger|[Lee] Berger]]'s charming personality and the hordes of other [[paleontologist]]s in this video make this contextual effort easily and visually accessible to the public."&lt;ref name="AB-2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirst |first=K. Kris |title=The Dawn of Humanity - Newly Discovered Homo Naledi Video Review - Accessible Science on the Rising Star Paleolithic Site |url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/stoneage/fl/The-Dawn-of-Humanity-Newly-Discovered-Homo-Naledi-Video-Review.htm |date=2015 |work=[[About.com]] |accessdate=September 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to Hirst, the behavior of apes in the "Dawn of Man" sequence of [[Stanley Kubrick]]{{'s}} film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', largely influenced by the notions of [[Raymond Dart]] and [[Robert Ardrey]], has been proven false since such violent apes have now been shown to be [[vegetarian]]s instead.&lt;ref name="AB-2015" /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
{{See also|Instinctive drowning response}}
Drowning is most often quick and unspectacular. Its media depictions as a loud, violent struggle have much more in common with [[distressed swimmer|distressed non-swimmers]], who may well drown but have not yet begun to do so. In particular, an asphyxiating person is seldom able to call for help.&lt;ref name="OnScene"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vittone |first1=Mario |last2=Pia |first2=Francesco |authorlink2=Frank Pia |title='It Doesn't Look Like They're Drowning': How To Recognize the Instinctive Drowning Response |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/On%20Scene/OSFall06.pdf |journal=On Scene: The Journal of U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue |date=Fall 2006 |page= 14 |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instinctive drowning response covers many signs or behaviors associated with drowning or near-drowning:
* Head low in the water, mouth at water level
* Head tilted back with mouth open
* Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus
* Eyes open, with fear evident on the face
* Hyperventilating or gasping
* Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway
* Trying to roll over on the back to float
* Uncontrollable movement of arms and legs, rarely out of the water.

Drowning begins at the point a person is unable to keep their mouth above water; inhalation of water takes place at a later stage.&lt;ref name="Pia1999"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Pia |author-link=Frank Pia |chapter=Chapter 14: Reflections on Lifeguard surveillance programs |editor-last1=Fletemeyer |editor-first1=John R. |editor-last2=Freas |editor-first2=Samuel J. |title=Drowning: New Perspectives on Intervention and Prevention |year=1999 |pages=234|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xcnwm8zE24QC&amp;dq=drowning+new+perspectives+on+intervention+and+prevention |isbn=978-1-57444-223-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people demonstrating the instinctive drowning response do not show obvious prior evidence of distress.&lt;ref name="Pia1999" /&gt;

A person drowning is generally unable to call for help, or seek attention, as they cannot obtain enough air. The instinctive drowning response is the final set of [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic reactions]] in the 20–60 seconds before sinking underwater, and to the untrained eye can look similar to calm safe behavior.&lt;ref name="OnScene" /&gt;&lt;ref name="irish times"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Claire |title=What stops people shouting and waving when drowning? |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2010/0803/1224276085079.html |accessdate=29 December 2010 |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date=3 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022212412/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2010/0803/1224276085079.html |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifeguard]]s and other persons trained in rescue learn to recognize drowning people by watching for these movements.&lt;ref name="OnScene" /&gt;

== Cause ==
[[File:Drowning child warning.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Children have drowned in buckets and toilets.]]

Approximately 90% of drownings take place in freshwater (rivers, lakes and [[swimming pool]]s) and 10% in [[seawater]]. Drownings in other fluids are rare, and often relate to [[industrial accident]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In New Zealand's early colonial history, so many settlers died while trying to cross rivers that drowning was known as "The New Zealand death".&lt;ref name="Young 2012"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=David |title=Rivers - The impact of European settlement |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rivers/page-4 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 January 2015 |date=13 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602100313/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rivers/page-4 |archivedate=2 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have drowned in as little as 30&amp;nbsp;mm of water lying face down.&lt;ref name="Gulli et al 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gulli |first1=Benjamin |first2=Joseph A. |last2=Ciatolla |first3=Leaugeay |last3=Barnes |title=Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqDOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1157&amp;lpg=PA1157&amp;dq= |year=2011 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Sudbury, Massachusetts |isbn=9780763778286 |page=1157 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125212947/https://books.google.com/books?id=IqDOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1157&amp;lpg=PA1157&amp;dq= |archivedate=25 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children have drowned in baths, buckets and toilets; inebriates or those under the influence of drugs have died in puddles.

Drowning can also happen in ways that are less well known:
* [[Ascent blackout]], also called deep water blackout – caused by latent [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] during ascent from depth, where the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in the lungs under pressure at the bottom of a deep free-dive is adequate to support consciousness but drops below the blackout threshold as the water pressure decreases on the ascent. It usually strikes upon arriving near the surface as the pressure approaches normal atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scuba-doc.com/latenthypoxia.html |title=Free Diving and Shallow Water Blackout |last=Campbell |first=Ernest |year=1996 |work=Diving Medicine Online |publisher=scuba-doc.com |accessdate=24 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918143331/http://www.scuba-doc.com/latenthypoxia.html |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shallow water blackout]] – caused by [[hyperventilation]] prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels in the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="pmid17274316"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindholm |first1=P |last2=Lundgren |first2=C. E. |title=Alveolar gas composition before and after maximal breath-holds in competitive divers |journal=Undersea &amp; Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=463–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17274316 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5053 |accessdate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324130435/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5053 |archivedate=24 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body detects CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing.&lt;ref name=pmid17274316/&gt; Hyperventilation reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood but leaves the diver susceptible to sudden loss of consciousness without warning from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. There is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout, and victims (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone to the fact that there is a problem; they are typically found on the bottom.
{{anchor| Further Complications}}
* Further complications following the drowning incident – Inhaled fluid can act as an [[irritation|irritant]] inside the [[lungs]]. Physiological responses to even small quantities include the extrusion of liquid into the lungs ([[pulmonary edema]]) over the following hours, but this reduces the ability to exchange air and can lead to a person "drowning in their own body fluid". Certain poisonous vapors or gases (as for example in [[chemical warfare]]), or vomit can have a similar effect. The reaction can take place up to 72 hours after the drowning incident, and may lead to a serious condition or death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Risk factors===
&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;--&gt;
Populations groups at risk:&lt;ref name="CDC Drowning 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/drowning.html|title=Drowning|last=Staff|date=23 September 2014|work=CDC Tip sheets|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2 February 2017|location=Atlanta.

* In the US:
** Children and young adults: Drowning rates are highest for children under 5 years of age and persons 15–24 years of age. 
** Males: Nearly 80% of people who die from drowning are male.
** Minorities: The fatal unintentional drowning rate for African Americans between 2005 and 2009 was significantly higher than that of whites across all ages. The fatal drowning rate of African American children of ages from 5 to 14 is almost three times that of white children in the same age range, and 5.5 times higher in swimming pools.  These disparities might be associated with lack of basic swimming skills in some minority populations.

* In the US:
** Use of alcohol increases the risk of drowning. Among adolescents and adults, alcohol use is involved in almost a quarter of emergency department visits for drowning.
** Inability to swim: Participation in formal swimming lessons can reduce the risk of drowning among children aged 1 to 4 years.
** Free access to water: Effective barriers prevent young children from gaining access to the water 
** Ineffective supervision: Drowning can occur anywhere there is water, and even in the presence of lifeguards.
** Risk can vary with location depending on age. Children between 1 and 4 usually drown in home swimming pools. Drownings in natural water settings increase with age. More than half of drownings among those 15 years and older occurred in natural water environments.
** Failure to wear life jackets or personal flotation devices was implicated in 88% of the boating related drownings in the US during 2010. 
** For persons with seizure disorders, drowning is the most common cause of death by unintentional injury, largely in the bathtub.

==Pathophysiology==
Drowning can be considered as going through four stages:&lt;ref name="Harle 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/forensicsdrowning.html|title=Drowning|last=Harle|first=Lindsey|date=August 2012|work=Forensic pathology: Types of injuries|publisher=PathologyOutlines.com|accessdate=3 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207201657/http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/forensicsdrowning.html|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Breath-hold under voluntary control until the urge to breathe due to hypercapnia becomes overwhelming
# Fluid is aspirated into the airways and/or swallowed 
# Cerebral anoxia stops breathing and aspiration 
# Cerebral injury due to anoxia becomes irreversible

Generally, in the early stages of drowning a person holds their breath to prevent water from entering their lungs.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; When this is no longer possible a small amount of water entering the trachea causes a muscular spasm that seals the airway and prevents further passage of water.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; If the process is not interrupted, loss of consciousness due to hypoxia is followed rapidly by cardiac arrest.

===Oxygen deprivation===
A conscious person will hold his or her breath (see [[Apnea]]) and will try to access air, often resulting in [[panic]], including rapid body movement.  This uses up more oxygen in the blood stream and reduces the time to unconsciousness.  The person can voluntarily hold his or her breath for some time, but the breathing reflex will increase until the person tries to breathe, even when submerged.&lt;ref name="Gorman2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gorman |first=Mark |editor=Jose Biller |title=Interface of Neurology and Internal Medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRIvmTVcYBwC&amp;pg=PA702 |accessdate=9 May 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-7906-7 |pages=702–706 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619074907/http://books.google.com/books?id=SRIvmTVcYBwC&amp;pg=PA702 |archivedate=19 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breathing reflex in the human body is weakly related to the amount of [[oxygen]] in the [[blood]] but strongly related to the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[Hypercapnia]]). During apnea, the oxygen in the body is used by the [[cell (biology)|cells]], and excreted as carbon dioxide.  Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases, and the level of carbon dioxide increases. Increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to a stronger and stronger breathing reflex, up to the ''breath-hold breakpoint'', at which the person can no longer voluntarily hold his or her breath. This typically occurs at an arterial  [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide of 55&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, but may differ significantly from individual to individual.

The breath-hold break point can be suppressed or delayed either intentionally or unintentionally.  [[Hyperventilation]] before any dive, deep or shallow, flushes out carbon dioxide in the blood resulting in a dive commencing with an abnormally low carbon dioxide level; a potentially dangerous condition known as [[hypocapnia]].  The level of carbon dioxide in the blood after hyperventilation may then be insufficient to trigger the breathing reflex later in the dive and a blackout may occur without warning and before the diver feels any urgent need to breathe.  This can occur at any depth and is common in distance breath-hold divers [[shallow water blackout|in swimming pools]].  Hyperventilation is often used by both deep and distance free-divers to flush out carbon dioxide from the lungs to suppress the breathing reflex for longer. It is important not to mistake this for an attempt to increase the body's oxygen store.  The body at rest is fully oxygenated by normal breathing and cannot take on any more.  Breath holding in water should always be supervised by a second person, as by hyperventilating, one increases the risk of shallow water blackout because insufficient carbon dioxide levels in the blood fail to trigger the breathing reflex.&lt;ref name="Lane 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Jordan D. |year=2017 |title=Drowning Deaths From Unsupervised Breath Holding: Separating Necessary Training From Unwarranted Risk |journal=Military Medicine |volume=182 |issue=January/February |pages=1471–1473 |doi=10.7205/MILMED-D-16-00246 |pmid=28051962 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.diversalertnetwork.org/files/UHMS_DAN_2006_Breath-hold_Workshop_Proceedings.pdf |last=Lindholm |first=Peter |title=Physiological mechanisms involved in the risk of loss of consciousness during breath-hold diving |editor1-last=Lindholm |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Pollock |editor2-first=N.

A continued lack of oxygen in the brain, [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], will quickly render a person unconscious usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25–30 mmHg.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt; An unconscious person rescued with an airway still sealed from [[laryngospasm]] stands a good chance of a full recovery. [[Artificial respiration]] is also much more effective without water in the lungs. At this point the person stands a good chance of recovery if attended to within minutes.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} More than 10% of drownings may involve laryngospasm, but the evidence suggests that it is not usually effective at preventing water from entering the trachea. The lack of water found in lungs during autopsy does not necessarily mean there was no water at the time of drowning, as small amounts of freshwater are readily absorbed into the bloodstream. Hypercarbia and hypoxia both contribute to laryngeal relaxation, after which the airway is effectively open through the trachea. There is also bronchospasm and mucous production in the bronchi associated with laryngospasm, and these may prevent water entry at terminal relaxation.&lt;ref name="North 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Robert|date=December 2002|title=The pathophysiology of drowning|journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal|volume=32|issue=4|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/7640/SPUMS_V32N4_6.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=9 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211084713/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/7640/SPUMS_V32N4_6.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypoxemia and acidosis caused by asphyxia in drowning affect various organs. There can be central nervous system damage, cardiac arhythmias, pulmonary injury, reperfusion injury, and multiple-organ secondary injury with prolonged tissue hypoxia.&lt;ref name="Cantwell 2016b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/772753-overview#a3|title=Drowning: Pathophysiology|last=Cantwell|first=G Patricia|date=5 July 2016|work=Drugs &amp; Diseases - Emergency Medicine|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=3 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204004435/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/772753-overview#a3|archivedate=4 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of oxygen or chemical changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating. This [[cardiac arrest]] stops the flow of blood and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional point of death but at this point there is still a chance of recovery. The brain cannot survive long without oxygen and the continued lack of oxygen in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first [[brain damage]] and eventually [[brain death]] from which recovery is generally considered impossible. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen at normal body temperature, but hypothermia of the central nervous system may prolong this.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The extent of central nervous system injury to a large extent determines the survival and long term consequences of drowning, In the case of children, most survivors are found within 2 minutes of immersion, and most fatalities are found after 10 minutes or more.&lt;ref name="Cantwell 2016b" /&gt;

=== Water aspiration ===
If water enters the [[airway]]s of a conscious person, the person will try to cough up the water or swallow it, often inhaling more water involuntarily.  When water enters the larynx or trachea, both conscious and unconscious persons experience [[laryngospasm]], in which the [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] constrict, sealing the [[vertebrate trachea|airway]].  This prevents water from entering the [[lung]]s. Because of this laryngospasm, in the initial phase of drowning, water generally enters the stomach and very little water enters the lungs. Though laryngospasm prevents water from entering the lungs, it also interferes with breathing. In most persons, the laryngospasm relaxes some time after unconsciousness and water can then enter the lungs causing a "wet drowning".  However, about 7–10% of people maintain this seal until [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="Gorman2008" /&gt; This has been called "[[dry drowning]]", as no water enters the lungs.  In [[forensic pathology]], water in the lungs indicates that the person was still alive at the point of submersion. Absence of water in the lungs may be either a dry drowning or indicates a death before submersion.&lt;ref name="DiMaio2001"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dominick |last1=DiMaio |first2=Vincent J.M. |last2=DiMaio |title=Forensic Pathology |edition= 2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyG3802xSdwC&amp;pg=PA405 |accessdate=9 May 2013 |date=28 June 2001 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8493-0072-1 |pages=405–|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619081108/http://books.google.com/books?id=XyG3802xSdwC&amp;pg=PA405 |archivedate=19 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirated water that reaches the alveoli destroys the [[pulmonary surfactant]], which causes pulmonary oedema and decreased lung compliance which compromises oxygenation in affected parts of the lungs. This is associated with metabolic acidosis, and secondary fluid and electrolyte shifts. During alveolar fluid exchange, diatoms present in the water may pass through the alveolar wall into the capillaries to be carried to internal organs. Presence of these diatoms may be diagnostic of drowning.

Of people who have survived drowning, almost one third will experience complications such as acute lung injury (ALI) or [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Faguang|last2=Li|first2=Congcong|date=2017-04-05|title=Seawater-drowning-induced acute lung injury: From molecular mechanisms to potential treatments|url=https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2017.4302|journal=Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine|volume=13|issue=6|pages=2591–2598|doi=10.3892/etm.2017.4302|issn=1792-0981|pmc=5450642|pmid=28587319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ALI/ARDS can be triggered by pneumonia, sepsis and [[Aspiration pneumonia|water aspiration]] and are life-threatening disorders that can result in death if not treated promptly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During drowning, aspirated water enters the lung tissues, causes a reduction in [[Pulmonary surfactant|alveolar surfactant]], obstructs ventilation and triggers a release of inflammatory mediators which ultimately results in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Once someone has reached definitive care, supportive care strategies such as [[mechanical ventilation]] can help to reduce the complications of ALI/ARDS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cold water immersion ===
&lt;!-- NOT HYPOTHERMIA, WHICH WOULD BE A MISLEADING TITLE. SEE TEXT OF THIS SECTION--&gt;
Submerging the face in water cooler than about {{convert|21|°C|°F}} triggers the [[diving reflex]], common to air-breathing vertebrates, especially [[marine mammal]]s such as [[whale]]s and [[Pinniped|seals]]. This reflex protects the body by putting it into ''energy saving'' mode to maximize the time it can stay under water. The strength of this reflex is greater in colder water and has three principal effects:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;!--refs may be available in [[Cold shock]]--&gt;
* ''[[Bradycardia]]'', a slowing of the [[heart rate]] by up to 50% in humans.
* ''Peripheral [[vasoconstriction]]'', the restriction of the blood flow to the extremities to increase the blood and oxygen supply to the vital organs, especially the [[brain]].
* ''Blood Shift'', the shifting of blood to the [[thoracic cavity]], the region of the chest between the diaphragm and the neck, to avoid the collapse of the lungs under higher pressure during deeper dives.

The reflex action is automatic and allows both a conscious and an unconscious person to survive longer without oxygen under water than in a comparable situation on dry land. The exact mechanism for this effect has been debated and may be a result of brain cooling similar to the protective effects seen in patients treated with deep [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name=uhms1985&gt;{{cite conference |editor1-last=Lundgren |editor1-first=Claus E.

The actual cause of death in cold or very cold water is usually lethal [[Involuntary action|bodily reactions]] to increased heat loss and to freezing water, rather than any loss of core body temperature. Of those who die after plunging into freezing seas, around 20% die within 2 minutes from [[cold shock response|cold shock]] (uncontrolled [[hyperventilation|rapid breathing]] and gasping causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to [[cardiac arrest]], and [[panic]]), another 50% die within 15 – 30 minutes from [[cold incapacitation]] (loss of use and control of limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body 'protectively' shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core),&lt;ref name="vittone-cold-immersion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mariovittone.com/2010/10/the-truth-about-cold-water/ |title=The Truth About Cold Water |last=Vittone |first=Mario |date=21 October 2010 |work=Survival |publisher=Mario Vittone |accessdate=24 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114154556/http://mariovittone.com/2010/10/the-truth-about-cold-water/ |archivedate=14 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time.&lt;ref name="cold water table"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm|accessdate=19 February 2008|title=Hypothermia safety|publisher=[[United States Power Squadrons]]|date=23 January 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208180845/http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of this occurred during the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']], in which most people who entered the {{convert|-2|C|F}} water died within 15–30 minutes.&lt;ref name="Butler 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last = Butler |first = Daniel Allen |year = 1998 |title = Unsinkable: The Full Story of RMS ''Titanic'' |publisher = Stackpole Books | location = Mechanicsburg, PA |isbn = 978-0-8117-1814-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypothermia (and also cardiac arrest) present a risk for ''survivors'' of immersion, as for survivors of exposure; in particular the risk increases if the survivor, feeling well again, tries to get up and move, not realizing their core body temperature is still very low and will take a long time to recover.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Most victims of cold-water drowning do not develop hypothermia quickly enough to decrease cerebral metabolism before ischemia and irreversible hypoxia occur.

==Diagnosis==
The World Health Organization in 2005 defined drowning as "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid".&lt;ref name=WHO2005 /&gt; This definition does not imply death, or even the necessity for medical treatment after removal of the cause, nor that any fluid enters the lungs. The WHO further recommended that outcomes should be classified as: [[death]], [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]], and no morbidity.&lt;ref name=WHO2005/&gt; There was also consensus that the terms wet, dry, active, passive, silent, and secondary drowning should no longer be used.&lt;ref name=WHO2005/&gt;

Experts differentiate between distress and drowning. 
* Distress – people ''in trouble'', but who still have the ability to keep afloat, signal for help and take actions.
* Drowning – people ''suffocating'' and in ''imminent danger of death within seconds''.

===Forensics===
Forensic diagnosis of drowning is considered one of the most difficult in forensic medicine. External examination and autopsy findings are often non-specific, and the available laboratory tests are often inconclusive or controversial.  The purpose of investigation is generally to distinguish whether the death was due to immersion, or whether the body was immersed post mortem. The mechanism in acute drowning is hypoxemia and irreversible cerebral anoxia due to submersion in liquid.&lt;ref name="Farrugia and Ludes 2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/19161/InTech-Diagnostic_of_drowning_in_forensic_medicine.pdf|title=Forensic Medicine – From Old  Problems to New Challenges|last1=Farrugia|first1=Audrey|last2=Ludes|first2=Bertrand|date=12 September 2011|publisher=InTech|isbn=978-953-307-262-3|editor-last=Vieira|editor=|editor-first=Duarte Nuno|pages=53–60|chapter=3 - Diagnostic of Drowning in Forensic Medicine|accessdate=4 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215022413/http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/19161/InTech-Diagnostic_of_drowning_in_forensic_medicine.pdf|archivedate=15 February 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drowning would be considered as a possible cause of death when the body was recovered from a body of water, or in close proximity to a fluid which could plausibly have caused drowning, or when found with the head immersed in a fluid. A medical diagnosis of death by drowning is generally made after other possible causes of death have been excluded by means of a complete autopsy and toxicology tests. Indications of drowning are seldom completely unambiguous, and may include bloody froth in the airway, water in the stomach, [[cerebral oedema]] and [[Petrous portion of the temporal bone|petrous]] or [[Mastoid part of the temporal bone|mastoid]] haemorrhage. Some evidence of immersion may be unrelated to the cause of death, and lacerations and abrasions may have occurred before or after immersion or death.&lt;ref name="Harle 2012" /&gt;

[[Diatoms]] should normally never be present in human tissue unless water was aspirated, and their presence in tissues such as bone marrow suggests drowning, however, they are present in soil and the atmosphere and samples may easily be contaminated. An absence of diatoms does not rule out drowning, as they are not always present in water.&lt;ref name="Harle 2012" /&gt; A match of diatom shells to those found in the water may provide supporting evidence of the place of death.&lt;ref name="Farrugia and Ludes 2011" /&gt; Drowning in salt water can leave significantly different concentrations of sodium and chloride ions in the left and right chambers of the heart, but this will dissipate if the person survived for some time after the aspiration, or if CPR was attempted,&lt;ref name="Harle 2012" /&gt; and have been described in other causes of death.&lt;ref name="Farrugia and Ludes 2011" /&gt;

Most autopsy findings relate to asphyxia and are not specific to drowning. The signs of drowning are degraded by decomposition. Large amounts of froth will be present around the mouth and nostrils and in the upper and lower airways in freshly drowned bodies. The volume of froth is generally much greater in drowning than from other origins. Lung density may be higher than normal but normal weights are possible after [[cardiac arrest reflex]] or [[vaso-vagal reflex]]. The lungs may be over inflated and waterlogged, filling the thoracic cavity, and the surface may have a marbled appearance, with darker areas associated with collapsed alveoli interspersed with paler aerated areas. Fluid trapped in the lower airways may block the passive collapse that is normal after death. [[Haemorrhagic bullae]] of [[emphysema]] may be found. These are related to rupture of alveolar walls. These signs, while suggestive of drowning, are not conclusive.&lt;ref name="Farrugia and Ludes 2011" /&gt;

==Prevention==
===Water safety===

{{main|Water safety}}
Most drowning is preventable. It has been estimated that more than 85% of drownings could have been prevented by supervision, training in water skills, technology, regulation and public education.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Szpilman |first=David |first2=Joost J.L.M. |last2=Bierens |first3=Anthony J. |last3=Handley |first4=James P. |last4=Orlowski |date=4 October 2012 |title=Drowning |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=366 |issue=22 |pages=2102–2110 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1013317 |pmid=22646632 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance===

Many pools and designated bathing areas either have [[lifeguard]]s, a [[pool safety camera]] system for local or remote monitoring, or computer-aided drowning detection.  However, bystanders play an important role in drowning detection and either intervention or the notification of authorities by phone or alarm.

Lifeguards may be unaware of a drowning due to "failure to recognize the struggle, the intrusion of non-lifeguard duties upon lifeguards' primary task-preventive lifeguarding, and the distraction from surveillance duties".&lt;ref name="RID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pia-enterprises.com/rid.rtf |title=The RID factor as a cause of drowning |last1=Pia |first1=Frank |authorlink=Frank Pia |date=June 1984 |work=Parks &amp; Recreation |via=pia-enterprises.com |accessdate=1 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024620/http://www.pia-enterprises.com/rid.rtf |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pool alarms have poor evidence for any utility.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt;

==Management==

[[File:Female Project Officer creating awareness on drowning in Ghana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Drowning prevention campaign in [[Ghana]]]]

===Rescue===
Many people who are drowning manage to save themselves, or are assisted by bystanders or professional rescuers. Less than 6% of people rescued by lifeguards need medical attention, and only 0.5% need CPR. The statistics are not as good for rescue by bystanders, but even there, a minority require CPR.

Rescue involves bringing the person's mouth and nose above the water surface. A drowning person may cling to the rescuer and try to pull himself out of the water, submerging the rescuer in the process. Rescuers should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily and where possible should provide assistance from a safe position, such as a boat, or by providing flotation or a means of towing from a distance.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Where it is necessary to approach a panicking person in deep water, it is advised that the rescuer approach with a [[buoyancy|buoyant]] object, or from behind, twisting the person's arm on the back to restrict movement. If the rescuer does get pushed under water, they can dive downwards to escape.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

After a successful approach, negatively buoyant objects such as a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the person to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The person is turned on their back with a secure grip used to tow from behind. If the person is cooperative they may be towed in a similar fashion held at the armpits. If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Rescue, and where necessary, resuscitation, should be started as early as possible. If conscious, the person should be taken out of the water as soon as possible. In-water resuscitation may increase the chances of a favourable result by a factor of about three, if there will be any delay in getting the person out of the water, but the necessary skills require training. Only rescue ventilation is practicable in the water, chest compressions require a suitable platform, so in-water assessment of circulation is pointless. If the person does not respond after a few breaths, cardiac arrest may be assumed, and getting them out of the water becomes the priority.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt; Special care has to be taken for people with suspected spinal injuries, and a back board (spinal board) may be needed for the rescue.&lt;ref name="ILCOR 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = ILCOR| date = 29 November 2005| title = 2005 ILCOR resuscitation guidelines| journal = Circulation| volume = 112| issue = 22 supplement| doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166480| url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/112/22_suppl/III-115.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 17 February 2008| quote = There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of oxygen by the first aid provider.| doi-broken-date = 2018-08-23| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227045739/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/112/22_suppl/III-115.pdf| archivedate = 27 February 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First aid===
{{see also|Expired air resuscitation|Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation|Basic life support|First aid}}
The checks for responsiveness and breathing are carried out with the person horizontally supine. If unconscious but breathing, the [[recovery position]] is appropriate. If not breathing, rescue ventilation is necessary. Drowning can produce a gasping pattern of apnea while the heart is still beating, and ventilation alone may be sufficient. The airway-breathing-circulation (ABC) sequence should be followed, rather than starting with compressions as is typical in cardiac arrest,&lt;ref name="AHA 2010"&gt;{{cite report|last=|editor-last=Hazinski|first=|editor-first=Mary Fran|year=2010|title=Guidelines for CPR and ECC|work=Highlights of the 2010 American Heart Association|publisher=American Heart Association|page=2|url=http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@ecc/documents/downloadable/ucm_317350.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106184849/http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@ecc/documents/downloadable/ucm_317350.pdf|archivedate=6 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basic problem is lack of oxygen. Five initial breaths are recommended, as the initial ventilation may be difficult because of water in the airways which can interfere with effective alveolar inflation. Thereafter a sequence of two breaths and 30 [[chest compressions]] is recommended, repeated until vital signs are re-established, the rescuers are unable to continue, or [[advanced life support]] is available.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Attempts to actively expel water from the airway by abdominal thrusts, [[Heimlich maneuver]] or positioning head downwards should be avoided as there is no obstruction by solids, and they delay the start of ventilation and increase the risk of vomiting, with a significantly increased risk of death, as aspiration of stomach contents is a common complication of resuscitation efforts.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medline"&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000046|Near drowning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment for [[hypothermia]] may also be necessary. However, in those who are unconscious, it is recommended their temperature not be increased above 34 degrees C.&lt;ref name=Ros2017/&gt; Because of the [[diving reflex]], people submerged in cold water and apparently drowned may revive after a relatively long period of immersion.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Kim D. |title=Mosby's paramedic textbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJyhIH8N8qgC&amp;pg=PA1264 |accessdate=9 May 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |isbn=978-0-323-07275-5 |pages=1262–1266 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619070103/http://books.google.com/books?id=PJyhIH8N8qgC&amp;pg=PA1264 |archivedate=19 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rescuers retrieving a child from water significantly below body temperature should attempt resuscitation even after protracted immersion.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011" /&gt;

===Medical care===
Administration of oxygen at 15 litres per minute by face mask or [[bag valve mask]] is often sufficient, but [[tracheal intubation]] with [[mechanical ventilation]] may be necessary. Suctioning of [[pulmonary oedema]] fluid should be balanced against the need for oxygenation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. [[Positive end-expiratory pressure]] will generally improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. [[Hypotension]] remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid [[Intravenous therapy#Volume expanders|crystalloid infusion]].&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt; Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as [[asystole]] or [[pulseless electrical activity]]. [[Ventricular fibrillation]] is more likely to be associated with complications of pre-existing coronary artery disease, severe hypothermia, or the use of [[epinephrine]] or [[norepinephrine]].&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

While [[surfactant]] may be used no high quality evidence exist that looks at this practice.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] may be used in those who cannot be oxygenated otherwise.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; [[Steroids]] are not recommended.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt;

People who have drowned who arrive at a hospital with spontaneous circulation and breathing usually recover with good outcomes.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011" /&gt; Early provision of basic and advanced life support improve probability of positive outcome.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Longer duration of submersion is associated with lower probability of survival and higher probability of permanent neurological damage.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011" /&gt;

Contaminants in the water can cause [[bronchospasm]] and impaired gas exchange, and can cause secondary infection with delayed severe respiratory compromise.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011" /&gt;

Low water temperature can cause ventricular fibrillation, but hypothermia during immersion can also slow the metabolism, allowing a longer hypoxia before severe damage occurs.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011" /&gt; Hypothermia which reduces brain temperature significantly can improve outcome. A reduction of brain temperature by 10&amp;nbsp;°C decreases [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] consumption by approximately 50%, which can double the time that the brain can survive.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

The younger the victim, the better the chances of survival.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011" /&gt; In one case, a child submerged in cold ({{convert|37|°F|°C}}) water for 66 minutes was resuscitated without apparent neurological damage.&lt;ref name="McKenna 2011" /&gt; However, over the long term significant deficits were noted, including a range of cognitive difficulties, particularly general memory impairment, although recent [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) were within normal range.&lt;ref name="Hughes et al 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=S.

===Children===
Drowning is a major worldwide cause of death and injury in children. Long term neurological outcomes of drowning cannot be predicted accurately during the early stages of treatment and although survival after long submersion times, mostly by young children, has been reported, many survivors will remain severely and permanently neurologically compromised after much shorter submersion times. Factors affecting probability of long term recovery with mild deficits or full function in young children include the duration of submersion, whether advanced life support was needed at the accident site, the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and whether spontaneous breathing and circulation are present on arrival at the emergency room.&lt;ref name="Suominen 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suominen |first=Pertti K. |first2=Raisa |last2=Vähätalo |date=15 August 2012 |title=Neurologic long term outcome after drowning in children |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine |volume=20 |issue=55 |pages=55 |issn=1757-7241 |doi=10.1186/1757-7241-20-55 |pmid=22894549 |pmc=3493332 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on long-term outcome are scarce and unreliable. Neurological examination at the time of discharge from hospital does not accurately predict long term outcomes. Some people with severe brain injury and were transferred to other institutions died months or years after the drowning and are recorded as survivors.

==Society and culture==

===Old terminology===
The word "drowning"—like "electrocution"—was previously used to describe fatal events only, and occasionally that usage is still insisted upon, though the consensus of the medical community supports the definition used in this article. Several terms related to drowning which have been used in the past are also no longer recommended.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; These include:

Active drowning: People, such as non-swimmers and the exhausted or [[hypothermia|hypothermic]] at the surface, who are unable to hold their [[mouth]] above water and are suffocating due to lack of [[air]]. Instinctively, people in such cases perform well-known behaviors in the last 20–60 seconds before being submerged, representing the body's last efforts to obtain air.&lt;ref name=WHO2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt; Notably, such people are unable to call for help, talk, reach for rescue equipment, or alert swimmers even feet away, and they may drown quickly and silently close to other swimmers or safety.&lt;ref name="OnScene"/&gt;

Dry drowning:Drowning in which no water enters the lungs&lt;ref name=WHO2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Near drowning: Drowning which is not fatal&lt;ref name=WHO2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Wet drowning: Drowning in which water enters the lungs&lt;ref name=WHO2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Passive drowning: People who suddenly sink or have sunk due to a change in their circumstances. Examples include people who drown in an accident, or due to sudden [[loss of consciousness]] or sudden medical condition.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Secondary drowning: Physiological response to foreign matter in the lungs due to drowning causing extrusion of liquid into the lungs (pulmonary edema) which adversely affects breathing&lt;ref name=WHO2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Silent drowning: Drowning without a noticeable external display of distress.&lt;ref name=WHO2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breining 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safebee.com/outdoors/silent-drowning-how-spot-signs-and-save-life|title=Silent Drowning: How to Spot the Signs and Save a Life|last=Breining|first=Greg|date=29 May 2015|work=Outdoors|publisher=Safe Bee|accessdate=2 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203082216/http://www.safebee.com/outdoors/silent-drowning-how-spot-signs-and-save-life|archivedate=3 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drowning experts have recognized that the end result pathophysiology of hypoxemia, acidemia, and eventual death is the same whether water entered the lung or not. As this distinction does not change management or prognosis, but causes significant confusion due to alternate definitions and misunderstandings, it is generally established that pathophysiological discussions of "dry" versus "wet" drowning are not relevant to drowning care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title="Drowning and Submersion Injuries".

{{nihongo|'''''Gilgamesh'''''|ギルガメッシュ|Girugamesshu}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]. It was serialized in the [[Shōnen Gahōsha]] magazine ''Weekly Shōnen King'' from 1976 to 1978. A dark and apocalyptic [[anime]] series based on the original story was adapted by [[Group TAC]] in 2003. ''Gilgamesh'' is set in the super present and the plot revolves around characters who can be divided into four groups: The Countess and the Orga-Superior, the Mitleid Corporation, the siblings, and the Gilgamesh. With the development of the plot, the past and motives of the characters and their relationships with one another are exposed.

The 26-episode anime television series was the first directed by [[Masahiko Murata]], with music by [[Kaoru Wada]]. It was created by Group TAC, and it aired on Kansai TV from October 2, 2003 to March 18, 2004. The series received generally positive reviews and was subsequently translated, released on DVD and aired in several other countries, including the United States. 

Music, mystery, intrigues and darkness are central elements of ''Gilgamesh'''s plot. The series shows clear influences from the story known as the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], and from different scientific and archaeological influences as well.

==Plot==

===Background===
The backdrop of ''Gilgamesh'' is the fight between two opposing forces. One of the forces is known as the Gilgamesh, led by Terumichi Madoka (better known as [[Enkidu]]), and the other side is the Countess of Werdenberg and the three Orga-Superior children who live with her. In appearance, the Orga-Superior are indistinguishable from humans. However, they carry a special power known as "Dynamis" (a variation of the Greek "Dunamus" meaning "strength" "power" especially "miraculous power") which allows them to use psychic energy and control objects using only their mind. The overarching theme of ''Gilgamesh'' is one of choosing sides.

===Central===
The tomb of [[Gilgamesh]] in [[Uruk]] from the story 'The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]' is discovered by a young genius-scientist named Terumichi Madoka, who is drawn to the energy called Dynamis, a word meaning 'power', resonating from the site. He reports his findings, and all of the world's best scientists gather there. When an unknown life form called Tear materializes in Delphys (a pit that seems to have no dimensions and that surrounds the tomb of Gilgamesh) and begins to contaminate embryos that surround it, the scientists stop all of the experiments. Dr. Madoka goes down to Delphys, breaches all of the guards around it and comes into direct contact with Tear, causing an immense explosion that blocks out the sky with a mirror-like layer. This is considered an act of terrorism, as after the explosion, computers and wireless communications stop working, and the planet falls into war and famine. The human population is nearly wiped out. This occurs on October 10, so the incident is called "Twin X" (after the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] symbol for [[10 (number)|the number 10]]). 

Of the people who worked at Heaven's Gate, which is left in ruins, only Dr. Madoka and a woman introduced as the Countess of Werdenberg survive. Dr. Madoka flees, taking with him ten test subjects contaminated by the life form Tear from the rubble of Heaven's Gate, who grow up to become the ten Gilgamesh. The Countess of Werdenberg leads a team of three children (the Orga-Superior) who can use the Dynamis to battle the Gilgamesh that work for Dr. Madoka. The present Dr. Madoka (who calls himself Enkidu and that the Gilgamesh refer to as the Professor) does not appear until the very last episode of the series.  It is learned through the Gilgamesh that he wants to wipe out the human race in a 'Cleansing Flood' and give rise to a new, more powerful human race.

Later in the series, a company known as the Mitleid Corporation throw themselves into the fray. The charismatic son of the Mitleid Chairman, Hayato Kazmatsuri, is a hardline anti-Gilgamesh military contractor who has made it his goal to wipe out the Gilgamesh through whatever means possible. However, Kazmatsuri cannot stand The Countess of Werdenberg because she refuses to tell the Orga-Superior and the siblings the truth about Twin X and their father's connection to it.  As well, the siblings want to know the truth about how they were born.

Enkidu needs his two children, Tatsuya and Kiyoko to help him achieve his goal, but they want nothing to do with their terrorist father. The story starts out with them on the run from the Yakuza, because of their dead mother's debt. The story follows the repeated clashing of the four groups as the siblings, who can be called the main characters, try to figure out who to trust (the Gilgamesh who appear to want a better world, the Countess and the Orga-Superior, who are fighting the Gilgamesh and trying to prevent what they believe is the end of humanity, or the Mitleid Corporation who are the only ones trying to tell the children the truth).

In the end of the series, The Countess of Werdenberg finds out that her heart itself was Tear and that the embryos were contaminated because of her hatred and jealousy towards Terumichi's wife. In the ensuing battle practically everyone dies, including all the Gilgamesh, Tatsuya, Kiyoko, the Orga-Superior, Reiko, and even Kazmatsuri — the final death, after being shot twice by the Countess. After the battle, the Countess surrenders her one-woman war against the sheltering sky, allowing Tear to enter her body and bring the Cleansing Flood. The sky descends, and the human world comes to an end.

In the last scene, Tear's goal of creating a new world has been realised but the "new" human it has given birth to reacts violently to its presence, since it has taken on the form of the young Countess. Consequently, the first act committed by the new human race is murder, suggesting that even Tear's attempts to restructure human nature were doomed from the beginning. After the final credits show, a gloomy scene depicting blood around the new human's face accompanied with a gleeful smile is shown.

==Characters==

===Principal===
*'''Tatsuya Madoka:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]|[[Blake Shepard]]}}
Tatsuya is a clone of Terumichi Madoka but was given birth to by his wife Azusa and is therefore considered a son of Terumichi and a sibling of Kiyoko. He is fifteen years old and can use the Dynamis. He is extremely attached to his sister, as she is the only family he really has, his mother having descended into madness or depression following Twin X. He trusts the Countess more than his sister does, and assimilates with the Orga very easily, but he sometimes has trouble following the Countess's orders.

*'''Kiyoko Madoka:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Chie Nakamura]]|[[Shelley Calene-Black]]}}
Kiyoko is about seventeen and was born before the Twin X terrorist attack, so she doesn't have the ability to use the Dynamis. However, she plays a very important role in the series. She acts as a surrogate mother to Tatsuya and has a hard time accepting the Countess's help because she feels like the countess is trying to take her brother away from her. She tries to leave the Countess twice. The first time she is caught and punished by the Countess by being thrown into the Hotel's underground prison. The Countess lets her go after she leaves a second time, but she has to her work to pay her debt to the Countess. She ends up living in a dank apartment in the only urban area in the world, and works as a hostess at a gentlemen's club, since the music store she originally worked at closed down. However, she doesn't let Tatsuya know that since she doesn't want him to worry about her. She loves music and is extremely sensitive to sound. She can match any sound to its proper note, and was taught to play the piano by her father when she was very little. All she wants is a peaceful life with her brother, but her mother's debt and the conflict between the Gilgamesh and Orga keep haunting her, as well as the memory of what her father did, so she can never find any peace. She eventually falls in love with Novem, one of the Gilgamesh.  Her love is reciprocated, and she carries his child which becomes the first of a short-lived new species.  

*'''The Countess of Werdenberg:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Mitsuki Saiga]]|[[Alice Fulks]]}}
The Countess's real name is Hiroko Kageyama, and she had been employed at Heaven's Gate, working closely with Madoka. She became the Countess after marrying a wealthy scientist and Count she worked with, because the man she loved, Terumichi Madoka, was already married and had a daughter. When the Count dies in Twin X, she inherits his immense fortune. She appears to be the only survivor of the attack and lies in a coma for a few years before deciding to find the children who can use the Dynamis. She searches for and finds three children rumored to have magical powers, pulls them from some pretty bad situations, and raises them as her own children. She teaches them to use their powers, the Dynamis, to fight the Gilgamesh, although they don't know her reasoning for asking them to do such. She despises Kiyoko, most likely for being the daughter of the man she loved, and is much warmer towards Tatsuya because he looks exactly like Terumichi. She has a mansion, but she lives in a huge, fancy hotel. She has a formal dinner with her makeshift family every night, and has the children driven everywhere in the hotel's car which eventually became hers. She can use Dynamis as well, because to save her, cloned pieces of her that had been contaminated by Tear were put in her body.  However, she uses it extremely sparingly, or is perhaps unable to use it outside of dangerous situations. She rarely smiles, is always dressed formally, and never speaks of her past.

===Gilgamesh===
Gilgamesh are six men and four women, capable of using Dynamis, who work for the scientist/terrorist Enkidu. Often portrayed as the antagonists and enemies of Orga, they are the 10 test subjects that Enkidu fled Heaven's Gate with. Their goal is to serve Enkidu by destroying the tower created to restore the blue sky and later cleanse the world in order to perpetuate a new species of human. Gilgamesh are created as half human, half god and made of anti-matter. They are referred to as 'God Beasts', referring to their second, non human forms. Gilgamesh are named after the lot number they were in the tomb of Gilgamesh. The female members of Gilgamesh wear red and the male members wear black and their tattoos, each in different places on their bodies, signify different aspects of divinity. The Gilgamesh never reveal their names in the anime.
[[File:The Gilgamesh.jpg|thumb|right|The men and women of Gilgamesh.]]
*'''Uno:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Akiko Kimura]]|[[Lesley Tesh]]}}
The first female Gilgamesh member introduced in the series, Uno (One) can be recognized by her light blue eyes, long red hair and the plait wound around her head. She has high standards; coming across as harsh and criticising. She is the first female member to die and the fourth member overall, impaled mercilessly on the many spears of the Blattaria and glaring at their leader Kazamatsuri the whole time. While she is scathing and harsh speaking, she listens and follows Novem's orders.  She also has a very low opinion of Orga, not even becoming concearned when she is out numbered two to one by Orga.

*'''Duo:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Kenji Nojima]]|Jose Diaz}}
The replacement for Octo, Duo (Two) acts as a contrast to Novem. Duo is the most physically strong of the Gilgamesh in both forms, which is reflected in the size and shape of his God Beast form. It is remarked that Duo is harsh, angry and cruel and when fighting the Blattaria, uses his strength more than his Dynamis. Duo is recognizable by his hazel, almost gold eyes and white hair which sticks up wildly. According to Novem, he is also poetic but that may have been sarcasm as Duo was talking harshly about the city.  He is more than willing to follow Novem's orders.  His tattoo covers his entire back.

*'''Tria:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Junichi Suwabe]]|[[Josh Wright]]}}
Unlike other members of Gilgamesh, his Dynamis takes shape in the form of Lightning strikes as demonstrated in episode eighteen when Tria singlehandedly destroys an Army of Blattaria. Tria's personality comes off as very angry and snobbish. Tria can be recognized by his long blond hair. There is an underlying tension between Tria and Novem over who should lead Gilgamesh. Tria does not see the killing of humans as wrong but rather as a cleansing. His mark is found on his hand.

*'''Quattuor:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Aoi Muratake]]|[[Imani Harris]]}}
The third member of the female Gilgamesh to be introduced, Quattuor is unlike the other female members of Gilgamesh.  Firstly she can be recognized as the only Gilgamesh to have a visible tattoo on her body, as her eye is covered with one. She also has darker-colored skin from the rest of the Gilgamesh (possibly being African).  As well, she can be recognized by her very short gray hair. Quattuor appears to have the power to control the weather. Quattuor is aware of the rivalry between Tria and Novem but doesn't care about it. She is satisfied as long as Enkidu's will is carried out.

*'''Cinque:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Ema Kogure]]|[[Melissa Davis]]}}
The final member of Gilgamesh to be seen, she does not appear until episode twenty-four.  There is little known about her, though she is easily recognizable with her short brown bobbed hair. She is known as "Quinque" in the Japanese version. Cinque acts as a messenger between Enkidu and the other members of Gilgamesh.

*'''Sex:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Makoto Homura]]|[[Kalob Martinez]]}}
Sex has hazel eyes and short, light red hair that seems to stick out in every direction simultaneously. Sex is often the opponent of Fuko, and seems to be attracted to her, from their first clash trying to sway Tatsuya and Kiyoko to the time they fight in an alleyway. Sex gets Fuko at a disadvantage — using his body to restrain her he tells her: "The closer I get, the better you look", to which Fuko responds "Then you're too close" and kicks him away. Sex is one of the first three members of Gilgamesh seen, when he is introduced along with Novem and Octo to try to tempt Kiyoko and Tatsuya to Gilgamesh's side. The first Gilgamesh member to transform into his God Beast form and the second to fall, Sex (Six) gives his life in order to destroy the Tower, creating chaos and killing hundreds of people in the town. His tattoo is around his navel.

*'''Septem:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Eri Oono]]|[[Taylor Hannah]]}}
The second female member to appear, she first appears in episode eighteen when she tries to take back Novem from Kiyoko Madoka, She appears to be the most vengeful and spiteful female member of the Gilgamesh. She can be recognized by her long brown hair and dark blue eyes. She is the physically strongest female member of the Gilgamesh. Septem is the strongest supporter of Novem in Gilgamesh and goes out of her way in battle to help Novem out. Septem is particularly attached to Novem. She heals the wounds Novem got while fighting the Blattaria by kissing him. It is no surprise that with her close (but rather one-sided) relationship to Novem, that Septem dislikes Kiyoko so much.

*'''Octo:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Takahito Mito]]|[[Adam Conlon]]}}
The first Gilgamesh member to die, Octo (Eight) is dealt a fatal wound when Orga clashed with Gilgamesh after Gilgamesh kidnapped Kiyoko from the Hotel Providence. A building at the airport collapses on Octo, who struggles out from under the rubble, nearly completely unable to move. As the Countess coolly informs Isamu to retrieve the body for scientific study, Octo recognizes Novem, who inclines his head regretfully, and Octo reverses his anti-matter, causing a massive explosion that rocks the whole area. Octo has ice blue eyes and dark brown hair cut just above his chin, and bangs. He is one of the three first introduced and is the one to significantly make five cups of cocoa instead of three. Octo is the most gentle of the Gilgamesh with the possible exception of Novem, and likes animals, as illustrated when he is seen feeding the seagulls popcorn shortly before his death. His tattoo is on the back of his neck.

*'''Novem:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Shibuya]]|[[Logan Keslar]]}}
The most charismatic and prominent member of Gilgamesh, Novem (Nine) is the kind blond who eventually captures Kiyoko's heart. He has blue eyes and short hair with a fringe usually covering his right eye. He remains calm at all times, and generally takes a position equivalent to leader, giving the orders to his team members. Novem genuinely believes that Gilgamesh has a sacred purpose, regardless of the lives taken to get to that end. In the battle with Kazamatsuri's Blattaria where his teammates die, Novem is shot with a substance which converts anti-matter to matter, which grievously injures him. Falling unconscious, he is found by Kiyoko who tries to heal him. With Kiyoko as the mother, Novem is the father of a very short-lived new human race. He confesses to Tatsuya "Your sister.... I did love her" before his death. His tattoo is on his left shoulder.

*'''Decem:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Hirofumi Nojima]]|[[David Matranga]]}}
The last male member of the Gilgamesh to be seen. Decem's Dynamis seems to be able to manifest itself in the power of Water; he is a strong Dynamis user, but there is little else known about him. He can be recognized by his ponytailed blue hair. Decem is more calm then Tria in meeting but seems to like Tria over Novem.

===Mitleid===
The Mitleid Corporation is a group of anti-Gilgamesh hardliners bent on destroying the Gilgamesh at any cost. The Corporation itself is led by its mysterious Chairman, Toranosuke Yuki.

*'''Toranosuke Yuki:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Rokuro Naya]]|[[Ernie Manouse]]}}
Despite only appearing in one episode, Chairman Yuki is introduced into the story when the Countess receives a letter stating that the Chairman would be holding a [[living funeral]] as he was growing deathly ill and did not have much time left. It was later discovered that the Chairman present at the funeral was but a body double and the real Chairman was being hidden in another room in his estate, in case the Gilgamesh attacked. Toranosuke is killed (inadvertently) by Reiko while on his deathbed when she tries to revive him with an accidentally lethal dose of Dynamis. Among other oddities in his Estate, the Chairman keeps [[pomegranate]] trees and also has a pond filled with salamander-like hybrids. Chairman Yuki was responsible for a majority of the funding of Heaven's Gate.

*'''Reiko Yuki:'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Kae Araki]]|[[Hilary Haag]]}}
A quiet young girl who dresses in a very formal kimono dress and generally seems to have an aura of mystery around her. For some reason her hair always covers what some might believe to be her eyes — it is later found out that she underwent surgery to give her eyes to Chairman Yuki because he had gone blind and she felt sorry for him. However, it was discovered that she was a Dynamis user and thus did not need her eyes in order for her to see. Because she has lived such a long time without her eyesight, her Dynamis is much further advanced than anyone else's in the series, as she has the power to lift even the largest buildings. Later in the series she is in fact revealed to be Chairman Yuki's clone and therefore a boy. His death in the final battle is gruesome, as Tria's God Beast form tears him limb from limb.

*'''Hayato Kazmatsuri'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]|[[Paul Oddo]]}}
The son of Chairman Yuki, he was born out of an affair with one of the Chairman's many mistresses. Kazmatsuri is depicted as a very angry and stubborn warmonger. He is the owner of his own weapons contracting company. His greatest creation however is his army of anti-Gilgamesh creatures, known as the Blattaria. Kazmatsuri is the one who told the Orga children about how they were born and how they came about.

*'''Professor Eriko Enuma'''&lt;br&gt;{{Voiced by|[[Misa Watanabe]]|[[Emily Carter-Essex]]}}
An acquaintance of the Countess of Werdenberg, she works for the Mitleid corporation and tries to change the sky back to its original shape, which she succeeds in doing. Unfortunately, her plan backfires as the Gilgamesh work their way up the tower and Sex sacrifices himself to blow up the entire facility. Professor Enuma dies, after the tower collapses.

During the course of the series it is revealed that Professor Enuma was one of the Heaven's Gate scientists and the only one away from the building during XX. She was away while implanting herself with her own clone in order to have a child. However, that child is killed along with many others due to XX and Professor Enuma has a personal grudge against the sheltering sky that she blames for her child's death. Enuma was the one who first brought the countess to Heaven's Gate.

===Orga===
Orga is the name of the organization that includes the Countess's three adopted children: Isamu, Fuko and Tohru, whom she uses to fight Gilgamesh. 
Isamu, Fuko and Tohru (along with Tatsuya) are later revealed to be clones of original scientists at Heaven's Gate, contaminated in the Twin X explosion by Tear's light resulting in their ability to use Dynamis. It is also revealed that the embryos of their DNA were put into pigs, which means that their "birth mother" is technically a pig. However, later and to his relief, Tohru learns that he was indeed born from a human mother just like Tatsuya.

==Music==
''Gilgamesh'', like many other anime, features a sequence of classical music as a prominent theme throughout the series. In this case, the 'adagio' from [[Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Emperor Concerto]] is a recurring piece and "Love Unspoken" from [[Franz Lehár]]'s "[[The Merry Widow]]". The [[Robert Lowry (hymn writer)|Robert Lowry]]-composed hymn "[[Shall We Gather at the River?]]" also appears several times, either sung by one or more characters or played on the Hotel Providence's piano.

'''''Globitermes sulphureus''''' is a species of [[termite]] that is very common in Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]&lt;ref name="Bordereau"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s000400050049|last=Bordereau|first=C. |author2=A.

Between five and 10 per cent of the population are soldier termites which can be recognised by their yellow [[abdomen]] and two large, curved mandibles. The termites use [[autothysis]] as a [[defense mechanism]].&lt;ref name="Bordereau" /&gt;

==Defense==
[[File:Globitermes sulphureus soldier.svg|thumb|left|A drawing of the head of a soldier termite showing the head (H), antennae (A) and the mandibles (M). Scale bar = 0.3mm]]
When the nest is damaged, the soldier termites defend the nest and workers rapidly repair any damage to the nest walls. The soldiers stand on alert on their legs and scan the area with their antennae. If the nest is attacked by [[ant]]s, for example ''[[Oecophylla smaragdina]]'', the workers immediately escape by retreating into the nest, while the soldiers remain outside to defend the nest. They will first attempt to catch and pierce the attackers with their large mandibles. If this does not deter the attackers, some soldiers secrete a yellow liquid from a large gland that occupies a large proportion of their body. The liquid is forced out of the gland by contractions of the mandibular muscles which compress the walls of the gland. This liquid rapidly hardens on contact with air, producing a sticky substance that traps ants and other termites.&lt;ref name="Bordereau" /&gt; The secretion also contains a [[pheromone]] which attracts more soldiers to fight the attackers. In some cases, the contractions are so violent that the termites rupture themselves. This form of suicidal [[altruism in animals|altruism]] is known as [[autothysis]].&lt;ref name="Bordereau" /&gt;

==Nitrogen fixation==
''G. sulphureus'' is able to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]]. An experiment in [[Thailand]] found that they fix around 250 grams of nitrogen per [[hectare]] per year.&lt;!--per what, nest?  what population density?--&gt; Although this contribution is only between 7% and 22% of the total nitrogen inputs in the [[ecosystem]] it is thought to be relatively important as termites add it to dead wood, thereby accelerating its [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name="nitrogen"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10021-005-0024-7|last=Yamada|first=Akinori |author2=Tetsushi Inoue |author3=Decha Wiwatwitaya |author4=Moriya Ohkuma |author5=Toshiaki Kudo |author6=Atsuko Sugimoto|date=February 2006|title= Nitrogen Fixation by Termites in Tropical Forests, Thailand |journal=Ecosystems|publisher=Springer New York|volume=9|issue=1|pages=75–83|issn=1435-0629|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/5n7m7w55g3627v2l/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foraging==
''G. sulphureus'' forages areas of up to 62m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ventures up to 16m away from its nest.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chow-Yang|author2=Jocelyn Yap|author3=Peng-Soon Ngee|author4=Zairi Jaal|year=2003|title=Foraging Colonies of a Higher Mound-building Subterranean Termite, Globitermes sulphureus (Haviland) in Malaysia|journal=Japanese Journal of Environmental Entomological Zoology|volume=14|issue=2|pages=105–112|url=http://idisk.mac.com/chowyang/Public/054.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718182511/http://idisk.mac.com/chowyang/Public/054.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
The species is a major pest in areas it inhabits as it attacks wooden structures&lt;ref name="Bordereau" /&gt; and can damage [[coconut]] and [[oil palm]] plantations.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Experiments have shown that it can be controlled using the insecticide [[imidacloprid]].&lt;ref name="malaysia" /&gt;

'''Henry Robert Oswald''' M.D., M.B., C.M., (8 February 1852&lt;ref name="bapt"&gt;Ancestry.com. India, Select Births and Baptisms, 1786-1947 [database on-line] Reference ID v 31 p 66. Record of Baptism on 17 Mar 1852 of Henry Robert Oswald has father as Henry Robert Oswald and mother Sarah Georgiana Oswald with a birth date of 8 February 1852&lt;/ref&gt; - 1940&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt;) was a British [[barrister]] and [[coroner]]. He was president of the [[Coroners Society of England and Wales|Coroners' Society of England and Wales]].

==Early life==
Oswald was born on 8 February 1852 in Trichnopoly, Madras, India, the son of Surgeon General H.R. Oswald who was serving in the [[Indian Army (1895–1947)|Indian Army]].&lt;ref name="timesobit"&gt;"Obituaries." ''The Times'', 15 March 1940, p. 11. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 16 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was privately educated in the Isle of Man and later Edgbaston, Birmingham, before moving on to the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt; Oswald originally intended to enter the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] but changed his mind and studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt; He then went into practice as a medical doctor, achieving his MD from Edinburgh University in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Oswald |first=Henry Robert |date=1881 |title=Epidemic of enteric fever |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1842/24206 |language=en |publisher=University of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1890 he entered the [[Middle Temple]] to train as a barrister, being [[called to the bar]] in 1894.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt;

==Coroner==
Oswald became the deputy-coroner in the Central and Western districts of London, and later in the South-Western and Kingston districts.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt; In 1902 he became the coroner for the South-Eastern district. He moved to the Western district in 1919, a post he held until he retired in 1930.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt;

Oswald presided over between 20,000 and 30,000 [[inquest]]s.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt; Among the notable ones were the first inquest about death from a motor car (1904),&lt;ref name=Mir&gt;"The Secrets of a Coroner", Bryan Reynolds, ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', 19 March 1936, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; a case involving [[Ronald True]],&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt; the death of Freda Kempton from a drug overdose in which the dealer [[Brilliant Chang]] was implicated (1922),&lt;ref name=Times2&gt;"Freda Kempton's Death" ''[[The Times]]'', 25 April 1922, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and deaths caused by the [[1928 Thames flood]] of London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26153241 The great 1928 flood of London.] Jon Kelly, ''BBC News Magazine'', 16 February 2014. Retrieved 15 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

His reminiscences were published in 1936 by [[Stanley Paul (publisher)|Stanley Paul]] as ''Memoirs of a London County Coroner''.

==Family life==
Oswald married twice, firstly to Jean Moir-Byres with whom he had a daughter. Jean died in 1907. He married again in 1908 to Ethel Mary Cundell.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt; Oswald died in early 1940 in the Salisbury district of Wiltshire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1577">In [[artificial neural network]]s, a '''hybrid Kohonen self-organizing map''' is a type of [[self-organizing map]] (SOM) named for the [[Finland|Finnish]] professor [[Teuvo Kohonen]], where the network architecture consists of an input layer fully connected to a 2–D SOM or Kohonen layer. 

The output from the Kohonen layer, which is the winning neuron, feeds into a hidden layer and finally into an output layer.  In other words, the Kohonen SOM is the front–end, while the hidden and output layer of a [[multilayer perceptron]] is the back–end of the
hybrid Kohonen SOM.  The hybrid Kohonen SOM was first applied to [[machine vision]] systems for [[image classification]] and [[image recognition|recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Nabhani and T. Shaw. Performance analysis and optimisation of shape recognition and classification using ANN. Robotics and Computer
Integrated Manufacturing, 18:177–185, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hybrid Kohonen SOM has been used in weather prediction and especially in forecasting stock prices, which has made a challenging task considerably easier. It is fast and efficient with less classification error, hence is a better predictor, when compared to Kohonen SOM and [[backpropagation]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;Mark O. Afolabi and Olatoyosi Olude (2007), [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4076468  Predicting Stock Prices Using a Hybrid Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM)], in 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference On System Sciences’, 2007, IEEE, pp. 48–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19380">'''Involuntary memory''', also known as '''involuntary explicit memory''', '''involuntary conscious memory''', '''involuntary aware memory''', and most commonly, '''involuntary autobiographical memory''', is a subcomponent of [[memory]] that occurs when cues encountered in everyday life evoke recollections of the past without conscious effort. Voluntary memory, its binary opposite, is characterized by a deliberate effort to recall the past.
[[Image:Dunking a biscuit.jpg|thumb|Tea biscuit dunking is one of many examples of cues that can elicit involuntary memories, as evidenced by [[Marcel Proust]].]]

==Occurrences==
There appear to be at least three different contexts within which involuntary memory arises, as described by J.H. Mace in his book ''Involuntary Memory''.&lt;ref name="Mace2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=John H. Mace|title=Involuntary memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzrqadWxAYcC|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3638-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include those that occur in everyday life, those that occur during the processes of voluntary and involuntary recall, and those that occur as part of a psychiatric syndrome.

===Precious fragments===
These include involuntary memories as they arise in everyday mental functioning, comprising the most common occurrences. They are characterized by their element of surprise, as they appear to come into conscious awareness spontaneously. They are the products of common every-day experiences such as eating a piece of cake, bringing to mind a past experience evoked by the taste. The term "precious fragments" was coined by [[Marigold Linton]], a pioneer in the study of [[autobiographical memory]] research.

===By-products of other memories===
These are less common, and appear to be the result of voluntary/involuntary retrieval{{vague|date=November 2012}}. Characteristic of such occurrences is the triggering effect this has, as one involuntary memory leads to another and so on. Again, Linton describes her own experiences with such memories as "...coming unbidden sometimes when my mind is silent, but also as by-products of searches for other information".&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

===Not so precious fragments===
Finally, some involuntary memories arise from traumatic experiences, and as such are fairly rare compared to other involuntary memories. Subjects describe them as salient, repetitive memories of traumatic events. The troubling nature of such memories makes these occurrences important to clinical researchers in their studies of psychiatric syndromes such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

==History==

===Hermann Ebbinghaus===
[[File:Ebbinghaus.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Herman Ebbinghaus (1850&amp;ndash;1909).]]

Born in Bremen, Germany in 1850, [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] is recognized as the first to apply the principles of experimental psychology to studying memory. He is especially well known for his introduction and application of nonsense syllables in studying memory. Nonsense syllables are combinations of letters that do not follow grammatical rules, and are meant to lack any meaning. Ebbinghaus designed the use of them to study his own memory by memorizing lists of nonsense syllables and testing his own recall after specified time intervals. From this he discovered the [[forgetting curve]] and the [[spacing effect]], two of his most well-known contributions. Ebbinghaus was also the first to attempt a description of involuntary memory, stating that, 'Often, even after years, mental states once present in consciousness return to it with apparent spontaneity and without any act of the will; that is, they are reproduced involuntarily. Here, also, in the majority of cases we at once recognize the returned mental state as one that has already been experienced; that is, we remember it. Under certain conditions, however, this accompanying consciousness is lacking, and we know only indirectly that the "now" must be identical with the "then"; yet we receive in this way a no less valid proof for its existence during the intervening time. As more exact observation teaches us, the occurrence of these involuntary reproductions is not an entirely random and accidental one. On the contrary they are brought about through the instrumentality of other immediately present mental images. Moreover, they occur in certain regular ways that, in general terms, are described under the so-called ''laws of association''.'&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1885/1964). Memory: A contribution to experimental psychology, (trans. H.A. Ruger and C.E. Bussenius). Dover, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcel Proust—Proustian memory===
[[File:Marcel Proust 1900-2.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Proust in 1900]]
[[Marcel Proust]] was the first person to coin the term involuntary memory, in his novel ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la Recherche du Temps Perdu]]'' (''In Search of Lost Time'' or ''Remembrance of Things Past'').  Proust did not have any psychological background, and worked primarily as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, A. E. (2005). The contributions of Marcel Proust to psychoanalysis. Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, 33(1), 137–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proust viewed involuntary memory as containing the "essence of the past", claiming that it was lacking from voluntary memory.  In his novel, he describes an incident where he was eating tea soaked cake, and a childhood memory of eating tea soaked cake with his aunt was "revealed" to him.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;  From this memory, he then proceeded to be reminded of the childhood home he was in, and even the town itself.  This becomes a theme throughout ''In Search of Lost Time'', with sensations reminding Proust of previous experiences.  He dubbed these "involuntary memories".

==Current research==

===Chaining===
One idea that has recently become the subject of studies on involuntary memory is chaining. This is the concept that involuntary memories have the tendency to trigger other involuntary memories that are related. Typically, it is thought to be the contents of involuntary memories that are related to one another, thereby causing the chaining effect.

In a diary study done by J.H Mace, participants reported that frequently, when one involuntary memory arose, it would quickly trigger a series of other involuntary memories. This was recognized as the cueing source for involuntary memories.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

In work by Bernsten, the diary method was also applied to the study of involuntary memory chaining. The main hypothesis was that chaining would also occur on autobiographical memory tasks. Participants were asked to report the presence of involuntary memories while performing an autobiographical memory task. Results showed that participants did experience involuntary memory recall when they were recalling the past deliberately (also known as voluntary memory). This implies that involuntary memory production occurs as a product of chaining from voluntary memory—deliberate recall of the past.

===Priming===
A common question in the study of involuntary memory is related to priming; what is it that activates such a memory? Various studies have been conducted in recent years to observe the conditions under which involuntary memories are primed.

Mace, in one of his recent studies, wanted to test the notion that basic cognitive activities, such as thinking about the past, may prime involuntary memories. To test this idea, Mace set up a diary method study in which participants recorded involuntary memories they experienced during a two-week period, in a diary. During this two-week period, participants also had to come into a laboratory at intervals, and were instructed to recall memories from certain life periods (e.g., high school, first five years of marriage). Following this, comparing their involuntary memories to a control condition found that a significant number of their involuntary memories related to the time period they were instructed to recall. Such findings suggest that involuntary memories may be primed by even the simplest of cognitive tasks—namely, reminiscing and recalling the past.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

==Neurological basis==
[[File:Hippocampus.gif|thumb|right|The hippocampus is important for the successful retrieval of involuntary memories.]]
Research studies regarding the neurological functions of involuntary memory have been few in number. Thus far, only two neuroimaging studies have been conducted comparing involuntary memories to voluntary memories using [[Positron emission tomography|Positron Emission Tomography (PET)]].

The first study found that involuntary memory retrieval is mediated by the [[hippocampus]], which is known to be associated with successful episodic memory retrieval. In addition, activity in areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, and right superior occipital cortex, have been implicated in involuntary memory when dealing with involuntary word recognition tasks. Areas implicated with executive control processes such as right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral medial/lateral parietal cortex were more active during voluntary word recognition tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Rugg, M. D., Fletcher, P. C., Frith, C. D., J, R. S., &amp; Dolan, R. J. (1997). Brain regions supporting intentional and incidental memory: a PET study. NeuroReport (Oxford), 8 (5), 1283-1287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second study found that the medial temporal lobe, the posterior cingulate gyrus, and the precunueus, are activated during retrieval success with or without executive control seen within right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This implies that involuntary memories are successfully retrieved using the same system as voluntary memory when retrieving perceptual information. Voluntary and involuntary recall were both associated with increased activations in the posterior cingulated gyrus, left precuneus, and right parahippocampal gyrus. In addition, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus were more active during voluntary recall, while left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more active during involuntary recall. It is suggested that the activation seen in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during involuntary memory recall reflects the attempt to prevent the recollected material from interfering with the semantic judgment task.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, N. M., Gjedde, A., &amp; Kupers, R. (2008). Neural mechanisms of voluntary and involuntary recall : A PET study. Behavioural brain research, 186 (2), 261-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of age==

===Development===
While age plays a role in memory capabilities, it has been found that general strategies used to encode (to remember) memories is more important.&lt;ref&gt;Sophian, C., &amp; Hagen, J. W. (1978). Involuntary memory and the development of retrieval skills in young children. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 26 (3), 458–471.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those that are better at memorizing information are more likely to have more involuntary memories. 
 
In younger children (ages 10 and under), it has also been found that inducing involuntary memory during testing produced significantly better results than using voluntary memory.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, T. A. (1989). Developmental aspects of activating voluntary and involuntary memory processes during reading. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], 14 (1), 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be accomplished by posing a vague, mildly related question or sentence prior to the actual test question.  In older children (aged 14 and above), the opposite holds, with strictly voluntary memory leading to better test results.

===Reminiscence bump===
The [[reminiscence bump]] is the phenomenon where in memories formed during adolescence and early adulthood are more commonly remembered than those throughout other periods in life.  This is due to the formation of [[self-identity]]&lt;ref&gt;Conway, M. A., Wang, Q., Hanyu, K., &amp; Haque, S. (2005). A cross-cultural investigation of autobiographical memory. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 36, 739–749. {{doi|10.1177/0022022105280512}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the development of cognitive abilities across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, D. C., Rahhal, T. A., &amp; Poon, L. W. (1998). Things learned in early adulthood are remembered best. Memory &amp; Cognition, 26, 3-19. {{doi|10.3758/BF03211366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, S. M. J., Kristo, G., Rouw, R., &amp; Murre, J. M. J. (2015). The relation between verbal and visuospatial memory and autobiographical memory. Consciousness and Cognition, 31, 12-23. {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2014.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that this is true for both voluntary and involuntary memories.&lt;ref&gt;Schlagman, S., Kliegel, M., Schulz, J., &amp; Kvavilashvili, L. (2009). Differential effects of age on involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memory. Psychology and Aging, 24(2), 397–411. {{doi|10.1037/a0015785}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Age has been found to have a difference on the amount of memories recalled, but no age differences were found in the specificity of involuntary memories.

==The role of emotion==

===Emotion intensity===
[[Emotion]] plays a strong role in relation to [[emotion and memory|memory]].  It has been found that memories associated with stronger emotions (e.g.: being happy at your wedding) are more easily remembered and quickly recalled,&lt;ref&gt;D'Argembeau, A., &amp; Van der Linden, M. (2005). Influence of emotion on memory for temporal information. Emotion, 5(4), 503–507. {{doi|10.1037/1528-3542.5.4.503}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are those formed during moments of intense stress.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, N. M., &amp; Berntsen, D. (2008). The effect of emotional stress on involuntary and voluntary conscious memories. Memory, 16(1), 48–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same holds true for involuntary memories, with happy involuntary memories occurring twice as often as unhappy or neutral involuntary memories.&lt;ref&gt;Berntsen, D., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2002). Emotionally charged autobiographical memories across the life span: The recall of happy, sad, traumatic and involuntary memories. Psychology and Aging, 17 (4), 636–652.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In clinical disorders==

===Posttraumatic stress disorder===
Often people who have been the victims of some type of trauma describe vivid memories that intrude on their thoughts spontaneously and without warning. Such mental intrusions, if maintained over time compose the hallmark symptom of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]].&lt;ref name="Berntsen2008"&gt;Berntsen, D., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2008). The reappearance hypothesis revisited: Recurrent involuntary memories after traumatic events and in everyday life. Memory &amp; Cognition (pre-2012), 36 (2), 449-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' defines a trauma as an event in which someone experiences, or witnesses' severe injury to themselves or others or a threat to their integrity. The person must also have responded with fear, helplessness or horror at the time of the trauma. The main psychological consequences of this include re-experiencing the traumatic event (through both intrusive thoughts and images), avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, and increased arousal levels.

When it comes to involuntary memory, researchers are mainly interested in the concept of these trauma-related intrusions, which generally involved some form of re-experiencing the event, including a sensory component (e.g., imagery in any modality be it visual, auditory etc.). These intrusions, often termed "[[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]]", make the victim feel as though they are reliving the trauma, and cause high levels of emotional arousal, and the sense of an impending threat. Typically, they are parts of the traumatic event that were most salient at the time, known as "hotspots" and have the definitive feature that they cause high levels of emotional distress, and may be difficult to recall deliberately. Although this is a defining feature of PTSD, intrusive memories are also frequently encountered in anxiety-based disorders, psychotic disorders and even within the general population.&lt;ref name=Berntsen2008/&gt; Regardless of the context in which they are encountered, intrusions tend to have the same central feature; that the stored information is being recalled involuntarily. It is thought that intrusions arise when an individual encounters stimuli similar to the stimuli that were processed and stored during the trauma, thus triggering the memory into the conscious mind.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt; A common example is one in which someone who has the victim of a car crash, upon hearing the screeching of tires experiences a flashback of their own collision, as if they are back at the original event.

===Psychosis===
Stressful and traumatic events, which may manifest as involuntary memories called ''flashbacks'', may trigger a wide range of anxiety-based and [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders. [[Social phobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hackmann, A., Clark, D. M., &amp; Mcmanus, F. (2000). Recurrent images and early memories in social phobia. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 38(6), 601–610.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Mansell, W., &amp; Lam, D. (2004). A preliminary study of autobiographical memory in remitted bipolar and unipolar depression and the role of imagery in memory specificity. Memory, 12, 437–446.&lt;/ref&gt; [[major depressive disorder|depression]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuyken, W., &amp; Brewin, C. R. (1994). Stress and coping in depressed women. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 18(5), 403–412.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agoraphobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Day, S. J., Holmes, E. A., &amp; Hackmann, A. (2004). Occurrence of imagery and its link with early memories in agoraphobia. Memory, 12, 416–427&lt;/ref&gt; are a few examples of disorders that have influences from flashbacks.

Psychosis is defined as a range of perceptual presentations, with the associated symptoms frequently referred to as either ''positive'' or ''negative''. Positive symptoms are delusional, and may include hallucinations, while negative symptoms are characterized by a "lack" of functioning, which may include a lack of affect (emotional feeling) and loss of motivation.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt; One study found that there was a high prevalence of trauma in patients with severe mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mueser, K. T., Trumbettam S. L., Rosenberg, S. D., Vivader, R., Goodman, L. B., Osher, F. C., Auciello, P., &amp; Foy, D. W. (1998). Trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in severe mental illness. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 66, 493–499.&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small percentage had been diagnosed with PTSD when displaying PTSD-like symptoms. Therefore, the more complex symptoms of psychosis may prevent the clinical detection required when diagnosing PTSD. In addition, those who have been diagnosed with PTSD and have an identified form of trauma show positive symptoms of psychosis such as delusions and/or hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, S. E., Carlson, E. B., &amp; Sheikh, J. I. (2000). Psychotic symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder. CNS Spectrums, 5(9), 52-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it has been suggested that individuals suffering from psychosis may be more vulnerable to intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;Steel, C., Fowler, D., &amp; Holmes, E. A. (2005). Trauma-related intrusions and psychosis: An information processing account. Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 33(2), 139–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Luis Ramírez''' (born 1958-12-03) is a retired Mexican [[Boxing|boxer]]. He was a two-time World Lightweight Champion.

==Career==
A native of [[Huatabampo, Sonora]] and a resident of [[Culiacan, Sinaloa|Culiacán]], Ramírez made his professional debut on March 25, 1973 at the age of 15. He climbed slowly but steadily on boxing's rankings. In 1978, as a Featherweight, a 19 year old Ramírez lost by knockout for the only time in his career to legendary three time former world champion [[Rubén Olivares]] in two rounds.

After his move in weight to the Lightweights, 21-year-old Ramírez accumulated a record of 67-2, and met another boxing legend inside a ring, when he fought [[Alexis Argüello]]. Ramírez dropped Argüello for the first time in his career in round six, but lost a disputed ten round split decision in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zr0lAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oPMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6123,1448964&amp;dq=alexis+arguello+ramirez&amp;hl=en Chandler's Booty: A Belt of Gold]. ''The Miami News''. November 15, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He then faced [[Ray Mancini]] for the North American Lightweight belt, and lost a 12 round decision in [[Ohio]]. By then, Ramírez and [[Julio César Chávez]] were gymmates and friends.

Ramírez won his following 10 bouts and on May 1, 1983, he was given the chance at becoming world Lightweight champion for the first time, when he fought [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Edwin Rosario|Edwin "El Chapo" Rosario]] at the [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum|Coliseo Roberto Clemente]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], for the [[World Boxing Council]]'s championship. Ramírez lost a close 12 round unanimous decision, but on November 3, of 1984, he and Rosario had a rematch, also in San Juan. After rising from two knockdowns, Ramírez rallied back to stagger Rosario in the third round. With Rosario pinned against a corner and Ramírez attacking, referee [[Steve Crosson]] stopped the bout in round four, after Ramírez had landed 17 straight punches, making Ramírez a world Lightweight champion for the first time, by a technical [[knockout]]. The fight was named the 1984 [[Ring Magazine fight of the year]].

Ramírez then went into training for a defense against [[Hector Camacho|Héctor Camacho]], another boxer from [[Puerto Rico]]. The fight was postponed when Camacho suffered a broken ankle during a pick up [[basketball]] game, but it finally came off on August 10, 1985. On his first fight telecast on [[HBO Boxing]], Ramírez was dropped in round three and lost a 12 round unanimous decision.

Ramírez, a culturally intellectual person, moved to [[Paris, France|Paris]] soon after. There, he re-grouped, and was able to regain the WBC's world championship when Camacho left it vacant in 1987, by edging out [[Terrence Alli]] with another close but unanimous 12 round decision. In his first title defense, he defeated former champion [[Cornelius Boza Edwards]] by fifth round knock out. In his second defense, he was awarded a 12 round split decision victory against future multiple world champion [[Pernell Whitaker]].  The consensus among both media and fans was that Whitaker deserved to win the fight.

Back in Mexico, he and Chávez were neighbors. Chávez had lifted the [[World Boxing Association]]'s world Lightweight championship by beating Rosario, and a unification bout between the two friends and neighbors was planned. Ramírez, who is a godfather to one of Chávez's sons, lost an 11 round technical decision to Chávez on October 29 of 1988, which marked the last day he would be a world champion.

In 1989, he tried to win the [[International Boxing Federation]]'s belt from Whitaker, in [[Virginia]], but he lost a 12 round decision. Then, in 1990, he returned to [[France]], where he lost to [[Juan Martin Coggi]] by a decision in 12 for the WBA's world Jr. Welterweight title in [[Ajaccio]]. After that bout, he retired.

Ramírez was a member of the less recognized, defunct ''World Boxing Hall of Fame'' in [[California]], not to be confused with the more widely recognized [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in [[Canastota, New York|Canastota]]. In 2003, [[Ring magazine]] placed Ramirez on their list of the 100 greatest punchers of all time.

His boxing record is 102-9 (82 KOs). Seven of Ramirez's nine career losses came against future hall of fame members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">{{See also|The Killing Jar (disambiguation)}}
A '''killing jar''' is a device used by [[entomologist]]s to kill captured [[insect]]s quickly and with minimum damage.&lt;ref&gt;Smithers, C. N. 1988. The Handbook of Insect Collecting. {{ISBN|0-589-50288-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jar, typically glass, must be [[Hermetic seal|hermetically sealable]] and one design has a thin layer of hardened [[plaster of paris]] on the bottom to absorb the killing agent. The killing agent will then slowly evaporate, allowing the jar to be used many times before needing to refresh the jar. The absorbent plaster of paris layer also helps prevent the agent sticking to and damaging insects. Crumpled paper tissue is also placed in the jar for the same reason. A second method utilises a wad of cotton or other absorbent material placed in the bottom of the jar. Liquid killing agent is then added until the absorbent material is nearly saturated. A piece of stiff paper or cardboard cut to fit the inside of the jar tightly is then pressed in.&lt;ref name="ars.usda"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/site_main.htm?docid=10141|publisher=USDA|title= Collecting and Preserving Insects and Mites: Tools and Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common killing agents are [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[chloroform]] and [[ethyl acetate]]. Ethyl acetate has many advantages and is very widely used. Its fumes are less toxic to humans than those of the other agents and specimens will remain limp if they are left in an ethyl acetate killing jar for several days and the ethyl acetate is not allowed to entirely evaporate from the specimens. A disadvantage is that although the  insects are quickly stunned by ethyl acetate it kills them slowly and specimens may revive if removed from the killing jar too soon. Isopropyl alcohol is an easy to find and use killing agent for amateurs. [[Potassium cyanide]] or other cyanide compounds including calcium cyanide are also used, but only by experts due to its extreme toxicity. It also has the disadvantages of making the specimens brittle when left in the jar for several hours and may also cause some discoloration of colored specimens. It does kill rapidly and the cyanide charge will last a long time. A few drops of acetic acid will increase the cyanide gas production.  If the jar is not used for long periods it may dry out and produce little gas, therefore a few drops of water will also help get the process going again.&lt;ref name="ars.usda" /&gt; The potassium cyanide slowly decomposes, releasing [[hydrogen cyanide]]. In former times, amateur entomolgists commonly used the thick green leaves of the Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) which, crushed or finely sliced, will similarly release hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry Laurel [www-saps.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/trees/laurel.htm], Retrieved on 25 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Killing jars are only used on hard-bodied insects. Soft-bodied insects, such as the [[larva|larval]] stage, are generally [[Fixation (histology)|fixed]] in [[ethanol]] at 70-80% concentration.

[[File:Treny normal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jan Kochanowski]] with dead daughter in painting inspired by the poet's ''[[Laments (Treny)|Laments]]'']]

A '''lament''' or '''lamentation''' is a passionate expression of [[grief]], often in [[music]], [[poetry]], or [[song]] form. The grief is most often born of [[regret]], or [[mourning]]. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, [[Complaint|moaning]] and/or [[crying]].&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Michalowski, trans., Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1989), 39–62; cited in Nancy Lee, Lyrics of Lament: From Tragedy to Transformation (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures.  

==History==
[[File:Egyptian mourners001.jpg|thumb|150px|Egyptian women weeping and lamenting.]]
Many of the oldest and most lasting poems in human [[history]] have been laments.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Austin, "The Lament and the Rhetoric of the Sublime" ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'' '''53'''.3 (December 1998:279-306) traces the literary rhetoric  evoking a voice crying.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lament for Sumer and Ur]] dates back at least 4000 years to ancient [[Sumer]], the world's first urban civilization. Laments are present in both the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and laments continued to be sung in [[elegiacs]] accompanied by the [[aulos]] in classical and [[Hellenistic]] Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Alexiou, ''Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition'' (Cambridge University Press) 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of laments appear in ''[[Beowulf]]'', in the [[Hindu]] [[Veda]]s, and in [[ancient Near Eastern]] religious texts. They are included in the Mesopotamian city laments such as the [[Lament for Ur]] and the [[Jew]]ish [[Tanakh]], (which would later become the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]]).

In many oral traditions, both early and modern, the lament has been a genre usually performed by women:&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou 1974; Angela Bourke, "More in anger than in sorrow: Irish women's lament poetry", in Joan Newlon Radnor, ed., ''Feminist Messages: Coding in Women's Folk Culture'' (Urbana: Illinois University Press) 1993:160-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Batya Weinbaum made a case for the spontaneous lament of women chanters in the creation of the oral tradition that resulted in the ''[[Iliad]]''&lt;ref&gt;Batya Weinbaum, "Lament Ritual Transformed into Literature: Positing Women's Prayer as Cornerstone in Western Classical Literature" ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''114''' No. 451 (Winter 2001:20-39).&lt;/ref&gt; The material of lament, the "sound of trauma" is as much an element in the [[Book of Job]] as in the genre of [[pastoral elegy]], such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s "Adonais" or [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "Thyrsis".&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1998:280f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Lamentations]] or ''Lamentations of Jeremiah'' figures in the Old Testament. The ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'' (under many closely variant terms) is a common subject from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'' in art]], showing his dead body being mourned after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]].

A Lament in The Book of Lamentations or in the [[Psalms]] (in the particular Lament/Complaint Psalms of the [[Tanakh]], may be looked at as "a cry of need in a context of crisis when Israel lacks the resources to fend for itself."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Brueggeman, ''An Unsettling God'', (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2009) 13&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of looking at it is all the more basic: laments simply being "appeals for divine help in distress".&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt; These laments, too, often have a set format: an address to God, description of the suffering/anguish which one seeks relief, a petition for help and deliverance, a curse towards one's enemies, an expression of the belief of ones innocence or a confession of the lack thereof, a vow corresponding to an expected divine response, and lastly, a song of thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of a general format of this, both in the individual and communal laments, can be seen in Psalm 3 and Psalm 44 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament,'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lament of Edward II]]'', if it is actually written by [[Edward II of England]], is the sole surviving composition of his.

A heroine's lament is a conventional fixture of [[Baroque opera|baroque]] [[opera seria]], accompanied usually by strings alone, in [[descending tetrachord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Rosand, 2007. ''Opera in Seventeenth-Century Venice'' (University of California Press),  "The lament aria: variations on a theme" pp 377ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their plangent cantabile melodic lines, evocatively free, non-[[strophic]] construction and [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]] pace, operatic laments have remained vividly memorable soprano or mezzo-soprano [[aria]]s even when separated from the emotional pathos of their operatic contexts. An early example is Ariadne's "Lasciatemi morire", which is the only survivor of [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s lost ''Arianna''. [[Francesco Cavalli]]'s operas extended the ''lamento'' formula, in numerous exemplars, of which Ciro's "Negatemi respiri" from ''Ciro'' is notable.&lt;ref&gt;"Negatemi respiri" and several others are noted by Rosand 2007:377f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include [[Dido's Lament|Dido's lament, "When I am laid"]] ([[Henry Purcell]], ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''), "[[Lascia ch'io pianga]]" ([[Georg Friedrich Handel]], ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''), "Caro mio ben" (Tomasso or [[Giuseppe Giordani]]). The lament continued to represent a musico-dramatic high point. In the context of [[opera buffa]], the Countess's lament, "Dove sono" comes as a surprise to the audience of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Marriage of Figaro]]'', and in [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[Barber of Seville]]'', Rosina's plaintive words at her apparent abandonment are followed, not by the expected lament aria, but by a vivid orchestral interlude of storm music. The heroine's lament remained a fixture in romantic opera, and the Marschallin's monologue in Act I of ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' can be understood as a penetrating psychological lament.&lt;ref&gt;Called "the Marschallin's Act I lament", in Jeremy Eichler, "Lushly Lamenting the Wages of Time and a Lost Golden Age" opera review in ''The New York Times'' March 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish laments==
The purely instrumental lament is a common form in [[pìobaireachd]] music for the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|Scottish bagpipes]]. "MacCrimmon's Lament" dates to the Jacobite uprising of 1745. The tune is held to have been written by Donald Ban MacCrimmon, piper to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, who supported the Hanoverians. It is said that Donald Ban, who was killed at Moy in 1746, had an intimation that he would not return.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/secondary/genericcontent_tcm4572872.asp "MacCrimmon's Lament", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006063418/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/secondary/genericcontent_tcm4572872.asp |date=2013-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known Gaelic [[lullaby]] is "[[Griogal Cridhe]]" ("Beloved Gregor"). It was composed in 1570 after the execution of Gregor MacGregor by the Campbells. The grief-stricken widow, Marion Campbell, describes what happened as she sings to her child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp "Lullabies and Dandlings", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070706/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cumhadh na Cloinne" (Lament for the Children) was composed by Padruig Mór MacCrimmon in the early 1650s. It is generally held to be based on the loss of seven of MacCrimmon's eight sons to an unknown illness, possibly brought to Skye by a trading vessel. Author Bridget MacKenzie, in ''Piping Traditions of Argyll'', suggests that it refers to the slaughter of the MacLeod's fighting Cromwell's forces at the Battle of Worcester. It may have been inspired by both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/pibroch/index.asp "Pibroch songs and canntaireachd", Education Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070629/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/pibroch/index.asp |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Scottish laments include "Lowlands Away"{{fact|date=April 2017}}, "MacPherson's Rant", and "Hector the Hero".

==Musical form==
There is a short, free musical form appearing in the Baroque and then again in the Romantic periods, called a [[Lament bass|lament]].  It is typically a set of harmonic [[Variation (music)|variations]] in [[Homophony|homophonic]] texture, wherein the bass descends through a tetrachord, usually one suggesting a [[Minor scale|minor mode]].

He was awarded the [[Military Medal]] for conspicuous gallantry on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1917.

==Death==
Colley-Priest went swimming on either 11 or 12 February 1928, at [[Balmoral, New South Wales|Balmoral Beach]], Sydney and was reported as missing on 13 February. On 14 February, a search team comprising the Balmoral local police and the New South Wales Water police were unable to find any signs of Colley-Priest.&lt;ref name="eaten"/&gt; After the police search, a man observed a floating body in the distance and alerted the police to its presence. However, as the police approached the body a "huge object heaved out of the sea, grabbed the body, and disappeared."&lt;ref name="eaten"/&gt; Newspapers at the time suggested suicide and that the body had been eaten by a shark.&lt;ref name="eaten"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article121862987 |title=Eaten by Shark? |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]] |location=Sydney |date=16 February 1928 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16441970 |title=Missing Man |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=NSW |date=15 February 1928 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |page=19 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February, an arm washed up on the beach near [[Dobroyd Point]] and was assumed to be Colley-Priest's.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17171">'''Leader-1''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] from the [[Go-Bots]], [[Robo Machine]]s and [[Transformers (toyline)|Transformers]] toy lines in 1983. The original Leader-1 was voiced by Lou Richards in the animated ''Challenge of the Gobots'' series. Since then Hasbro acquired legal rights to the name and has used it for a [[Mini-Con]].

In the animated series [[Challenge of the GoBots]], '''Leader-1''' is the leader of the Guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J.D. Reed |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,954424,00.html |title=Living: Hot Toys with a Special Twist - Printout |publisher=TIME |date=1984-10-01 |accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a brave leader who cares deeply about his people. He believes not one person should be in charge. He supports the democratic system of the Guardians. This led his former friend, [[Cy-Kill]], to break away from the Guardians. He took command of the evil Renegades and became Leader-1's worst enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Vibe July 2007, page 40 "Do the Robot"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Totally Tubular '80s | last=Bellomo | first=Mark | year=2010 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=1-4402-1282-1 | pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader-1 can fly, project energy blasts, and project a force field (which rapidly drains his power reserves). He has been known to use Guardian power suits that increases his speed and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal =Toyfare |title=Going, Going, Gobots  | author=Matt Caracappa | date=November 2007 |pages=80–82 |volume = 1 | issue = 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
Leader-1 appeared in ''Challenge of the GoBots'' episode #8, "Time Wars."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Time Wars |episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Jeff Seagle, Kelly Ward and Doug Booth |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= September 17, 1985|season= 1|number= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode #14 "Ultra Zod" Leader-1 dons a Power Suit and helps form the Power Warrior Courageous, which defeats Ultra Zod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Ultra Zod|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Jim Bertges|network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= September 25, 1985|season= 1|number= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode #23 "[[Doppelganger]]" [[Cy-Kill]], [[Cop-Tur]], [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]] and Snoop attacked Leader-1, Turbo, Scooter and [[Small Foot (Gobots)|Small Foot]]. Crasher wounded Small Foot. After attaining recordings of the Guardians, the Renegades retreated. Using the recordings Cy-Kill had [[Herr Fiend]] program robot duplicates of the Guardians. When demonstrating the Space Bender weapon to Unicom, Leader-1 learned that the Renegades were attacking Washington. The Renegades ambushed Leader-1 and replaced him with his duplicate. Leading the Command Center back to GoBotron, and getting rid of Scooter and Small Foot, the Renegades then released duplicates of Path Finder, Rest-Q, [[Van Guard]] and Turbo. Small Foot and Scooter were able to capture the Turbo duplicate and learn where their friends were being held. Cy-Kill then replaced Good Night. Using the duplicate Turbo, the Guardians infiltrated the Renegade base, freed the captured Guardians and escaped from Spoons and [[Fitor]]. Although blocked by the Renegades, Scooter used a hologram of [[Zod (GoBots)|Zod]] to make the Renegades flee. Making it back to GoBotron the Guardians were attacked by the Guardian duplicates. The real Guardians were able to defeat their duplicates with the aid of the real [[Zeemon]], [[Hans-Cuff]] and Rest-Q. Cy-Kill then arrived in [[Thrustor]] with more duplicates, but Small Foot was able to stop with robots using the Space Bender, which would fuse their robot brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Doppelganger|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Jeff Segal, Kelly Ward and Antoni Zalewski|network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= October 11, 1985|season= 1|number= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode #24 "Scooter Enhanced" Scooter and Small Foot joined Nick and A.J. to watch a car stunt show which was attacked by Crasher, [[BuggyMan]] and Fly Trap. Small Foot fought Buggyman and defeated him, but the Renegades regained the upper hand until the Guardians were rescued by Leader-1 and Turbo who arrived in Power Suits. Cy-Kill vowed to gain Power Suits for the Renegades. Scooter decided he needed more firepower, so he had [[Baron Von Joy]] remove his damaged holo projector in favor of a blaster unit. [[Screw Head]], Bad Boy and Cop-Tur were sent to attack Unicom bases and distract the Guardians while Cy-Kill, Crasher and Scorp attempted to take the suits from the Guardian Command Center. Small Foot and Scooter were able to delay the Renegades until Leader-1 and Turbo returned to chase away the Renegades. Realizing he was a better Guardian with his holo projector, Scooter had it reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Scooter Enhanced|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Jeff Segal, Kelly Ward and Mark Young |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= November 24, 1985|season= 1|number= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode #25, "Tarnished Image" Doctor Go creates a device that allows the Renegades to appear like Guardians. Cy-Kill, Crasher and Cop-Tur disguise themselves as Leader-1, Scooter and Turbo and go on a rampage on Earth while the real Guardians are sent on a fake rescue mission. When the Guardians return they are banished from Earth by the humans. The Guardians are eventually able to prove the Renegades staged the attacks, chase them off and capture Doctor Go.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Tarnished Image|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits=Written by  Jeff Segal, Kelly Ward and David Schwartz |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate=November 25, 1985 |season= 1|number= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader-1 appears in "Auto-Madic" episode #28, where he dons a Power Suit and helped form the Power Warrior Courageous, which defeats Puzzler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Auto-Madic |episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Mark Zaslove |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= November 23, 1985|season= 1|number= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader-1 appeared in "Return to GoBotron" episode #45. He was given one of the Power Suits by the Last Engineer, which featured enhanced speed and strength. He combined with the other suits and the Last Engineer's ship to form the Power Warrior Courageous and defeat a fleet of Renegade Thrustors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Return to GoBotron |episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Jeff Segal, Kelly Ward, John Loy and Peter Anderegg |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= November 15, 1985|season= 1|number= 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Gobots'' Model Leader-1'''

When Hasbro bought out Tonka, they assumed ownership of the GoBots character names. [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]'s Mini-Con in [[Transformers: Armada]] was named Leader-1 (Barrel in Japan). This character has no connection to the GoBot Leader-1. Leader-1 was later recolored into [[Clench (Transformers)|Clench]] (Spark Barrel) as a partner to Armada [[Galvatron]], then into [[Caliburn]] as a partner to [[Megazarak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1-4053-0461-8 | page= 122}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader-1 has two different official mottos. The first comes from his biography page in Dreamwave comics, and the second from his biography page in the ''Transformers: Armada Official Guidebook''.

Bio: [From the Troop Assessment Files of Megatron, Decepticon Leader] It's quite laughable, really. In the very core of his spark, Leader-1 truly believes that-somehow, some way-he'll eventually become a leader in fact and not just name. At first, he tried to ingratiate himself with me, doing everything from suggesting battle tactics on the field to helping keep the other Mini-Cons in line in order to win my favor. When it became clear that this behavior wouldn't convince me to let him assume a station of command, he resorted to open acts of treachery against me...I still haven't forgotten his homicidal insubordination on the Moon. Yet, his tenacity and ingenuity occasionally impress me; in these respects, he is far superior to the average Mini-Con. But that changes nothing. I will never allow a lowly Mini-Con to exert any control over my operations or me; they are tools to be manipulated, nothing more. For Leader-1 to believe he can be something more than that, to think for one astrosecond that he could ever stand with me as an equal, is ridiculous and insulting beyond words. I will dash his dreams at every turn until he understands his place...if he doesn't, then he will be discarded and replaced.

Weapons and Abilities: Although I'll never tell the little scraplet this, his abilities have proven valuable to me. Leader-1 is a surprisingly intelligent and tactically inclined Mini-Con; had he the fortune to be created a Decepticon instead of a Mini-Con, he would've made an excellent warrior. In addition to his mobile cannon mode, he can also transform into a powerful handgun for my use.

Weaknesses: Leader-1 gives himself more credit than he deserves. Although he's clever, his plans are too grandiose to be achieved by just him. After all, he's only a Mini-Con.

===Fun Publications===
In "Balancing Act" Leader-1 appeared among the rebel Mini-Con forces who sided with Megatron and attempted to sabotage the Mini-Con evacuation from one of Cybertron's moons.

===Dreamwave Productions===
[[File:ArmadaIssue6Leader1.jpg|left|thumb|Leader-1 in Dreamwave comics]]
Leader-1 appeared among the Mini-Cons in issue #18 of the ''Transformers: Armada'' comic book who aided [[Over-Run]] using the [[Mini-Con Matrix]] in the defeat of Unicron.

===Toys===
*'''''Armada'' Megatron with Leader-1''
:This toy was redecoed into Galvatron with Clench and later as [[Megazarak]] with his Caliburn.

'''Li Quan''' (全莉) is a Beijing-born tiger and wildlife [[conservation biology|conservationist]] who lives in [[London]]. She is credited with the concept of [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] in the promotion of [[tiger]] conservation. This ensures zoo-born tigers develop hunting and other survival skills in a controlled natural environment prior to their return to the wild.&lt;ref name="Liu2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rewilded: Saving the South China Tiger |url=http://www.dimsum.co.uk/features/rewilded-saving-the-south-china-tiger.html |accessdate=27 August 2011 |first=Cecily |last=Liu |date=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929122435/http://www.dimsum.co.uk/features/rewilded-saving-the-south-china-tiger.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blandy2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=South China tiger finds hope in South Africa |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/12/13/2003392378 |accessdate=27 August 2011 |first=Fran |last=Blandy |date=13 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She initiated the world’s first such experiment by rewilding [[South China tiger]]s in collaboration with the [[State Forestry Administration of China]] at the [[Laohu Valley Reserve]] in [[South Africa]]. The concept was initially controversial, but it is now widely accepted as a viable strategy for wildlife conservation by many mainstream wildlife organizations including the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]].

Quan has founded several charities related to tiger and wildlife conservation. She is now a director of China Tiger Revival.&lt;ref name="Wild10.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsung Heroes - Li Quan|url=http://wild10.org/blog/unsung-heroes-li-quan |accessdate=29 August 2015|first=Wild|last=10|date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to devoting herself to wildlife conservation she was global head of licensing at the fashion house [[Gucci]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1392">'''Lucius Caecilicus Minutianus Appuleius''' was a writer of [[ancient Rome]] whose surviving works are about grammar. He was commonly acknowledged until the 19th century to be the author of a work ''de Orthographia'', of which considerable fragments were first published by Italian Cardinal and philologist [[Angelo Mai]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo Mai]], ''Juris Civilis Ante-Justinianei Reliquiae, &amp;c'', Rome, 1823&lt;/ref&gt;

They were republished by [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], with two other grammatical works, ''de Nota Aspirationis'' and ''de Diphthongis'', which also bear the name of Appuleius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Darmstadt]], 1826&lt;/ref&gt; Danish philologist [[Johan Nicolai Madvig]] showed that the treatise ''de Orthographia'' was actually the work of a literary impostor of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Nicolai Madvig]], ''de Apuleii Fragm. de Orthogr.'', Hafniae, 1829&lt;/ref&gt; The two other grammatical treatises above mentioned were probably written in the tenth century.

[[Don (honorific)|Dona]] '''Maria Leopoldina of Austria''' (22 January 1797&amp;nbsp;– 11 December 1826) was an [[archduchess]] of [[Austria]], [[Empress consort]] of [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Queen consort]] of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]].

She was born ''Caroline Josepha Leopoldine Franziska Ferdinanda of Habsburg-Lorraine'' in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], the daughter of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], and his second wife, [[Maria Teresa of Naples and Sicily]]. Among her many siblings were Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] and [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], the wife of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]].

== Early life ==
[[File:Maria Leopoline of Austria Brasilia2.jpg|thumb|left|Leopoldina in her youth, 1800s]]
Leopoldina was born on 22 January 1797 in [[Schönbrunn Palace]], in [[Vienna]], [[Archduchy of Austria]]. She was given the name Caroline Josepha Leopoldine Franziska Ferdinanda,{{sfn|Oberacker|1988|p=31}} according to her biographer Carlos H. Oberacker, and confirmed by Bettina Kann in her work "Cartas de uma Imperatriz", who mentioned a contemporary source: the Austrian newspaper ''[[Wiener Zeitung]]'' of 25 January 1797, who gave the news of the birth of the Archduchess three days before with her full name. According to Oberacker, the name "Maria" wasn't present in the preserved baptismal record of the Archduchess,{{sfn|Oberacker|1988|pp=301–302}} and she began to use it only during her journey to Brazil, where she began to be named Maria Leopoldina in all documents, including the Constitutional oath of 1822. According to another theory presented by Oberacker, the Archduchess probably began to use the name "Maria" due to her great devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]] and because all her sisters-in-law used this name.

She was raised in accordance with the educational principles laid down by her grandfather, [[Emperor Leopold II]]. Among these was the habit of exercising her handwriting by writing the following text:&lt;ref name="sunday"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/das-sonntagskind-leopoldine | title=Leopoldine: Sunday's child | publisher=habsburger.net | work=The World of the Habsburgs | year=2010 | accessdate=March 9, 2012 | author=Schloß Schönbrunn | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221174903/http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/das-sonntagskind-leopoldine | archivedate=February 21, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Do not oppress the poor. Be charitable. Do not complain about what God has given you, but improve your habits. We must strive earnestly to be good.}}

In addition, she and her sisters were taught to speak [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]].

Although Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily was her birth mother, Leopoldina always considered Maria Ludovika d'Este, her stepmother, to be her mother and she grew up with Ludovika as her "spiritual mother".&lt;ref name="sunday" /&gt;

== Marriage to Pedro==

On 24 September 1816 it was announced by Leopoldina's father that [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro of Braganza]] wished to take a Habsburg princess as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/leopoldines-schicksalsjahr-1816 | title=1816 – A fateful year for Leopoldine | publisher=habsburger.net | work=The World of the Habsburgs | year=2010 | accessdate=March 9, 2012 | author=Schloß Schönbrunn | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709144722/http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/leopoldines-schicksalsjahr-1816 | archivedate=July 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klemens von Metternich]] suggested that it should be Leopoldina to go get married, as it was "her turn" to become a wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/eine-anfrage-aus-rio-de-janeiro | title=An enquiry from Rio de Janeiro | publisher=habsburger.net | work=The World of Habsburgs | year=2010 | accessdate=March 9, 2012 | author=Schloß Schönbrunn | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715095244/http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/eine-anfrage-aus-rio-de-janeiro | archivedate=July 15, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two ships were prepared and in April 1817 scientists, painters, gardeners and a taxidermist, all with assistants, travelled to [[Rio de Janeiro]] ahead of Leopoldina, whom, in the meantime, studied the history and geography of her future home and learned [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. During these weeks Leopoldina compiled and wrote a [[vade mecum]], a unique document the like of which has never been produced by any other Habsburg princess.&lt;ref name="tropics"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/heirat-reise-nach-brasilien-expedition | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207191259/http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/heirat-reise-nach-brasilien-expedition | dead-url=yes | archive-date=December 7, 2011 | title=An expedition to the tropics | publisher=habsburger.net | work=The World of the Habsburgs | year=2010 | accessdate=March 9, 2012 | author=Schloß Schönbrunn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 1817 Leopoldina was married to Dom Pedro ''per procuram'' (by proxy) in Vienna. At the ceremony the bridegroom was represented by Leopoldina’s uncle, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]]. Embarkation took place in Livorno on 13 August 1817 among much celebration, and after an adventure-filled voyage lasting 81 days, Leopoldina arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 5 November and finally met her husband.&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/ein-portugiesischer-maerchenprinz | title=A Portuguese fairy-tale prince? | publisher=habsburger.net | work=The World of the Habsburgs | year=2010 | accessdate=March 9, 2012 | author=Schloß Schönbrunn | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206173723/http://english.habsburger.net/module-en/ein-portugiesischer-maerchenprinz | archivedate=December 6, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Debret-desembarque.jpg|thumb|right|Arrival of Archduchess Leopoldina in [[Rio de Janeiro]], 5 November 1817.]]
From a distance Pedro initially appeared to Leopoldina to be a perfect, well-educated gentleman, but the reality was very different. Dom Pedro was a year younger than Leopoldina and sadly rarely measured up to the descriptions given by the matchmakers. His temperament was impulsive and choleric, and his education but modest. Even spoken communication between the young married couple proved difficult, as Pedro spoke very little French and his Portuguese could only be described as vulgar.&lt;ref name="prince" /&gt;

In keeping with Portuguese tradition, at the age of eighteen Pedro of Braganza not only had a string of amorous adventures behind him and was principally interested in horse racing and love affairs, but in 1817 (the year of his marriage to Leopoldina) he was living as if in wedlock with French dancer Noemie Thierry, who was finally removed from the court by his father a month after Leopoldina's arrival in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="prince" /&gt;

The young married couple took up residence in six relatively small rooms in the [[Paço de São Cristóvão|Palace of São Cristóvão]]. The inner courtyard and path to the stables were unpaved and the tropical rainfall quickly turned everything to mud. There were insects everywhere, including in their clothing, for the uniforms and court regalia made of velvet and plush rotted and turned mouldy in the heat and humidity.&lt;ref name="prince" /&gt;

==Regent of Brazil==

[[File:D. Leopoldina - ca. 1817.jpg|thumb|left|Leopoldina wearing court dress and the insignia of the [[Order of the Southern Cross|Imperial Order of the Southern Cross]], c. 1817]]
On 25 April 1821, the court returned to Portugal. A fleet of 11 ships took the king, the court, the royal house and the royal treasury, and only Prince Pedro remained in Brazil as regent of the country, with ample powers counterbalanced by a regency council. At first Pedro was incapable of dominating the chaos: the situation was dominated by the Portuguese troops, in anarchic conditions. The opposition between Portuguese and Brazilians became increasingly evident. It is clear from Leopoldina's correspondence that she has warmly espoused the cause of the Brazilian people and even desired the independence of the country and is therefore loved and venerated by the Brazilians.

According to Ezekiel Ramirez, below, the signs of a nascent Brazilian unit as an independent nation in the southern provinces were visible, but the north supported the Lisbon Cortes and called for regional independence. If the Prince Regent had left the country at that moment, Brazil would be lost to Portugal because the courts of Lisbon repeated the same error that led the Spanish courts to lose the colonies, seeking to establish direct contacts with each province in particular.

In Rio, thousands of signatures collected required the regents to remain in Brazil. "José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva's courageous attitude toward Portuguese arrogance greatly encouraged the aspirations for unity that existed in the southern provinces, especially in São Paulo. A highly educated men led this movement." After Fico's day, 9 January 1822, a new ministry was organized under the leadership of Jose Bonifacio, "strictly monarchist", and the Prince Royal soon won the trust of the people. On 15 February 1822 the Portuguese troops left Rio, and their departure represented the dissolution of the ties between Brazil and the metropolis. The prince was triumphantly received in Minas Gerais.

When her husband, prince regent, traveled to São Paulo in August 1822 to pacify politics (which culminated in the proclamation of Brazil's independence in September), Leopoldina exercised the regency. Great was his influence in the process of independence. The Brazilians were already aware that Portugal intended to call Pedro back, relegating Brazil again to the status of a simple colony rather than a [[Kingdom of Brazil|kingdom]] united to that of Portugal. There were fears that a civil war would separate the [[Province of São Paulo]] from the rest of Brazil. Pedro gave power to Leopoldina on 13 August 1822, appointing her head of the Council of State and Acting Princess Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil, with legal powers to govern the country during his absence and set out to appease São Paulo.

[[File:Maria Leopoldina regent.jpg|thumb|[[Dom (title)|Dona]] Leopoldina, then Princess Royal Regent of the [[Kingdom of Brazil]], presides a meeting of the Council of Ministers on September 2, 1822.]]
The Princess received news that Portugal was preparing action against Brazil and, without time to wait for Pedro's return, Leopoldina, advised by Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva, and using his attributes as interim head of government, met in the morning of 2 September 1822, with the Council of State, signing the decree of Independence, declaring Brazil separate from Portugal. The Princess sends Pedro a letter, along with another letter from José Bonifácio, as well as comments from Portugal criticizing the actions of her husband and King João VI. It demands that Pedro proclaim the Independence of Brazil and, in the letter, warns: "The pommel is ripe, pick it up already, or it will rot."

The officer arrived at the prince on 7 September 1822. Leopoldina had also sent papers received from [[Lisbon]], and comments from Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada, deputy to the courts, for which the Prince-Regent learned of criticism of him in the metropolis. The position of John VI and all his ministry, dominated by the courts, was difficult.

While awaiting the return of Pedro, Leopoldina, the interim ruler of an already independent Brazil, idealized the flag of Brazil, in which she mixed the green of the [[House of Braganza]] and the golden yellow of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg]]. Other authors say that [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]], the French artist who designed what he saw in Brazil in the 1820s, was the author of the national pavilion that replaced that of the old Portuguese court, symbol of the oppression of the old regime. Debret is the design of the beautiful imperial flag, in collaboration with Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva, in which the green rectangle of the Braganza represented the forests and the yellow rhombus, color of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, represented the gold.

== Empress of Brazil ==

[[File:Leopoldina-schlapritz-mcm.jpg|thumb|left|Leopoldina, Empress consort of Brazil]]
[[File:Juramento da Imperatriz Leopoldina à Constituição do Império 02.tiff|thumb|Oath of the Empress Maria Leopoldina to the Brazilian Constitution, 1824.]]
Maria Leopoldina became Brazil's first [[Queen consort|empress consort]]. She also played an important role in the process of issuing a [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. On 2 September 1822, a new decree with demands from Lisbon arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], while Prince Pedro was in [[São Paulo]]. Leopoldina, advised by [[José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva|José Bonifácio]], and using her power as [[Prince Regent|Princess Regent]], met on 2 September 1822 with the Council of Ministers. She decided to send her husband the news along with a letter advising him to declare Brazil's independence and warned him, "The fruit is ready, it's time to harvest." Prince Pedro declared the country's independence upon receiving the letter on 7 September 1822.

When his father, [[João VI of Portugal|João VI]], died on 10 March 1826, Pedro inherited the Portuguese throne as King Pedro IV, while remaining Emperor Pedro I of Brazil. Maria Leopoldina thus became both Empress consort of Brazil and Queen consort of Portugal. However, two months later, Pedro was forced to give up the Portuguese throne to their seven-year-old daughter [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria]].

At the end of November 1826, Pedro traveled to Cisplatina (now Uruguay) to join his soldiers. To mark the occasion there was a large farewell reception on 20 November 1826, and Pedro demanded that both women, Maria Leopoldina and his official mistress [[Domitila de Castro, Marchioness of Santos]], appear together before the ecclesiastical and diplomatic dignitaries and receive his kiss on the hand. With the fulfillment of this demand, Maria Leopoldina would have officially recognized her husband's mistress, and for this she refused to appear at the reception. This caused a bitter argument with Pedro, who departed with no resolution to the situation.&lt;ref name ="Kaiser"&gt;[http://cas.umn.edu/assets/pdf/dona_leopoldina.pdf Gloria Kaiser: ''Dona Leopoldina – Habsburg Princess, Empress of Brazil'', 2009, p. 15] [retrieved 14 July 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, Maria Leopoldina became ill, had spells of fever, became delirious at times, and then suffered a miscarriage on 2 December 1826. She died eight days later, on 11 December, five weeks before
her thirtieth birthday. She was buried on 14 December 1826 in Rio de Janeiro, in the church of the
Ajuda Convent.&lt;ref name ="Kaiser"/&gt;

'''Mark Elliot Zuckerberg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ʌ|k|ər|b|ɜr|g}}; born May 14, 1984) is an American [[List of Internet entrepreneurs|technology entrepreneur]] and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding and leading [[Facebook]] as its chairman and [[chief executive officer]].&lt;ref name=FBM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/facebook-surges-mark-zuckerberg-pockets-3-8-billion-143114560.html|publisher=Yahoo!

Born in [[White Plains, New York]], Zuckerberg attended [[Harvard University]], where he launched Facebook from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]], and [[Chris Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3#we-can-talk-about-that-after-i-get-all-the-basic-functionality-up-tomorrow-night-1 |title=At Last&amp;nbsp;– The Full Story Of How Facebook Was Founded|work=Business Insider|first=Nicholas|last=Carlson|date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His [[net worth]] is estimated to be [[United States dollar|US$]]55.0 billion as of November 30, 2018, declining over the last year with Facebook stock as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/mark-e-zuckerberg/|title=Mark Zuckerberg, Bloomberg Billionaires Index&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] award.&lt;ref name="NetWorth"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-zuckerberg/|title=Mark Zuckerberg|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=POTY&gt;{{cite news|first=Lev|last=Grossman|authorlink=Lev Grossman|url=https://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2037183_2037185,00.html|title=Person of the Year 2010: Mark Zuckerberg|date=December 15, 2010|work=Time|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817081156/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2037183_2037185,00.html|archivedate=August 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The All-Time TIME 100 of All Time|url=https://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2112269_2112278,00.html|access-date=April 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419230619/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2112269_2112278,00.html|archivedate=April 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on [[Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People|''Forbes'' list of The World's Most Powerful People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The World's Most Powerful People|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidewalt/2016/12/14/the-worlds-most-powerful-people-2016/|newspaper=Forbes|date=December 2016|access-date=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

At [[Ardsley High School]], Zuckerberg excelled in classes. He transferred to the private school [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], in New Hampshire, in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (mathematics, astronomy, and physics) and classical studies. In his youth, he also attended the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] [[Center for Talented Youth]] summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg stated that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.&lt;ref name=Kirkpatrick&gt;{{cite book |title=The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World |last=Kirkpatrick |first=David |year=2010 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4391-0211-4 |pages=20–21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRUkLhyGZVgC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|access-date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatwelearned"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Caitlin |last=McDevitt |title=What We Learned About Mark Zuckerberg This Week |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/facebook-status/2010/03/05/what-we-learned-about-mark-zuckerberg-week |work=The Big Money|access-date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grynbaum |first=Michael M. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/mark-e-zuckerberg-06-the-whiz |title=Mark E.

==Software developer==
===Early years===
Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in [[middle school]]. His father taught him [[Atari]] [[BASIC Programming]] in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of [[AOL]]'s [[Instant messaging|Instant Messenger]], which came out the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letsintern.com/blog/4-thing-mark-zuckerberg/ |title=4-thing-mark-zuckerberg | access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learni.st/users/jacobrwheeler/boards/83006-facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy |title=facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy | access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer [[Jose Antonio Vargas]], "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." Vargas notes that Zuckerberg was not, however, a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school [[fencing]] team and earned a classics diploma. [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', by [[Virgil]], during a Facebook product conference.&lt;ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /&gt;

During Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used [[machine learning]] to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to ''[[Slashdot]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/articles/03/04/21/110236.shtml |title=Machine Learning and MP3s |author=Hemos/Dan Moore |date=April 21, 2003 |work=Slashdot|access-date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from ''[[PC Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1748374,00.asp |title=Synapse Media Player Review |first=Troy |last=Dreier |date=February 8, 2005 |work=PC Magazine |access-date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College years===
[[File:MarkZuckerberg-crop.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Zuckerberg in 2005]]
Vargas noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at [[Harvard]], he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] and belonged to [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] and [[Kirkland House]].&lt;ref name = POTY /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mark Zuckerberg speaks at BYU, calls Facebook "as much psychology and sociology as it is technology" |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700121651/Mark-Zuckerberg-speaks-at-BYU-calls-Facebook-as-much-psychology-and-sociology-as-it-is-technology.html|first=Chase |last=Larson |work=Deseret News |date=March 25, 2011|access-date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[sophomore]] year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called [[History of Facebook#Facemash|Facemash]] that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.&lt;ref name=Hasit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/facebook-founder-s-roommate-recounts-creation-of-internet-giant-1.275748 |title=Facebook founder's roommate recounts creation of Internet giant |work=Haaretz |date=Oct 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's [[network switch]]es and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."&lt;ref name=Hasit /&gt;

The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new Web site.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Claire"&gt;{{Cite news |access-date=February 5, 2009 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |title=The Battle for Facebook |newspaper=Rolling Stone |location=New York |date=June 28, 2008 |author=Hoffman, Claire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703220456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |archivedate=July 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.&lt;ref name="skepticism"&gt;{{Cite news|access-date=April 30, 2008 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118539991204578084 |title=Judge Expresses Skepticism About Facebook Lawsuit |work=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Seward, Zachary M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]], while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;ref name="zuckerberghacked"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Nicolas |last=Carlson |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |work=Business Insider |access-date =March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three complained to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', and the newspaper began an investigation in response.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.&lt;ref name=nytb&gt;{{Cite news |work=New York Times blog |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/judge-ends-facebooks-feud-with-connectu/index.html |date=June 28, 2008 |title=Judge Ends Facebook's Feud With ConnectU |author=Stone, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/02/facebook-ipo-winklevoss-300m-fortune |title=Facebook IPO sees Winklevoss twins heading for $300m fortune |date=February 2, 2012 |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Dominic |last=Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1109/Mark-Zuckerberg-Harvard-dropout-returns-to-open-arms |title=Mark Zuckerberg, Harvard dropout, returns to open arms |publisher=CS Monitor |date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, he recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=As Mark Zuckerberg Turns 30, His 10 Best Quotes as CEO |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233890?newsletter=true |work=Entrepreneur |publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc|access-date=16 May 2014 |first=Jason |last=Fell |date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 28, 2017, Zuckerberg received an [[honorary degree]] from Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steinbock |first1=Anna |title=Harvard awards 10 honorary degrees |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/harvard-awards-10-honorary-degrees-at-366th-commencement/ |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |work=[[Harvard Gazette]] |date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pppfocus.com/2017/05/28/13-years-after-quitting-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-gets-honorary-harvard-degree/ |title=13 YEARS AFTER QUITTING, FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG GETS HONORARY HARVARD DEGREE |publisher=PPP Focus |date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.&lt;ref name="rww051009" /&gt;

Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate [[Dustin Moskovitz]]. They began with [[Columbia University]], [[New York University]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University|Brown]], and [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;

Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to [[Palo Alto, California]] in [[Silicon Valley]] where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met [[Peter Thiel]], who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zuckerberg To Leave Harvard Indefinitely |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/11/1/zuckerberg-to-leave-harvard-indefinitely-mark/ |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|access-date=March 26, 2013 |first=Sam |last=Teller |date=November 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Business, Casual. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/2/24/business-casual-a-year-ago-mark/ |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|access-date=March 26, 2013 |author=Kevin J.

For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s is just not an attractive idea to me."&lt;ref name=Exeter /&gt;

He restated these goals to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in 2010: "The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open."&lt;ref name="wired-zuckerberg" /&gt; Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former [[Netscape]] CFO [[Peter Currie (businessman)|Peter Currie]] about financing strategies for Facebook.&lt;ref name=twsOctBPP&gt;{{cite news |title=Yu, Zuckerberg and the Facebook fallout |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/04/01/yu-zuckerberg-and-the-facebook-fallout/|access-date=March 26, 2013 |agency=Reuters |date=April 1, 2009 |first=Robert |last=MacMillan |quote=In a back-to-the-future move, former Netscape CFO Peter Currie will be the key adviser to Facebook about financial matters, until a new search for a CFO is found, sources said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=500 Million Stories |first=Mark |last=Zuckerberg |url=https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=409753352130 |publisher=The Facebook Blog |date=July 22, 2010|access-date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I guess we could&amp;nbsp;... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average [[Search engine marketing|search]] query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads&amp;nbsp;... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.&lt;ref name="wired-zuckerberg" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, [[Steven Levy]], who wrote the 1984 book ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]'', wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself as a [[Hacker culture|hacker]]". Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make them better".&lt;ref name="wired041910"&gt;{{cite news|access-date=September 23, 2010 |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/04/ff_hackers/all/1 |title=Geek Power: Steven Levy Revisits Tech Titans, Hackers, Idealists |work=Wired |date=April 19, 2010 |author=Levy, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fast092410"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=September 24, 2010 |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/mic/2010/profile/facebook |title=The World's Most Innovative Companies 2010 |work=Fast Company |date=February 17, 2010 |author=McGirt, Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook instituted "[[hackathon]]s" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.&lt;ref name="wired041910" /&gt; The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.&lt;ref name="fast092410" /&gt; "The idea is that you can build something really good in a night", Zuckerberg told Levy. "And that's part of the personality of Facebook now&amp;nbsp;... It's definitely very core to my personality."&lt;ref name="wired041910" /&gt;

In a 2011 interview with [[PBS]] shortly after the death of [[Steve Jobs]], Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was "focused on building as high quality and good things as you are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-07/facebook-s-zuckerberg-says-steve-jobs-advised-on-company-focus-management.html |title=Facebook's Zuckerberg says Steve Jobs advised on company focus, management |work=Bloomberg |date=November 7, 2011 |access-date=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medvedev and Zuckerberg October 2012-1.jpeg|thumb|Zuckerberg and Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] during their meeting at the Russian leader's residence outside [[Moscow]], October 1, 2012]]
On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited [[Russia]]n Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zuckerberg in Moscow to boost Facebook's presence |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20121001-zuckerberg-moscow-boost-facebooks-presence-0 |publisher=France 24 |date=October 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003232618/http://www.france24.com/en/20121001-zuckerberg-moscow-boost-facebooks-presence-0 |archivedate=October 3, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow.

On August 19, 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook page was hacked by an unemployed web developer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/19/mark-zuckerbergs-facebook-page-was-hacked-by-an-unemployed-web-developer/|access-date=August 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 19, 2013 |author=Caitlin Dewey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 [[TechCrunch#TechCrunch Disrupt|TechCrunch Disrupt]] conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web |title=6 Things We Learned From Marissa Mayer and Mark Zuckerberg at TechCrunch Disrupt 2013 |url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2296067/6-Things-We-Learned-From-Marissa-Mayer-and-Mark-Zuckerberg-at-TechCrunch-Disrupt-2013 |work=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL Inc|access-date=September 23, 2013 |first=Victoria |last=Edwards |date=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sew"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Zuckerberg Creates Tech Justice League to Bring Internet to the Masses |url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2290350/Mark-Zuckerberg-Creates-Tech-Justice-League-to-Bring-Internet-to-the-Masses |work=Search Engine Watch |publisher=Incisive Media  Incisive Interactive Marketing LLC|access-date=September 23, 2013 |first=Alastair |last=Stevenson |date=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in [[Barcelona]], Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company.&lt;ref&gt;

Alongside other American technology figures like [[Jeff Bezos]] and [[Tim Cook]], Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician [[Lu Wei (politician)|Lu Wei]], known as the "Internet czar" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&amp;A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Alex Hern, Jonathan Kaiman |title=Mark Zuckerberg addresses Chinese university in Mandarin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-chinese-university-fluent-mandarin-video|access-date=December 14, 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&amp;A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could "learn how to better serve the community".&lt;ref name="Tad"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Maria Tadeo |title=Mark Zuckerberg Q&amp;A: What we learnt about the Facebook founder |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mark-zuckerberg-qa-what-we-learnt-about-the-facebook-founder-9921582.html|access-date=December 14, 2014 |work=The Independent |date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sam Colt |title=Facebook May Be Adding a 'Dislike' Button |url=http://www.inc.com/business-insider/Facebook-may-be-adding-a-dislike-button.html?cid=em01011week50day12d |website=''Inc.'' |publisher=Monsueto Ventures|access-date=December 14, 2014 |date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wirehog===
{{Main|Wirehog}}
A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, [[i2hub]], another campus-only service, created by [[Wayne Chang]], was launched. i2hub focused on [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Adam D'Angelo]], and [[Sean Parker]] launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called [[Wirehog]], a precursor to [[Facebook Platform]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Martey Dodoo |url=http://www.marteydodoo.com/2004/08/16/wirehog/ |date=August 16, 2004 |title=Wirehog? |author=Martey Dodoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Harvard Crimson |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/8/13/zuckerberg-programs-new-website-having-seemingly/ |date=August 13, 2004 |title=Zuckerberg Programs New Website |author=Alan J.

===Platform, Beacon, and Connect===

On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced [[Facebook Platform]], a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gits4u.com/infotech/info15.htm |title=80000 developers |access-date=April 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324022748/http://www.gits4u.com/infotech/info15.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, [[eBay]] sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=7584397130 |title=The Facebook Blog &amp;#124; Facebook |publisher=Blog.facebook.com |access-date=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.

In 2007, Zuckerberg was added to [[MIT Technology Review]]'s [[TR35]] list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/TR35/Profile.aspx?TRID=635 |title=2007 Young Innovators Under 35: Mark Zuckerberg, 23 |publisher=[[MIT Technology Review]] |year=2007 | access-date=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2008, Zuckerberg announced [[Facebook Platform#Facebook Connect|Facebook Connect]], a version of Facebook Platform for users.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Internet.org===
In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the [[Free Basics|Internet.org]] project in late August 2013. He explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the five billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to Zuckerberg. He stated in his post:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.&lt;ref name="Sew" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To stay proven on the efforts of bringing in the concept of [[net neutrality]], Zuckerberg met [[Narendra Modi]], [[Satya Nadella]] and [[Sundar Pichai]] at Silicon Valley, to discuss on how to effectively establish affordable [[internet]] access to the less developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/at-facebook-we-also-believe-in-net-neutrality-very-strongly-mark-zuckerberg/ |title=Meet at the Silicon Valley among the tech leaders and Indian Prime Minister-Narendra Modi|access-date= October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a token of initiation, he changed his Facebook profile picture to extend his support to the [[Digital India]] to help the rural communities to stay connected to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102393263811931&amp;set=a.743613136151.2308566.4&amp;type=3&amp;permPage=1 |title=Mark Zuckerberg supports Digital India|access-date= October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal controversies===

====ConnectU lawsuits====
{{Main|ConnectU}}
Harvard students [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]] accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called [[ConnectU]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicholas |last=Carlson |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |publisher=Silicon Alley Insider|access-date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|federal court]] in [[Boston]]. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by [[i2hub#The Winklevoss Chang Group|The Winklevoss Chang Group]], an alleged partnership between ConnectU and [[i2hub]]. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/feb/12/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-ex-classmates |title=Facebook paid up to $65m to founder Mark Zuckerberg's ex-classmates |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=February 12, 2009|access-date=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of ''[[02138]]'', a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Facebook filed to have the documents removed, but the judge ruled in favor of ''02138''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Caroline |url=http://www.news.com/8301-13577_3-9827222-36.html?tag=cd.blog |title=article about 02138 |publisher=News.com |date=November 30, 2007|access-date=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saverin lawsuit====
A lawsuit filed by [[Eduardo Saverin]] against Facebook and Zuckerberg was settled out of court. Though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/25/technology/founding_of_facebook.fortune/ |title=The book that Facebook doesn't want you to read |publisher=CNN |first=Jessi |last=Hempel |date=July 25, 2009 |access-date=May 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914024405/http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/25/technology/founding_of_facebook.fortune/ |archivedate=September 14, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan criminal investigation====
In June 2010, [[Pakistan]]i Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]] after a "[[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day|Draw Muhammad]]" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact [[Interpol]] to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for [[blasphemy law|blasphemy]]. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=West |first=Jackson |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local-beat/Facebook-CEO-Named-in-Pakiistan-Criminal-Investigation.html |title=Facebook CEO Named in Pakistan Criminal Investigation |publisher=NBC Bay Area|access-date=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/17/zuckerberg_faces_criminal_investigation_in_pakistan |title=Zuckerberg faces criminal investigation in Pakistan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paul Ceglia====
{{Main|Paul Ceglia}}
In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood [[pellet fuel]] company in [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County, upstate New York]], filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was ''Facemash'', the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name ''thefacebook.com'' until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellsvilledaily.com/article/20100729/NEWS/307299940 |title=Facebook does not have a like button for Ceglia |author=Anderson, John |publisher=WellsvilleDaily.com |date=July 29, 2010|access-date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/07/20/zuckerberg-ceglia |title=Venture beat coverage of Ceglia lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of "tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars."

===''The Social Network''===
{{Main|The Social Network}}
A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, ''[[The Social Network]]'' was released on October 1, 2010, starring [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=June 26, 2010 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20006653-56.html?tag=mncol;title |title=Zuckerberg in the hot seat at D8 |publisher=CNET |date=June 2, 2010 |author=Fried, Ina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a "good guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|access-date=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7127721.ece |title=Movie depicts seamy life of Facebook boss |work=The Times |date=May 16, 2010 |author=Harlow, John |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is based on the book ''[[The Accidental Billionaires]]'' by [[Ben Mezrich]], which the book's publicist once described as "big juicy fun" rather than "reportage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|access-date=September 22, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/business/media/21facebook.html|title=Facebook Feels Unfriendly Toward Film It Inspired |work=The New York Times |date=August 20, 2010 |author1=Cieply, Michael |author2=Helft, Miguel |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's screenwriter [[Aaron Sorkin]] told [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]], "I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling", adding, "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=September 22, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/68319 |title=Inventing Facebook |publisher=New York |date=September 17, 2010 |author=Harris, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon winning the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer [[Scott Rudin]] thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg "for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a [[metaphor]] through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techland.time.com/2011/01/17/the-social-network-filmmakers-thank-zuckerberg-during-golden-globes/ |title=The Social Network Filmmakers Thank Zuckerberg During Golden Globes |work=Techland |date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/01/aaron_sorkin.html |title=Last Night, Aaron Sorkin Demonstrated How to Apologize Without Accepting Responsibility |journal=New York |date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:I wanted to say to Mark Zuckerberg tonight, if you're watching, [[Rooney Mara]]'s character makes a prediction at the beginning of the movie. She was wrong. You turned out to be a great entrepreneur, a visionary, and an incredible altruist.

On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they ever met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=January 30, 2011 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20462104,00.html |title=Mark Zuckerberg Meets Jesse Eisenberg on Saturday Night Live |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=January 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131034819/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20462104,00.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, "It was interesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/jesse-eisenberg-meets-the-real-mark-zuckerberg-on-snl/ |title=Jesse Eisenberg meets the real Mark Zuckerberg on SNL |publisher=Digital Trends |date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was "nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him&amp;nbsp;..." He adds, "Mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable&amp;nbsp;... The fact that he would do ''SNL'' and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It's the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsugar.com/Pictures-Jesse-Eisenberg-83rd-Annual-Academy-Awards-Nominees-Luncheon-13752458 "Jesse Eisenberg Calls Mark Zuckerberg "Sweet" and "Generous" in His Funny Oscar Nominees Lunch Interview"] ''Popsugar'', February 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/01/31/133345641/mark-zuckerberg-meets-jesse-eisenberg-on-the-saturday-night-live-stage "Mark Zuckerberg Meets Jesse Eisenberg On The 'Saturday Night Live' Stage"] NPR, January 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disputed accuracy====
Jeff Jarvis, author of the book ''Public Parts'', interviewed Zuckerberg and believes Sorkin made up too much of the story. He states, "That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts."&lt;ref name=BBCmovie&gt;Rohrer, Finlo. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11437873 "Is the Facebook movie the truth about Mark Zuckerberg"] BBC, September 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine and author of ''The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World,'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1439102120 "The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World"], release date February 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "the film is only "40% true&amp;nbsp;... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie." He says that "a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false", and concludes that primarily "his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet".&lt;ref name=BBCmovie /&gt;

Although the film portrays Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite [[Officially unrecognized Harvard College social clubs|final clubs]] at Harvard, Zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs.&lt;ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /&gt; Kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is "false". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, notes that the "image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated&amp;nbsp;... It is fiction&amp;nbsp;..." He likewise dismisses the film's assertion that he "would deliberately betray a friend".&lt;ref name=BBCmovie /&gt;

===Other depictions===
Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[Loan-a Lisa]]", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson]] and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing [[Bill Gates]] and [[Richard Branson]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=September 22, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/07/facebook_creator_mark_zuckerbe.html |title=Facebook Creator Mark Zuckerberg to Get Yellow on The Simpsons |publisher=New York |date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When questioned about the mid-2013 [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government "blew it." He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt;

On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "[[Black Lives Matter]]" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but "malicious as well." According to Zuckerberg's memo, "''Black Lives Matter'' doesn't mean other lives don't -- it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve." The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, "means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's." Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.&lt;ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Shaun |title=Mark Zuckerberg forced to address racism among Facebook staff after vandals target Black Lives Matter phrases |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-mark-zuckerberg-forced-address-racism-facebook-article-1.2543985|access-date=February 26, 2016 |agency=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guynn"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jessica |first1=Guynn |title=Zuckerberg reprimands Facebook staff defacing 'Black Lives Matter' slogan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter-diversity/80933694/|access-date=February 26, 2016 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benjaminsnyder"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Snyder |first1=Benjamin |title=Mark Zuckerberg Takes Facebook Workers to Task Over 'All Lives Matter' Graffiti |url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter/|access-date=February 26, 2016 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, "Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure."&lt;ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg"/&gt;

'''Massimo Boninsegni''' is an Italian Canadian [[Theoretical condensed matter physics|theoretical condensed matter physicist]].  Born in [[Genoa|Genova]] (Italy) in 1963, he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in physics at the [[Universita degli Studi di Genova|Universita' degli Studi di Genova]] in 1986.

He moved to the United States in 1987, where he received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral degree in physics]] from [[Florida State University]]. His [https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:25035971 Ph.D. thesis] was on numerical studies of a [[T-J_model|strongly correlated electronic model]] of [[High-temperature_superconductivity|high-temperature superconductivity]].
He took on postdoctoral positions at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and [[University of Delaware]], before becoming in 1997 an assistant professor of physics at [[San Diego State University]]. He moved to the [[University of Alberta]] in 2002, where he has been a professor of physics since 2005. In 2008 he became a Canadian citizen.

== Background ==
In 2010, Joseph McStay (age 40) and his wife Summer (age 43) lived in Fallbrook, California, with their sons Gianni (age 4) and Joseph Jr. (age 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsey|first=Debbie|title=Authorities distribute 'endangered missing' flier pertaining to missing McStay family|url=http://www.thevillagenews.com/story/45499/|newspaper=Fallbrook Bonsall Village News|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph owned and operated Earth Inspired Products, a company that built decorative fountains, and Summer was a licensed real estate agent.&lt;ref name="Rojas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rojas |first=Rick |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-victorville-bodies-mcstay-families-20131114,0,5975246.story |title=Buried bodies identified as members of missing McStay family |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 15, 2013 |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disappearance ==
On February 4, 2010, at 7:47 pm, a neighbor's [[Surveillance camera|surveillance system]] captured the bottom 18 inches of a vehicle, thought at the time to be the McStay family's 1996 [[Isuzu Trooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Teri |last1=Figueroa |first2=John |last2=Wilkens |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/lifestyle/people/sdut-mcstay-missing-fallbrook-family-2013feb02-story.html |title=The McStays: A lingering mystery |newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=February 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the surveillance recording, the vehicle's occupants could not be seen.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; At 8:28 pm, a call was placed from Joseph McStay's cell phone to his business associate, Chase Merritt. The call went to voice mail. Merritt later told police that he ignored it because he was watching a movie. Joseph's cellphone pinged a tower in Fallbrook.&lt;ref name=Polygraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Linthicum|first=Kate|title=Man last phoned by McStay father says he took polygraph test|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/20/local/la-me-ln-mcstay-family-mystery-20131120|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several days, the McStays' family unsuccessfully tried to contact them. On February 13, Joseph's brother, Michael McStay traveled to the McStay residence and on finding an open window in back, climbed in and gained entry to the home. Michael McStay did not find any of the McStay family at home, and their two dogs were in the backyard. On February 15, he phoned the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department|San Diego Sheriff's Department]] and reported his brother and family missing.  Officers arrived to the home and requested a search warrant, executed on February 19, 2010.  Although a search of the home found no evidence of struggle or [[Murder|foul play]], there were indications of a hasty departure: a carton of raw eggs had been left on the counter and two child-size bowls of popcorn sat on a sofa.&lt;ref name = "nbcsandiego1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falcon|first=Gabriel|title=Three years later, no sign of missing|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/26/justice/mcstay-family-disappearance/|publisher=CNN|date=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their investigation, the police learned that at 11&amp;nbsp;pm on February 8, the family's Trooper had been towed from a [[strip mall]] parking lot in [[San Ysidro, San Diego]], near the Mexican border. It was believed to have been parked there between 5:30 and 7:00 that evening.

Patrick McStay, Joseph's father, was informed of the discovery and phoned missing person advocate Jerrie Dean of Missing Persons of America to tell her what he knew.&lt;ref name="Mcstay Memorial erected in Victorville"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2013/11/20/mcstay-memorial-erected-in-victorville/|title=McStay memorial erected in Victorville|work=FOX News Local|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerrie Dean stated in her blog she had just finished producing a radio show for [[KNSJ]] when she received the phone call, and that she asked whether she could tell her followers what he had told her. Two days later, two sets of remains were officially identified as those of Joseph and Summer McStay.&lt;ref name="nbcsandiego1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rojas"/&gt; The deaths were ruled a homicide and San Bernardino County authorities said they believed the family died of blunt force trauma inside their home, but declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/08/us/mcstay-suspect-chase-merritt/ |title='I have absolutely no clue' on McStay family's slaying, Merritt said in interview |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days after the discovery of the bodies, Joseph McStay's father said the San Diego Sheriff's Department investigation was faulty. He filed formal complaints in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mcstay-family-disappearance-probe-botched-angry-relative-article-1.1519082 |title=Father of Joseph McStay calls the San Diego Sheriff's department investigation of missing family 'botched' and 'inept' |work=Daily News|location=New York |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Reaction to the disappearance}}Reaction and investigation==
The circumstances surrounding the family's disappearance and the lack of clues about their whereabouts triggered speculation by amateur sleuths. [[Radio host]] Rick Baker published a book, ''No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family''.&lt;ref name="Baker book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Rick|title=No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family|date=February 4, 2013|publisher=Tate Publishing|isbn=1625104219|url=https://www.amazon.com/No-Goodbyes-Mysterious-Disappearance-McStay/dp/1625104219/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392682861&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=McStay+family}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker began following the case in 2013, after interviewing Joseph's brother, Michael, on his program. He conducted dozens of interviews on the case (traveling to [[Belize]], [[Mexico]], [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), followed leads and reported sightings of the family. In the book he speculated that Summer McStay might have committed the murders. When the bodies were found, he offered a refund to those who purchased his book before November 2013.&lt;ref name="San Diego"&gt;{{cite news|title=Author of McStay book criticized by victim's family|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2013/11/18/author-of-mcstay-book-criticized-by-victims-family/|agency=Fox 5 San Diego |date=November 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their disappearance, it was speculated that the McStays left voluntarily, since investigators found searches on the family's computers for "What documents do children need for traveling to Mexico?" and Spanish language lessons.&lt;ref name="disappearance deepens"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rojas|first=Rick|title=After discovery, mystery of McStay family's disappearance deepens|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-victorville-bodies-20131116,0,4073608.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because their car was found so close to the Mexican border, police reviewed surveillance footage of the pedestrian gate into Mexico. Video recorded the evening of February&amp;nbsp;8, released on March&amp;nbsp;5, showed a family of four resembling the McStays crossing the border into Mexico. On February 19, 2010, California police notified [[Interpol]] to be on the lookout for the family.&lt;ref name = "nbcsandiego1" /&gt; In April 2013, the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department|San Diego Sheriff's Department]] announced that it believed that the McStays traveled to Mexico voluntarily.&lt;ref name=voluntarily&gt;{{cite news|last=Spagat |first=Elliot |title=Investigators say Missing McStay family left voluntarily |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/investigators-say-missing_n_3047938.html |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=April 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209201542/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/investigators-say-missing_n_3047938.html |archivedate=December 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed sightings of the family were reported in Mexico and elsewhere, perpetuating hopes that they were safe and had left voluntarily.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Relatives of the McStays doubted that they would travel to Mexico, saying that Joseph and Summer avoided the country because of the safety threat posed by recent [[Mexican Drug War|drug wars]].&lt;ref name="disappearance deepens" /&gt; Other critics of the theory noted that the McStays had more than $100,000 in bank accounts, with no withdrawal of funds in preparation for a trip, and their accounts were untouched after their disappearance. Summer's sister said Summer's [[passport]] was expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Edecio|title=McStay Family Update: FBI Joins Search for Missing Family|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcstay-family-update-fbi-joins-search-for-missing-family/|publisher=CBS News|date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is possible for a U.S. citizen to enter Mexico without a passport, one is required to reenter the United States.

Summer had been known by a number of names. Born "Virginia Lisa Aranda", she had also been known as "Summer Martelli", "Summer Aranda-Martelli", "Lisa Aranda", "Lisa Martelli" and "Lisa Aranda-Martelli". In an early video interview, her mother confirmed that Martelli was the surname of Summer's stepfather, but it was later alleged to have been invented by Summer.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In a February 25, 2010 ''Valley News'' article, Sheriff's Lieutenant Dennis Brugos confirmed that Summer McStay had used various names including her stepfather's last name of Martelli, although she was never adopted by him.&lt;ref name="valley news"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramsey|first1=Debbie|title=Authorities distribute 'endangered missing' flier pertaining to missing McStay family|url=http://www.myvalleynews.com/story/45499/|newspaper=The Valley News|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took ten years off her age, although there was no confirmation that she used the alternative birthdate on any legal document. Family members insisted that the name change was only a facet of Summer's mental illness.&lt;ref name="mother interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsey|first=Debbie|title=Mothers of McStays determined to find family|url=http://www.myvalleynews.com/story/46479/|newspaper=The Valley News|date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs8"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search for Missing Fallbrook family continues|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/12025015/search-for-missing-fallbrook-family-continues|publisher=CBS 8 San Diego|date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators and the public also focused on McStay's business partner, Chase Merritt, who was the last known person to have had contact with Joseph McStay, and was the first to notice his disappearance. According to state records, Merritt had [[felony]] convictions for [[burglary]] and [[receiving stolen property]]. His most recent felony conviction, in 2001, was for the theft of $32,000 worth of welding and drilling equipment from San Gabriel Valley Ornamental Iron Works in [[Monrovia, California]]. An acquaintance of Merritt's told a San Diego reporter, "I think police should look at him and anyone associated with him."&lt;ref name="cbs8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gotfredson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gotfredson|first=David|title=McStay family Mystery: Who is Chase Merritt|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/24245580/mcstay-murder-mystery-who-is-chase-merritt|publisher=CBS 8 San Diego|date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Merritt acknowledged he had spent more than an hour with Joseph McStay the day the McStay family went missing.&lt;ref name="sbsun.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20170721/tentative-trial-date-set-for-mcstay-family-murder-suspect-chase-merritt|title=Tentative trial date set for McStay family murder suspect 'Chase' Merritt|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merritt, who reportedly was the last person McStay called from his cell phone, also said that he had passed a polygraph exam and did not know anything that could help solve the mystery of the family's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-mcstay-family-mystery-20131120-story.html |title=Man last phoned by McStay father says he took polygraph test |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if he thought Merritt was a suspect, Joseph McStay's father Patrick said, "I have to have faith in Chase because I have to have faith in my son. I believe that he (Joseph McStay) trusted Chase and believed in Chase. Do I think Chase is involved? I don't think so, and I truly hope not."&lt;ref name="Gotfredson"/&gt;

In January, 2014, Merritt said that he might write a book about the family, alleging that Summer had anger issues and that Joseph had been ill for some time with a mysterious ailment. Joseph McStay's family confirmed that Joseph had an unexplained illness and that Summer was possessive of her husband, but they called Merritt's suggestion that she was responsible for his illness unfounded. Joseph's father Patrick said, "I truly believe she loved my son."&lt;ref name="richard allyn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allyn|first=Richard|title=Backlash over book's new theory on McStay murders|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/24380050/backlash-over-books-new-theory-on-mcstay-murders|publisher=CBS 8 San Diego|date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, local news reported that the McStay family had called Summer's ex-boyfriend, Vick W. Johansen, a person of interest in the case; the family believes email records demonstrate that Johansen was obsessed with Summer for years after their relationship ended. The McStays noted his criminal history (violent threats, felony vandalism, disturbing the peace, interfering with a business and resisting a [[peace officer]]) and a pattern of movement around the time of the disappearance that they considered suspicious. The San Diego Police Department had no comment on Johansen, defending its work in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/24256729/mcstay-murder-mystery-who-is-vick-johansen |title=McStay murder mystery: Who is Vick Johansen? |publisher=CBS 8 San Diego |date=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Arrest}}Arrest ==
On November 5, 2014, detectives from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department arrested Chase Merritt in connection with the deaths of the McStay family after discovering that his [[DNA profiling|DNA]] had been recovered from the McStays' car. His arrest was announced on November 7, 2014.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt; Merritt is awaiting trial on four counts of murder, and the district attorney is seeking the [[death penalty]]. In July 2015, Merritt's defense attorney filed a request to have the case dismissed because of the wording used by the prosecution when the charges were filed.&lt;ref name=SDU&gt;{{cite news|last1=Figueroa|first1=Teri|title=Merritt attorneys want McStay case dismissed|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jul/17/merritt-mcstay-demurrer-request-to-dismiss/|accessdate=August 23, 2015|work=[[U-T San Diego]]|date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to arrest warrant affidavits filed in the case, autopsies concluded that all four victims had been beaten to death with a blunt object, and investigators believe the murder weapon was a 3-pound [[sledgehammer]], which was found in the grave containing the remains of Summer McStay and one of her sons. Investigators testified they believed the victims were tortured before they were killed.&lt;ref name="Merritt fires attorneys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20160121/mcstay-family-murder-suspect-charles-chase-merritt-fires-attorneys|title=McStay family murder suspect Charles 'Chase' Merritt fires attorneys |work=The Sun|location=San Bernardino |accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors allege that Merritt had a gambling problem, and killed the family for financial gain. They said that he wrote checks totalling more than $21,000 on Joseph McStay's business account in the days after they were killed, and then went on a gambling spree at nearby casinos, where he lost thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="Merritt fires attorneys"/&gt;

Trial has been delayed as Merritt has repeatedly fired his attorney or attempted to represent himself. {{As of |2016|02}}, he had gone through five attorneys.&lt;ref name="Merritt wants new attorneys"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20160211/mcstay-family-murder-suspect-charles-chase-merritt-wants-new-attorneys|title=McStay family murder suspect Charles 'Chase' Merritt wants new attorneys |newspaper=San Bernardino Sun |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meketaten-FragmentaryStatue-BrooklynMuseum.png|thumb|right|Fragmentary [[quartzite]] statue of the Amarna princess Meketaten, from the reign of Akhenaten, circa 1352-1336 B.C. On display at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. The broken hand over the figure's right breast was common to images depicting young girls, and likely once held a flower or rattle.]]

'''Meketaten''' ("Behold the Aten" or "Protected by Aten") was the second daughter of six born to the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]] and his [[Great Royal Wife]] [[Nefertiti]]. She was probably born in year 4 of Akhenaten's reign. Although little is known about her, she is frequently depicted with her sisters accompanying her royal parents in the first two thirds of Akhenaten's  reign.

==Family==
Meketaten was the second daughter born to [[Akhenaten]] and [[Nefertiti]]. She  had an older sister named [[Meritaten]] and four younger sisters named [[Ankhesenpaaten]], [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]], [[Neferneferure]] and [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]]. Tutankhaten was a half-brother.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2004. {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Meketaten’s approximate year of birth is in or before year 4 of Akhenaten.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen. Penguin. 1998. {{ISBN|0-670-86998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meketaten is first depicted on the walls of the ''Hut-benben'' temple dedicated to her mother Nefertiti in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Meketaten appears behind her older sister [[Meritaten]] in some of the later inscriptions, thought to date to year 4 or later.&lt;ref name="Redford"&gt;Redford, Donald B. Akhenaten: The Heretic King. Princeton University Press. 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-691-00217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further arguments to suggest Meketaten was born in or before year 4 come from the fact that her figure was added to one of the boundary stela recording events in year 4  and carved in year 5.&lt;ref name="Dodson"&gt;Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter-Reformation. The American University in Cairo Press. 2009, {{ISBN|978-977-416-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Meketaten moved to the new capital city Akhetaten with her family when she was still a small child. She is depicted in several of the tombs of the nobles in Amarna. Meketaten is depicted in the tomb of [[Ay]] holding a tray of gifts while wrapping one arm around her mother’s neck.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt; Other monuments mentioning Meketaten include a stela from Heliopolis, a statue base from the Fayoum, and the tombs of Panehesy and Parennefer.&lt;ref name="Murnane"/&gt; Meketaten was depicted with her parents and sisters at the reception of foreign tributes – a ceremony dating to year 12 - that can be seen on several scenes in the private tombs in Amarna of high-ranking officials named Huya and High Priest Meryre II.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redford"/&gt;

==Death and burial==
Meketaten died in approximately year 14 of [[Akhenaten]].&lt;ref name="Redford"/&gt; It is very likely that a plague swept across Egypt between Akhenaten's 12th and 15th regnal years, for many members of the royal family cease to be mentioned again; among them Queen Mother [[Tiye]], Queen [[Nefertiti]], Akhenaten's secondary wife [[Kiya]], Meketaten and the two youngest princesses, [[Neferneferure]] and [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]].&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt; Meketaten's death could have resulted either from a plague, or from childbirth. The presence of a royal baby causes many to believe the young princess died in childbirth (in which case the father of the child would most likely be Akhenaten himself), but this cannot be proven.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt; An alternative interpretation suggested by van Dijk is that the child depicted in the scenes is the soul (the ka) of Meketaten.&lt;ref name="Dodson"/&gt;5

[[File:Dibujo de tumba.jpg|575px|center|thumb|Meketaten under the canopy, on the wall paintings of the Chamber &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. In front of her: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit.]]

Three chambers, denoted as Chambers &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \ \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Royal Tomb of Akhenaten|Royal Tomb]] are believed to be used for the burials. Chambers &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;  depict very similar scenes: Akhenaten and Nefertiti bend over the inert body of a woman, weeping and gripping each other's arms for support. Nearby a nurse stands with a baby in her arms, accompanied by a fan-bearer, which indicates the baby's royal status. 
The names in the scene in chamber &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;  have been hacked out. In the chamber &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; however the hieroglyphs identify the dead young woman as Meketaten. In the same chamber another scene shows Meketaten standing under a canopy which is usually associated with childbirth but can also interpreted as representing the rebirth of the princess. In front of her, amongst courtiers, stand Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their three remaining daughters, Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]].&lt;ref name="Dodson"/&gt;

It is possible that chamber &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; was the burial place of someone other than Meketaten. There may even have been two burials which may have been those of [[Neferneferure]] and [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]], but this is not certain.&lt;ref name="Dodson"/&gt;  Another theory is that one of the scenes depicts [[Kiya]] and that the baby is [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt; However, Jacobus Van Dijk, in a 2009 book in memory of the late William Murnane has demonstrated that this person was actually a symbolic depiction of the death and rebirth of Meketaten now with the god [[Aten]] in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;J. Van Dijk, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322083908/http://cassian.memphis.edu/history/murnane/Van_Dijk.pdf The Death of Meketaten], in ''Causing His Name to Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J. Murnane'', ed.P. Brand and L. Cooper, Culture and history of the Ancient Near East 37. Leiden: Brill, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; John Harris also agrees with Van Dijk's conclusions according to the author. 

Fragments of Meketaten’s sarcophagus were found in the royal tomb. Inscriptions mention her parents [[Akhenaten]] and [[Nefertiti]], her sister [[Ankhesenpaaten]] as well as her grandparents [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Queen Tiye]].&lt;ref name="Murnane"&gt;Murnane, William J., Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt, Society of Biblical Literature, 1995 {{ISBN|1-55540-966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neuroenhancement''' refers to the targeted enhancement and extension of cognitive and affective abilities based on an understanding of their underlying [[neurobiology]] in [[health]]y persons who do not have any mental illness.&lt;ref name=Modafini/&gt;&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name=C /&gt;&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; As such, it can be thought of as an umbrella term that encompasses pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods of improving cognitive, affective, and motor functionality, as well as the overarching ethico-legal discourse that accompanies these aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/modafinil-the-smart-drug-leading-the-charge-towards-a-future-of-neuroenhancement-46477|title = Modafinil - the 'smart drug' leading the charge towards a future of neuroenhancement|date = |access-date = |website = The Conversation|publisher = |last = Battleday|first = Ruairidh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, for any agent to qualify as a neuroenhancer, it must reliably engender substantial cognitive, affective, or motor benefits beyond normal functioning in healthy individuals, whilst causing few side effects: at most at the level of commonly used comparable legal substances or activities, such as caffeine, alcohol, and sleep-deprivation.

Pharmalogical neuroenhancement agents include the well-validated [[nootropic]]s, such as [[racetam]], [[vinpocetine]], and [[phosphatidylserine]],&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; as well as other drugs used for treating patients suffering from [[neurological disorder]]s. Non-pharmacological measures include [[Transcranial direct-current stimulation|non-invasive brain stimulation]], which has been employed to improve various cognitive and affective functions, and [[Brain–computer interface|brain-machine interfaces]], which hold much potential to extend the repertoire of motor and cognitive actions available to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brain–machine interface|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/110/46/18343|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2013-11-12|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 3831969|pmid = 24222678|pages = 18343–18343|volume = 110|issue = 46|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1319310110|first = Prashant|last = Nair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although consideration of individual neuroenhancement agents is usually triggered by success in clinical and technological fields, they have also been used to attempt to help people with lack of normal cognitive, motor, and affective abilities: for example, social skills and empathy. In this case, neuroenhancement drugs try to increase [[oxytocin]] and decrease [[cortisol]] levels helping people better their communication and social interaction skills.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

==Pharmacological==

===Modafinil===
{{main|Modafinil}}
[[File:Modafinil3Dan.gif|thumb|3D structure of modafinil]]
[[Modafinil]] is a wakefulness-promoting drug that decreases fatigue, increases vigilance, reduces daytime sleepiness, and improves mood.&lt;ref name=C /&gt;&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; Modafinil is currently licensed for treating patients with disorders such as [[narcolepsy]], [[sleep apnea]], and [[shift work sleep disorder]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=D /&gt; This drug also seems promising in the treatment of depression and [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=D /&gt; Modafinil is currently being used by United States Air Force personnel for missions of great duration in an attempt to decrease fatigue amongst aircrew. It has become more popular amongst the general public. In an online poll conducted by ''Nature'' magazine, 8.8% of 1400 corresponding readers admitted use of modafinil for non-medical reasons. Their reasoning behind its use was for increasing concentration and focus on a specific task or to counteract sleep deficit and jetlag.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; A comparison between the sales of modafinil to the number of patients revealed a disproportionate ratio, indicating high abuse.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

Modafinil has been reported to improve executive function in healthy non-sleep-deprived individuals, as well as potentially improving attention and learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modafinil for cognitive neuroenhancement in healthy non-sleep-deprived subjects: A systematic review|url = http://www.europeanneuropsychopharmacology.com/article/S0924-977X(15)00249-7/fulltext|journal = European Neuropsychopharmacology|pages = 1865–1881|volume = 25|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.07.028|first = R.M.|last = Battleday|first2 = A.-K.|last2 = Brem|pmid=26381811|date=Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effects on sleep deprived individuals are even more striking: a single dose resulted in enhanced wakefulness, executive functions, and memory.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; In the case of sustained [[sleep deprivation]], repeated intake of modafinil helped individuals maintain higher levels of wakefulness than the [[placebo]], but did not help attention and [[executive function]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; Since the majority of these trials were conducted on military personnel, further research needs to be conducted on the effects of modafinil on the general population. Modafinil may impair one's self-monitoring ability. A common trend found in research studies indicated that participants rated their performances on cognitive tests higher than it actually was, suggesting "overconfidence" effect.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

Modafinil is becoming increasingly popular among the general population. Apart from a consumer's want to increase his [[neurological]] performance, there are financial incentives for manufacturers as well. Modafinil has a market share of more than $700 million a year, indicating a high degree of off-label use.&lt;ref name=C /&gt; Modafinil is also one of the more easily available neuroenhancement drugs in the market today. Modafinil can be bought
from many websites – mostly from Asian countries – as well as from [[darknet market]]s.&lt;ref name=C /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woolf|first1=Nicky|title=Silk Road sentencing: why governments can't win the war on darknet drugs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/31/silk-road-sentencing-darknet-drugs|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 December 2016|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valette|first1=Jean-Jacques|title=Du commerce illicite à la liberté d'expression totale, on a plongé dans le darknet|url=http://www.wedemain.fr/Du-commerce-illicite-a-la-liberte-d-expression-totale-on-a-plonge-dans-le-darknet_a2140.html|publisher=We Demain|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modafinil first came into attention when world champion runner [[Kelli White]] was tested positive for illegally consuming modafinil in the Athletics World Championship in 2003, resulting in the loss of her two gold medals.&lt;ref name=C /&gt;

===Methylphenidate===
[[File:Methylphenidate3Dan.gif|thumb|left|3D structure of methylphenidate]]
[[Methylphenidate]] (MPH) is a [[stimulant]] that is used to treat [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). MPH is known to be highly abused by the general population, especially college students.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name= C /&gt; In an online poll conducted by ''Nature'' magazine, 12.4% of 1400 corresponding readers admitted use of MPH for non-medical reasons. Their reasoning behind its use was for increasing concentration, [[sleep deficit]], and [[jetlag]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

A comparison between the sales of MPH to the number of patients revealed a disproportionate ratio, indicating high abuse.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; MPH is believed to have a positive effect for [[memory consolidation]], but studies have not been able to conclusively verify this claim.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; Popular opinion that MPH enhances attention could not be verified.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; Studies of MPH have reported improved problem solving skills. However, when these studies were repeated to replicate the results, the placebo group scored higher, indicating that MPH may even impair performance.&lt;ref name= C /&gt;

These inconclusive, and generally negative, results for [[memory enhancement]] are insufficient to explain the use of MPH for non-medical reasons. Users may have motives other than genuine neuroenhancement that propels its unprescribed use, such as subjective and recreational effects.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; The lack of any result, positive or negative, indicated that the 10–20&amp;nbsp;mg dosage may be too low for the drug.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Further studies need to be conducted, looking at different doses of MPH.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="I" /&gt;

===Memantine===
[[File:Memantine.png|thumb|Memantine structure]]
[[Memantine]] is a [[NMDA]] receptor antagonist and is used to treat patients with moderate to severe [[Alzheimer's disease]], but is also used as a neuroenhancement drug.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; 
Studies conducted on memantine were unable to conclusively verify neuroenhancement capability of the drug. Since most of these studies were single dose tests of memantine, it is possible that these drugs would only show some effect, positive or negative, after continuous intake. Until then, single dose studies of memantine are not enough to reveal the drug's actual potential.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

===Donepezil===
[[File:Aricept 10mg 000195lg.jpg|thumb|left|10mg donepezil pill]]
[[Donepezil]] is an [[acetylcholinesterase]] inhibitor (AChEI) that is used to treat patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. While many AChEIs could be potential neuroenhancement substances, donepezil is the most commonly used AChEIs by the general population due to its widespread use for treating Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

Most studies on donepezil are unable to conclusively verify the neuroenhancement capability of the drug.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; In such studies, it was seen participants that took donepezil scored higher than those that took the placebo. Donepezil helps individuals retain training tasks, verbal memory, and episodic memory.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; In sleep deprivation studies, while donepezil had no effect on well-rested patients, it had a positive effect on patients with 24 hours of sleep deprivation. Such patients benefited from increased memory performance and attention that would otherwise be deficit in such sleep-deprived conditions.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; However, this effect was only seen in individuals whose performance declined significantly due to sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

==Non-pharmacological==

===Transcranial direct current stimulation===
While neuroenhancement drugs are a potential method for cognitive performance enhancement, [[Transcranial direct current stimulation]] (tDCS) over the motor cortex (MC) is being seen as another potential method.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; Although it was originally intended to help patients with brain injuries such as stroke, there has been a lot of interest in the last few years on tDCS's capabilities for healthy individuals as well. Recent studies have already shown improved [[neuroplasticity]] from tDCS to facilitate motor learning in young humans, and it may be possible to apply this method to the older segment of the workforce as well.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

Stimulating higher cognitive functions of the brain, such as the language function, with tDCS in one study resulted in improved word retrieval. tDCS works by enhancing the connectivity in a given stimulated network, providing neural efficiency in highly specific brain areas critical for task performance.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;  During this time, [[fMRI]] images also showed reduced activity in the semantic retrieval processes, suggesting more efficient processing in task-critical areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt; Reduced activity in circumscribed task-related areas has been attributed to consolidation of motor learning and superior memory performance. New research in tDCS is trying to localize the stimulation to affect the desired subset of highly specific task-relevant neurons.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;

===Deep brain stimulation===
[[Image:Parkinson surgery.jpg|thumb|Illustration showing an electrode placed deep seated in the brain]]
[[Deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) is another form of neuroenhancement. Unlike tDCS, though, DBS involves the implantation of a medical device, and is restricted for use for only a few, severe diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[dystonia]].&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; In one study, DBS improved movement by 39%, reduced disability by 38%, and improved quality of life by 30% for patients suffering from dystonia over a course of 3 months.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; The patients had a reduction in dystonia symptoms by 50%.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; Improvement was noticeable within hours to days after DBS application. The benefits of DBS as of now are far more than those of high-dosage [[trihexyphenidyl]], a powerful drug used in the treatment for dystonia.

==Side effects==
Neuroenhancements drugs are well tolerated by healthy humans.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; These drugs are already in mainstream use to treat patients with different kinds of psychiatric disorders. Since most of the information on neuroenhancements and its capabilities are drawn from research experiments, the best way to determine adverse effects are drop-out rates and subjective rating.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; The drop-out rates were minimal or non-existent for donepezil, memantine, MPH, and modafinil.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;
In the drug trials, participants reported the following adverse reactions to the consumption of donepezil, memantine, MPH, or modafinil: [[gastrointestinal complaint]]s (nausea), [[headache]], [[dizziness]], [[nightmares]], [[anxiety]], [[drowsiness]], nervousness, restlessness, sleep disturbances, and [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; The side effects normally ceased in the course of treatment.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;
While there were no reported side effects from DBS, 18% of the patients suffered from device related complications such as infections due to lead dislodgment or breakage.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt;

==Ethical, social and legal issues==
Neuroenhancement is often seen analogous to the issue of [[doping in sport]]s.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; A common concern raised is an unfair advantage of people who consume enhancing drugs over people who don't. Many athletes, however, feel that the only way for them to win against athletes that take [[Performance-enhancing drugs|performance-enhancing drugs (PED)]] is for them to take PEDs as well; a similar thought process has developed within the general population in regard to people that consume neuroenhancement drugs.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; In a research study of 18- to 34-year-olds, 50% of them had little or no objection to the concept of doping.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; Students, in particular, often feel that cognitive neuroenhancers are acceptable.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; However, parents and healthcare providers are concerned about the safety and well-being of those that consume neuroenhancement.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; Generally, the moral acceptability (including fairness perceptions) of such substances for the purpose of neuroenhancement are an important factor in the decision to use or not use such drugs. Studies found that moral objections against such substances strongly decrease the willingness to use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Sattler, S., Sauer, C., Mehlkop, G., Graeff, P.|year=2013|title=The Rationale for Consuming Cognitive Enhancement Drugs in University Students and Teachers|journal=PLoS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068821|pmid=23874778|pmc=3714277|volume=8|pages=e68821}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sattler&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Sattler, S., Forlini, C., Racine, E., Sauer, C.|year=2013|title=Impact of Contextual Factors and Substance Characteristics on Perspectives toward Cognitive Enhancement|journal=PLoS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071452|pmid=23940757|pmc=3733969|volume=8|pages=e71452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Wiegel C., Sattler S., Göritz A.

Neuro-enhancement drugs play a key role in some recent novels and movies, such as ''Limitless'' (2011), probing and exploring the opportunities and threats of using neuro-enhancers in an imaginative way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zwart H.|year=2014|title=''Limitless'' as a neuro-pharmaceutical experiment and as a ''Daseinsanalyse'': on the use of fiction in preparatory debates on cognitive enhancement|journal= Medicine, Health Care &amp; Philosophy: a European Journal|volume=17|issue=1|pages=29–38|doi=10.1007/s11019-013-9481-5|pmid=23585022|url=http://www.filosofie.science.ru.nl/PDF%20library%20HZ/Limitless.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent article published by Jayne Lucke, the concept of neuroenhancement is compared to [[sildenafil]]. The author states that "recreational users of [sildenafil] had lower confidence in their ability to achieve an [[erection]] than non-users, even though they had significantly better erectile function. They become psychologically dependent on these drugs." The author believes a similar trend can be seen neuroenhancement users.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; The author goes on to argue about how expectation, especially in students that are the general force, differs vastly on what is considered normal or good performance. Many argue that the only option for regulation of neuroenhancements is to allow it to everyone, thus minimizing cheating. Banning the drugs, on the other hand, may have detrimental consequences to society. Not only would it create a black market, amplifying issues caused by illicit use, it would also increase the cost to society from enforcing the law.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; Neuroenhancement drugs need to be assessed further for their merits and adverse effects, making it easier for policy makers to make a call on the regulation of such drugs.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt;

==Scope for cognitive enhancement==
[[File:Workforce demographics chart.png|thumb|A significant increase in the older segment of the workforce has been apparent in the last decade.]]
Proponents of cognitive enhancement have argued that there are vast potential benefits for the workforce, especially for the older segment.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; Due to advances in medical technology over the last century, the [[human life expectancy]] has increased significantly. Demographics for developed countries indicate rapid growth of the older segment of the workforce. Advancing age generally shows a pattern in the reduction of the ability to acquire new skills, but integration in the industry today requires employees to be able to acquire and retain new skills more than ever before.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

==Opinion==

===General public===
The opinion of the general public on the issue of neuroenhancement is scattered.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt;&lt;ref name=G /&gt; In general, the younger population under the age of 25 feel that neuroenhancements are acceptable or that the decision lies in the hand of that individual. Healthcare officials and parents feel concerned due to safety factors, lack of complete information on these drugs, and possible irreversible adverse effects.&lt;ref name="F" /&gt; Such concerns have been shown to reduce the willingness to take such drugs.&lt;ref name="Sattler, S. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Sattler S., Wiegel C. | year = 2013 | title = Cognitive test anxiety and cognitive enhancement: the influence of students' worries on their use of performance-enhancing drugs | url = | journal = Substance Use and Misuse | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 220–32 | doi = 10.3109/10826084.2012.751426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Sattler S., Sauer C., Mehlkop G., Graeff P. | year = 2013 | title = The Rationale for Consuming Cognitive Enhancement Drugs in University Students and Teachers | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume =  8| issue = | pages =  e68821| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0068821 | pmid=23874778 | pmc=3714277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sattler/&gt;

A recent German study among 6.454 employees found a rather low life-time prevalence of cognitive enhancement drug use (namely 2.96%), while the willingness to take such drugs was found in every tenth respondent (10.45%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Sattler S., Schunck R. | year = 2016 | title = Associations Between the Big Five Personality Traits and the Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs for Cognitive Enhancement | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 1971 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01971 |pmid=26779083|pmc=4700267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have estimated that between 7–9% of the college population in the United States consumes neuroenhancement drugs. Some studies estimate this figure to be as high as 12% or even 20%.&lt;ref name=G /&gt; A large-scale survey using a random sample of more than 5.000 German university students found a relatively low 30-days prevalence of 1.2%, 2.3% indicated the use of such drugs within the last 6 months, 3.2% within the last 12 months and during 4.6% during their lifetime, respectively.&lt;ref name="Sattler, S. 2013"/&gt; Of those students, who used such substances during the last 6 months, 39.4% reported their use once in this period, 24.2% twice, 12.1% three times and 24.2% more than three times. It has been shown that consumers of neuroenhancement drugs are much more willing to also use them in the future, e.g. due to positive experiences or a tendency towards addiction.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Sattler, S., Mehlkop, G., Graeff, P., Sauer, C.|year=2014|title=Evaluating the drivers of and obstacles to the willingness to use cognitive enhancement drugs: the influence of drug characteristics, social environment, and personal characteristics|journal=Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy |volume=9|page=8|doi=10.1186/1747-597X-9-8|url=http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/8|pmid=24484640|pmc=3928621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students primarily attribute consumption of these drugs for increased concentration, improved alertness, or to "get high".&lt;ref name="F" /&gt;&lt;ref name=G /&gt; Neuroenhancement drug users rated the positive potential of neuroenhancement drugs higher than non-users, and rated the adverse effects of these drugs lower than non-users, showing more confidence in the result of these drugs. In a survey of 1324 German students, 32% of participants that do not consume neuroenhancement drugs felt they had positive cognitive effects while 12% felt they had a relaxation effect.&lt;ref name=G /&gt; In contrast, 54% of participants that do consume neuroenhancement drugs felt they had a positive cognitive effect while 25% felt they had a relaxation effect.

[[File:A table for the results of a survey conducted on physicians.png|thumb|A table for the results of a survey conducted on physicians]]

The need to remain "alert" and "focused" can also been seen in the trend of caffeine consumption. The caffeine consumption for both students and the general population of the US is around 90%.&lt;ref name=G /&gt;&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; Students who consume neuroenhancements also had a higher frequency of consuming [[psychoactive]] lifestyle drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. This demonstrates a trend of psychological addiction amongst neuroenhancement users.&lt;ref name=G /&gt;

A study among German university teachers (including professors) found a very low prevalence of neuroenhancement drug use.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Only 0.9% of the respondents reported the use of such drugs. However, 10% of the respondents are willing to take such drugs in the future, what might indicate a potential increase of the prevalence. One reason to use such drugs was work-related stress.

===Physicians===
Physicians play an important role in determining the potential abuse of neuroenhancing drugs. While some neuroenhancing drugs do not require a prescription and are easily available, others that require prescription are up to the discretion of the physician. In a survey conducted among Swiss psychiatrists and general practitioners, the majority of surveyed physicians agreed that their criteria to determine whether or not a dysfunction should be considered a disease is if the patient indicates subjective suffering and/or negative consequences for everyday ability to work.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt;  The surveyed physicians, however, were in majority agreement that they do not prescribe medication without a clear indication of such a dysfunction.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt;

'''Old Baldy''' (ca. 1852 &amp;ndash; December 16, 1882) was the horse ridden by [[Union Army | Union]] [[Major general (United States) | Major General]] [[George G. Meade]] at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and in many other important battles of the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life and Civil War service==
Baldy was born and raised on the western frontier and at the start of the Civil War was owned by Maj. Gen. [[David Hunter]]. His name during this period is unknown. It is said that he was wounded anywhere from five to 14 times during the war, starting at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], where he was struck in the nose by a piece of an artillery shell. Soon after, in September 1861, he was purchased from the government by Meade in [[Washington, D.C.]], for $150 and named Baldy because of his white face.

Despite Baldy's unusual, uncomfortable pace, Meade became quite devoted to him and rode him in all of his battles through 1862 and the spring of 1863. The horse was wounded in the right hind leg at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], and at [[Battle of Antietam | Antietam]], he was wounded through the neck and left for dead on the field. He survived and was treated. At [[Battle of Gettysburg | Gettysburg]], on July 2, 1863, Baldy was hit by a bullet that entered his stomach after passing through Meade's right trouser leg. He staggered and refused to move forward, defying all of Meade's directions. Meade commented, "Baldy is done for this time. This is the first time he has refused to go forward under fire."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Baldy was sent to the rear for recuperation. In 1864, having returned to duty for the [[Overland Campaign]] and the [[Siege of Petersburg]], he was struck in the ribs by a shell at the Weldon Railroad, and Meade decided that Old Baldy should be retired.

==Retirement and death==
Baldy was sent north to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | Philadelphia]] and then to the farm of Meade's staff quartermaster, Captain Sam Ringwalt, in [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania]]. He was later relocated to the Meadow Bank Farm, owned by a friend of the Meade family, where he remained for several years. He was moderately active in retirement and Meade rode the horse in several memorial parades. His last parade was as the "riderless horse" in the funeral procession of his master, in November 1872. Baldy lived another 10 years. He was euthanized on December 16, 1882, at the age of 30, when he became too feeble to stand. On Christmas Day of that year, two Union Army veterans (Albert C. Johnston and H.W.B. Harvey) disinterred Baldy's remains and decapitated him, sending the head to a taxidermist.

==Baldy's remains==
Baldy's head was mounted on a plaque in a glass case and displayed in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] Civil War Museum and Library in Philadelphia. In 1979, his head was loaned to the Old Baldy [[Civil War Round Table]], which paid for its restoration and placed it on exhibit in the Meade Room of the [[Civil War Museum of Philadelphia]]. The latter museum closed in August 2008, pending a relocation, and most of its artifacts were distributed to other museums, including the [[Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center]]. Attorneys for the two museums reached an agreement under the auspices of the [[First Judicial District of Pennsylvania|Philadelphia Orphans' Court]] in December 2009 to return Old Baldy to the GAR museum on Griscom Street.&lt;ref&gt;Colimore.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceremonies marking the resumption of public display of Old Baldy at the museum were conducted on September 26, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3281">An '''optical neural network''' is a physical implementation of an [[artificial neural network]]  with [[photonics|optical components]].

Some artificial neural networks that have been implemented as optical neural networks include the [[Hopfield neural network]]&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?id=78568; http://nr.stic.gov.tw/ejournal/ProceedingA/v24n1/73-78.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012210747/http://nr.stic.gov.tw/ejournal/ProceedingA/v24n1/73-78.pdf |date=2004-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kohonen [[self-organizing map]] with [[liquid crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;see http://link.aip.org/link/?PSISDG/1296/378/1{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electrochemical vs. Optical Neural Networks ==
[[Biological neural network]]s function on an electrochemical basis, while optical neural networks use electromagnetic waves. Optical interfaces to [[biological neural network]]s can be created with [[optogenetics]], but is not the same as an optical neural networks. In biological neural networks there exist a lot of different mechanisms for dynamically changing the state of the neurons, these include short-term and long-term [[synaptic plasticity]]. Synaptic plasticity is among the electrophysiological phenomena used to control the efficiency of synaptic transmission, long-term for learning and memory, and short-term for short transient changes in synaptic transmission efficiency. Implementing this with optical components is difficult, and ideally requires advanced photonic materials. Properties that might be desirable in photonic materials for optical neural networks include the ability to change their efficiency of transmitting light, based on the intensity of incoming light.

== Implementations ==
There is one recent (2007) model of Optical Neural Network: the Programmable Optical Array/Analogic Computer (POAC). It had been implemented in the year 2000 and reported based on modified Joint Fourier Transform Correlator (JTC) and Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) as a holographic optical memory. Full parallelism, large array size and the speed of light are three promises offered by POAC to implement an optical CNN. They had been investigated during the last years with their practical limitations and considerations yielding the design of the first portable POAC version.

The practical details: hardware (optical setups) and software (optical templates) are published. However, POAC is a general purpose and programmable array computer that has a wide range of applications including:
* [[image processing]]
* [[pattern recognition]]
* [[Tracking system|target tracking]]
* real-time [[video processing]]
* [[document security]]
* [[optical switching]]

== Debate and public attention ==

=== Support ===

In a 1996 article "Abortion and Fathers' Rights,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven D. Hales|authorlink1=Abortion and Fathers' Rights|editor1-last=Humber|editor1-first=James|title=REPRODUCTION, TECHNOLOGY, AND RIGHTS|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|isbn=978-1-4757-6403-1|pages=5–26|format=Biomedical Ethics Reviews|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher Steven Hales made an argument that presupposes the following assertions:

# That women have an absolute right to abortion on demand;
# That men and women have equal moral rights and duties and should have equal legal right and duties; and
# That parents have a moral duty to support their children once they are born and legal duties of support should supervene on this moral duty.

Hales contends that the conjunction of these three principles is prima facie inconsistent and that this inconsistency should be eradicated by firstly acknowledging that men have no absolute duty to provide material support for their children, and secondly by admitting that fathers have the right of refusal.

[[Laurie Shrage]], professor of philosophy and women’s and gender studies, questions whether men should be 'penalized for being sexually active', and she puts the subject in the perspective of feminists who had to fight the same idea with different gender portent, namely that consenting to sexual intercourse is not the same as consenting to parenthood. Furthermore, both men and children are punished, according to professor Shrage; children have to live with an absent father who never 'voluntarily' became a parent.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrage 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shrage | first=Laurie | title=Is Forced Fatherhood Fair? | website=Opinionator | date=2013-06-12 | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/is-forced-fatherhood-fair/ | accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|if women’s partial responsibility for pregnancy does not obligate them to support a fetus, then men’s partial responsibility for pregnancy does not obligate them to support a resulting child.|Elizabeth Brake in the Journal of Applied Philosophy, 2005&lt;ref name="Shrage 2013" /&gt;}}At most, according to Brake, men should be responsible for helping with the medical expenses and other costs of a pregnancy for which they are partly responsible.

=== Opposition ===
Paper abortion has met opposition by those who see it as an excuse for men to shirk their responsibilities as a father.&lt;ref name=PolitkenA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/profiler/bob/ECE2182043/aldrig-har-maend-udstillet-sig-selv-mere-kaellingeagtigt/|title=Aldrig har mænd udstillet sig selv mere kællingeagtigt|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Never have men exhibited themselves more hag-like }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gudme (2016)"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gudme |first1=Maria |last2=Dyrkjær |first2=Maja Vedel |title=Fædre skal tage ansvar for børn - ikke kræve juridisk abort |trans-title=Fathers must take responsibility for children - does not require legal abortion |language=Danish |date=2016-02-04 |newspaper=[[Politiken]] |department=Debate |url=http://politiken.dk/debat/ECE3050409/faedre-skal-tage-ansvar-for-boern---ikke-kraeve-juridisk-abort/ |access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that men should use birth control (either contraception or sterilization) or practice abstinence if they want to avoid the financial and personal responsibilities of fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/fomo/ECE3050063/stor-guide-saadan-undgaar-du-at-blive-far/|title=Stor guide: Sådan undgår du at blive far|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Great guide: How to avoid becoming a father }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/klummer/amaliekestler/ECE3067223/skyl-juridisk-abort-ud-med-badevandet/|title=Skyl 'juridisk abort' ud med badevandet|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Rinse 'legal abortion' out with the bathwater }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also argue that a father's paper abortion is different from a female abortion since a child is born. Thus the best interests of the child should weigh more than equal opportunity to deny parenthood.{{r|Gudme (2016)}}

== In Scandinavia ==

=== Denmark ===
The concept of a paper abortion was first introduced in Denmark in 2000 by the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomicist]] Henrik Platz. He says that it is necessary from an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] perspective, to ensure that women and men have equal rights under the law. According to a Gallup poll from 2014 and earlier polls, between 40% and 70% of Danes agree with legalizing paper abortion.&lt;ref name=nyheder2016-03-13/&gt;

Sociologist Karen Sjørup, who conducted research on the topic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sjørup|first1=Karen|title=Men´s right to paper abortion – a feminist perspective|url=http://interactingminds.au.dk/events/single-events/artikel/gendering-in-research-talk-by-karen-sjoerup-ruc/|website=Interacting Minds Centre|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it would give women more freedom by allowing those who want to become mothers without having to share the rights and duties of parenthood with men an additional way to do so. She also suggests that it could decrease the abortion rate because it would prevent men who wished to avoid fatherhood from pressuring women to abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.information.dk/moti/2016/02/juridisk-abort-god-ting-ogsaa-kvinderne|title=Juridisk abort er en god ting – også for kvinderne|website=Information|language=Danish|access-date=2016-03-14|trans-title=Juridical abortion is a good thing - even for women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that just as women are able to choose whether to have a child or not, men should also be able to choose whether to assume paternity or not. Allowing men to have the opportunity to renounce the economic, social and legal responsibility for an unborn child during the first three months of pregnancy would give men and women as close to equal opportunities as possible.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annesophia.blogs.berlingske.dk/2016/01/30/skal-maend-have-fri-abort/|title= Skal mænd have fri abort?|website=ASH|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Should men be free to abort? | author = Anne Sophia Hermansen | date = 2016-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
In 2016, a regional branch of the Swedish Liberal Youth Party decided to support paper abortion for men until the 18th week of pregnancy, the time limit on abortions for women. The proposition was supported by some commentators, but not by the LYP's parent party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:GreatHoax.jpg|thumb|alt=Cover of a 1969 magazine entitled “Paul McCartney Dead The Great Hoax'|A magazine discussing the rumour]]

"'''Paul is dead'''" is an [[urban legend]] and [[conspiracy theory]] alleging that [[Paul McCartney]], of the English rock band [[the Beatles]], died in November 1966 and was secretly replaced by a [[look-alike]].

In September 1969, American college students published articles claiming that clues to McCartney's supposed death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Clue-hunting proved infectious and, within a few weeks, had become an international phenomenon. Rumours declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in November 1969.

References to the legend are still occasionally made in popular culture. McCartney himself poked fun at it with his 1993 live album, titling it ''[[Paul Is Live]]'', with cover art parodying clues allegedly on the cover of the Beatles' album ''[[Abbey Road]]''.

In early 1967, a rumour circulated in London that Paul McCartney had been killed in a traffic accident while driving along the [[M1 motorway|M1]] motorway on 7 January.&lt;ref name="Yoakum/Gadfly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoakum|first=Jim|date=May–June 2000|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html |title=The Man Who Killed Paul McCartney|work=[[Gadfly Online]]|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rumour was acknowledged and rebutted in the February issue of ''[[The Beatles Book]]'', a fanzine.&lt;ref name="Yoakum/Gadfly" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Beatle News|date=February 1967|magazine=[[The Beatles Book]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a lecture titled "Who Buried Paul?", presented by [[Brian Moriarty]] at the 1999 [[Game Developers Conference]], it is not known whether the rumour of 1969 is related to this earlier episode.&lt;ref name=moriarty&gt;{{cite web|last=Moriarty|first=Brian|date=1999|url=http://ludix.com/moriarty/paul.html |title=Who Buried Paul?|publisher=ludix.com|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September 1969, the Beatles released the album ''[[Abbey Road]]'' as they were in the process of disbanding.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=353, 354}} Isolated from his bandmates in his opposition to their choice of business manager, [[Allen Klein]], and distraught at [[John Lennon]]'s private announcement that he was leaving the group, McCartney retreated to his farm near [[Campbeltown]] in Scotland with his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]] and their daughters.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|pp=261, 263–64}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|pp=1, 396, 398}}

On 17 September 1969, Tim Harper, an editor of the ''Drake Times-Delphic'', the student newspaper of [[Drake University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], published an article titled "Is Beatle Paul McCartney Dead?" The article addressed a rumour being circulated on campus that cited clues from recent Beatles albums, including a message interpreted as "Turn me on, dead man", heard when "[[Revolution 9]]" (from the [[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]) is played backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt |first=Bart |url=http://blogs.library.drake.edu/2009/09/18/it-was-40-years-ago-yesterday/ |title=It Was 40 Years Ago, Yesterday ...|publisher=Drake University: Cowles Library blog |date=18 September 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to music journalist Merrell Noden, this was the first published article on the "Paul is dead" theory.&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Writing in 1977, author [[Nicholas Schaffner]] said that the theory "has been traced variously to an [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] student's thesis and to a prankish article in an [[Illinois University]] student newspaper".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=128}}}} Harper later said that it had become the subject of discussion among students at the start of the new academic year, and he added: "A lot us, because of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the so-called [[The Establishment|Establishment]], were ready, willing and able to believe just about any sort of conspiracy."&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt;

On 10 October the Beatles' press officer, [[Derek Taylor]], responded to the rumour, saying: "Recently we've been getting a flood of inquiries asking about reports that Paul is dead. We've been getting questions like that for years, of course, but in the past few weeks we've been getting them at the office and home night and day.

On 12 October 1969, a caller to [[Detroit]] radio station [[WNIC|WKNR-FM]] told [[disc jockey]] [[Russ Gibb]] about the rumour and its clues.&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt; Gibb and other callers then discussed the rumour on air for the next hour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Julie|title=The Beatle Paul Mystery – As Big as Rock Music Itself|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=23 October 1969|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which Gibb offered further potential clues.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=241}} Two days later, ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'' published a satirical review of ''Abbey Road'' by [[University of Michigan]] student [[Fred LaBour]], who had listened to the exchange on Gibb's show,&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt; under the headline "McCartney Dead; New Evidence Brought to Light".&lt;ref name="labour"&gt;{{cite news|last=LaBour|first=Fred|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2gxKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cR4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=903,2323118&amp;dq=mccartney&amp;hl=en |title=McCartney Dead; New Evidence Brought to Light|newspaper=[[The Michigan Daily]]|date=14 October 1969|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=593–94}} It identified various clues to McCartney's death on Beatles album covers, particularly on the ''Abbey Road'' sleeve. LaBour had invented many of the clues and was astonished when the story was picked up by newspapers across the United States.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2009/11/story.php?id=7565&amp;tr=y&amp;auid=5578331 |last=Glenn |first=Allen |title=Paul Is Dead (Said Fred) |newspaper=[[Michigan Today]]|date=11 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228202339/http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2009/11/story.php?id=7565&amp;tr=y&amp;auid=5578331 |archivedate=28 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noden writes that "Very soon, every college campus, every radio station, had a resident expert."&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt; WKNR fuelled the rumour further with its two-hour programme ''The Beatle Plot'', which first aired on 19 October.

The story was soon taken up by more mainstream radio stations in the New York area, [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] and [[WABC (AM)|WABC]],{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}} and by [[Bill Gavin]] on the [[US West Coast]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|Bailey|1990|p=165}} In the early hours of 21 October, WABC disc jockey [[Roby Yonge]] discussed the rumour on-air for over an hour before being pulled off the air for breaking format. At that time of night, WABC's signal covered a wide listening area and could be heard in 38 US states and, at times, in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicradio77.com/transm.html |title=Why Did WABC Have Such a Great Signal? |publisher=Musicradio 77 WABC |accessdate=5 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Beatles' press office denied the rumour, McCartney's atypical withdrawal from public life contributed to its escalation.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=262}} [[Vin Scelsa]], a student broadcaster in 1969, later said that the escalation was indicative of the [[1960s counterculture|countercultural]] influence of [[Bob Dylan]], the Beatles and [[the Rolling Stones]], since: "Every song from them – starting about late 1966 – became a personal message, worthy of endless scrutiny ... they were guidelines on how to live your life."&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt;

WMCA despatched [[Alex Bennett (broadcaster)|Alex Bennett]] to the Beatles' [[Apple Corps]] headquarters in London on 23 October,{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=333}} further to his extended coverage of the "Paul is dead" theory.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}} There, [[Ringo Starr]] told Bennett: "If people are gonna believe it, they're gonna believe it. I can only say it's not true."{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=333}} In another interview at this time, Lennon said that the rumour was "insane" but good publicity for ''Abbey Road''.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=333}}{{refn|group=nb|Estranged from McCartney, Lennon said: "Paul McCartney couldn't die without the world knowing it.

Before the end of October 1969, several record releases had exploited the phenomenon of McCartney's alleged demise.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}} These included "The Ballad of Paul" by the Mystery Tour, "Brother Paul" by Billy Shears and the All Americans, and "So Long Paul" by Werbley Finster, a pseudonym for [[José Feliciano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neely|first=Tim |year=2006|title=Goldmine Standard Catalog of American Records 1950–1975|pp=404, 863, 1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Billboard staff|url=|title=McCartney 'Death' Gets 'Disk Coverage' Dearth|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=8 November 1969|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another song was [[Terry Knight]]'s "Saint Paul",{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}} which had been a minor hit in June that year and was subsequently adopted by radio stations as a tribute to "the late Paul McCartney".&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/terry-knight-speaks |title=Terry Knight Speaks |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025171758/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/terry-knight-speaks/ |archive-date=25 October 2011 |publisher=[[Blogcritics]]|date=2 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|A [[Capitol Records]] recording artist, Knight had been present during the White Album session when Starr temporarily left the band,&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt; in August 1968.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=271}} In the song, the singer conveys his fears that the Beatles were about to disband.&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt;}} In Canada, [[Polydor Records]] exploited the rumour in their artwork for ''[[Very Together]]'', a repackaging of the Beatles' pre-fame recordings with [[Tony Sheridan]], using a cover that showed four candles, one of which had just been snuffed out.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=130}}

==Premise==
[[Image:Beatles - Abbey Road.jpg|thumb|alt=The ''Abbey Road'' album cover|The "funeral procession" on the cover of ''Abbey Road'']]
Proponents of the theory maintained that, in November 1966, McCartney had an argument with his bandmates during a Beatles recording session and drove off angrily in his car, crashed, and was decapitated.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|Bailey|1990|pp=165–66}} To spare the public from grief, or simply as a joke, the surviving Beatles replaced him with the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}} This scenario was facilitated by the Beatles' recent retirement from live performance and by their choosing to present themselves with a new image for their next album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=593}}

In LaBour's telling, the stand-in was an "orphan from Edinburgh named William Campbell" whom the Beatles then trained to impersonate McCartney.&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial"&gt;{{cite book|first=Merrell|last=Noden|chapter=Dead Man Walking|year=2003|title=[[Mojo (magazine)#Special editions|Mojo Special Limited Edition]]: 1000 Days of Revolution (The Beatles' Final Years – Jan 1, 1968 to Sept 27, 1970)|location=London|publisher=Emap|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contended that the man's name was William Shears Campbell, later abbreviated to Billy Shears,{{sfn|Turner|2016|p=368}} and the replacement was instigated by Britain's [[MI5]] out of concern for the severe distress McCartney's death would cause the Beatles' audience.&lt;ref name="Shivani/Dawn"&gt;{{cite news|first=Anis|last=Shivani|title=Paul is Dead: The Conspiracy Theory That Won't Go Away|date=15 January 2017|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1307942|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this latter telling, the surviving Beatles were said to be wracked by guilt at their duplicity, and therefore left messages in their music and album artwork to communicate the truth to their fans.&lt;ref name="Shivani/Dawn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Time staff|title=Separating Fact from Fiction: Paul Is Dead|date=July 2009|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1860871_1860876_1860997,00.html|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clues===
&lt;!--Editors: Please do not add any more clues; after much discussion on the talk page, it has been deemed that the two given are sufficient to illustrate this aspect of the subject--&gt;
{{quote box|quote= A DJ put all those signs together: Paul with no shoes [on the cover of ''Abbey Road''] ... and the Volkswagen Beetle.

Hundreds of supposed clues to McCartney's death have been reported by fans and followers of the legend. These include messages perceived when listening to a song being [[backmasking|played backwards]] and symbolic interpretations of both lyrics and album cover imagery.&lt;ref name=Harbidge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806055801/http://homepages.tesco.net/harbfamily/opd/index.html |title=Officially Pronounced Dead?|publisher=Michael Harbidge Website|accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=127–28}}
One frequently cited example is the suggestion that the words "I buried Paul" are spoken by Lennon in the final section of the song "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", which the Beatles recorded in November and December 1966. Lennon later said that the words were actually "Cranberry sauce".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=273fn}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Yorke|first=Ritchie|title=A Private Talk With John|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=7 February 1970|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the interpretation of the ''Abbey Road'' album cover as depicting a [[funeral procession]]. Lennon, dressed in white, is said to symbolise the [[Deity|heavenly figure]]; Starr, dressed in black, symbolises the [[undertaker]]; [[George Harrison]], in denim, represents the [[gravedigger]]; and McCartney, barefoot and out of step with the others, symbolises the [[cadaver|corpse]].&lt;ref name="labour" /&gt; The number plate of the white [[Volkswagen Beetle]] in the photo was identified as further "evidence",&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt;{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=341, 342}} the characters "28IF" representing McCartney's age "if" he had still been alive.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=262}}{{refn|group=nb|The fact that he would have been 27 in late 1969, rather than 28, was dismissed with the rationale that, in the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, infants were one year old at birth.&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt;}} That the left-handed McCartney holds a cigarette in his right hand was also said to support the idea that he was an imposter.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}}

McCartney was secretly filmed by a [[CBS News]] crew as he worked on his farm. As in his and Linda's segment in the Beatles' promotional clip for "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]", which the couple filmed privately around this time, McCartney was unshaven and unusually scruffy-looking in his appearance.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=335}} His next visitors were a reporter and photographer from ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Irate at the intrusion, he swore at the pair, threw a bucket of water over them and was captured on film attempting to hit the photographer. Fearing that the photos would damage his image, McCartney then approached the pair and agreed to pose for a photo with his family and answer the reporter's questions, in exchange for the roll of film containing the offending pictures.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|pp=262–63}} In Winn's description, the family portrait used for ''Life''{{'}}s cover shows McCartney no longer "shabbily attired", but "clean-shaven and casually but smartly dressed".{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=335}}

Following the publication of the article and the photo, in the issue dated 7 November,{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=335}} the rumour started to decline.&lt;ref name="Noden/MojoSpecial" /&gt; In the interview, McCartney was quoted as saying: {{quote|Perhaps the rumour started because I haven't been much in the press lately.

==Aftermath==
In November 1969, [[Capitol Records]] sales managers reported a significant increase in sales of Beatles catalogue albums, attributed to the rumour.

A television special dedicated to "Paul is dead" was broadcast on [[WWOR-TV|WOR]] in New York on 30 November.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; Set in a courtroom, it was hosted by the celebrity lawyer [[F. Lee Bailey]], who [[Cross-examination|cross-examine]]d LaBour and other "witnesses", including McCartney's friend [[Peter Asher]] and Allen Klein,{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=127}} but he left it to the viewer to determine a conclusion.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; Before the recording, LaBour told Bailey that his article had been intended as a joke, to which Bailey sighed and replied, "Well, we have an hour of television to do; you're going to have to go along with this."&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

{{quote box|quote= It was a bit weird meeting people shortly after that, because they'd be looking at the back of my ears, looking a bit through me.

McCartney returned to London in December. Bolstered by Linda's support, he began recording his debut solo album at his home in [[St John's Wood]].{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=264}} Titled ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'', and recorded without his bandmates' knowledge,{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=111, 121}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|p=2}} it was "one of the best-kept secrets in rock history" until shortly before its release in April 1970, according to author [[Nicholas Schaffner]], and led to the announcement of the [[Break-up of the Beatles|Beatles' break-up]].{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=135}} Both Lennon and McCartney subsequently referred to the "Paul is dead" legend in their solo careers. In his 1971 song "[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]", in which he attacked McCartney's character,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|p=399}} Lennon described the theorists as "freaks" who "were right when they said you was dead".{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=290}} McCartney titled his 1993 live album ''[[Paul Is Live]]'' and presented it in a sleeve that parodied the ''Abbey Road'' cover and its clues.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=339}}

LaBour later became notable as the bassist for the [[western swing]] group [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Riders in the Sky]], which he cofounded in 1977. In 2008, he joked that his success as a musician had extended his [[fifteen minutes of fame]] for his part in the rumour to "seventeen minutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaBour|first1=Fred|title=True Westerners: Fred Labour – Too Slim of Riders in the Sky|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/fred-labour-too-slim-of-riders-in-the-sky/|website=''[[True West Magazine]]''|accessdate=28 June 2016|date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he told ''[[The Detroit News]]'' that he is still periodically contacted by conspiracy theorists who have attempted to present him with supposed new developments on the McCartney rumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Neal|title=Paul McCartney still isn't dead.

==Analysis and legacy==
Author [[Peter Doggett]] writes that, while the theory behind "Paul is dead" defied logic, its popularity was understandable in a climate where citizens were faced with conspiracy theories insisting that the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] in 1963 was in fact a [[coup d'état]].{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=107}} Schaffner said that, given its origins as an item of gossip and intrigue generated by a select group in the "Beatles cult", "Paul is dead" serves as "a genuine folk tale of the [[Mass communication|mass communications]] era".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=128}} He also described it as "the most monumental hoax since [[Orson Welles]]' [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|''War of the Worlds'' broadcast]] persuaded thousands of panicky New Jerseyites that Martian invaders were in the vicinity".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=128}}

During the 1970s, the phenomenon became a topic of academic study in America in the fields of [[sociology]], [[psychology]] and [[Communication studies|communications]].{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=128–29}} Among sociological studies, Barbara Suczek recognised it as, in Schaffner's description, a contemporary reading of the "archetypal myth wherein the beautiful youth dies and is resurrected as a god".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=128}} Psychologists Ralph Rosnow and [[Gary Fine]] attributed its popularity partly to the shared, vicarious experience of searching for clues without consequence for the participants. They also said that for a generation distrustful of the media following the [[Warren Commission]]'s report, it was able to thrive amid a climate informed by "The credibility gap of [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s presidency, the widely circulated rumors after the [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]] assassinations, as well as attacks on the leading media sources by the [[yippies]] and [[Spiro Agnew]]".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=128}} American social critic [[Camille Paglia]] locates the "Paul is dead" phenomenon to the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] tradition symbolised by [[Adonis]] and [[Antinous]], as represented in the cult of rock music's "pretty, long-haired boys who mesmerize both sexes", and she adds: "It's no coincidence that it was Paul McCartney, the 'cutest' and most girlish of the Beatles, who inspired a false rumor that swept the world in 1969 that he was dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Camille|last=Paglia|title=Cults and Cosmic Consciousness: Religious Vision in the American 1960s|journal=[[Arion (journal)|Arion: A Journal of Humanities and the Classics]]|date=Winter 2003|series=3rd|volume=10|number=3|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Paul is dead" has continued to inspire analysis into the 21st century, with published studies by 
Andru J. Reeve, [[Nick Kollerstrom]] and Brian Moriarty, among others, and exploitative works in the mediums of [[mockumentary]] and documentary film.&lt;ref name="Shivani/Dawn" /&gt; Writing in 2016, Beatles biographer [[Steve Turner (writer)|Steve Turner]] said, "the theory still has the power to flare back into life."{{sfn|Turner|2016|p=368}}{{refn|group=nb|In his article on the legacy of "Paul is dead", for ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' in January 2017, Anis Shivani wrote that the narrative has grown, in the manner of JFK's assassination, to incorporate related conspiracy theories. In this expanded narrative, Lennon's murder in 1980, Harrison's near-fatal stabbing in 1999, and the death of Beatles associate [[Mal Evans]] in 1976 are all credited to forces protecting the "truth" behind "Paul is dead".&lt;ref name="Shivani/Dawn" /&gt;}} Similar rumours concerning other celebrities have been circulated, including the unsubstantiated allegation that Canadian singer [[Avril Lavigne]] died in 2003 and was replaced by a person named Melissa Vandella.&lt;ref name="Cresci/Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Elena|last=Cresci|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/may/15/avril-lavigne-melissa-cloning-conspiracy-theories|title=Why fans think Avril Lavigne died and was replaced by a clone named Melissa|date=16 May 2017|publisher=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lamia|last=Estatie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39921209|title=The Avril Lavigne conspiracy theory returns|date=15 May 2017|publisher=[[BBC|bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on the latter phenomenon, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the 1969 McCartney hoax as "Possibly the best known example" of a celebrity being the focus of "a (completely unverified) cloning conspiracy theory".&lt;ref name="Cresci/Guardian" /&gt; In 2009, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included "Paul is dead" in its feature on ten of "the world's most enduring conspiracy theories".&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

[[Image:Batman222june1970.jpg|thumb|alt=The cover of a 1970 ''Batman'' comic book parodying the legend|The cover of a 1970 ''Batman'' comic book parodying the legend]]
There have been many references to the legend in popular culture, including the following examples.

*In [[the Rutles]]' 1978 television film satirising the Beatles' history, ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', the identity of the alleged dead band member was transferred to the George Harrison character, "Stig O'Hara". As narrated by [[Eric Idle]], the rumour was attributed to Stig's reluctance to be in the limelight and the fact that "he'd not said a word since 1966." The "Stig is dead" theory contended that the Rutles' guitarist "[had] been killed in a flash fire at a water bed shop and replaced by a plastic and wax replica from [[Madame Tussauds]]".
*A 2009 ''[[Wired Italia]]'' magazine article featured an analysis by two forensic research consultants who compared selected photographs of McCartney taken before and after his alleged death by measuring features of the skull.{{sfn|Turner|2016|p=368}}&lt;ref&gt;Carlesi, Gabriella ''et al.''

'''George''' ({{lang-ka|გიორგი}}, Giorgi; c. 1529 – 6 April 1561) was a [[Georgians|Georgian]] prince (''[[batonishvili]]'') of the [[Bagrationi dynasty|royal house]] of [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]], a son of King [[Levan of Kakheti]] by his second wife, a daughter of Kamal Kara-Musel, [[Shamkhal of Tarki]]. He was killed in 1561 in a battle with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Iranian]] army, fighting on the side of his brother-in-law, King [[Simon I of Kartli]].

== Biography ==
George was born of Levan of Kakheti's second marriage to a daughter of Kamal Kara-Musel, the shamkhal of Tarku in [[Dagestan]]. He was the eldest of the fourteen children born of this union. According to the 18th-century Georgian historian [[Prince Vakhushti]], Georgewas intended by his father as heir to the throne (Levan had disowned his children by his first marriage to [[Tinatin Gurieli]]). In 1561, [[Simon I of Kartli]], ruler of a neighboring [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484–1762)|Georgian polity]], offered Levan—his father-in-law—an alliance against the Safavid Iranian hegemony. Levan, anxious to preserve peace at home, was reluctant, but his son George volunteered with the Kakhetian army for Simon's cause. Arriving at Dzegvi to join the Kartlians, George's troops were attacked and annihilated, on the [[Easter Day]] on 6 April 1561, by the Safavid army under [[Shahverdi Sultan]], a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] [[beylerbey]] of [[Karabakh Beylarbeylik|Karabakh]], at the battle of Tsikhedidi. George himself was killed in action.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayfield|first=Donald|author-link=Donald Rayfield|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|year=2012|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1780230303|page = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brosset"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brosset|first=Marie-Félicité|title=Chronique géorgienne, traduite par m.

The live rhinoceros was a gift from M. Chevalier, French governor of [[Chandernagor]], to [[Louis XV]].&lt;ref name="Rookmaaker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rookmaaker|first1=L.

==Preservation==
The rhino was installed in a small pen at the Ménagerie of Versailles. When the rhinoceros died in 1793, having been in captivity in France for more than 20 years, its skeleton and hide were preserved. They are today displayed at the [[Museum d'Histoire Naturelle]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Rookmaaker"/&gt;

Rabbi '''Shmuel Dovid Ungar''' (23 November 1885 &amp;ndash; 9 February 1945), also known as Rabbi '''Samuel David Ungar''', was the rabbi of the [[Slovakia]]n city of [[Nitra]] and dean of the last surviving [[yeshiva]] in occupied Europe during World War II. He was the father-in-law of Rabbi [[Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl]], and played a minor role in the [[Bratislava Working Group]]'s efforts to save Slovak Jews from the Holocaust.

==Early life==
Ungar was the only son born to his father, Rabbi Yosef Moshe Ungar (1855–1897), the rabbi of the town of [[Pöstyén]] (today: Piešťany). He was a descendant of the [[Abravanel|Abrabanel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/todays-yahrtzeits-history-27-nissan-2 |title=Today's Yahrtzeits &amp; History &amp;ndash; 27 Nissan |publisher=matzav.com |date=1 May 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinuch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chinuch.org/AdarI.php |title=Gedolim Yahrtzeits |last=Paltiel |first=Manny |year=2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011|publisher=chinuch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ungar's father died when he was 11 years old,&lt;ref name="witness"&gt;Project Witness. "Harav Shmuel David Ungar, ''Hy"d'', of Nitra". ''[[Hamodia]]'', 17 March 2011, p. C2.&lt;/ref&gt; and he became a frequent guest at the home of Rabbi Kalman Weber, who was appointed Rav of Pöstyén in his father's place.

After his [[bar mitzvah]], Shmuel Dovid left home to study at the [[yeshiva]] in [[Prešov]] headed by his uncle, Rabbi Noach Baruch Fisher. Later, he studied at the yeshiva in [[Huncovce|Unsdorf]] led by Rabbi Shmuel Rosenberg. He married his first cousin, Miriam Leah Fisher, daughter of Rabbi Noach Baruch.&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt;

==Rabbi and rosh yeshiva==
At the age of 21, Ungar became the Rav of [[Korompa]] (today: Krompachy), and founded a yeshiva in that town. Five years later, he was asked to become Rav and Rosh Yeshiva of [[Nagyszombat]] (today: Trnava), an old and well-established Jewish community, which he served for 15 years.&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt; It was during this tenure that he became known as one of the leading rabbis of Europe for his erudition and strict adherence to [[halakha]]. It was also during this time that Rabbi Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl joined his yeshiva and formed a lifelong attachment to him.

In 1931, Ungar was approached by the town of Nitra, which had recently lost its chief rabbi, Rabbi Avraham Aharon Katz, with a request that he head that community. To sweeten the offer, the community promised to help him expand its yeshiva under his leadership. Weissmandl tried to dissuade Ungar from accepting the offer, arguing that it would be a mistake to leave an established community like Trnava for Nitra, which was only about 200 years old and had 3,000 Jews. Ungar, however, said he would go. "My heart tells me that the day will come when there will be no yeshiva anywhere in Slovakia but Nitra, and I want to be there when that happens", he said presciently.&lt;ref name="cry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5763/NSO63features.htm |last=Fried |first=S. |title=A Cry from the Pages |publisher=Dei'ah VeDibur |date=3 June 2003 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525072148/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5763/NSO63features.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nitra, Ungar built up a yeshiva with nearly 300 students that eventually attracted students from Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. He taught in the classic Hungarian style introduced by the [[Moses Sofer|Chasam Sofer]], and although he did not set out to produce rabbis, some of his students did go on to become prominent rabbis in their hometowns.&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt; He developed a close and loving relationship with each student and kept the connection after they left, conducting an alumni reunion every five years. Weissmandl married his Rav's daughter, Bracha Rachel, in 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/1378317/jewish/A-Rabbi-from-the-Bodleian-Library-who-saved-Jews-from-the-Holocaust.htm |title=Rabbi Michael Weissmandl: A Rabbi from Oxford’s Bodleian Library who saved Jews from the Holocaust |last=Brackman |first=Rabbi Eli |publisher=Oxford Chabad Society |year=2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became Ungar's right-hand man in all aspects of running the yeshiva.

Besides his position as the chief rabbi of Nitra, Ungar was appointed vice president of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, the supreme religious body of [[World Agudath Israel]], in 1935.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt;

==World War II==
Jewish persecution began even before World War II in Slovakia, where the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 carved Czechoslovakia into separate states. Slovakia became a totalitarian state run by the Catholic priest [[Jozef Tiso]], who allied with Nazi Germany and supported discrimination against his country's Jews. In 1942, [[deportation]]s from Slovakia to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] via [[Lublin]] began. The first Jews were forced to leave Nitra on the [[Shabbat]] after [[Passover]].

Ungar could have left Slovakia to save his life, but he refused to desert his community and his yeshiva.&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt; Defying a Nazi order to remain at home on that first day of deportations, Ungar walked to the [[synagogue]] to spend the [[Seudah Shlishit|third meal of Shabbat]] with his flock.

After 58,000 Jews had been expelled from Slovakia, Weissmandl, in conjunction with the [[Working Group of Bratislava|Working Group]] that he and other activists had established to try to save Slovak Jews, attempted one of the most ambitious rescue schemes of the [[Holocaust]]. With a $50,000 bribe to [[Dieter Wisliceny]] ([[Adolf Eichmann]]'s deputy in the Jewish Section of the Reich Security Main Office and adviser on Jewish affairs to the Slovak government), the Working Group managed to halt the deportations until 1944.

Weissmandl also intervened with the Slovak government to allow the Nitra Yeshiva to continue functioning as the only legal yeshiva in the country during the next two years. To assist students who were still being accosted and sent to forced labor camps, the yeshiva constructed hiding places under the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] and above bookcases in its study hall in the event of Nazi raids. Often the warning came at such short notice that [[Talmud]]s would be left lying open on the tables as everyone fled and hid. Despite these disruptions, Ungar continued to teach and give weekly examinations as usual.

==In hiding==
In August 1944, the Nazis crushed a revolt by [[Slovak partisans]] who had never supported Slovakia's Nazi regime, and the German army entered and occupied the country. Deportations to Auschwitz resumed in greater intensity than before. The Nitra Yeshiva was liquidated on September 5, 1944.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; By September 17, every remaining Jew in Nitra had been deported.

Ungar and one of his sons, Sholom Moshe, together with Rabbi Meir Eisler, had been vacationing in the forests of the [[Zobor]] Mountain near Nitra. When they heard that the yeshiva had been liquidated, they did not return to Nitra. They made their way to [[Bystřice pod Lopeníkem|Bistritz]], which was under partisan control, but when the Germans attacked that city the following month, they fled and spent the winter hiding in mountain caves and subsisting on starvation rations.&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt; Ungar kept a diary in which he recorded his travails and prepared his spiritual will.

Throughout that winter of hiding in the forest, Ungar scrupulously observed [[halakha|Jewish law]] even though he was starving to death. He refused to eat bread or milk obtained from gentiles, or to even eat bread if there was no water for [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ritual hand-washing]].&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt; On one occasion he received some grapes, but would not eat them immediately; he insisted on saving them to eat on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. While terror and fear were others' constant companions, he was concerned with how to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] of hearing the [[shofar]] blasts on [[Rosh Hashanah]].&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt;

Ungar died of starvation on 9 February 1945 (8 [[Adar]] 5705 according to the Hebrew calendar).&lt;ref name="chinuch"/&gt; He instructed his son where and how to bury him, said his last [[Confession in Judaism|confession]] (''viduy''), and died. After the war, his son re-interred him in Piešťany, his birthplace, next to the grave of his father.&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Two of Ungar's sons, Sholom Moshe (1916&amp;ndash;2003)&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/printArticle.cfm?contentid=46689 |title=Nitra Reborn |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rabbi Gershon |work=[[The Jewish Press]] |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yaakov Yitzchak, and a daughter, Chaya Nechama, survived the war. (Chaya Nechama later married Rabbi [[Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam]], the [[Klausenberg (Hasidic dynasty)|Klausenberger]] Rebbe, in America in 1947.&lt;ref name="Mishpacha"&gt;Landesman, Yeruchem. ''The Wedding that Changed Despair to Hope''. ''[[Mishpacha]]'', 11 November 2009, pp. 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;) Another son, Benzion, the Rav of Piešťany, was taken to a prison camp in [[Sereď]], where he was murdered by Slovak military police. Ungar's rebbetzin, Miriam Leah, was also murdered, together with many other family members.&lt;ref name="witness"/&gt; Ungar's son-in-law, Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl, survived the war.

Ungar's [[Torah study|Torah]] writings were saved by a gentile woman who gave them to Ungar's son, Sholom Moshe, after the war.

'''Steve Adams''', sometimes known as '''Stephen Adams''', was a miner and member of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) in the early 1900s. Adams was named as an accomplice in several murders by [[Harry Orchard]], who said that the murders were done at the orders of the WFM leadership. Adams was tried three times for murder, but was never convicted.

Adans played a role in events surrounding the murder trials of [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) leaders [[Bill Haywood]], [[Charles Moyer]], and [[George Pettibone]], all charged with conspiring to murder former Idaho Governor [[Frank Steunenberg]], allegedly in retaliation of the governor's role in the [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899|miner uprising in Coeur d'Alene]]. The investigations were led by famed [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent [[James McParland]]. As a witness for the state who recanted, Adams is particularly notable for his comments about the methods used by agent McParland to turn defendants against each other.

==The Haywood trial==

McParland had WFM member Harry Orchard in custody, and [[James McParland|had obtained an elaborate confession]]. However, McParland knew that he needed more than the confession of one man to convict Bill Haywood, who was being tried first among the trio of WFM leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Adams was "a thirty-nine-year-old former Kansas City butcher and Cripple Creek miner with heavy, drooping eyelids and a booze-blotched complexion."&lt;ref name="Roughneck 1983, page 102"&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Orchard had described Adams as an accomplice in several crimes. As in the cases of Haywood, Moyer, and Pettibone, McParland relied upon a perjured warrant to cross state lines and grab Adams. The prisoner wasn't charged with any crime, but was held at the penitentiary in Idaho with Orchard. This was not according to McParland's plans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If arrested, Adams was supposed to be kept in a separate cell away from Orchard as McParland explicitly spelled out to the warden. To prime a man for confessing, McParland required solitary confinement, a penetrating silence, the watchful presence of a stony guard, and as few contacts as possible. Adams was to be denied access to an attorney, knowledge of his wife and children, and no information on the charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Together in the cell, Orchard described his own confession to Adams, and urged Adams to also confess. In spite of the missed instruction about isolation, McParland reportedly later obtained such a confession from Adams.&lt;ref name="Roughneck 1983, page 102"/&gt; 

Although Steve Adams wasn't allowed to know anything about his wife and children, they weren't far away:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
His wife, Annie, and their small children had also been locked in the penitentiary shortly after his arrest for "their own protection," McParland had assured him, hinting that something dreadful might befall them.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adams' family was brought to the prison "as a means to 'sweat' him."&lt;ref&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarence Darrow intervenes===

However, Haywood defense attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] passed the word that he would defend Adams, and the prisoner immediately recanted. This provoked the prosecution to try Adams in an old murder case for which there was only flimsy evidence. In fact the only significant evidence against Adams was his now-repudiated confession&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared to have been coerced, as Harry Orchard's confession was coerced.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 89-92.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference appeared to be that there was clear evidence of Orchard's guilt in the Steunenberg murder,&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 87.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps in a string of crimes, but little or no evidence linking the others.

Adams had been dining well and provided with fine cigars since signing his confession, as had Harry Orchard. The note announcing that Adams recanted that confession was passed secretly from his jail cell via his wife, Annie, during a visit. The note "delivered a lightning bolt" to the prosecution.&lt;ref name="Boomerang Road 1908, page 283"&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 283, citing ''Miners' Magazine'', September 13, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; It declared,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is to certify that the statement that I signed was made up by James McParland, detective, and Harry Orchard, alias Tom Hogan. I signed it because I was threatened by [[Frank R. Gooding|Governor Gooding]], saying I would be hanged if I did not corroborate Orchard's story against the officers of the federation union of miners. Stephen Adams. Witness: Annie Adams.&lt;ref name="Boomerang Road 1908, page 283"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because under Idaho law the testimony of an accomplice must be corroborated by other evidence, the prosecution was counting on Adams' testimony to back up Orchard's confession. Adams' renunciation of his confession greatly weakened the prosecution's case against Haywood, who was found not guilty of the Steunenberg assassination. Pettibone was later also found not guilty in a separate trial. Moyer was released. 

Harry Orchard pled guilty of the murder of Frank Steunenberg and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted. Orchard would spend the rest of his life in prison.

Some believed that the WFM would retaliate with violence against its enemies in the court cases. This belief was strengthened between the Haywood and Adams trials when ex-sheriff Harvey Brown, who had arrested Adams, was killed by a bomb set to explode when he opened his front gate - very similar to the setup Harry Orchard used to assassinate ex-governor Steunenberg. Another prospective witness in the Adams trial, Archie Phillips, found ten pounds of dynamite behind his house, and fled to Canada to avoid testifying. A number of other prosecution witnesses disappeared or put themselves out of reach of subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;Beau Riffenburgh, ''Pinkerton's Great Detective'' (New York: Penguin, 1913) 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steve Adams testifies===

Adams took the witness stand in his own murder trial and testified, in part,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was taken to the office of the penitentiary and introduced to detective McParland. He told me about "Kelly the Bum" [from McParland's [[Molly Maguires]] case] and other men who had turned state's evidence and had been set free. ... McParland told me he wanted to convict [WFM leaders] Moyer, Haywood, Pettibone, [[Vincent Saint John|St. John]], and Simpkins, whom he called 'cut-throats.' If I did not help to convict them, he said, I would be taken back to Colorado and either hanged or mobbed. If I did help, I would only be taken to Colorado as a witness. ... When the confession was made, McParland led me on a step-by-step and showed me all they wanted me to say. ... He wanted the names of the officers of the Federation used as much as possible all through the confession.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McParland's own reports to Idaho Governor Gooding confirm Steve Adams' courtroom statements.

Adams described how information from the question and answer session with McParland, with the Pinkerton detective guiding him from "notes in his pocket," had been typed and returned to him in the form of a narrative document which he was required to sign. The narrative was written in a form that was not consistent with Adams' manner of speech. The document ended with, "I hope that the reign of terror inaugurated by Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone...will cease."&lt;ref&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams also claimed that Orchard had colluded with McParland to rewrite his own confession because "he could not repeat it the second time anything at all like the first one."&lt;ref&gt;All That Glitters &amp;mdash; Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fremont Wood, the presiding judge in both the Haywood and Pettibone trials, was highly impressed by the way Orchard held up under prolonged and severe cross-examination in each trial, and believed Orchard's testimony to be true. In Wood's experience, no one could have fabricated such a convoluted story, covering many years, in many locations, and including so many different people, and withstand such thorough cross-examination without materially contradicting himself.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont Wood, ''The Introductory Chapter to the History of the Trials of Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone, and Harry Orchard'' (Caldwell, Ida.: Caxton, 1931) 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was L.J. "Jack" Simpkins, also known as J. Simmons, who accompanied Harry Orchard to [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], but left before former governor Stuenenberg was assassinated. Simpkins was the WFM executive board member with responsibility for Idaho. The Pinkerton Agency produced a poster offering a two thousand dollar reward for his arrest, but "some skeptics believed that he was actually a Pinkerton [[agent provocateur]]."&lt;ref&gt;Big Trouble, J. Anthony Lukas, 1997, photo caption between pages 224-225, page 293. and pages 557-558.&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations appear to have been unfounded.

At one point in the trial of Bill Haywood, McParland thought to frighten Moyer into testifying against Haywood and Pettibone by alleging that Pettibone had urged Orchard and Adams to kill Moyer. The plan was not carried out because McParland came up with an alternative plan.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 107.&lt;/ref&gt; But the alternative scheme failed when Moyer refused to accept the bait.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results of the trials===

Adams was not found guilty of the murder. He was tried three times altogether, and both trials in Idaho ended in hung juries.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he would still face a trial for his life in Colorado.

In the Colorado trial of Steve Adams, attorney [[Orrin N. Hilton]] challenged the legality of Adams' confession. McParland testified, and so did the Pinkerton stenographer who took down the confession. The stenographer admitted that McParland directed him what to take down, and what to leave out. The stenographer also confirmed that the confession was not written in language attributable to the defendant, and that sometimes "the substance of the conversation" was added in at a later time. The judge considered the issue overnight. In court the next day, he cited McParland's own testimony about the threat of hanging, and the promise of reward &amp;mdash; freedom in return for a confession &amp;mdash; which McParland routinely used in obtaining confessions. The judge ruled that the confession was gained illicitly, and the confession itself was barred. The judge ruled, however, that witnesses could attest to what Steve Adams had admitted in their presence. The information provided by the witnesses was contradictory, incomplete, and in some cases appeared to come from newspaper accounts.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 289-292, and 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Steve Adams had been accused of involvement in two murders in Colorado, one of which never happened. 

In her research for the book ''The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908,'' MaryJoy Martin uncovered an elaborate scheme by mine owners and their supporters to blame the [[Telluride, Colorado]], local of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] with a string of murders for which there was no evidence. Newspapers printed articles about how the murders allegedly occurred, and named union officials who had committed the crimes. The mine owners, the local sheriff, and James McParland of the Pinkerton Agency used the accusations of murder to publicize an alleged "reign of terror" as a means of destroying the union. One allegedly deceased victim, [[William J. Barney]],  was a mine guard who simply had disappeared from his job. In spite of elaborate and detailed chronologies of the murder that were printed in the local newspapers, Barney was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this fact wasn't known to the jury sitting in judgment of Steve Adams. 

Even so, it wasn't long before the jury decided that testimony by [[Bulkeley Wells]], manager of the Smuggler-Union Mining Company, who had sought the conviction and execution of Western Federation of Miners leaders for years, was not credible. Wells had constructed a scenario under which Steve Adams committed the murder with a shotgun. The jury, mostly area farmers, were intimately familiar with shotguns. The murder scenario, in their judgment, was impossible.

The jury deliberated for an hour before taking a straw poll. They were unanimous; the defendant was not guilty. After three years in prison, Steve Adams was set free.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 293-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|The Singularity||Singularity (disambiguation)}}
The '''technological singularity''' (also, simply, the '''singularity''')&lt;ref&gt;Cadwalladr, Carole (2014). "[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/22/robots-google-ray-kurzweil-terminator-singularity-artificial-intelligence Are the robots about to rise? Google's new director of engineering thinks so…]" ''The Guardian''. Guardian News and Media Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial [[superintelligence]] (ASI) will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization.&lt;ref name="Singularity hypotheses"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eden, Amnon H. |author2=Moor, James H. |title=Singularity hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment |date=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=9783642325601 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this hypothesis, an upgradable [[intelligent agent]] (such as a computer running software-based [[artificial general intelligence]]) would enter a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, with each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an [[intelligence explosion]] and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that would, qualitatively, far surpass all [[human intelligence]].

[[Stanislaw Ulam]] reports a discussion with [[John von Neumann]] "centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue".&lt;ref name="mathematical" /&gt; Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Singularity hypotheses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=2010|title=The singularity: a philosophical analysis|url=|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|volume=17|issue=9–10|pages=7–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[I. J. Good]]'s "intelligence explosion" model predicts that a future superintelligence will trigger a singularity.&lt;ref name="vinge1993"&gt;Vinge, Vernor. [http://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era"], in ''Vision-21: Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering in the Era of Cyberspace'', G. A. Landis, ed., NASA Publication CP-10129, pp. 11–22, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emeritus professor of computer science at [[San Diego State University]] and [[science fiction]] author [[Vernor Vinge]] said in his 1993 essay ''The Coming Technological Singularity'' that this would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate.&lt;ref name="vinge1993" /&gt;

Four polls, conducted in 2012 and 2013, suggested that the median estimate was a 50% chance that artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be developed by 2040–2050.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khatchadourian|first1=Raffi|title=The Doomsday Invention|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=The New Yorker|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, V. C., &amp; Bostrom, N. (2016). Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion. In Fundamental issues of artificial intelligence (pp. 555–572). Springer, Cham.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, public figures such as [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Elon Musk]] expressed concern that full artificial intelligence could result in human extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparkes|first1=Matthew|title=Top scientists call for caution over artificial intelligence|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11342200/Top-scientists-call-for-caution-over-artificial-intelligence.html|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph (UK)]]|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540|title=Hawking: AI could end human race|date=2 December 2014|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been hotly debated.

==Background==
Although technological progress has been accelerating, it has been limited by the basic intelligence of the human brain, which has not, according to [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], changed significantly for millennia.&lt;ref name="Paul Ehrlich June 2008"&gt;Ehrlich, Paul. [http://www.longnow.org/seminars/02008/jun/27/dominant-animal-human-evolution-and-environment/ The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the increasing power of computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build a machine that is more intelligent than humans.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_35/b3644021.htm Superbrains born of silicon will change everything.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801074729/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_35/b3644021.htm |date=August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a superhuman intelligence were to be invented—either through the [[Intelligence amplification|amplification of human intelligence]] or through artificial intelligence—it would bring to bear greater problem-solving and inventive skills than current humans are capable of. Such an AI is referred to as '''Seed AI'''&lt;ref name="Yampolskiy, Roman V 2015"&gt;Yampolskiy, Roman V. "Analysis of types of self-improving software." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 384-393.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]. General Intelligence and Seed AI-Creating Complete Minds Capable of Open-Ended Self-Improvement, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; because if an AI were created with engineering capabilities that matched or surpassed those of its human creators, it would have the potential to autonomously improve its own software and hardware or design an even more capable machine. This more capable machine could then go on to design a machine of yet greater capability. These iterations of recursive self-improvement could accelerate, potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in. It is speculated that over many iterations, such an AI [[Superintelligence|would far surpass human cognitive abilities]].

==Intelligence explosion==
The '''intelligence explosion''' is a possible outcome of humanity building [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI). AGI would be capable of '''recursive self-improvement''' leading to rapid emergence of ASI ([[Superintelligence|artificial superintelligence]]), the limits of which are unknown, at the time of the technological singularity.

[[I. J. Good]] speculated in 1965 that [[artificial general intelligence]] might bring about an intelligence explosion. He speculated on the effects of superhuman machines, should they ever be invented: {{Harvtxt|Good|1965}}
{{quote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.}}

Good's scenario runs as follows: as computers increase in power, it becomes possible for people to build a machine that is more intelligent than humanity; this superhuman intelligence possesses greater problem-solving and inventive skills than current humans are capable of. This superintelligent machine then designs an even more capable machine, or re-writes its own software to become even more intelligent; this (even more capable) machine then goes on to design a machine of yet greater capability, and so on. These iterations of recursive self-improvement accelerate, allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in.&lt;ref name="stat"/&gt;

==Other manifestations==
===Emergence of superintelligence===
{{Further|Superintelligence}}
A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. "Superintelligence" may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent. John von Neumann, [[Vernor Vinge]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]] define the concept in terms of the technological creation of super intelligence. They argue that it is difficult or impossible for present-day humans to predict what human beings' lives would be like in a post-singularity world.&lt;ref name="vinge1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singularity"/&gt;

Technology forecasters and researchers disagree about if or when human intelligence is likely to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence. A number of [[futures studies]] scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to [[brain–computer interface|interface with computers]], or [[mind uploading|upload their minds to computers]], in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification.

===Non-AI singularity===
Some writers use "the singularity" in a broader way to refer to any radical changes in our society brought about by new technologies such as [[molecular nanotechnology]],&lt;ref name="hplusmagazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agi-conf"/&gt; although Vinge and other writers specifically state that without superintelligence, such changes would not qualify as a true singularity.&lt;ref name="vinge1993" /&gt;

==Plausibility==
Many prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity, including [[Paul Allen]], [[Jeff Hawkins]], [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]], [[Jaron Lanier]], and [[Gordon Moore]], whose [[Moore's law|law]] is often cited in support of the concept.&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

Most proposed methods for creating superhuman or [[transhuman]] minds fall into one of two categories: intelligence amplification of human brains and artificial intelligence. The means speculated to produce intelligence augmentation are numerous, and include [[bioengineering]], [[genetic engineering]], [[nootropic]] drugs, AI assistants, direct [[brain–computer interface]]s and [[mind uploading]]. The existence of multiple paths to an intelligence explosion makes a singularity more likely; for a singularity to not occur they would all have to fail.&lt;ref name="singinst.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singinst.org/overview/whatisthesingularity |title=What is the Singularity? &amp;#124; Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Singinst.org |accessdate=2011-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908014050/http://singinst.org/overview/whatisthesingularity/ |archivedate=2011-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Hanson|1998}} is skeptical of human intelligence augmentation, writing that once one has exhausted the "low-hanging fruit" of easy methods for increasing human intelligence, further improvements will become increasingly difficult to find. Despite the numerous speculated means for amplifying human intelligence, non-human artificial intelligence (specifically seed AI) is the most popular option for organizations{{which?|date=September 2018}} trying to advance the singularity.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Whether or not an intelligence explosion occurs depends on three factors.&lt;ref name="david_chalmers_singularity_lecture_resources_available"&gt;David Chalmers John Locke Lecture, 10 May, Exam Schools, Oxford, [http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/news/2010/david_chalmers_singularity_lecture_resources_available Presenting a philosophical analysis of the possibility of a technological singularity or "intelligence explosion" resulting from recursively self-improving AI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115205558/http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/news/2010/david_chalmers_singularity_lecture_resources_available |date=2013-01-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first, accelerating factor, is the new intelligence enhancements made possible by each previous improvement. Contrariwise, as the intelligences become more advanced, further advances will become more and more complicated, possibly overcoming the advantage of increased intelligence. Each improvement must be able to beget at least one more improvement, on average, for the singularity to continue. Finally the laws of physics will eventually prevent any further improvements.

There are two logically independent, but mutually reinforcing causes of intelligence improvements: increases in the speed of computation, and improvements to the [[algorithm]]s used.&lt;ref name="consc.net"&gt;[http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis, David J. Chalmers]&lt;/ref&gt; The former is predicted by [[Moore's law|Moore’s Law]] and the forecast improvements in hardware,&lt;ref name="itrs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itrs.net/Links/2007ITRS/ExecSum2007.pdf |title=ITRS |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929173755/http://www.itrs.net/Links/2007ITRS/ExecSum2007.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is comparatively similar to previous technological advance. On the other hand, most AI researchers{{who|date=March 2017}} believe that software is more important than hardware.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A 2017 email survey of authors with publications at the 2015 [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems|NIPS]] and [[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]] machine learning conferences asked them about the chance of an intelligence explosion. 12% said it was "quite likely", 17% said it was "likely", 21% said it was "about even", 24% said it was "unlikely" and 26% said it was "quite unlikely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Grace|first1=Katja|last2=Salvatier|first2=John|last3=Dafoe|first3=Allan|last4=Zhang|first4=Baobao|last5=Evans|first5=Owain|title=When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?

=== Speed improvements ===
Both for human and artificial intelligence, hardware improvements increase the rate of future hardware improvements. Oversimplified,&lt;ref name="arstechnica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Siracusa |first=John |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/8 |title=Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard: the Ars Technica review |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's Law suggests that if the first doubling of speed took 18 months, the second would take 18 subjective months; or 9 external months, whereafter, four months, two months, and so on towards a speed singularity.&lt;ref name="singularity6"&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky, 1996 [http://www.yudkowsky.net/obsolete/singularity.html "Staring into the Singularity"]&lt;/ref&gt; An upper limit on speed may eventually be reached, although it is unclear how high this would be.
{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|2008}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--no such citation at end of article--&gt;, responding to Good, argued that the upper limit is relatively low;
{{quote|Belief in this idea is based on a naive understanding of what intelligence is. As an analogy, imagine we had a computer that could design new computers (chips, systems, and software) faster than itself. Would such a computer lead to infinitely fast computers or even computers that were faster than anything humans could ever build? No. It might accelerate the rate of improvements for a while, but in the end there are limits to how big and fast computers can be. We would end up in the same place; we'd just get there a bit faster. There would be no singularity.&lt;br&gt;Whereas if it were a lot higher than current human levels of intelligence, the effects of the singularity would be great enough as to be indistinguishable (to humans) from a singularity with an upper limit. For example, if the speed of thought could be increased a million-fold, a subjective year would pass in 30 physical seconds.&lt;ref name="singinst.org"/&gt;}}

It is difficult to directly compare [[silicon]]-based hardware with [[neuron]]s. But {{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}} notes that computer [[speech recognition]] is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude of being as powerful as the human brain.

====Exponential growth====
[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Ray Kurzweil writes that, due to [[paradigm shift]]s, a trend of exponential growth extends [[Moore's law]] from [[integrated circuits]] to earlier [[transistor]]s, [[vacuum tube]]s, [[relay]]s, and [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] computers. He predicts that the exponential growth will continue, and that in a few decades the computing power of all computers will exceed that of ("unenhanced") human brains, with superhuman [[artificial intelligence]] appearing around the same time.]]
[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|left|225px|An updated version of Moore's law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil’s]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]

The exponential growth in computing technology suggested by Moore's law is commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future, and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of Moore's law. Computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] proposed in a 1998 book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moravec, Hans|title=Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind|year=1999|publisher=Oxford U. Press|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fduW6KHhWtQC&amp;pg=PA61|isbn=978-0-19-513630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies prior to the [[integrated circuit]].

[[Ray Kurzweil]] postulates a [[law of accelerating returns]] in which the speed of technological change (and more generally, all evolutionary processes&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;) increases exponentially, generalizing Moore's law in the same manner as Moravec's proposal, and also including material technology (especially as applied to [[nanotechnology]]), [[Medical Technology|medical technology]] and others.&lt;ref name="singularity2"/&gt; Between 1986 and 2007, machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil reserves the term "singularity" for a rapid increase in artificial intelligence (as opposed to other technologies), writing for example that "The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine".&lt;ref name="singularity3"/&gt; He also defines his predicted date of the singularity (2045) in terms of when he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower, writing that advances in computing before that date "will not represent the Singularity" because they do "not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence."&lt;ref name="transformation"/&gt;

====Accelerating change====
{{Main|Accelerating change}}
[[Image:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg|thumb|right|195px|According to Kurzweil, his [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic graph]] of 15 lists of [[paradigm shift]]s for key [[human history|historic]] events shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] trend]]
Some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology. In one of the first uses of the term "singularity" in the context of technological progress, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] tells of a conversation with [[John von Neumann]] about accelerating change: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;ref name=mathematical/&gt;}}

Kurzweil claims that technological progress follows a pattern of [[exponential growth]], following what he calls the "[[law of accelerating returns]]". Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil writes, new technologies will surmount it. He predicts [[paradigm shift]]s will become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history".&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2001"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur by approximately [[Predictions made by Raymond Kurzweil#2045: The Singularity|2045]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Singularity Is Near''&lt;/ref&gt; His predictions differ from Vinge's in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather than Vinge's rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.

Oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology and [[genetic engineering]]. These threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics, and were the subject of [[Bill Joy]]'s ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine article "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]".&lt;ref name=chalmers /&gt;&lt;ref name="JoyFuture"/&gt;

=== Algorithm improvements ===
Some intelligence technologies, like "seed AI",&lt;ref name="Yampolskiy, Roman V 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; may also have the potential to make themselves more efficient, not just faster, by modifying their [[source code]]. These improvements would make further improvements possible, which would make further improvements possible, and so on.

The mechanism for a recursively self-improving set of algorithms differs from an increase in raw computation speed in two ways. First, it does not require external influence: machines designing faster hardware would still require humans to create the improved hardware, or to program factories appropriately.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} An AI which was rewriting its own source code, however, could do so while contained in an [[AI box]].

Second, as with [[Vernor Vinge]]’s conception of the singularity, it is much harder to predict the outcome. While speed increases seem to be only a quantitative difference from human intelligence, actual algorithm improvements would be qualitatively different. [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] compares it to the changes that human intelligence brought: humans changed the world thousands of times more rapidly than evolution had done, and in totally different ways. Similarly, the evolution of life had been a massive departure and acceleration from the previous geological rates of change, and improved intelligence could cause change to be as different again.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky"&gt;{{cite web|author=Eliezer S. Yudkowsky |url=http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/power |title=Power of Intelligence |publisher=Yudkowsky |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are substantial dangers associated with an intelligence explosion singularity originating from a recursively self-improving set of algorithms. First, the goal structure of the AI may not be invariant under self-improvement, potentially causing the AI to optimise for something other than was intended.&lt;ref name="selfawaresystems"&gt;[http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/ Omohundro, Stephen M., "The Basic AI Drives."

While not actively malicious, there is no reason to think that AIs would actively promote human goals unless they could be programmed as such, and if not, might use the resources currently used to support mankind to promote its own goals, causing human extinction.&lt;ref name="kurzweilai.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/max-more-and-ray-kurzweil-on-the-singularity-2 |title=Max More and Ray Kurzweil on the Singularity |publisher=KurzweilAI |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singinst.org/riskintro/index.html |title=Concise Summary &amp;#124; Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Singinst.org |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nickbostrom7"&gt;[http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html Bostrom, Nick, The Future of Human Evolution, Death and Anti-Death: Two Hundred Years After Kant, Fifty Years After Turing, ed.

[[Carl Shulman]] and [[Anders Sandberg]] suggest that algorithm improvements may be the limiting factor for a singularity because whereas hardware efficiency tends to improve at a steady pace, software innovations are more unpredictable and may be bottlenecked by serial, cumulative research. They suggest that in the case of a software-limited singularity, intelligence explosion would actually become more likely than with a hardware-limited singularity, because in the software-limited case, once human-level AI was developed, it could run serially on very fast hardware, and the abundance of cheap hardware would make AI research less constrained.&lt;ref name=ShulmanSandberg2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shulman|first=Carl|author2=Anders Sandberg |title=Implications of a Software-Limited Singularity|journal=ECAP10: VIII European Conference on Computing and Philosophy|year=2010|url=http://intelligence.org/files/SoftwareLimited.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2014|editor1-first=Klaus|editor1-last=Mainzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abundance of accumulated hardware that can be unleashed once the software figures out how to use it has been called "computing overhang."&lt;ref name=MuehlhauserSalamon2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment|year=2012|publisher=Springer|url=http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf|author2=Anna Salamon |editor=Amnon Eden |editor2=Johnny Søraker |editor3=James H. Moor |editor4=Eric Steinhart|chapter=Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Some critics, like philosopher [[Hubert Dreyfus]], assert that computers or machines can't achieve [[human intelligence]], while others, like physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], hold that the definition of intelligence is irrelevant if the net result is the same.&lt;ref name="dreyfus"/&gt;

Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] stated in 2008:
{{quote|... There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity. The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible. Look at domed cities, jet-pack commuting, underwater cities, mile-high buildings, and nuclear-powered automobiles—all staples of futuristic fantasies when I was a child that have never arrived. Sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems. ...&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org"/&gt;}}

[[University of California, Berkeley]], [[philosophy]] professor [[John Searle]] writes:
{{blockquote|[Computers] have, literally ..., no [[intelligence]], no [[motivation]], no [[autonomy]], and no agency.  We design them to behave as if they had certain sorts of [[psychology]], but there is no psychological reality to the corresponding processes or behavior. ...  [T]he machinery has no beliefs, desires, [or] motivations.&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]] in ''The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future''&lt;ref name="thelightsinthetunnel"/&gt; postulates a "technology paradox" in that before the singularity could occur most routine jobs in the economy would be automated, since this would require a level of technology inferior to that of the singularity. This would cause massive unemployment and plummeting consumer demand, which in turn would destroy the incentive to invest in the technologies that would be required to bring about the Singularity. Job displacement is increasingly no longer limited to work traditionally considered to be "routine."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

[[Theodore Modis]]&lt;ref name="google13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singularity Myth"/&gt; and [[Jonathan Huebner]]&lt;ref name="technological14"/&gt; argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. Evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer [[clock rate]]s is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold. This is due to excessive heat build-up from the chip, which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent the chip from melting when operating at higher speeds. Advancements in speed may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient CPU designs and multi-cell processors.&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; While Kurzweil used Modis' resources, and Modis' work was around accelerating change, Modis distanced himself from Kurzweil's thesis of a "technological singularity", claiming that it lacks scientific rigor.&lt;ref name="Singularity Myth"/&gt;

Others&lt;ref name="cliodynamics"/&gt; propose that other "singularities" can be found through analysis of trends in [[world population]], world [[gross domestic product]], and other indices. [[Andrey Korotayev]] and others argue that historical [[hyperbolic growth]] curves can be attributed to [[feedback loop]]s that ceased to affect global trends in the 1970s, and thus hyperbolic growth should not be expected in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=Andrey |year=2018 |title=The 21st Century Singularity and its Big History Implications: A re-analysis |url=https://www.academia.edu/36810724 |journal=Journal of Big History |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=71-118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LePoire D. Potential Economic and Energy Indicators of Inflection in Complexity. ''Evolution'' 3 (2013): 108–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a detailed empirical accounting, ''The Progress of Computing'', [[William Nordhaus]] argued that, prior to 1940, computers followed the much slower growth of a traditional industrial economy, thus rejecting extrapolations of Moore's law to 19th-century computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0022050707000058|title = Two Centuries of Productivity Growth in Computing| journal=The Journal of Economic History| volume=67|year = 2007|last1 = Nordhaus|first1 = William D.| citeseerx=10.1.1.330.1871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 paper, Schmidhuber stated that the frequency of subjectively "notable events" appears to be approaching a 21st-century singularity, but cautioned readers to take such plots of subjective events with a grain of salt: perhaps differences in memory of recent and distant events could create an illusion of accelerating change where none exists.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidhuber, Jürgen. "New millennium AI and the convergence of history." Challenges for computational intelligence. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007. 15–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Allen]] argues the opposite of accelerating returns, the complexity brake;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; the more progress science makes towards understanding intelligence, the more difficult it becomes to make additional progress.  A study of the number of patents shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact, as suggested by [[Joseph Tainter]] in his ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'',&lt;ref name="university"/&gt; a law of [[diminishing returns]]. The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850 to 1900, and has been declining since.&lt;ref name="technological14"/&gt;&lt;!--[Previous comment: is this from 'Collapse of Complex Societies' or some other source? Perhaps this refers to Jonathan Huebner's patent analysis mentioned in the earlier paragraph? If so, would be better to integrate this part with that paragraph, since the earlier paragraph mentions that Huebner's analysis has been criticized whereas this paragraph just seems to present it as fact --&gt; The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a widespread "general systems collapse".

[[Jaron Lanier]] refutes the idea that the Singularity is inevitable. He states: "I do not think the technology is creating itself. It's not an autonomous process."&lt;ref name="lanier"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jaron Lanier |title=Who Owns the Future? |work=New York: Simon &amp; Schuster |date=2013 |url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=JCB8D9LA&amp;tocp=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to assert: "The reason to believe in human agency over technological determinism is that you can then have an economy where people earn their own way and invent their own lives. If you structure a society on ''not'' emphasizing individual human agency, it's the same thing operationally as denying people clout, dignity, and self-determination ... to embrace [the idea of the Singularity] would be a celebration of bad data and bad politics."&lt;ref name="lanier" /&gt;

[[Economics|Economist]] [[Robert J. Gordon]], in ''The Rise and Fall of American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War'' (2016), points out that measured economic growth has slowed around 1970 and slowed even further since the [[financial crisis of 2008]], and argues that the economic data show no trace of a coming Singularity as imagined by mathematician [[I.J. Good]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William D. Nordhaus]], "Why Growth Will Fall" (a review of [[Robert J. Gordon]], ''The Rise and Fall of American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War'', Princeton University Press, 2016, {{ISBN|978-0691147727}}, 762 pp., $39.95), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 13 (August 18, 2016), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to general criticisms of the singularity concept, several critics have raised issues with Kurzweil's iconic chart. One line of criticism is that a [[Log-log plot|log-log]] chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line result. Others identify selection bias in the points that Kurzweil chooses to use. For example, biologist [[PZ Myers]] points out that many of the early evolutionary "events" were picked arbitrarily.&lt;ref name="PZMyers"/&gt; Kurzweil has rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources, and showing that they fit a straight line on [[:File:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg|a log-log chart]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' mocked the concept with a graph extrapolating that the number of blades on a razor, which has increased over the years from one to as many as five, will increase ever-faster to infinity.&lt;ref name="moreblades"/&gt;

==Impact==
Dramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because of some technological advancement. Based on population growth, the economy doubled every 250,000 years from the [[Paleolithic]] era until the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The new agricultural economy doubled every 900 years, a remarkable increase. In the current era, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the world’s economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster than during the agricultural era. If the rise of superhuman intelligence causes a similar revolution, argues Robin Hanson, one would expect the economy to double at least quarterly and possibly on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/robotics-software/economics-of-the-singularity |title= Economics Of The Singularity |accessdate=2008-09-11 |author= Robin Hanson |work=IEEE Spectrum Special Report: The Singularity }} &amp; [http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.pdf Long-Term Growth As A Sequence of Exponential Modes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncertainty and risk===
{{Further|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
The term "technological singularity" reflects the idea that such change may happen suddenly, and that it is difficult to predict how the resulting new world would operate.&lt;ref name="positive-and-negative"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theuncertainfuture"/&gt; It is unclear whether an intelligence explosion of this kind would be beneficial or harmful, or even an [[Existential risk|existential threat]],&lt;ref name="catastrophic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nickbostrom"/&gt; as the issue has not been dealt with by most [[artificial general intelligence]] researchers, although the topic of [[friendly artificial intelligence]] is investigated by the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] and the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]].&lt;ref name="positive-and-negative"/&gt;

===Next step of sociobiological evolution===
{{Further|Sociocultural evolution}}
[[File:Major Evolutionary Transitions digital.jpg|thumb|350px|Schematic Timeline of Information and Replicators in the Biosphere: Gillings et al.'s "[[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transitions]]" in information processing.&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016" /&gt;]]
[[File:Biological vs. digital information.jpg|thumb|Amount of digital information worldwide (5x10^21 bytes) versus human genome information worldwide (10^19 bytes) in 2014.&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016" /&gt;]]
While the technological singularity is usually seen as a sudden event, some scholars argue the current speed of change already fits this description.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

In addition, some argue that we are already in the midst of a [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transition]] that merges technology, biology, and society. Digital technology has infiltrated the fabric of human society to a degree of indisputable and often life-sustaining dependence.

A 2016 article in ''[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]]'' argues that "humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels... we trust [[artificial intelligence]] with our lives through [[Anti-lock braking system|antilock braking in cars]] and [[autopilot]]s in planes... With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction".

The article further argues that from the perspective of the [[evolution]], several previous [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|Major Transitions in Evolution]] have transformed life through innovations in information storage and replication ([[RNA]], [[DNA]], [[multicellularity]], and [[culture]] and [[language]]). In the current stage of life's evolution, the carbon-based biosphere has generated a [[cognitive system]] (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|evolutionary transition]].

The digital information created by humans has reached a similar magnitude to biological information in the biosphere. Since the 1980s, "the quantity of digital information stored has doubled about every 2.5 years, reaching about 5 zettabytes in 2014 (5x10^21 bytes).

In biological terms, there are 7.2 billion humans on the planet, each having a genome of 6.2 billion nucleotides. Since one byte can encode four nucleotide pairs, the individual genomes of every human on the planet could be encoded by approximately 1x10^19 bytes. The digital realm stored 500 times more information than this in 2014 (see fgure).

===Implications for human society===
{{further|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
In February 2009, under the auspices of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI), [[Eric Horvitz]] chaired a meeting of leading computer scientists, artificial intelligence researchers and roboticists at Asilomar in Pacific Grove, California. The goal was to discuss the potential impact of the hypothetical possibility that robots could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire [[autonomy]], and to what degree they could use such abilities to pose threats or hazards.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09" /&gt;

Some machines are programmed with various forms of semi-autonomy, including the ability to locate their own power sources and choose targets to attack with weapons. Also, some [[computer viruses]] can evade elimination and, according to scientists in attendance, could therefore be said to have reached a "cockroach" stage of machine intelligence. The conference attendees noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that other potential hazards and pitfalls exist.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential risk ===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
{{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}} claims that there is no direct evolutionary motivation for an AI to be friendly to humans. Evolution has no inherent tendency to produce outcomes valued by humans, and there is little reason to expect an arbitrary optimisation process to promote an outcome desired by mankind, rather than inadvertently leading to an AI behaving in a way not intended by its creators (such as Nick Bostrom's [[Paperclip maximizer|whimsical example]] of an AI which was originally programmed with the goal of manufacturing paper clips, so that when it achieves superintelligence it decides to convert the entire planet into a paper clip manufacturing facility).&lt;ref name="nickbostrom8"&gt;Nick Bostrom, [http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html "Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence"], in ''Cognitive, Emotive and Ethical Aspects of Decision Making in Humans and in Artificial Intelligence'', Vol. 2, ed. I. Smit et al., Int. Institute of Advanced Studies in Systems Research and Cybernetics, 2003, pp. 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="singinst"&gt;[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]: [http://singinst.org/upload/artificial-intelligence-risk.pdf Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611190606/http://singinst.org/upload/artificial-intelligence-risk.pdf |date=2012-06-11 }}.

[[Anders Sandberg]] has also elaborated on this scenario, addressing various common counter-arguments.&lt;ref name="aleph"&gt;[http://www.aleph.se/andart/archives/2011/02/why_we_should_fear_the_paperclipper.html 'Why we should fear the Paperclipper'], 2011-02-14 entry of Sandberg's blog 'Andart'&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher [[Hugo de Garis]] suggests that artificial intelligences may simply eliminate the human race for access to scarce resources,&lt;ref name="selfawaresystems.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="selfawaresystems10"&gt;[http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/ Omohundro, Stephen M., "The Basic AI Drives." Artificial General Intelligence, 2008 proceedings of the First AGI Conference, eds. Pei Wang, Ben Goertzel, and Stan Franklin. Vol. 171. Amsterdam: IOS, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; and humans would be powerless to stop them.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;de Garis, Hugo. [https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/18/cosmist-terran-cyborgist-opinions-contributors-artificial-intelligence-09-hugo-de-garis.html "The Coming Artilect War"], Forbes.com, 22 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, AIs developed under evolutionary pressure to promote their own survival could outcompete humanity.&lt;ref name="nickbostrom7" /&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2002}} discusses human extinction scenarios, and lists superintelligence as a possible cause:
{{quote|When we create the first superintelligent entity, we might make a mistake and give it goals that lead it to annihilate humankind, assuming its enormous intellectual advantage gives it the power to do so. For example, we could mistakenly elevate a subgoal to the status of a supergoal. We tell it to solve a mathematical problem, and it complies by turning all the matter in the solar system into a giant calculating device, in the process killing the person who asked the question.}}

A significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.&lt;ref name="singinst12"&gt;[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] proposed that research be undertaken to produce [[friendly artificial intelligence]] in order to address the dangers. He noted that the first real AI would have a head start on self-improvement and, if friendly, could prevent unfriendly AIs from developing, as well as providing enormous benefits to mankind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

It also proposed a simple design that was vulnerable to corruption of the reward generator.

One hypothetical approach towards attempting to control an artificial intelligence is an [[AI box]], where the artificial intelligence is kept constrained inside a [[Computer simulation|simulated world]] and not allowed to affect the external world. However, a sufficiently intelligent AI may simply be able to escape by outsmarting its less intelligent human captors.&lt;ref name="positive-and-negative"&gt;{{Citation|last=Yudkowsky |first=Eliezer |title=Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk |journal=Global Catastrophic Risks |editor-last=Bostrom |editor-first=Nick |editor2-last=Cirkovic |editor2-first=Milan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |url=http://singinst.org/AIRisk.pdf |bibcode=2008gcr..book..303Y |isbn=978-0-19-857050-9 |page=303 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807132337/http://www.singinst.org/AIRisk.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berglas"&gt;[http://berglas.org/Articles/AIKillGrandchildren/AIKillGrandchildren.html#mozTocId817119 Artificial Intelligence Will Kill Our Grandchildren (Singularity), Dr Anthony Berglas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophical"&gt;The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis David J. Chalmers&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Hawking]] said in 2014 that "Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks." Hawking believes that in the coming decades, AI could offer "incalculable benefits and risks" such as "technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand." Hawking believes more should be done to prepare for the singularity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence--but-are-we-taking-ai-seriously-enough-9313474.html |title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence - but are we taking AI seriously enough?'  |work=[[The Independent]] |author=[[Stephen Hawking]] |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, "We'll arrive in a few decades," would we just reply, "OK, call us when you get here – we'll leave the lights on"? Probably not – but this is more or less what is happening with AI.}}

==Hard vs. soft takeoff==
[[File:Recursive self-improvement.svg|thumb|320px|In this sample recursive self-improvement scenario, humans modifying an AI's architecture would be able to double its performance every three years through, for example, 30 generations before exhausting all feasible improvements (left). If instead the AI is smart enough to modify its own architecture as well as human researchers can, its time required to complete a redesign halves with each generation, and it progresses all 30 feasible generations in six years (right).&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk"&gt;[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]. "Artificial intelligence as a positive and negative factor in global risk." Global catastrophic risks (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In a hard takeoff scenario, an AGI rapidly self-improves, "taking control" of the world (perhaps in a matter of hours), too quickly for significant human-initiated error correction or for a gradual tuning of the AGI's goals. In a soft takeoff scenario, AGI still becomes far more powerful than humanity, but at a human-like pace (perhaps on the order of decades), on a timescale where ongoing human interaction and correction can effectively steer the AGI's development.&lt;ref&gt;Bugaj, Stephan Vladimir, and Ben Goertzel. "Five ethical imperatives and their implications for human-AGI interaction." Dynamical Psychology (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sotala, Kaj, and Roman V. Yampolskiy. "Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey." Physica Scripta 90.1 (2014): 018001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramez Naam]] argues against a hard takeoff by pointing out that we already see recursive self-improvement by superintelligences, such as corporations. For instance, Intel has "the collective brainpower of tens of thousands of humans and probably millions of CPU cores to.. design better CPUs!" However, this has not led to a hard takeoff; rather, it has led to a soft takeoff in the form of [[Moore's law]].&lt;ref name=Naam2014Further&gt;{{cite web|last=Naam|first=Ramez|title=The Singularity Is Further Than It Appears|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/the-singularity-is-further-tha.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naam further points out that the computational complexity of higher intelligence may be much greater than linear, such that "creating a mind of intelligence 2 is probably ''more'' than twice as hard as creating a mind of intelligence 1."&lt;ref name=Naam2014Ascend&gt;{{cite web|last=Naam|first=Ramez|title=Why AIs Won't Ascend in the Blink of an Eye - Some Math|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/why-ais-wont-ascend-in-blink-of-an-eye.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Storrs Hall]] believes that "many of the more commonly seen scenarios for overnight hard takeoff are circular – they seem to assume hyperhuman capabilities at the ''starting point'' of the self-improvement process" in order for an AI to be able to make the dramatic, domain-general improvements required for takeoff. Hall suggests that rather than recursively self-improving its hardware, software, and infrastructure all on its own, a fledgling AI would be better off specializing in one area where it was most effective and then buying the remaining components on the marketplace, because the quality of products on the marketplace continually improves, and the AI would have a hard time keeping up with the cutting-edge technology used by the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Hall2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=J. Storrs|title=Engineering Utopia|journal=Artificial General Intelligence, 2008: Proceedings of the First AGI Conference|date=2008|pages=460–467|url=http://www.agiri.org/takeoff_hall.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Goertzel]] agrees with Hall's suggestion that a new human-level AI would do well to use its intelligence to accumulate wealth. The AI's talents might inspire companies and governments to disperse its software throughout society. Goertzel is skeptical of a very hard, 5-minute takeoff but thinks a takeoff from human to superhuman level on the order of 5 years is reasonable. He calls this a "semihard takeoff".&lt;ref name="Goertzel2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goertzel|first1=Ben|title=Superintelligence — Semi-hard Takeoff Scenarios|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/09/26/superintelligence-semi-hard-takeoff-scenarios/|accessdate=25 October 2014|agency=h+ Magazine|date=26 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max More]] disagrees, arguing that if there were only a few superfast human-level AIs, they wouldn't radically change the world, because they would still depend on other people to get things done and would still have human cognitive constraints. Even if all superfast AIs worked on intelligence augmentation, it's not clear why they would do better in a discontinuous way than existing human cognitive scientists at producing super-human intelligence, although the rate of progress would increase. More also argues that a superintelligence would not transform the world overnight, because a superintelligence would need to engage with existing, slow human systems to accomplish physical impacts on the world. "The need for collaboration, for organization, and for putting ideas into physical changes will ensure that all the old rules are not thrown out overnight or even within years."&lt;ref name=More&gt;{{cite web|last1=More|first1=Max|title=Singularity Meets Economy|url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/vc.html#more|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immortality==
In his 2005 book, ''The Singularity is Near'', [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] suggests that medical advances would allow people to protect their bodies from the effects of aging, making the life expectancy limitless. Kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine would allow us to continuously repair and replace defective components in our bodies, prolonging life to an undetermined age.&lt;ref&gt;''The Singularity Is Near'', p.215,&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. Kurzweil suggests [[somatic gene therapy]]; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Singularity is Near'', p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[biological machine]]s, in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]].

According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines. Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond merely extending the operational life of the physical body, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues for a form of immortality called "Digital Ascension" that involves "people dying in the flesh and being uploaded into a computer and remaining conscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto|titlelink=You are Not a Gadget|last = Lanier|first = Jaron|authorlink=Jaron Lanier|publisher = [[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year = 2010|isbn = 0307269647|location = New York|page = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
In his 1958 obituary for [[John von Neumann]], Ulam recalled a conversation with von Neumann about the "ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue."&lt;ref name=mathematical/&gt;

In 1965, Good wrote his essay postulating an "intelligence explosion" of recursive self-improvement of a machine intelligence. 

In 1981, [[Stanisław Lem]] published his [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Golem XIV]]''. It describes a military AI computer (Golem XIV) who obtains consciousness and starts to increase his own intelligence, moving towards personal technological singularity. Golem XIV was originally created to aid its builders in fighting wars, but as its intelligence advances to a much higher level than that of humans, it stops being interested in the military requirement because it finds them lacking internal logical consistency.

In 1983, [[Vernor Vinge]] greatly popularized Good's intelligence explosion in a number of writings, first addressing the topic in print in the January 1983 issue of ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine. In this op-ed piece, Vinge seems to have been the first to use the term "singularity" in a way that was specifically tied to the creation of intelligent machines:&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="technological"/&gt;
writing
{{quote|We will soon create intelligences greater than our own. When this happens, human history will have reached a kind of singularity, an intellectual transition as impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole, and the world will pass far beyond our understanding. This singularity, I believe, already haunts a number of science-fiction writers. It makes realistic extrapolation to an interstellar future impossible. To write a story set more than a century hence, one needs a nuclear war in between ... so that the world remains intelligible.}}

In 1985, in "The Time Scale of Artificial Intelligence", artificial intelligence researcher [[Ray Solomonoff]] articulated mathematically the related notion of what he called an "infinity point": if a research community of human-level self-improving AIs take four years to double their own speed, then two years, then one year and so on, their capabilities increase infinitely in finite time.&lt;ref name=chalmers /&gt;&lt;ref name="std"/&gt;

Vinge's 1993 article "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era",&lt;ref name="vinge1993" /&gt; spread widely on the internet and helped to popularize the idea.&lt;ref name="google5"/&gt; This article contains the statement, "Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended." Vinge argues that science-fiction authors cannot write realistic post-singularity characters who surpass the human intellect, as the thoughts of such an intellect would be beyond the ability of humans to express.&lt;ref name="vinge1993" /&gt;

In 2000, [[Bill Joy]], a prominent technologist and a co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], voiced concern over the potential dangers of the singularity.&lt;ref name="JoyFuture"/&gt;

In 2005, Kurzweil published ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''. Kurzweil's publicity campaign included an appearance on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''.&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt;

In 2007, [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] suggested that many of the varied definitions that have been assigned to "singularity" are mutually incompatible rather than mutually supporting.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, Anders. "An overview of models of technological singularity." Roadmaps to AGI and the Future of AGI Workshop, Lugano, Switzerland, March. Vol. 8. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kurzweil extrapolates current technological trajectories past the arrival of self-improving AI or superhuman intelligence, which Yudkowsky argues represents a tension with both I. J. Good's proposed discontinuous upswing in intelligence and Vinge's thesis on unpredictability.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky.net"/&gt;

In 2009, Kurzweil and [[X-Prize]] founder [[Peter Diamandis]] announced the establishment of [[Singularity University]], a nonaccredited private institute whose stated mission is "to educate, inspire and empower leaders to apply exponential technologies to address humanity's grand challenges."&lt;ref name="singularityu"/&gt; Funded by [[Google]], [[Autodesk]], [[ePlanet Ventures]], and a group of [[High tech|technology industry]] leaders, Singularity University is based at [[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Center]] in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California]]. The not-for-profit organization runs an annual ten-week graduate program during summer that covers ten different technology and allied tracks, and a series of executive programs throughout the year.

==In politics==
In 2007, the joint Economic Committee of the [[United States Congress]] released a report about the future of nanotechnology. It predicts significant technological and political changes in the mid-term future, including possible technological singularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyp1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA375|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society|first=David H.|last=Guston|date=14 July 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6617-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/20120213_TheFutureisComingSoonerThanYouThink.pdf | title=Nanotechnology: The Future is Coming Sooner Than You Think | publisher=Joint Economic Committee | date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2007/03/congress_and_th.html|title=Congress and the Singularity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former President of the United States [[Barack Obama]] spoke about singularity in his interview to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' in 2016:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/|title=Barack Obama Talks AI, Robo Cars, and the Future of the World|first=Scott|last=Dadich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=One thing that we haven't talked about too much, and I just want to go back to, is we really have to think through the economic implications. Because most people aren't spending a lot of time right now worrying about singularity—they are worrying about "Well, is my job going to be replaced by a machine?"}}

"So we will be producing about 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; cps of nonbiological computation per year in the early 2030s. This is roughly equal to our estimate for the capacity of all living biological human intelligence ... This state of computation in the early 2030s will not represent the Singularity, however, because it does not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence. By the mid-2040s, however, that one thousand dollars' worth of computation will be equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; cps, so the intelligence created per year (at a total cost of about $10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) will be about one billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today. That ''will'' indeed represent a profound change, and it is for that reason that I set the date for the Singularity—representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability—as 2045."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Multiple'' tests of [[artificial intelligence|artificial-intelligence]] efficacy are needed because, "just as there is no single test of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletic]] prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of [[intelligence]]."  One such test, a "Construction Challenge", would test perception and physical action—"two important elements of intelligent behavior that were entirely absent from the original [[Turing test]]."  Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take.  A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways."  A prominent example is known as the "pronoun disambiguation problem":  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.

'''Time-out''' is a form of behavioral modification that involves temporarily separating a person from an environment where unacceptable behavior has occurred. The goal is to remove that person from an enriched, enjoyable environment, and therefore lead to [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] of the offending behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 23881717|title = Is Isolation Room Time-Out a Punisher?|journal = Behavioral Disorders|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 247–256|last1 = Smith|first1 = Donald E. P|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an educational and [[parenting]] technique recommended by most [[pediatrician]]s and [[developmental psychologist]]s as an effective form of [[discipline]]. Often a corner (hence the common term ''corner time'') or a similar space where the person is to stand or sit during time-outs is designated. This form of discipline is especially popular in western cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publisher|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the punishment is often known as the '''naughty chair''' or '''naughty step'''. This term became popular in the US thanks to two reality TV series, ''[[Supernanny]]'' and ''[[Nanny 911]]''.

==History==
The concept of time-out was invented,{{dubious|reason=what chance is there that there have been fewer than thousands (at the very least, and perhaps millions) of prior independent inventions of the core practice?|date=October 2018}} named, and used (see Child Magazine, 2006, "20 People who Changed Childhood"&lt;ref name="20 People Who Changed Childhood"&gt;{{cite article|title= 20 People Who Changed Childhood|author=R. Straus|date=October 2006|pages=107–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by [[Arthur W. Staats]] in his extended work with his daughter (and later son), and was part of a long-term program of behavioral analysis beginning in 1958 that treated various aspects of child development. He introduced various elements that later composed foundations for applied behavior analysis and behavior therapy. (The [[token reward system]] was another invention by him.) [[Montrose Wolf]], a graduate student assistant of Staats on several studies dealing with reading learning in preschoolers (see, for example, "The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers"&lt;ref name=" The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers"&gt;{{cite article|title= The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers|author=Staats, A.W.; Staats, C.K.; Schultz, R.E.; Wolf, M.|date=1962|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;), used that background when he went to the [[University of Washington]] where he began his creative program of research. Wolf began the widespread use of Staats' time-out procedure in extending training methods to an autistic child (see the 1964 published study dealing with the behavioral treatment of a child).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1226164 | pmid=16033175 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2005.165-04 | volume=38 | issue=2 | title=Montrose M. Wolf (1935-2004) | year=2005 | journal=J Appl Behav Anal | pages=279–87 | last1 = Risley | first1 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1404175&amp;blobtype=pdf | pmc = 1404175 | pmid=13916029 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1962.5-33 | volume=5 | title=The conditioning of textual responses using &amp;quot;extrinsic&amp;quot; reinforcers | year=1962 | journal=J Exp Anal Behav | pages=33–40 | last1 = Staats | first1 = AW | last2 = Staats | first2 = CK | last3 = Schutz | first3 = RE | last4 = Wolf | first4 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats described the discipline of his 2-year-old daughter in 1962: "I would put her in her crib and indicate that she had to stay there until she stopped crying. If we were in a public place [where her behavior was inappropriate], I would pick her up and go outside."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Strauss, "Twenty People Who Changed Childhood," ''Child'' magazine, October 2006, pp107-110.&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Application ==
For Staats, the timeout period was ended when the child's misbehavior, such as crying inappropriately, ended. He considered removal from a positive emotional environment to one of lesser positivity as a very mild punishment. Various people have added their opinions regarding time-out as the following indicates.

Time out is a type two [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment procedure]] and is used commonly in schools, colleges, offices, clinics and homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = Tera L. | last2 = McLaughlin | first2 = T. F. | last3 = Lee Williams | first3 = Randy | year = 2006 | title = Time-out interventions and strategies: A brief review and recommendations | url = | journal = International Journal of Special Education | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 22–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To implement time out, a caregiver removes the child from a reinforcing activity for a short period of time, usually 5 to 15 minutes, in order to discourage inappropriate behavior and teach the child that engaging in problem behavior will result in decreased access to reinforcing items and events in the child's environment.

Time-outs may be on a chair, step, corner, bedroom, or any other location where there are no distractions and reduced access to fun items, activities and people.  This procedure is preferable to other punishments such as reprimanding, yelling at or spanking the child for their misbehavior, which are type one punishments ([[positive punishment]]).

Research has established that 15 minutes is the maximum time that a child should be kept in time out from reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = G. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = S. M. | year = 1972 | title = TIMEOUT DURATION AND THE SUPPRESSION OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR IN CHILDREN1 | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 111–120 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1972.5-111| pmc = 1310739 | pmid=16795328}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shorter durations may be just as effective for behavior change.

For this disciplinary technique to be most effective and to produce the desired results, the child should be old enough to sit still and is required to remain there for a fixed period. Also, according to developmental psychologists, parents should evaluate each situation to determine what may be causing the misbehavior, such as a toy, frustration, hunger, or lack of sleep, and then address any underlying needs before a punishment contingency should be used. Any time they are trying to reduce a problem behavior, parents should be sure that they are also teaching and reinforcing the desired replacement behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Discipline and Effective Parenting|last = Flaskerud|first = Jacquelyn H.|date = 2011|journal = Issues in Mental Health Nursing|accessdate = |doi = 10.3109/01612840.2010.498078|pmid =21208055|volume=32|issue = 1|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents should also clearly explain why the child is being put in time out, and what the child needs to do to return to the reinforcing environment/be let out of time-out (but too much explanation can reinforce the unwanted behavior as a result of "misplaced adult attention"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200109/why-our-kids-are-out-control ''Psychology Today'' September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;). Furthermore, the renown developmental psychologist Kathleen Stassen Berger suggests that time-out should remain brief, proposing a general guideline: the length of time that the child should remain in time-out should correlate with the child's age - each of year of the child's age constitutes one minute in time-out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Time-out is one behavior control method based on removing [[positive reinforcement]] for a brief time.  Less elaborate methods from the same class like [[tactical ignoring]], or planned ignoring, also can be effective in cases where parental/caregiver attention is the positive reinforcement for negative behavior. This class of methods are more effective if the child gets a significant amount positive reinforcement (praise, attention) for good behavior. All punishment procedures can evoke other problem behaviors, damage rapport, or evoke escape or avoidant behaviors. For this, and other ethical reasons, behavior analysts exhaust all options for using differential reinforcement and/or [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] procedures to reduce problem behavior, before considering the use of punishment procedures.

==Effectiveness==
Several studies show that time-out is an especially effective disciplinary strategy, reducing aggressive and non-compliant behavior, when other positive parenting methods are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Parental Use of Time Out Revisited: A Useful or Harmful Parenting Strategy?|last = Morawska|first = Alina|date = February 2011|journal = Journal of Child and Family Studies|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time out must be linked with "time in" in order to be effective because children need to be able to find reinforcement through positive experiences.

There are differences between strategies for ending time out. While some proponents of time-outs insist on silence and stillness from the child during the time-out, it is easier to use a "release-contingency," such that the requirement is only that the child is sitting peacefully at the end of the time-out period. Those who use time-out for children to get anger and frustration "out of their system" or for children to think about their behavior are using time-out in a way that is different than those basing it on operant behavioral principles (that time-out from positive reinforcement may reduce recurrences of the unwanted target behavior).

In a study by Donaldson and Vollmer, the efficacy of a fixed duration time-out and a release contingency time-out were compared. In the fixed duration condition, children were sent to time-out for a total of 4 minutes and were released from time-out whether or not they performed problem behavior during the time-out session. In the release contingency condition, children were not released from time-out if they were performing problem behavior during the last 30 seconds of their time-out. The time-out was extended until there were no occurrences of problem behavior for a total of 30 seconds or until the time-out reached the ten-minute mark. Results showed that both time-out procedures were successful in reducing the problem behavior for the subjects. The subjects in the release contingency did not benefit from staying in time-out for an extended period of time either. Moreover, the results show that only 4 minutes is necessary for a successful time-out procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Vollmer | first2 = T. R. | year = 2011 | title = An evaluation and comparison of time-out procedures with and without release contingencies | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 693–705 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2011.44-693 | pmid=22219523 | pmc=3251275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of time-out also varies with each individual child, dependent on the child's age, temperament and emotional wellness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Critics of time-out include [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], [[Gabor Maté (physician)|Gabor Mate]], [[Alfie Kohn]] and [[Aletha Solter]], who claim that the approach may lead to short-term compliance but has the same disadvantages as other forms of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, T. (2000). Parent Effectiveness Training: The Proven Program for Raising Responsible Children. New York, NY: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2005). Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason. New York, NY: Atria Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1989). Helping Young Children Flourish. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2013). Attachment Play. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2002). The disadvantages of time-out. http://www.awareparenting.com/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seasoned teachers say 'Time-outs only seem to work at first because of shock value and over time it becomes less effective.' http://afineparent.com/be-positive/effective-discipline.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to these authors, the use of time-out does not enhance moral behavior or teach children useful conflict-resolution skills and it fails to address the underlying cause of the behavior. Furthermore, they claim that the parent/child bond can be damaged by forced isolation and withdrawal of love in an effort to control a child's behavior and this can lead to feelings of insecurity or anxiety in children, though there is no evidence that this occurs. Another argument is that time-out, like all other methods of [[coercive control]], eventually stops working as children grow older and begin to rebel against their parents’ authoritarian approach to discipline.

In addition to the potential psychological drawbacks resulting from the use of time-out, there also appears to be a risk to the child's developing brain, according to research in neuroscience by [[Daniel J. Siegel]]. “In a brain scan, relational pain (that caused by isolation during punishment) can look the same as physical abuse,” and “Repeated experiences actually change the physical structure of the brain.”&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, D.J. and Bryson, T.P. (September 23, 2014). ‘Time-Outs’ Are Hurting Your Child. Time Magazine online. http://time.com/3404701/discipline-time-out-is-not-good/&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dr. Siegel backed away from this statement and claimed that Time Magazine distorted his message. He later clarified, "The “appropriate” use of time-outs calls for brief, infrequent, previously explained breaks from an interaction used as part of a thought-out parenting strategy that is followed by positive feedback and connection with a parent. This seems not only reasonable, but it is an overall approach supported by the research as helpful for many children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drdansiegel.com/blog/2014/10/29/you-said-what-about-time-outs/|title=You Said WHAT About Time-Outs?! {{!}} Dr. Dan Siegel|website=www.drdansiegel.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Association for Infant Mental Health has published a position statement in which the use of time-out is considered inappropriate, especially for children under three years of age, which matches with most professional advice.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Association for Infant Mental Health (July 2009): Position Pager 3: Time Out. {{cite web |url=http://www.aaimhi.org/inewsfiles/Position%20Paper%203.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908074504/http://www.aaimhi.org/inewsfiles/Position%20Paper%203.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of time-out needs to be carefully considered in families dealing with special challenges. In a review of parenting intervention programs for drug-abusing mothers, researchers found that programs emphasizing behavioral approaches to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) “were not successful in fostering measurable improvement in mother-child interactions or promoting child development.” An attachment-based approach focusing on strengthening the parent/child relationship was found to be more successful than behavioral approaches in changing children's behavior in these families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suchman | first1 =  | last2 = Pajulo | first2 = M. | last3 = DeCoste | first3 = C. | last4 = Mayes | first4 = L.C. | year = 2006 | title = Parenting Interventions for Drug-Dependent Mothers and Their Young Children: The Case for an Attachment-Based Approach | journal = Family Relations | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 211–226 | pmc=1847954 | pmid=17417669 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2006.00371.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found that the traditional behavioral approach to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) can be challenging with children in foster care with attachment disorders resulting from early abuse or neglect. Foster parents benefit from training that addresses these children's attachment and emotional issues, as wells as traditional parenting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wotherspoon | first1 = E. | last2 = O'Neill-Laberge | first2 = M. | last3 = Pirie | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Meeting the emotional needs of infants and toddlers in foster care: the collaborative mental health care experience | url = | journal = Infant Mental Health Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 377–397 | doi = 10.1002/imhj.20185 | pmid = 28636157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time-out has been misused to the point of becoming abusive in some schools and so proper training for educational professionals is important. There are reported cases of children being locked in closets for extended periods of solitary confinement for behaviors such as crying or failing to finish an assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, I. (1990). Child abusers' destructive use of 'time-out'. From Reading, Writing and the Hickory Stick, pp. 139-140, 12-13. http://www.nospank.net/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some experts call school time-out rooms 'abuse.' http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-10-20-time-out-discipline_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These are not examples of appropriate use of time-out.

[[Image:A vihangamyoga.jpg|thumb|Logo of Vihangam Yoga]]

'''''Vihangam Yoga''''' is  an ancient meditation technique practiced by [[India]]n seers and [[Wise old man|sages]]. In the current time, it is established by [[Sadguru Sadafaldeo Ji Maharaj]]. Vihangam Yoga is also known as ''[[Brahmavidya]]'', ''[[Madhu-vidya]]'', ''Para Vidhya'' in the Indian ancient most scriptures and [[Veda]]s. "''Vihangam''" literally means "bird". Just as a bird leaves its base on the earth to fly high in the sky, so does ''Vihangam Yoga'' enable the human Soul ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atma]]) to cut off its moorings in the [[Prakriti]] (phenomenal world) and realize its true and free nature .{{according to whom|date=August 2014}} 
This knowledge is emerged from Brahma so it is also named as Brahma Vidya and who ever has gained this knowledge by practising it called Brahma Rishi. Through the Vihangam Yoga meditation, one easily raises his soul's energy to open "Kundalini shakti" (the hidden Potential in all of us) under the able guidance of a true Sadguru and attains Soul's conscious state, from where it actually starts the prayer to "Supreme Soul". This is a situation where the soul is in its own state i.e. it is not attached with Mann (Mind) and Prana&amp;nbsp;– the true form.{{elucidate|date=August 2014}}

==Introduction to Vihangam Yoga==
Vihangam means a bird. As a bird floats in the air overcoming the gravitational force of the earth, so does the consciousness of the Atma float in the limitless space of pure consciousness leaving behind its physical base i.e. body, mind and intellect. To distinguish it from various prevalent physical, mental and spiritual practices, which also go by the name of Yoga, the Vedic Yoga is called Vihangam Yoga or [[Sahaja Yoga]].

In Vihangam Yoga the mind is lifted to its source, the Akshara Brahma where it is permanently quietened, just like a river losing its identity in the ocean. Once the soul is freed from bondage of the mind, it realises its true nature and stops identifying itself with the human body. In fact, the soul then acts as the master and guides the mind and the body in the way it likes. Having realised the futility of worldly pleasures, derived through the sense organs and their objects, it soars higher in search of the Absolute Bliss ([[Paramananda]]). It is then only that the real meditation of Vihangam Yoga starts, terminating in [[Samādhi]], the ultimate aim of Yoga of meeting with the Supreme Soul. In this state the soul has attained liberation while residing in the body itself (Jivanmukti).{{attribution needed|date=August 2014}}

The literal meaning of the word 'Yoga' is union. Vihangam Yoga is defined as the union of [[Atma (Hinduism)|Atma]] with [[Paramatma]]. This union is achieved after Atma frees itself from the shackles of the mind and intellect and attains its pure conscious state. The Supreme Soul is a purely conscious entity and is beyond the reach of the mind and intellect. The mind and intellect are inert by themselves and are activated by the consciousness of the soul. An inert object cannot reach a conscious entity, far less unite with or merge in it. Therefore, the physical yogas cannot reach the ideal of Vihangam Yoga.

This [[yoga]] was also taught to Arjuna by the Lord [[Krishna]] In the celebrated Hindu Scripture Bhagwad Gita during the Mahabharata period, some five thousand years ago. This has called Brahma Vidya in the Gita and the Upanishads.{{attribution needed|date=August 2014}}

The divine knowledge of Vihangam Yoga disappeared gradually after the Mahabharata period. It was revived by the real mystic saint, Kabir, more than five hundred years ago.{{attribution needed|date=August 2014}}

In recent times it was rediscovered by the great [[Swami Sadafal Deoji Maharaj]] of village Pakari of [[Ballia District]] of Indian state [[Uttar Pradesh]] (U.P.).The entire knowledge that he gained in the state, of Samadhi of Vihangam Yoga has been described fully and systematically by him in his unique spiritual work SWARVEDA, a book of couplets describing all aspects of spiritual practice in simple language. A detailed commentary has been written by his successor and son, [[Acharya Dharam Chandra Deoji Maharaj]], and had been published from Adhyatmic Yantralaya, [[Garhwar]]; District Ballia, U.P.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Vihangam yogis of today are verifying the experiences described therein just in the same way as was done during the Vedic period.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Modern science vis-à-vis Vihangam Yoga==
Modern science believes in objects perceived by sense organs with or without the help of various gadgets. Human sense organs are bound by severe limitations. The eyes and ears can see and hear only within a limited spectrum. Scientists discovered, an eagle's eye or a dog's ears can see or hear beyond human capabilities (ref. [[Eagle eye]] and [[Hearing range]]). This holds good for other sense organs like those of smell, taste or touch. With the help instruments, which are being invented from time to time, man has been able to extend his perception beyond natural human mind and intellect have also made deductions from certain phenomena occurring in the world. This has led to formulation of many hypotheses from time to time. These hypotheses have been changing since the dawn of civilization and will keep on changing till man is able to realize the truth. The modern scientists have observed that the universe is continuously expanding and this expansion is thought to be due to the process of creation of the universe. The scientists say that the universe will ultimately cease to expand and then the gravitational force will play its role to reduce it again to a cosmic egg (The Theory of [[Big Bang]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The scientists have put forward the theory of oscillating universe, which states that the cycles of creation and, dissolution will continue endlessly, a well-known Indian concept. What they call 'Cosmic egg' has been termed by the ancient Indian seers as Mool Prakriti, which is said to be composed of three basic substances, viz. Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas. These three substances combine in different proportions during creation giving rise to a variety of physical objects. This is analogous to the scientific knowledge that the atoms, which the physical objects are composed of, consist of three fundamental particles known as electrons, protons and neutrons and atoms of one object differ from those of the other only in the number and combination of these fundamental particles.

According to modern science the basic forces are four, viz. gravitational, electromagnetic and the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force, which influence motion in particles and bodies and determine the interrelation among them. What is the origin of these forces? What is that which causes explosion in the cosmic egg? Is there a ruling power, which regulates the movement of stars and the galaxies in this universe whose vastness could be imagined by the presumption (based on no evidence at all) that there are galaxies so far away that light, traveling at the speed of three hundred thousand kilometers per second, has not yet reached our earth? The scientific method shows the most promise for finding answers to these questions; certainly more so than ancient fantasy-based mysticism.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Our sages of vote have discovered answers to these queries. The technique they employed was basically different from that used by the scientists, and therefore more a development of philosophy than a description of physical reality. Unlike the scientists, they neither attempted to develop equipment to bring the universe within the perceiving powers of their sense organs, nor did they invent super computers powerful enough to aid their mental faculties. On the contrary, the ancient spiritualists, rejecting investigation into how the universe actually works, mastered a technique of withdrawing the flow of consciousness from the senses, mind, and intellect and thus, supposedly, realized "the pure conscious form of their real selves". The pure conscious form of an individual is called Atma or the Self, and the state in which it that the Atma(soul) is realized is called Samadhi(deep meditation) . They discovered that Atma when freed from the bondage of body and mind has great potential power much beyond the concept of modern science. The knowledge gained after dissociating the conscious self from the phenomenal world in the state of Samadhi was verified over and over again for a long span of time by a number of great seers, called Rishis. They handed down their observations to their followers, generation after generation. These observations are codified in the four Vedas and they have not been improved upon or falsified by modern scientists. In fact, the more the science progresses, the more does it come nearer to the recordings in the Vedas.{{nonspecific|date=August 2014}}

The Vedic [[Rishi]]s experienced during their Samadhi, a primordial Being, supremely conscious and superbly blissful. It is called Parama Akshara, Parama Brahma or Paramatma. When the Atma unites itself with the Paramatma, it is able to imbibe the qualities of Paramatma. An iron ball put in the fire of a furnace becomes a glowing red mass of fire itself. Similarly, when the finitely conscious Atma merges with the infinitely conscious Paramatma, it becomes an all-knowing entity and thus acquires the complete knowledge of the entire existence.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The technique of achieving the union of Atma and Paramatma is called Yoga in the Vedic sense of the term (yoga literally means union). To distinguish it from various prevalent physical, mental and spiritual practices, which also go by the name of Yoga, the Vedic yoga is called Vihangam Yoga or Sahaja Yoga. It was this yoga that Lord Krishna taught to Arjuna In the celebrated work [[Bhagwad Gita]] during the [[Mahabharata]] period, some five thousand years ago. This has called Brahma Vidya in the [[Gita]] and the [[Upanishads]]. The divine knowledge of Vihangam Yoga disappeared gradually after the Mahabharata period. The real mystic saint, Kabir, revived it more than five hundred years ago. In recent times the great Swami Sadafal Deoji Maharaj of village Pakari of Ballia District of U.P rediscovered it. The entire knowledge that he gained in the state, of Samadhi of Vihangam Yoga has been described fully and systematically by him in his unique spiritual work SWARVEDA, a book of couplets describing all aspects of spiritual practice in simple language. A detailed commentary has been written by his successor and son, Acharya Dharam Chandra Deoji Maharaj, and had been published from Adhyatmic Yantralaya, Garhwar; District Ballia, U.P. The Vihangam yogis of today are verifying the experiences described therein just in the same way as was done during the Vedic period.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==The Six Fundamental Entities==
"REFER SWARVEDA A SPIRITUAL ENCYCLOPEDIA"
The basic eternal existences are six in number. They are, Paramatma or Parama Purusha (the Supreme Being), Akshara Brahma (the Cosmic Executor), Atma (the Soul), Nitya Anadi Sadguru (the Eternal Spiritual Guide), Prakriti (Nature) and Kaal (Time concept).{{according to whom|date=August 2014}} As they are eternal, there was never a time when they did not exist and there will never be a time when they will cease to exist, and thus they have no beginning and no end.

The first four of the above entities are- conscious or sentient while the last two, viz. Prakriti and Kaal are insentient. The conscious beings are those, which possess the faculties of knowledge, desire and action. Of the two insentient entities, devoid of these faculties, Prakriti is inert and Kaal is neither conscious nor inert.
The forms and characteristics of the six eternal entities have been described in detail in the great spiritual work 'SWARVEDA' of Sadguru Sadafal Deo Ji Maharaj. A brief description of each of these entities is presented.

==The Supreme, Being (Parama Purusha)==
The supreme&amp;nbsp;– Being (Parama Purusha) is omniscient, omnipotent and the base of
everything that exists. He is also known as Supreme Soul (Paramatma), Supreme
Brahma (Para Brahma), and Supreme Word (Sar Shabda) and by various other
names. He has been described as Sat-chit-ananda i.e. one who is eternally
existent, infinitely conscious and supremely blissful.{{vague|date=August 2014}} He is the subtlest of all the
subtle and pervades every substance, every soul and the entire universe. He is the
internal soul of all the souls. The universe exists in only one-fourth of Him.{{vague|date=August 2014}} The
remaining three-fourths is pure nectarine bliss. He is eternal, unchangeable and
inexpressible. He has been called the Supreme Word or the Unique Light in the
Vedas. He is the Lord, the Support, the illuminer, the Regulator and the Witness of
each and every activity in the universe.{{vague|date=August 2014}}

==Cosmic executor (Akshara Brahma)==
That which creates, sustains and dissolves the universe is Akshara Brahma. All the physical forces as well as mind and Pranas (the life forces) originate from Akshara Brahma. Scientifically speaking, the Akshara Brahma is responsible for 'big bang' in the 'cosmic egg' from which the process of creation starts. The motion in particles is imparted by it. As a matter of fact, all the activities in the world are solely due to it. It is thus the preserver of the world. When the Akshara Brahma withdraws its forces, all the motions cease and the universe collapses to a point, the cosmic egg of modem science. That is what we call dissolution. Like the Supreme Being, it is also eternal unchangeable and pervades the whole universe. It functions under the command of the Supreme Being and is and is confined to one-fourth of Him, where the creation, regulation and dissolution of the universe take place.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Soul (Atma)==
There is only one Supreme Brahma. There is only one Akshara Brahma as well. But the- souls are innumerable. Though bliss is not the intrinsic quality of a Soul, it possesses the other two qualities like those of the Supreme Being, viz. eternal existence and consciousness. However, there are two, basic differences between the two. Firstly, the consciousness of a soul is limited whereas that of the Supreme Soul is unlimited.{{vague|date=August 2014}} Secondly, while the Paramatma remains in one and the same form with its consciousness not undergoing any change, the consciousness of a soul attains different levels in the six states it is known to exist.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The six states in one of which a soul exists are Hansa Deha (super-conscious state), Kaivalya Deha (conscious state), Mahakarana Deha (prime causal state), Karana Deha (causal state), Sukshma Deha (subtle body) and Sthoola Deha (gross body). The Atma is capable of associating itself with Paramatma. In the association of Paramatma the soul's consciousness increases infinitely and at the same time it is a supreme bliss of His. It thus acquires all the qualities of Supreme Being. This is the super conscious state of Atma. In this state there is likelihood that a soul may delude itself to be identical with the Supreme Being. This deluded state of the soul is called its Kaivalya state.

'''A soul is always a soul it never becomes Brahma'''. A piece of iron fallen in fire becomes red and starts glowing like it. But soon as it is taken out of fire, it gradually loses its qualities of fire and becomes an iron piece again. Kaivalya state meets with a similar fate. As soon as the ego of I am Brahma crops up in the soul, it no longer cares to remain in the zone of nectarine bliss and tends to move towards the zone of creation. When this tendency becomes firm, the soul is said to be in the prime causal state, and finally when it actually enters the zone of creation, it attains the causal state. When it wishes to enjoy worldly pleasures, it acquires a subtle body, which enters into the mother's womb through male and female union and comes out in the manifested world in a gross body.

The gross body is equipped with five sense organs (viz. ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose) to receive sensations of sound, touch, form, taste and odour and five organs of actions (viz. tongue, hands, feet, genital and anus) to perform the functions of speech, grasp, motion, reproduction and excretion. In addition, there are four inner organs, viz. mind, intellect, Chitta and ego. Of these fourteen organs mind is the most important, since it activates and controls all other organs it is the mind through which the consciousness of the soul flows in different organs of the body. The intellect is endowed with discriminating power. The memories of past actions and various desires and tendencies of the soul are impressed on the Chitta. The ego is responsible for the constant feeling of 'I am the doer' in all actions that one performs. To provide energy to the body and its various organs for their proper functioning, five life forces, called Pranas act incessantly in the body. These life forces are Prana (respiration), Vyana (blood circulation), Samana (digestion), Apana (excretion) and Udana. The last one provides the energy for transplanting the subtle body in the mother's womb and also for separating the, subtle body from the gross body at the end of life. The five [[Prana]]s as well as the ten outer organs and four inner organs are all present in the subtle body in seed form.

The gross body passes through the stages of birth, childhood, adolescence, youth, senility and death. 'The death', is the separation of the subtle body from the gross body. In the gross body the soul experiences the different worldly pleasures, which are short lived and invariably followed by misery. It goes through the cycle of love and hate, love for the pleasurable objects and hate for those, which give pain. It indulges itself in various actions to fulfill its desires. Each desire feeds and multiples on other desires. The Atma in the subtle body takes another birth in one of the millions of species depending on the desires and tendencies of the previous lives imprinted on the [[Chitta]]. The process is repeated ad infinitum and the soul finds itself shackled in the endless chain of births and deaths. The soul forgets its real nature and identifies itself with its body. When it finds the miseries of its unbearable and craves to find a way out, another, conscious entity, the Eternal Sadguru, begins to guide him on the path of salvation.

==The Eternal Sadguru==
The Eternal Sadguru is the messenger of Paramatma. Brahma Vidya (the Divine Wisdom) emanates from Him and he is the Lord of the spiritual domain. In the beginning of the creation, he is sent by the Supreme Being into the world with the light of spiritual knowledge. His only mission is to awaken the suffering souls of the world from the sleepy state of ignorance by shedding upon them the divine light. He liberates the craving and deserving souls from the bondage of Prakriti and enables them to enjoy the nectarine bliss of the Supreme Being. When the current of the spiritual knowledge of the Eternal Guru flows in the soul of a human being, the status of Rishi or [[Maharshi]] is attained. The knowledge of Brahma Vidya or Vihangam Yoga, which is found in the Veda the Upanishads, and other holy books is solely due to him. He has been addressed as Sukrit Deo, Atri, Jyoti, Aj and the Sanatan in the Vedas. He has also been mentioned in the Upanishads as Amanava Purusha (Super human being). The Eternal Sadguru sermonize the spiritual practitioners and the real devotees in his manifested or un-manifested form. He can take a human form when he wills.

When humans become too much engrossed in the, allurements of Prakriti and tend to deviate from the true path, of spiritualism, the Eternal Sadguru appears in the world in a human form to salvage the souls. Sometimes he inspires a liberated soul to take a human form and propagate the divine knowledge of Vihangam Yoga. Such a great soul possesses full spiritual knowledge right from his birth and is called a ''Swayam Siddha Sadguru''. Sometimes the Eternal Guru appears before an industrious yogi and guides him to perfection. Such a great yogi is granted the authority to act as a Sadguru. Such a Sadguru is called the ''Abhyasa Sadguru''. There is only one Sadguru at one period of time that carries the authority of the Eternal Sadguru to propagate Brahma Vidya (Vihangam Yoga or Sahaja Yoga). Once a soul has been authorised by the Eternal Sadguru to act as a world preceptor (Jagadguru), he can hand over the science of Brahma Vidya and the authority to propagate it to his progeny or any other deserving disciple. Such a Sadguru is called the ''Parampara Sadguru''. This science of Brahma Vidya can thus be propagated generation after generation, even though the science is one and the way of attainment is also one that has been taught and authorised by the Eternal Sadguru.

The knowledge of the phenomenal world, the various sciences and arts of the world, are being taught by different teachers who gain their knowledge from books or experiences with the help of different scientific Instruments. The knowledge so acquired is related to the material universe and the senses. Brahma Vidya or Yoga is knowledge beyond the senses and cannot be studied from books or from a Guru who has not been given the authority by the Eternal Sadguru. This stream of knowledge flows from the Eternal Sadguru through the Sadguru only. Nobody can proclaim himself a, Sadguru by dint of his vast erudition or knowledge of scriptures. The scriptures only hint at the path of righteousness, but they cannot lift up a soul to liberation from the bondage of Prakriti. For this a Sadguru is essential. He uses his soul force to elevate the aspiring soul beyond Prakriti. It is then only that the Yoga Practitioner realises his true self (Atma). The Atma only in its true detached form is capable of real worship of the Supreme Soul ([[Bhajan]]). By assiduous worship (Bhajan), the Atma gets united to the Paramatma, the ultimate aim of yoga.

Since the worship of the formless Paramatma is not practical, devotion to the Sadguru is the only way to achieve the ultimate goal. The Sadguru has no worldly desires, has nothing to get from the disciple, and hence he comes to the world to fulfill his mission of helping the aspirant to choose the correct path and then guide him through the practice of yoga. The problem, which arises, is that of meeting the Sadguru. For that there must be a burning desire to get liberation from the worldly bondage (vairagya). Those who seek gratification of the senses can never turn in this direction. Once the desire for liberation is kindled, one seeks a Sadguru.

In one's search one may come across a number of half- baked Gurus who teach some kind of mental relaxation, which does give some mental peace but nothing beyond that. Having attained some tranquility one gets stuck up. The Guru is unable to take the disciple beyond that. Some self-proclaimed Gurus who can show some miracles, which are mostly sleight of hand, impress people and get recognition. There are others who are well versed in scriptures and get a good following by dint of their erudition. The soul force of the Sadguru is utterly lacking in them. They lead the disciples astray resulting ultimately in disappointment. Some cheat posing as Gurus, make a business out of Gurudom. With an increasing number of such Gurus, the aspirant may face some difficulty in finding the Sadguru, but will ultimately find him if he has a burning desire.

The Sadguru himself looks for deserving and seeking Atmas. There is then a meeting of souls and the Sadguru is glad to lead such souls to their ultimate goal. The aspirant may not recognise the Sadguru but the Sadguru might have instructed him in the science of Brahma Vidya in his previous lives. The Sadguru can easily recognise such souls and gladly guides them to further heights. It is futile to ask the Sadguru for material achievements because that is not a function of the Sadguru. He is there to guide the souls to reach the Supreme Soul, the abode of eternal bliss.

==Nature (Prakriti)==
All the insentient objects in the universe are composed of one basic substance called Nature or Prakriti. Prakriti Maya and Paramanu are synonymous. Prakriti consists of three gunas - [[Sattwa]], [[Rajas]] and [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas]], whose characteristics are illumination, activity and inertia or sluggishness respectively. Guna (in the context of Prakriti) means constituent and not attribute as called by some authors. The three gunas or constituents of Prakriti are basic substances, which do not exist independently when there is no creation, nature or Prakriti exists in its seed (or cosmic egg) form, which is called Mool Prakriti. In [[Mool Prakriti]] the three gunas remain in balance and do not interact.

The creation starts with the vibration in the Mool Prakriti. As a result of the vibration, the gunas of Prakriti combine in different proportions to give, rise to a variety of substances. Each guna is present in active or dormant form in all the substances created. The gunas of Prakriti are analogous with the fundamental particles of atom. According to science, all the physical substances are made up of atoms consisting of electrons, protons and neutrons in specific numbers. The properties of the fundamental particles are similar to those of gunas. Furthermore, the creation of universe a result of a 'big bang' in the cosmic egg, and the theory of oscillating universe propounded by modem science, is strikingly similar to the views of great Indian seers.

While modern science is ignorant as to the agency responsible for 'big bang' in the cosmic egg, the Indian Rishis say that it is the Akshara Brahma who imparts vibration in Mool Prakriti and thus starts the creation of the universe. In the process of creation, five basic elements are first created. They are [[Akasha]] (space), [[Vayu]] (air), [[Agni]] (fire), [[Ap (water)|Jala]] (water) and [[Prithivi]] (earth). They are listed here in their decreasing order of subtleness and their respective qualities are sound ([[Shabda]]), touch ([[Sparsha]]), form ([[Roopa]]), taste ([[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]]) and smell ([[Olfaction|Gandha]]). All objects are made of these five subtle elements. Our five senses are created to receive the five different sensations of the five basic elements. All parts of our bodies are manifestations of Prakriti, except mind and Pranas, which originate from Akshara Brahma.

==Time (Kaal)==
Given two events, we can always say whether one of them occurred earlier, later or simultaneously. The concept, on which the chronological order of events is based, is called [[Kāal (time)|Kaal]] (Time). Time is an abstract entity and is conceived only through the changes that take, place around us. The Prakriti (Nature) undergoes a continuous transformation or change right from the moment of the creation of the universe till its dissolution. These changes indicate the incessant flow of time. Even during the dissolution when no change, whatever, occurs, time does not cease to exist. Like all other conscious and inert objects, time concept also rests with the Supreme Being who decides the duration of the dissolution based on this concept alone. Time is thus an eternal entity.

Among the nine kinds of elements mentioned in his Vaisesika System, the great Seer Kanada has postulated time as a substance. Kaal Shukta finds mention in Atharva Veda. It is time under whose fold the galaxies are mobile and the entire universe is cycling. ''Time is neither conscious nor inert''. Still years throughout the world, more as a means to promote the entire zone of creation is ruled by it. The birth and death, inhalation and exhalation and all the experiences of pleasure and pain occur in the domain of time. The soul becomes free from the wheel of time only when it is liberated from the bondage of Prakriti by the technique of Vihangam Yoga under the guidance of a Sadguru.

==Essence of Vihangam Yoga==
Yoga has been gaining recognition and popularity in recent time under whose fold healthy living rather than spiritual attainment. To this end a number of Indian yogis are engaged in teaching yogic exercises such as Asanas and Pranayama. Some forms of meditations and other practices of very recent origins are also being taught in the name of yoga. Hatha Yoga, Mantra Yoga, Laya Yoga and Raja Yoga are some of the various kinds of yoga, which are popular in India. These are physical or Prakritic yogas. They are practiced at the physical level of body, mind, intellect and Pranas and develop their powers appreciably. The ultimate aim of yoga as propounded in the Vedas and the Upanishads is to unite the individual soul (Atma) with the Supreme Soul (Paramatma). This highest form of yoga is called Vihangam Yoga or Brahma Vidya. The knowledge of Vihangam Yoga had disappeared for the last five hundred years and was revived by Sadguru Swami Sadafal Deoji Maharaj in the first half of last century.

The literal meaning of the word 'Yoga' is union. Vihangam Yoga is defined as the union of Atma with Paramatma. This union is achieved after Atma frees itself from the shackles of the mind and intellect and attains its pure conscious state. The Supreme Soul is a purely conscious entity and is beyond the reach of the mind and intellect. The mind and intellect are inert by themselves and are activated by the consciousness of the soul. An inert object cannot reach a conscious entity, far less unite with or merge in it. Therefore, the physical yogas cannot reach the ideal of Vihangam Yoga. Vihangam means a bird. As a bird floats in the air overcoming the gravitational force of the earth, so does the consciousness of the Atma float in the limitless space of pure consciousness leaving behind its physical base i.e. body, mind and intellect. The cessation of mental activities has been defined as Yoga Patanjali. This is the definition of Raja Yoga, prominent among the physical yogas. Raja Yoga preludes to Vihangam Yoga. In other words, Vihangam Yoga begins where Raja Yoga ends. Maharshi Patanjali in his Yoga Darshan has described eight limbs of yoga.
They are:

===Yama===
It is a self-imposed code of good conduct in one's relation to other beings in general and to the human society in particular. It includes Ahimsa (not to hurt anybody thoughts, words or deeds), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (not to usurp anybody's property), Brahmacharya (celibacy in thoughts and deeds) and Aparigraha (not to hoard things beyond one's needs)

===Niyama===
It is concerned with purification of one's body and self. It includes Shoucha (external and internal cleanliness), Santosha (contentment), Tapa (religious austerity), Swadhyaya (study of scriptures) and Ishwar Pranidhana (devotion and surrender to the Almighty).

===Asanas===
These are various yogic postures, which help to keep the body supple
and strong. They include the different Bandhs and Mudras, which keep the internal
organs toned up, and help in concentration of mind.

===Pranayama===
These are practices involving regulation of breath. These enhance the performance of the respiratory and circulatory systems and help to control the mind.

===Pratyahara===
It is withdrawal of sense organs from the sense objects.

===Dharana===
Mann bandhe so dharana (Controlling the mind at a point is called Dharana)

===Dhyana===
It means meditation with unbroken attention on the object of concentration.

===Samadhi===
It is the complete absorption of one's self in the object of meditation. Here there is complete absence of one's identity, which has merged in its goal. In the highest stage of Raja Yoga or [[Rāja yoga|Ashtanga Yoga]] (eight-limbed yoga) of [[Patanjali]], that is Samadhi, the cessation of all mental activities is achieved. Thus it does not reach the ultimate aim of yoga viz. the union of the individual self with the Supreme Self. This is achieved through [[Samādhi]] of Vihangam Yoga only.

In Vihangam Yoga the mind is lifted to its source, the Akshara Brahma where it is permanently quietened, just like a river losing its identity in the ocean. Once the soul is freed from bondage of the mind, it realises its true nature and stops identifying itself with the human body. In fact, the soul then acts as the master and guides the mind and the body in the way it likes. Having realised the futility of worldly pleasures, derived through the sense organs and their objects, it soars higher in search of the Absolute Bliss (Paramananda). It is then only that the real meditation of Vihangam Yoga starts, terminating in Samadhi, the ultimate aim of Yoga of meeting with the Supreme Soul. In this state the soul has attained liberation while residing in the body itself (Jivanmukti).

As already stated in the previous chapter, Atma, in the association of Paramatma, assumes all His qualities. In this state if it develops egotism and identifies itself with the Paramatma, it meets with its downfall to the zone of Prakriti, degrading itself successively to the states of Kaivalya, Mahakarana, Karana, Sukshma, and lastly to the gross body. Once the Atma takes on a body it has to perform actions in thoughts, words or deeds. The various actions performed by the soul through mind and other bodily organs, bear fruits and lead to the cycle of births and deaths. The law of [[Karma]] (action) is inevitable. Whatever action is done has to bear fruit, if not in this life, in the lives to come.

Karma has been classified as Sanchita (hoarded), Prarabdha (actions motivating the present life) and Kriyamana (actions performed in the present life).
*[[Sanchita karma]]s are actions performed in previous lives, which have accumulated and will produce results in the future lives.
*[[Prarabdha karma]]s are those actions, which are destined to bear fruits in this life.
*[[Kriyamana karma]]s will necessarily produce their effects in due course of time.
The law of karma explains many enigmas of life. Why is a person born with a silver spoon in his mouth while another under tragic circumstances? Why should two persons born of the same parents and reared under identical conditions shape so differently in life? Why should newborn children behave differently? Why should two identical twins possess different natures? It is because the different souls in the different bodies have to reap the fruits of actions performed by them in previous lives. There is no escape from that. There is nothing, which happens by chance. The orderly way in which the vast universe is run cannot simply be a matter of chance or independent happenings. The Supreme Soul is the great co-coordinator and judge who preside over all happenings in this world and beyond.

The three Gunas of Prakriti-Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas bound the soul to worldly action. The more engrossed it becomes in Prakriti, the less it realises its true nature and its identity separate from the mind and the body. The deluded soul wanders from one birth to another propelled by the three Gunas of Prakriti and the law of Karma. As soon as there is a burning desire in the self to get liberated from worldly bondage and it submits in all humility to the Sadguru, the reverse journey of the soul towards its real abode starts. By the yogic practices under the guidance of a Sadguru, there is a gradual and successive detachment of the soul from Prakriti and it comes back to its own conscious form. It then devotes itself to the [[Supreme Being]] and achieves supreme bliss.

In the first stage of yogic practice, the soul detaches its consciousness from the external world and associates itself with the subtle body. In the next stage the mind, intellect and Pranas are left behind and then there is dissociation from the subtle body also. Subsequently, the soul dissociates itself from all its relationship with the three Gunas of Prakriti and then the causal body is separated from it. In this yogic state, the soul acquires unlimited strength and brilliance. For attainment of peace and bliss, the soul must be free not only from the physical association, but also from the latent impressions of this association.

When the worldly impressions from the soul are rooted out and annihilated in the next stage of yoga, there is a separation of [[Mahakarana]] state. The yogi can now sit firmly in complete and unbroken Samadhi and obtain bliss of the Supreme Being. In the Samadhi the Soul acquires the qualities of Brahma due to its association with Him just as an iron ball acquires the properties of fire when it is associated with the fire. In this state a feeling of 'I am the Brahma' develops in the soul. This is Kaivalya state of the Soul. This ego in the soul is due to ignorance and is the main cause of its downfall. So this ego must be discarded through the practice of yoga. In the highest state of yoga, a feeling of relationship between the soul and the Supreme Being as that of a master and servant develops. The soul then attains its purest state of Hansa Deha. In the state of Samadhi, the yogi dives in the infinite ocean of supreme bliss while living in the body, which is the ultimate aim of yoga.

Vihangam Yoga, also known as Sahaja Yoga or Madhu Vidya, is the ancient, science of conscious entities described in the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Gita. This was the only art or science of yoga known to the Rishis who practiced and taught to their disciples through the ages. By a lapse of time the science was lost and later fragments of this yoga appeared in the form of Raja Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Gyana Yoga, Laya Yoga and a host of others. When the soul becomes associated with Prakriti, mind and its associated senses, different views and notions appear which have given rise to various yogas and its distortions. Vihangam Yoga is the mother of all these ramifications and can be taught only by the Sadguru who is empowered by the original Sadguru, a conscious force described in the Vedas as 'Messenger', [[Sukrit]], [[Atri]], [[Amanava]] Purusha or [[Munindra]]. While a host of Gurus have appeared, who are teaching various yogas, claiming benefits for the practitioners, it is only the Sadguru of Vihangam Yoga who claims to take- the liberated soul to the Supreme Soul, the Paramatma.

[[Hatha yoga]], by means of the various Asanas, Pranayama, bandhs and mudras aims at awakening of the Kundalini. This is achieved in Vihangam Yoga in no time because the knowledge of the eight Chakras or the Psychic centres in the body and the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] become clear-cut by a short practice of this yoga. The Hatha Yogi may take a lifetime of arduous practice to achieve the same result. [[Mantra Yoga]] and [[Tantra Yoga]] depend on the repetition of certain code words as Mantra which absorbs the practitioner's mind so deeply that he forgets the world but they are all done at the mental level which is a part of Prakriti and remains with the Prakriti. Vihangam Yoga starts with concentrating the mind but gradually takes the mind up to its source, the Akshara Brahma where it loses its hold on the soul. It is then only that the soul becomes free to leave the bondage of Prakriti and rises up to its master, the Paramatma. By mental acrobatics, arguments and discussions, it is not possible to free the soul from this bondage. It is only by the realisation of the true nature of the freed soul and its master that the ultimate aim of Yoga is fulfilled.

Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Gyana Yoga are all small fragments of Vihangam Yoga. They automatically come to the Vihangam Yogi in one lot. In fact, by complete knowledge of the reality of Atma, Paramatma and Prakriti and their qualities, whatever the liberated soul does is Karma Yoga and his devotion to Paramatma from the purely conscious level is real Bhakti Yoga. Discussions and arguments about the Superiority of Karma, Bhakti or Gyana Yoga are mere mental exercises, which do not take the aspirant any further. Learned scholars have written many volumes but they have been mental giants only and not developed souls. A soul, which has realised the truth, knows and practices all these three Yogas and has no doubts in his mind about these various Yogas and hence does not indulge in these discussions. He is a Gyana Yogi, a Bhakti Yogi and a Karma Yogi, all in one.

==Gyana Yoga or Yoga of Knowledge==
One of the paths by which the union of the Individual soul with the Supreme Soul can be achieved is Gyana Yoga. Gyana means the realisation of the true nature of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul and the Prakriti. Knowledge as we ordinarily comprehend, comprises ideas assimilated by the human mind by means of the various sense organs, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the palate and the skin. This may be obtained by direct contact with the objects of the world or by being narrated by a reliable person who has first-hand information.

In modem Science various gadgets are being used to gather information, which are not obtainable directly through the sense organs. With all the aids available at present or which scientists, might invent later, the information we gather is all about the inert materials of the universe. We might succeed in collecting all the knowledge of the inert material world but the conscious elements can never be known by using inert instruments. Only conscious entities can delve into the realms of the conscious. Though the consciousness of the Supreme Soul pervades all matter, inert as well as conscious, it can-only be known by the conscious entities like the individual souls. Thus, a complete knowledge (Gyana) is not possible through the sense organs, the mind or the intellect. They are capable of knowing only the material universe. The conscious elements like the Atma and the Paramatma being subtle are capable of complete knowledge.

The Atma (individual soul), though it activates, and illuminates the mind and sense organs, has so to say, forgotten its potentiality and lost its subtlety in association with the inert mind, body and intellect. It has the nature of identifying itself with the individual mind and through it to the organs of the body. It takes part in the various actions and has to bear the fruits of the actions. When the mind leads it to pleasurable actions, as a natural sequence, it takes part in the painful part of the effect also. It thus carries this burden of actions from one body to another by the inexorable law of Karma. The Atma thus keeps on identifying itself with the different embodied forms and does not realise its free conscious nature. In this state it does not have the capacity to grasp the true character of the Supreme Soul which remains the unknowable, incomprehensible entity as described by the different scriptures.

When the Atma realises its true nature which is free from the mind and body, in an unalloyed conscious form, it is quite capable of comprehending the Supreme Soul which always stays in its pure form unaffected by actions and-mental processes even though pervading everything. In this pure state the Atma gains correct knowledge of the phenomenal world also as an observer. This is the process of Gyana Yoga. The complete knowledge of the phenomenal world by all possible scientific means leaves our knowledge only incomplete. By all these means, the conscious field is not touched at all even though its presence cannot be denied in everyday working of the phenomenal world.
The final step in Gyana Yoga is, therefore, to free the Atma from its affection by the mind which is ever turbulent. The different systems of yoga aim at making the mind tranquil. This may be achieved by different methods of concentration but this achievement is only temporary. The mind springs back to activities as soon as concentration ends and tends to run towards the objects of sensual gratification. It is only when the mind is taken to its source of energy, the Akshara (Hiranyagarbha), that it calms down and then only the Atma can free itself from its association with the mind. The Atma in its pure state of consciousness, then, is able to conceive the true nature of the Supreme Atma as well as the phenomenal world and gets true knowledge (Gyana).

Gyana Yoga has different meanings in diverse schools of thought. One school starts with the assumption that the Supreme Almighty, Immanent Soul is the only reality and the rest of existence is an illusion, Maya. According to them, the individual souls are non-existent and so is the universe. In that we have to deny whatever we perceive by the senses or intellect as well as our own existence. If we are already the Sat-chit-ananda, there should not be any illusion or suffering which seems to be as real as the palms of our hands. Why should the all-knowing Supreme Self-have any illusion at all? Maya can only occur to a soul who is not omniscient. To ascribe ignorance to the Almighty Supreme Soul is the very denial of His powers. If the individual soul is supposed to be just a chunk of the Supreme Soul, it should possess all the qualities of the Supreme Soul just as a drop of water has the same properties as a river from where it is taken. In fact we find that the human soul suffers pleasure and pain so long it is attached to the body. A chunk of sat-chit-ananda should not suffer any pain by its very nature. In that case any effort to reach the Supreme Soul should be meaningless and all the concentration and meditation becomes superfluous.

Another school of thought practices denial of everything perceived through the senses and through a process of self-hypnosis tries to establish soul's oneness with the Supreme Soul. It is a purely mental process. The effect of self-hypnosis can but be temporary while yoga aims at permanent liberation of the soul and its attachment to the source of eternal bliss, the Sat-chit-ananda.

Our mind and intellect have to be used only to reach at the probable units of existence of reality. The vast universe of which we do not know even a fraction, the orderly movements occurring in the distant stars and planets for ages, only point to a conscious force which pervades, regulates and encompasses everything. No name will explain it adequately but its processes can be felt within ourselves provided we are aware of it. Otherwise what halts a person from committing a crime for the first time? What prevents a horse from treading on a toad on the road?

The mind and intellect have limited capacity and have not been able to comprehend the vastness nor the subtlety of the Supreme Soul. Our sages have perceived the Almighty Soul during the stage of Samadhi when they have left the mind and intellect behind.

The individual souls are entities separate from the, Supreme Soul and have to strive hard to reach the ultimate goal, the Sat-chit-ananda. This, the soul is incapable of knowing through the medium of mind and intellect which are meant to work in the sphere of the phenomenal world only because they are a part of the Prakriti. Gyana Yoga or knowledge of the various conscious souls when it has broken the shackles of the mind and intellect and has become capable of reaching up to the Prakriti. The soul has to realise its true nature first before knowing the Supreme Soul and once it has known the supreme Soul, it knows everything about Prakriti also which is pervaded and enveloped by the Omniscient Supreme Being.

==Bhakti Yoga Or Yoga Of Devotion==
From time immemorial man has been worshiping one deity or another. Usually the deity was one, which was supposed to be powerful and capable of doing harm to human beings. Powerful forces of nature such as the sun, the rivers, fire, wind and rain were worshipped at sometime or another by means of different rituals. Sacrifices of animals were common as a means of propitiating these forces. The idea behind these rituals was to keep the deities appeased so that their anger may not cause harm to the human beings. The great thinkers, with their developed faculties of observation and inference from the working of nature, came to visualise an omnipotent force, which was not only regulating the working of nature, but influencing the working of the living beings also. They also indulged in the sacrificial rites and used foodstuffs and animals as offerings. Some thinkers like Mahavira and the Buddha revolted against the animal sacrifices and the dominance of the priests at the time and preached the doctrine of non-violence and correct conduct, eliminating all kinds of sacrifices. In its place they laid stress on humility of character and austerity in one's life. The followers of these saints started to worship their idols with all devotion. Since then worshiping of idols started as a common practice. Human beings started shaping their deities according to their imagination and bestowing all powers on these deities. The real nature of the omnipresent, omnipotent forces behind the working of the universe was beyond common human conception and hence the devotion to various forms of deities continued. Even those devotional practices have one virtue. They mitigate one's egotistic tendency if practiced sincerely and not as a mere rituals. Beyond this virtue little else can be achieved as well as the qualities attributed by such devotion as Bhakti. The idols and their pictures as well as the qualities attributed to them are the projections of the human mind and not representation of reality.

Unless the real nature of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul and the phenomenal world (Prakriti) is known, any devotion (Bhakti) is a delusion. Thus Gyana Yoga by which this knowledge is obtained is a sine qua non for the practice of Bhakti Yoga. On the other hand, Gyana Yoga devoid of Bhakti stops the progress of the individual soul at a certain stage of development. This stage is known as Kaivalya Sharir when the soul has not shed off its egotism and identifies itself with the Supreme Soul proclaiming "Aham Brahmasmi" (I am Brahma). The soul is likely to have a fall at this stage again into the folds of Prakriti. The liberated soul (Jivana Mukta) should stay on in close contact with the Supreme Soul to enjoy the eternal bliss (Parama Anand). The individual soul in its innate nature must stay as a faithful servant of its masters the supreme soul. This cannot be achieved without unwavering Bhakti and devotion. Thus Gyana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga go hand in hand. Bhakti Yoga without Gyana Yoga is mere delusion and Gyana without Bhakti is an incomplete Yoga. Bhakti is the commonest form of worship or prayer being practiced in the world. It is usually an idol, a picture or a symbol, which is worshipped in nine ways viz. by hearing of the divine attributes, singing His glories, remembrance of the Almighty, devotion to His feet, His adoration, His praise, thinking Him to be the Master and the devotee in the role of friend and complete surrender of oneself to the worshipped symbol. All this leads to annihilation of the ego of the devotee that way he attains peace of mind.

In the Gita four kinds of devotees are described. Firstly those who are in distress and seek divine help secondly, those who long for wealth, thirdly those who are seekers of truth and fourthly the man of self-realisation. Of these four, the last, the Gyani has been described as the best. The other three also get what they want by sincere devotion and effort but it is the self-realised soul who gets nearest to the Supreme Soul and that is only possible through the medium of Gyana Yoga. Mere performance of rituals can at best be diversion of the mind from mundane worries for the time being. A real devotee does not forget his own self or the Supreme Self for a single moment and enjoys the ultimate bliss all the time.

==Karma Yoga or Yoga of Action==
Karma, in common language, means action done by the individual soul on account of its contact with Prakriti and its Gunas. The tendency of all Karmas is to bind the soul to Prakriti so that the soul becomes more and more attached to Prakriti. The embodied soul has five coverings or Koshas. The first is Annamaya Kosha made of the gross matter of the body, which is formed, from the food that we eat; the second is these Pranas Kosha which is made of prana inside the body which is less gross than the outer body. Third is the Manomaya or the mental sheath which is subtler than the breath. The fourth is Vigyan Maya Kosha or the intellectual sheath. The last comes the Ananadmaya Kosha or bliss sheath, which is the subtlest form of the body.

The Karma affects all coverings according to its nature. As the soul is immortal, life is one continuous existence. When the body dies, the subtle body of the soul as its Sanchita Karma or Prarabdha Karma carries on the unfulfilled actions. The next body that the soul takes has to reap the fruits of Prarabdha Karma necessarily. It indulges in further Karmas with the body and mind, the Kriyamana Karmas, the fruits of which also have to be reaped either in that body or in future bodies. There is no action performed in association with the mind and body, which does not bear fruits. In spite of all, efforts made by the human mind to act without desiring the fruits of action, the desires and passions associated with the mind prevent it from unattached actions. The three Gunas of Prakriti force it to get attached to the desire for fruits of actions. It is only when the mind is not the guiding force behind action, that real unattached actions can be performed. Only such actions do not affect the different Koshas or layers covering the Atma and no further Kriyamana Karmas accumulate. The Prarabdha Karma, to fulfill which the soul takes on a particular body, has necessarily to be gone through. There still remains the bundle of Sanchita Karmas, which the soul has to carry. When the soul realises its pure free form by Gyana (knowledge of reality) the Sanchita Karma burnt out and the liberated soul becomes free from all the five Koshas (Layers of material body).

There is only, one way in which this liberation of the soul can be achieved. This is the way of Sahaja Yoga or Vihangam Yoga or Brahma Vidya. The practitioner of this yoga has to learn the art of service and selfless actions (Vikarma). The mind, at the same time; has to be tamed to become steady and unwavering. This unwavering mind has to be lifted up from the bonds of Prakriti by a Sadguru. Once the mind is lifted up, it merges with its source of energy, the Akshara or Hiranyagarbha. When the mind is lost in its source, the soul (Atma) is freed from the shackles of the mind and becomes free to ascend higher to the Supreme Soul. This is the Jivana Mukta stage of the soul. Now the soul can act using the mind and the body at its command (Akarma). It is only in this stage of development that real unattached actions (Akarma) can be performed. These actions are free from any passion and desire and are performed solely for the good of other souls. The Mukti (freedom) or Nirvana does not occur after the death of the body but in the body itself. This may not be possible in one life but the practitioner of Vihangam Yoga carries the experience through his subtle body to the next life where he starts at the point he left the previous body. The Sadguru is eternal and gives him further guidance. Thus the achievement is never lost.

The performance of unattached actions (Karma Yoga) is not possible unless the Atma (soul) frees itself from the bondage of Prakriti by Brahma Vidya or Vihangam Yoga and becomes a Jivana Mukta. Then it exercises full control over the mind and the body and is free from all selfish desires or passions. It resorts to only benevolent actions called Karma Yoga. Freed from all shackles, it becomes more powerful than ever and is capable of activities far beyond the capacity of ordinary mortals.

We read and hear of worldly great men being described as Karma Yogis by their admirers. They are usually workaholics who work for long hours just to earn more money or fame. Their insatiable desires goad them to strenuous work. They are just doing Sakama Karma. There are others who are devoted to social work. They are certainly a boon to society and they are loved and respected by society and it is for that reward that they work hard even neglecting their health and comforts. Much they desire to be selfless, this desire lurks in his type of action bears fruit whether done willingly or forced by circumstances. It is true that nobody can remain without indulging in some action, mental, verbal or Prakritic. Satoguna, Rajoguna and Tamsoguna force man to indulge in activity. In this state of helplessness it is best to choose actions, which have more of Satoguna than Rajoguna and Tamsoguna. By such actions, one moves on the right path of liberation. Such actions are called Vikarma. It is only when the soul stands as an observer and thinks of all actions performed by the influence of Gunas of Prakriti that is not attached to the fruits of actions and can be called Akarma Yogi. This is only possible after self-realisation.

Thus we find that three yogas i.e. Gyana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga are not really threefold paths to attainment of sat-chit-ananda; unless the reality is known by Gyana Yoga neither Bhakti nor Karma Yoga is possible. The attainment of full knowledge leads automatically to Nishkama Karma (Unattached Actions) and the innate nature of individual soul in relation to the Supreme Soul being of a servant and master, full knowledge is only possible by unwavering devotion (Bhakti Yoga) to Him.

==The Practice of Vihangam Yoga==
As we know, the mind and the different organs of the body are themselves inert. The force of consciousness in the soul activates the mind and through it the various organs. In the waking state, this force flows out into the phenomenal worlds and gives us the knowledge of the world. The five sensory organs, the eyes, ears, nose, palate and skin as well as the five organs of action, the hands, the legs, the organs of speech, excretion and generation are all activated by the mind and so are the three internal organs intellect, chitta or memory cell and ego. Once the mind is fixed, its outward flow can be controlled consciously.

According to the Rishis or ancient philosopher scientists of India, a perfect knowledge of all existence, inert as well as conscious, can be achieved when one has acquired the divine eye of pure consciousness after its dissociation from all the physical attachments such as, the mind, intellect, the Pranas or life force and the body. Hence the force of consciousness has to be channelised inwards willfully towards its origin. On the inward journey of the consciousness towards its origin in the mind has first to be restrained so that it may not be able to dissipate our force of consciousness.

While we are awake the mind is situated before the eyes most of the time. So to control the mind, dissipation of the beams of consciousness oozing out through both the eyes have to be united at a point where they can converge into one ray. The spiritual scientists of the east and west have therefore stressed the prime necessity of this practice. "''The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light''" says -St. Mathew in the Bible (6:2). Swarveda (1/4/30) says, "''Combine first the light of consciousness of the two eyes into a single ray, then thou shall be able to move up and there is no other way.''" The benefits that one gets by this practice are manifold. The mind is calmed and is freed from all types of tensions and anxieties. One gets the vision of the colours of the five basic elements of nature, the earth, water, fire, air and space. The breath becomes slower, thereby increasing longevity. The practitioner becomes a happier man with greater enthusiasm for work.

Once the mind is controlled with its outward flow through different organs, it is taken to a point in the forehead which is the tri junction of the three channels&amp;nbsp;– the Ingla Nadi (passing through left nostril), the Pingla Nadi (through the right nostril)- and the Sushumna Nadi in the centre. Swami Sadafal Deoji says in his Swarveda (6/2) that "''at this tri junction flows the water of divine knowledge, which purifies the mind of its dotages and bestows glazing serenity to it.''" In the Bible St. John has described this experience in the following words: "''And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their forehead. And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.''" (Revelation 22:4 and 5). There are many pleasant experiences at this second level on the journey of consciousness. The mind is pacified and moves deeper inwards. The yogi hears a resounding sound like 'Om' and sees a soothing and pleasing light. He feels peaceful and starts getting a vision of the inner world. His mind is elevated to a much higher level than that of an average human being and becomes capable of achieving many divine powers.

After perfection at this level, the consciousness is taken to a point at the top of the head called the Brahma Randra or the Tenth Gate. This is the gate through which the soul enters the human body. St. John in his Revelations has mentioned the experiences of this gate as follows: "''Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any man bear my voice and open the door, I shall come unto him and will sup with him and be with me''" (Revelation 3:20). In Swarveda (6/2), Swami Sadafal Deo Ji says: "''A deep concentration at the tenth gate has awakened the consciousness from the slumber.''" He further says, "''The Tenth Gate is very secret. It is the gateway to the bliss of Madhumati or Brahma Vidya (the science of knowledge of Brahma). Without the grace of Sadguru, none can cross this gate and get the illumination of the Akshara Brahma.''" By concentration at this level, full control and subjugation of the mind and life force (Pranas) is achieved. The body, Pranas and mind are joined together. As we move on in this direction, we go on dissociating out consciousness from the body, Pranas and mind.

After opening the gate, the consciousness is pulled up at a particular distance from the crown of the head by the Master of the science, the Sadguru, where the mind and Pranas dissolve in their origin, the Akshara Brahma. Here the soul's consciousness is separated from its physical chaff. It is the Akshara Brahma, which controls the creation and dissolution of the universe through its all-pervading vibratory sound. The Brahma appears in the beginning of creation and gives motion to the dormant fundamental particles of nature or Prakriti to combine and form different shapes. This ''fourth stage'' on the conscious journey makes soul's consciousness free and it is then bathed in the brilliant light of the Akshara Brahma, which did not manifest because of the Soul's association with the physical appendages. This Akshara Brahma is the creator, the preserver and the annihilator of the universe through its all-pervading vibratory sound. The Bible mentions it as "''These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of creation of God.''" (Revelation 3: 14). Maharshi Swami Sadafal Deoji describes in Swarveda (1/2/33) thus: "''The vibration is in the Akshara Brahma which causes revolution of the creation. The Akshara appears in the beginning of the creation.''"

In some schools of yoga, concentration and meditation are practiced on certain sounds, which are produced when consciousness reaches a particular point. The concentrations on the various chakras in the body are associated with the utterances, of different Mantras or code words. Similarly the code word for different sounds produced when the life force (Pranas) reaches various points in the head are repeated by the aspirants and there ends their meditation. These audible sound are Niranjan, Om, Soham, Shakti and Rarankar which are heard when the consciousness reaches the tip of nose, the Trikuti, the Bhanwar Gupha, a spot between the Gupha and the top of the head and lastly he Brahma Randra or the tenth gate respectively. As the practitioner's consciousness reaches the head region, he also hears the Anahat sounds of varying characters, which some schools consider to be the ultimate post of the spiritual journey. In fact these sounds are only heard on the way to the Akshara Brahma and the journey stops short of the tenth gate. A Vihangam Yogi has to go beyond the tenth gate into the zone of Akshara Brahma, which is the fourth stage of the journey. The Bible also mentions about this as follows: "''In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the word was God.''"

With the continued practice at this level of Akshara Brahma a practitioner gets the inner divine eye with which he goes to the ''fifth stage'' where he sees the all-pervading consciousness, the Supreme Brahma, God, Allah, Jehovah or Ahuja of different religious cults. The yogi perceives a brilliant yet soothing light and sound, which submerges the soul in bliss indescribable. A perfect knowledge of everything comes to him who has fixed his consciousness at this fifth and the highest level. We all know that all knowledge and power of action belongs to the soul alone and not to its inert associations. Its conscious power is very much reduced when it flows through the physical sheaths. When this conscious flow is totally separated from the inert physical impediments the capacity to know or act becomes infinitely large and this is what is expressed as superhuman powers in varying degrees in yogis at different levels of the play of consciousness. This journey of consciousness from the gross physical level up to the Para Brahma (Supreme Being) has been explicitly mentioned in the Vedas (Atharva Veda 4/3/14) as "''From the earth I ascend to the horizon, from the horizon to the lighted space, from the lighted space through subtle hole to the conscious space (Cbidakash) and from there to the Supreme Light.''" About the experiences, of the highest level St. John says (Revelation 14:2) "''And I heard a voice of a great thunder and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.''" Similarly a mantra from Sama Veda (6/l/5) says "''I am bearing the powerful nectarine sound like that of torrential rainfall on all sides. The light of thunder is moving very fast over my head.''" Maharshi Sadafal Deoji writes in his Swarveda (1/3/14) "''The lotus has bloomed forth; the inner sky is thundering and roaring raining nectar all around. The conscious peacock is dancing in the secret zone of its play.''"

Thus we see that like any scientific investigation the results of this science of consciousness have been found to be similar whenever they have been performed correctly, whether in pre-historic ages or modem times. But there is a fundamental difference between the two sciences. In the physical science, the observation is objective whereas in this spiritual science of consciousness or what we call Para Vidya or Vihangam Yoga, it is subjective. In the first case it is external while in the latter it is internal of consciousness can be learnt and practiced. This science of consciousness can be learnt and practiced with the help of a Sadguru as has been done since the Vedic ages. This art has been handed down from the Eternal Sadguru who has been mentioned in the Vedas as Sukrit Deo, Atri, Jyoti, Amanava Purusha, Sant and Doot. Atharva Veda (10/4/8/32) mentions about this Sadguru as "''No one sees that saint who is free from death and decay though he is nearest to everybody and is constantly seeing everyone.''" It is this Sadguru who has been mentioned in the Bible as the Holy Ghost. Whenever he appears before a soul and grants him full knowledge and the authority to preach this science of consciousness in the world, then only he preaches it for the redemption of the deserving souls.

This science is available today for its dissemination into the whole world from Vrittikut Ashram, Village-Pakari, District-Ballia in U.P. (India.). True seekers of knowledge may learn and achieve the ultimate aim of human life.

== Journey of Maharishi Sadguru Sadafaldeo Ji Maharaj (15 Aug 1888 to 11 Feb 1954) ==
Maharishi Sadguru Sadafaldeo Ji Maharaj was born in the year 1888 on the fourth day of the first fortnight of Bhadrapada, of Vikram Samvat 1945. 

While still a child of two, once he sat aloof on a wooden plank and his father, mother and other elderly members of his house lay prostrate before him, as he was a great saint. People thought that the child was just making fun and they reverently touched his feet. The same boy began going to school to continue his studies. He wanted to learn Sanskrit in order to know the secret of God-realization by going through the ancient scriptures.

At the early age of eleven Sadafal went to Kashi to learn Sanskrit, but the scholars, who were Brahmins by caste, did not agree to impart him the knowledge of Sanskrit, as he hailed from a Kshatriya family. Being disappointed, boy Sadafal decided to practice Yoga, because he had heard that ancient saints and seers got invaluable and deep knowledge of everything by practicing Yoga. As a result, he sat in meditation practicing 'Unmunimudra' which Lord Krishna has taught in the Gita. Maharishi Sadafaldeo practiced his first lesson of yoga for controlling mind continuously for three years. He sat in meditation in a secluded place in Sidhasana, a yogic posture, for six hours every day.

One night, while he was meditating, he found that his room was filled up with effulgence. He also heard a sweet and soothing voice from the void. "This won't lead you to attain the Supreme Lord, as this practice is based on material sense organs." Sometimes while in a state of meditation, he felt that someone put one of the fingers on the uppermost point of his head. On opening his eyes, he found none there. He could not make out who had spoken so sweetly and who had touched his head with his finger. Later on when Swamiji began practicing yoga inside his cave at Vritikoot Ashram, Pakari, he met a saint with light effulging from him, in the early hours of morning in a lovely field. This saint initiated him into the conscious technique of Vihangam Yoga and instructed him not to come out of his cave before the public until a period of six months of 'anusthan' was complete. Swamiji later on realized that the saint he had met was not a common one. He was the Eternal True Teacher, Nitya Anadi Sadguru. The Lord is Eternal and the way of realizing him is also eternal. As such the teacher teaching the scientific technique of realizing the Lord is also eternal. He is gifted with the power of materializing his body whenever he wills. He also appears in the physical form in all the four ages viz. Satyug, Tretaa, Dwapar and Kaliyug and teaches the technique of Vihangam Yoga, the only way of God-realization, to deserving aspirants.

A reference to this effect has been made in the Vedas at several places.

''Twa dootam agney amritam yugey- yugey havyawaaham dadhirey paayum eedayam.''

''Devaasah cha martasah cha jaagrivim vibhum vishwapatim namasaa nishedirey.''

- Rig Veda

O Lord! Your messenger comes to this world with your nectarian message to emancipate the suffering humanity and leads it to Thee. People as well as gods can't know Him. We lay ourselves prostrate to his Holy feet.

He practiced Vihangam Yoga for seventeen long years, under the guidance of the same Eternal Sadguru, in his self-made cave at Vritikoot Ashram Pakari, Balia, in his cave at Shoonya Shikar Ashram Himalayas, at Jhoonsi Ashram (Prayag) on the bank of Ganges and at several other sacred places. He undertook a number of yoga anusthans (Continuous Practice) lasting continuously for six months. Being pleased with his great sacrifice and perseverance, Nitya Anadi Sadguru endowed him with the authority of True Teacher. In the month of Magh (two months before the Indian Festival- Holi), Eternal Sadguru blessed Maharishi Sadafaldeo Ji with the authority of Sadguru and in the process, transferred the divine Brahma Vidya Knowledge to him. It was that auspicious moment when Sadguru Sadafaldeo Ji was enlightened with the complete Brahma Vidya knowledge. Only a Sadguru has the potential to bless a disciple with the complete knowledge and authorize the disciple as next Sadguru. No one can claim himself or herself as Sadguru just by reading Vedas and other books. A Sadguru is the one who has the practical experience of Brahma Vidya and who can empower a deserved disciple with the same.

Sadguru Sadafaldeo Ji Maharaj has said in his unique spiritual work Swarveda

''Magh Maas shub maas hai, Ardh kumbh paryaag''

''Sadguru sadguru pad diye, puran gyaan viraag''

- Swarveda

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savarkar published ''[[The Indian War of Independence (book)|The Indian War of Independence]]'' about the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] that was banned by British authorities. He was arrested in 1910 for his connections with the revolutionary group [[India House]]. Following a failed attempt to escape while being transported from [[Marseilles]], Savarkar was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment totaling fifty years and was moved to the [[Cellular Jail]] in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], but released in 1921 after several mercy petitions to the Britishers. 

While in prison, Savarkar wrote the work describing ''Hindutva'', espousing what it means to be a Hindu, and Hindu pride, in which he defined as all the people descended of Hindu culture as being part of Hindutva, including Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. In 1921, under restrictions after signing a plea for [[clemency]], he was released on the condition that he renounce revolutionary activities. Travelling widely, Savarkar became a forceful [[orator]] and writer, advocating Hindu political and social unity. Serving as the president of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]], Savarkar endorsed the idea of India as a ''[[Hindu Rashtra]]'' and opposed the ''[[Quit India]]'' struggle in 1942, calling it a "Quit India but keep your army" movement. He became a fierce critic of the [[Indian National Congress]] and its acceptance of [[Partition of India|India's partition]]. He was accused of the [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination]] of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] but acquitted by the court. His role in the assassination was later established by [[Kapur Commission|Kapur Commission in 1969]].

He had three other siblings namely [[Ganesh Damodar Savarkar|Ganesh]], Narayan, and a sister named Maina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc9lLS2dqbUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar: An Immortal Revolutionary of India|last=Rana|first=Bhawan Singh|date=2004|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|year=|isbn=9788128808838|location=|pages=15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned the nickname "Veer" (Sanskrit:braveheart)when at the age of 12, he led fellow students against a rampaging horde of Muslims that attacked his village. Highly outnumbered, he inspired the boys to fight-on until the last Muslim was driven off. Later, he is known to have stated: "Do not fear them. The Almighty is your strength, so fight, even when facing an enemy stronger than yourself"&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Savarkar, Modi’s mentor: The man who thought Gandhi a sissy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636599-controversial-mentor-hindu-right-man-who-thought-gandhi-sissy|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=The Economist|date=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=Jyotirmaya |title=Hindutva: Exploring the Idea of Hindu Nationalism |publisher=Penguin Books India |edition=Third |year=2011 |isbn=9780143418184 |p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his parents, the eldest sibling Ganesh, known as Babarao, took responsibility for the family. Babarao played a supportive and influential role in Vinayak's teenage life. During this period, Vinayak organised a youth group called ''Mitra Mela'' (''Band of Friends'') and encouraged revolutionary and nationalist views of passion using this group. In 1901, Vinayak Savarkar married Yamunabai, daughter of Ramchandra Triambak Chiplunkar, who supported his university education. Subsequently, in 1902, he enrolled in [[Fergusson College]], in [[Pune]] . As a young man, he was inspired by the new generation of radical political leaders namely [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] and [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] along with the political struggle against the [[1905 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] and the rising [[Swadeshi]] campaign. After completing his degree, nationalist activist [[Shyamji Krishna Varma]] helped Vinayak to go to England to study law, on a scholarship. It was during this period that the Garam Dal, literally "Army of the angry," was formed under the leadership of [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] as a result of a split between the moderate, "constitutionalist" wing on the one part, and of Tilak's extremist or radical wing in the [[Indian National Congress]]. The members of the Garam Dal did not acknowledge the agenda of the majority moderate Indian National Congress leadership which advocated dialogue with the British rulers and incremental steps towards Independence by gaining the confidence of the British. Tilak was soon imprisoned for his support of revolutionary activities.

==Activities at India House==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
{{Main article|India House}}
[[File:Dhingra.jpg|thumb|[[Madan Lal Dhingra]] was a protege of Savarkar.]]

After joining [[Gray's Inn]] law college in London Vinayak took accommodation at [[India House]]. Organized by expatriate social and political activist [[Pandit Shyamji]], India House was a thriving centre for student political activities. Savarkar soon founded the [[Free India Society]] to help organize fellow Indian students with the goal of fighting for complete independence through a revolution, declaring, {{quote|We must stop complaining about this British officer or that officer, this law or that law. There would be no end to that. Our movement must not be limited to being against any particular law, but it must be for acquiring the authority to make laws itself. In other words, we want absolute independence.&lt;ref name="Sundaram"/&gt;}}

Savarkar envisioned a guerrilla war for independence along the lines of the famous war for Indian independence of 1857. Studying the history of the revolt, from English as well as Indian sources, Savarkar wrote the book, ''[[The Indian War of Independence (book)|The History of the War of Indian Independence]]''. He analysed the circumstances of 1857 uprising and assailed British rule in India as unjust and oppressive. It was via this book that Savarkar became one of the first writers to allude the uprising as India's "First War for Independence."&lt;ref name="Rediff"&gt;{{cite web

The book was banned throughout the [[British Empire]]. [[Madame Bhikaji Cama]], an expatriate Indian revolutionary obtained its publication in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Widely smuggled and circulated, the book attained great popularity and influenced rising young Indians. Savarkar was studying revolutionary methods and he came into contact with a veteran of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] who imparted him the knowledge of bomb-making. Savarkar had printed and circulated a manual amongst his friends on bomb-making and other methods of [[guerrilla warfare]].

In 1909, [[Madan Lal Dhingra]], a keen follower and friend of Savarkar, assassinated [[William Hutt Curzon Wyllie|Sir William Hutt Curzon Wyllie]] in a public meeting. Dhingra's action provoked controversy across Britain and India, evoking enthusiastic admiration as well as condemnation. Savarkar published an article in which he all but endorsed the murder and worked to organize support, both political and for Dhingra's legal defence.

At a meeting of Indians called for a condemnation of Dhingra's deed, Savarkar protested the intention to condemn and was drawn into a hot debate and angry scuffle with other participants. A secretive and restricted trial and a sentence awarding the death penalty to Dhingra provoked an outcry and protest across the Indian student and political community. Strongly protesting the verdict, Savarkar struggled with British authorities in laying claim to Dhingra's remains following his execution. Savarkar hailed Dhingra as a hero and [[martyr]], and began encouraging revolution with greater intensity.

In India, Ganesh Savarkar had organised an armed revolt against the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Morley-Minto reforms]] of 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3vsAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=South Asian Transnationalisms: Cultural Exchange in the Twentieth Century|last=Sinha|first=Babli|date=2014-02-25|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135718329|location=|pages=129|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British police implicated Savarkar in the investigation for allegedly plotting the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdFADQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar: An Immortal Revolutionary of India|last=Rana|first=Bhawan Singh|date=2016-10-14|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books Pvt Ltd|isbn=9788128835759|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Madame Cama's home in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J3uk3x_k6sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Veer Savarkar Father of Hindu Nationalism|last=Joglekar|first=Jaywant|date=2006-10-01|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781847283801|location=|pages=69|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD1ZMJZZNr4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Veer Savarkar: Thought and Action of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar|last=Trehan|first=Jyoti|date=1991-01-01|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|year=|isbn=9788171003228|location=|pages=23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless arrested by police on 13 March 1910.

Savarkar's arrest at Marseilles caused the French government to protest to the British, arguing that the British could not recover Savarkar unless they took appropriate legal proceedings for his rendition. The dispute came before the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Permanent Court of International Arbitration]] in 1910, and it gave its decision in 1911. The case excited much controversy as was reported by the ''New York Times'', and it considered it involved an interesting international question of the right of asylum.

The Court held, firstly, that since there was a pattern of collaboration between the two countries regarding the possibility of Savarkar's escape in Marseilles and there was neither force nor fraud in inducing the French authorities to return Savarkar to them, the British authorities did not have to hand him back to the French in order for the latter to hold rendition proceedings. On the other hand, the tribunal also observed that there had been an "irregularity" in Savarkar's arrest and delivery over to the Indian Army Military Police guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1972/72_3_04.htm |title=LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE REFUSAL OF ASYLUM BY U.S. COAST GUARD ON 23 NOVEMBER, 1970 |last1=GOLDIE |first1=LOUIS |last2= |first2= |year=1972 |website=LITHUANIAN QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ARTS AND SCIENCES  |publisher=LITUANUS Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf? |title=Hindu case at Hague: Question between France and England over extradition of student |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=15 February 1911 |website=  |publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and Sentence===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
Arriving in [[Bombay]], Savarkar was taken to the [[Yerwada Jail|Yervada Central Jail]] in [[Pune]]. The trial before the special tribunal was started on 10 September 1910 &lt;ref name="GoM" /&gt;{{rp|pg.456}}. One of the charges on Savarkar was he abetted murder. Following a trial, Savarkar, aged 28, was convicted and sentenced to 50-years imprisonment&lt;ref name="GoM" /&gt;{{rp|pg.455}} and transported on 4 July 1911 to the infamous [[Cellular Jail]] in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. He was not considered by the British government as a political prisoner.

==Prisoner in Cellular Jail in Andaman==
{{Unreferenced|date=October 2018}}
[[File:A statue of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.jpg|thumb|A statue of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar at [[Cellular Jail]].]]
His fellow captives included many political prisoners, who were forced to perform hard labour for many years. Reunited with his brother Ganesh, the Savarkars nevertheless struggled in the harsh environment: Forced to arise at 5&amp;nbsp;am, tasks including cutting trees and chopping wood, and working at the oil mill under regimental strictness, with talking amidst prisoners strictly prohibited during mealtime. Prisoners were subject to frequent mistreatment and torture. Contact with the outside world and home was restricted to the writing and mailing of one letter a year. In these years, Savarkar withdrew within himself and performed his routine tasks mechanically. Obtaining permission to start a rudimentary jail library, Savarkar would also teach some fellow convicts to read and write.

===Mercy Petitions===
Savarkar applied to the Bombay Government for certain concessions in connection with his sentences. However, by Government letter No. 2022, dated 4 April 1911, his Application was rejected and he was informed that the question of remitting the second sentence of transportation for life would be considered in due course on the expiry of the first sentence of transportation for life.&lt;ref name="GoM"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Palande |editor-first=Prof M.R |title=Source Material for a History of the Freedom Movement of India |volume=2 | publisher=Government of Maharashtra |publication-date=1958| publication-place=Maharashtra |page= |url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/VOL-II/REVOLUTIONARY_III.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pg.467}}

Merely a month after arriving in the Cellular Jail, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Savarkar submitted his first mercy petition on 30 August 1911. This petition was rejected on 3 September 1911 &lt;ref name="GoM"/&gt;{{rp|pg.478}}

Savarkar submitted his next mercy petition on November 14, 1913, and presented it personally to the Home Member of the Governor General’s council, Sir Reginald Craddock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Majumdar |first=R.C |date=1975 |title=Penal Settlements in Andamans |location=New Delhi |publisher=Department of culture(Government of India) |pages=211–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, asking for forgiveness, he described himself as a "''prodigal son''" longing to return to the "''parental doors of the government''". He wrote that his release from the jail will recast the faith of many Indians in the British rule. Also he said "''Moreover, my conversion to the constitutional line would bring back all those misled young men in India and abroad who were once looking up to me as their guide. I am ready to serve the government in any capacity they like, for as my conversion is conscientious so I hope my future conduct would be. By keeping me in jail, nothing can be got in comparison to what would be otherwise.''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Savarkar-had-begged-the-British-for-mercy/articleshow/8792427.cms | title=Savarkar had begged the British for mercy | work=Times of India | date=May 3, 2002 | agency=Times of India | accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Savarkar submitted another mercy petition, this time for a general amnesty of all political prisoners. Savarkar was informed on February 1, 1918 that the mercy petition was placed before the British Indian Government&lt;ref name="GoM"/&gt;{{rp|pg.480}}.

In December 1919, there was a Royal proclamation by King Emperor George V. The summary of this proclamation is as follows &lt;ref name="GoM"/&gt;{{rp|pg.469}}
* Paragraph 1: Reference to Acts of 1773, 1784, 1833, 1858, 1861 and 1909—The Act of 1919 entrusts the elected representatives of the people with a definite share in Government and points the way to full responsible Government hereafter.
* Paragraph 2: Mention of what Queen Victoria, King Edward VII and he himself declared between 1858 and 1910.
* Paragraph 3: Britain's desire to make it possible for India to take the control of her domestic affairs on her own shoulders.
* Paragraph 4: Recognition of the political awakening and political aspirations of the people of the country.
* Paragraph 5: Hope that the new legislatures shall succeed.
* Paragraph 6: An appeal to forgive and forget for removing all bitterness and creating an atmosphere of goodwill for the success of the reforms. Declaration of Royal clemency to political offenders.
* Paragraph 7: Reference to Chamber of Princes.
* Paragraph 8: Intention of sending Prince of Wales to visit India to further cordiality of relations between the King and his subjects.

In the view of Royal proclamation, Savarkar submitted his fourth mercy petition to the British Government on 30 March 1920
&lt;ref name="GoM" /&gt;{{rp|pg.472-476}}.

In which he stated that ''"So far from believing in the militant school of the Bukanin type, I do not contribute even to the peaceful and philosophical anarchism of a Kuropatkin [sic.] or a Tolstoy. And as to my revolutionary tendencies in the past:- it is not only now for the object of sharing the clemency but years before this have I informed of and written to the Government in my petitions (1918, 1914) about my firm intention to abide by the constitution and stand by it as soon as a beginning was made to frame it by Mr. Montagu. Since that the Reforms and then the Proclamation have only confirmed me in my views and recently I have publicly avowed my faith in and readiness to stand by the side of orderly and constitutional development."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Noorani |first=A.G |date=April 8, 2005 |title=Savarkar’s Mercy Petition |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2207/stories/20050408001903700.htm |magazine=Frontline |location= |publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This petition was rejected on 12 July 1920 by the British government &lt;ref name="GoM"/&gt;{{rp|pg.477}}. After considering the petition, the British government contemplated releasing Ganesh Savarkar but not Vinayak Savarkar. The rationale for doing so was stated as follows &lt;ref name="GoM" /&gt;{{rp|pg.472}}
{{Quote
|text= It may be observed that if Ganesh is released and Vinayak retained in custody, the latter will become in some measure a hostage for the former, who will see that his own misconduct does not jeopardize his brother's chances of release at some future date.
}}
In 1920, the [[Indian National Congress]] and leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, [[Vithalbhai Patel]] and Bal Gangadhar Tilak demanded his unconditional release. Savarkar signed a statement endorsing his trial, verdict and British law, and renouncing violence, a bargain for freedom.

Jaywant Joglekar, who authored a book euologising Savarkar as 'Father of Hindu Nationalism',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1J3uk3x_k6sC | title=Veer Savarkar Father of Hindu Nationalism| isbn=9781847283801| last1=Joglekar| first1=Jaywant| date=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers Savarkar's appeal for clemency a tactical ploy, like [[Shivaji]]'s letter to [[Aurangzeb]], during his arrest at [[Agra]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, such claims are disputed by others. The Indian historian [[Bipan Chandra]] claimed that post Savarkar's release from jail, he was not an anti-imperialist any longer, and that he accepted the humiliating conditions of his release set forth by the British government, including his non-participation in politics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= |first= |subject-link= |interviewer=Tara Shankar Sahay |title='Savarkar cannot be a role model' |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/mar/03inter.htm |location=New Delhi |date=March 3, 2003 |access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portrait of Savarkar was unveiled in the Indian Parliament in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2003/02/27/stories/2003022705830100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restricted Freedom in Ratnagiri==
On 2 May 1921, the Savarkar brothers were moved to a jail in [[Ratnagiri]], and later to the Yerwada Central Jail. He was finally released on 6 January 1924 under stringent restrictions – he was not to leave [[Ratnagiri District]] and was to refrain from political activities for the next five years. As a political internee in Ratnagiri he demanded an amount of Rs 100 per month. The British Government agreed on a stipend of Rs 60 per month in lieu of his compulsory unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Veer Savarkar Father of Hindu Nationalism|isbn=978-1847283801|page=103|last1=Joglekar|first1=Jaywant|date=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, police restrictions on his activities would not be dropped until provincial autonomy was granted in 1937.
==Leader of the Hindu Mahasabha==

In the wake of the rising popularity of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], Savarkar and his party began gaining attraction in the national political environment. Savarkar moved to Bombay and was elected president of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1937, and would serve until 1943. The Congress swept the polls in 1937 but conflicts between the Congress and Jinnah would exacerbate Hindu-Muslim political divisions. Jinnah derided Congress rule as a "Hindu Raj", and hailed 22 December 1939 as a "[[Day of Deliverance (India)|Day of Deliverance]]" for Muslims when the Congress resigned en masse in protest when the British India Governor-General declared India's inclusion into World War II for the United Kingdom and its allies against Germany and its allies. Savarkar's message of Hindu unity and empowerment gained increasing popularity amidst the worsening communal climate.

Savarkar as president of the Hindu Mahasabha, during the Second World War, advanced the slogan "Hinduize all Politics and Militarize Hindudom", he decided to support the British war effort in India seeking military training for the Hindus.&lt;ref name="Pandey2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gyanendra Pandey|title=Routine violence: nations, fragments, histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bd3kHO-lJ68C&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=3 March 2012|year=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-5264-0|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Congress launched the ''[[Quit India]]'' movement in 1942, Savarkar criticised it and asked Hindus to stay active in the war effort and not disobey the government,&lt;ref name="Rediff"/&gt; he urged the Hindus to enlist in the armed forces to learn the "arts of war".&lt;ref name="BaryBary1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen N Hay, William Theodore De Bary|author2=William Theodore De Bary|title=Sources of Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBWzV-TRXzkC&amp;pg=PA880|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=May 1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Pvt. Ltd)|isbn=978-81-208-0467-8|pages=880–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu Mahasabha activists protested Gandhi's initiative to hold talks with Jinnah in 1944, which Savarkar denounced as "[[appeasement]]." He assailed the British proposals for transfer of power, attacking both the Congress and the British for making concessions to Muslim separatists. Soon after Independence, [[Shyama Prasad Mookerjee|Dr Shyama Prasad]] Mookerjee resigned as Vice-President of the Hindu Mahasabha dissociating himself from its ''Akhand Hindustan'' plank, which implied undoing partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Opposition to Quit India Movement===
Under Savarkar, the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially.&lt;ref name="Bapu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Prabhu Bapu|title=Hindu Mahasabha in Colonial North India, 1915-1930: Constructing Nation and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUFalxUFFWkC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-67165-1|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savarkar even went to the extent of writing a letter titled "'''''Stick to your Posts'''''", in which he instructed Hindu Sabhaites who happened to be "members of municipalities, local bodies, legislatures or those serving in the army...to stick to their posts" across the country, and not to join the Quit India Movement at any cost.&lt;ref name="Bapu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Prabhu Bapu|title=Hindu Mahasabha in Colonial North India, 1915-1930: Constructing Nation and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUFalxUFFWkC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-67165-1|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliance with Muslim League and others===
The [[Indian National Congress]] won a massive victory in the [[Indian provincial elections, 1937]], decimating the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and the Hindu Mahasabha. However, in 1939, the Congress ministries resigned in protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's action of declaring India to be a belligerent in the Second World War without consulting the Indian people. This led to the Hindu Mahasabha, under Savarkar's presidency, joining hands with the Muslim League and other parties to form governments, in certain provinces. Such coalition governments were formed in Sindh, NWFP, and Bengal.

In Sindh, Hindu Mahasabha members joined [[Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah]]'s Muslim League government. In Savarkar's own words,&lt;blockquote&gt;"Witness the fact that only recently in Sind, the Sind-Hindu-Sabha on invitation had taken the responsibility of joining hands with the League itself in running coalition government&lt;ref name="Savarkar1963"&gt;{{cite book |last=Savarkar |first=Vinayak Damodar |date=1963 |title=Collected Works of V.d.

===Civil resistance movement===
[[Hindu Mahasabha]] under the leadership of Savarkar started a [[civil resistance]] movement in March 1939. The objective of the Satyagraha was to secure religious and cultural liberty for the Hindus who at that time constituted 86% of total population of Hyderabad State. Many notable people like [[Senapati Bapat]], [[V. G. Deshpande]], [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani]], Madhavrao Mule, took part in it. The [[Arya Samaj]] also sent around 10000 civil resisters. At last, on July 19, 1939, the [[Nizam]] government announced some political reforms. In the new dispensation, 50% seats were left for non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Veer Savarkar: Father of Hindu Nationalism|last = Joglekar|first = Jaywant|publisher = Lulu.com|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1847283801|location = Internet|pages = 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hindus were the majority in the state and Muslims were in minority, Hindu Mahasabha accepted this proposal. They withdrew the movement despite the fact that these reforms for partial reforms. [[Indian National Congress]] did not support this movement and called it 'communal' and 'anti-national'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Eminent Thinkers: The Political Thought Of Veer Savarkar|last = Sharma|first = Jainayan|publisher = Concept Publishing Company|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New Delhi|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Mahatma Gandhi===
Savarkar was an outspoken critic of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. He criticized Gandhi for being a hypocrite as he supported use of violence by the British against Germany during World War II. He also criticized his appeasement of Muslims at the time of [[Khilafat Movement]].

In articles from the 1920s to the 1940s Savarkar considered Gandhi as a naive leader who "happens to babble...[about] compassion, forgiveness", yet "notwithstanding his sublime and broad heart, the Mahatma has a very narrow and immature head".

===Opposition to the partition of India===

Dr Ambedkar's opinion about Savarkar's position is as follows:

"Strange as it may appear, Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah, instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue, are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but insist, that there are two nations in India—one the Muslim nation and the other the Hindu nation. They differ only as regards the terms and conditions on which the two nations should live. Mr. Jinnah says India should be cut up into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, the Muslim nation to occupy Pakistan and the Hindu nation to occupy Hindustan. Mr. Savarkar on the other hand insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution; that the constitution shall be such that the Hindu nation will be enabled to occupy a predominant position that is due to it and the Muslim nation made to live in the position of subordinate co-operation with the Hindu nation. In the struggle for political power between, the two nations the rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be one man one vote, be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty. The State will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims,/16/ such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population. Thus by confiscating its weightages, Mr. Savarkar would even strip the Muslim nation of all the political privileges it has secured so far.""&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

On 1943 Savarkar himself expressed his strong support for Jinnah's demand for separate nation for Muslims before partition which ended all confusion regarding his view on this matter. On August 15 1943 in Nagpur, he unequivocally said :

"I have no quarrel with Mr Jinnah's two-nation theory. We, Hindus, are a nation by ourselves and it is a historical fact that Hindus and Muslims are two nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Support for Jewish state in Palestine===

Savarkar in a statement issued on 19 December 1947, expressed joy at the recognition of the claim of [[Jewish people]] to establish an independent [[Jewish state]], and likened the event to the glorious day on which [[Moses]] led them out of Egyptian bondage. He considered that justice demanded restoration of entire Palestine to the Jews, their historical holy land and Fatherland. He regretted India's [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine#Against (13 countries, 28% of voting)|vote]] at the [[United Nations]] against the creation of the Jewish state terming the vote a policy of [[appeasement]] of Muslims.&lt;ref name = "Jewishstate"&gt;{{cite web

Following the assassination of Gandhi on 30 January 1948, police arrested the assassin [[Nathuram Godse]] and his alleged accomplices and conspirators. He was a member of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Godse was the editor of ''Agrani - Hindu Rashtra'', a Marathi daily from Pune which was run by the company "The Hindu Rashtra Prakashan Ltd" (The Hindu Nation Publications). This company had contributions from such eminent persons as [[Gulabchand Hirachand]], [[Bhalji Pendharkar]] and [[Jugalkishore Birla]]. Savarkar had invested {{INR}}15000 in the company. Savarkar, a former president of the Hindu Mahasabha, was arrested on 5 February 1948, from his house in [[Shivaji Park Residential Zone|Shivaji Park]], and kept under detention in the [[Arthur Road Jail|Arthur Road Prison]], Mumbai. He was charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and abatement to murder. A day before his arrest, Savarkar in a public written statement, as reported in The Times of India", Mumbai dated 7 February 1948, termed Gandhi's assassination a fratricidal crime, endangering India's existence as a nascent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Due to lack of evidence, Savarkar was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act &lt;ref name="Malgonkar, M."/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 11}}.

===Approver's testimony===

Godse claimed full responsibility for planning and carrying out the assassination. However, according to the Approver Badge, on 17 January 1948, Nathuram Godse went to have a last ''darshan'' (audience/interview) with Savarkar in Bombay before the assassination. While Badge and Shankar waited outside, Nathuram and Apte went in. On coming out Apte told Badge that Savarkar blessed them "''Yashasvi houn ya''" ("''यशस्वी होऊन या''", be successful and return). Apte also said that Savarkar predicted that Gandhi's 100 years were over and there was no doubt that the task would be successfully finished.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Gafoor Abdul Majeed Noorani (2002) ''Savarkar and Hindutva: the Godse connection '' LeftWord Books, {{ISBN|81-87496-28-2}}, {{ISBN|978-81-87496-28-1}} p. 4 &amp; 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mahatma Gandhi--the last phase, Volume 2'' Navajivan Pub. House, 1958 p.752&lt;/ref&gt; However Badge's testimony was not accepted as the approver's evidence lacked independent corroboration and hence Savarkar was acquitted.

In the last week of August 1974, Mr. [[Manohar Malgonkar]] saw [[Digambar Badge|Digamber Badge]] several times and in particular, questioned him about the veracity of his testimony against Savarkar &lt;ref name= "Malgonkar, M."&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Notes}}. Badge insisted to Mr. [[Manohar Malgonkar]] that " even though he had blurted out the full story of the plot as far as he knew, without much persuasion, he had put up a valiant struggle against being made to testify against Savarkar"&lt;ref name="Malgonkar, M." /&gt;{{rp|Chapter 12}}. In the end, Badge gave in. He agreed to say on oath that he saw [[Nathuram Godse]] and Apte with Savarker and that Savarkar, within Badge's hearing, had blessed their venture...&lt;ref name="Malgonkar, M." /&gt;{{rp|Chapter 12}}

Under pressure of 29 members of parliament and public opinion the then Union home minister [[Gulzarilal Nanda]] appointed [[Gopal Swarup Pathak]], M. P. and a senior advocate of the Supreme Court of India as a Commission of Inquiry to re-investigate the conspiracy to murder Gandhi. The central government intended on conducting a thorough inquiry with the help of old records in consultation with the government of Maharashtra.

In these testimonies, it is said that Godse and Apte visited Savarkar on or about 23 or 24 January&lt;ref name="Kapur, J.L." /&gt;{{rp|317}}, which was when they returned from Delhi after the bomb incident. Damle deposed that Godse and Apte saw Savarkar in the middle of January and sat with him (Savarkar) in his garden. The C. I. D.

Moreover, if testimonies of Mr. Kasar and Mr. Damle were so damning then it is not clear why Bombay Police did not produce them before the court during the trial.

The arrest of V. D. Savarkar was mainly based on approver [[Digambar Badge]]'s testimony. The commission did not re-interview [[Digambar Badge]]&lt;ref name="Kapur, J.L." /&gt;. At the time of inquiry of the commission, Badge was alive and working in [[Bombay]].

== Later life and death ==

After Gandhi's assassination Savarkar's home in Dadar, Mumbai was stoned by angry mobs.&lt;ref name="Rediff"/&gt; After he was acquitted of the allegations related to Gandhi's assassination and released from jail, Savarkar was arrested by the government, for making "militant Hindu nationalist speeches", he was released after agreeing to give up political activities. He continued addressing social and cultural elements of Hindutva. He resumed political activism after the ban on it was lifted, it was however limited until his death in 1966 because of ill health. His followers bestowed upon him honours and financial awards when he was alive. Two thousand RSS workers gave his funeral procession a guard of honour. According to McKean, there was public antipathy between Savarkar and the Congress for most of his political career, yet after independence Congress ministers, [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and [[C. D. Deshmukh]] unsuccessfully sought partnership with the Hindu Mahasabha and Savarkar. It was forbidden for Congress party members to participate in public functions honouring Savarkar. [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] refused to share the stage during the centenary celebrations of the [[India's First War of Independence]] held in Delhi. After the independence of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] had put forward a proposal to demolish the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and build a hospital in its place. After the death of Nehru, the Congress government, under Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|Shastri]], started to pay him a monthly pension.{{sfn|McKean|1996|p=94}}

===Death===
On 8 November 1963, Savarkar's wife, Yamuna, died. On 1 February 1966, Savarkar renounced medicines, food and water which he termed as ''atmaarpan'' (fast until death). Before his death he had written an article titled "Atmahatya Nahi Atmaarpan" in which he argued that when one's life mission is over and ability to serve the society is left no more, it is better to end the life at will rather than waiting for death. His condition was described to have become as "extremely serious" before his death on 26 February 1966 at his residence in [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai), and that he faced difficulty in breathing; efforts to revive him failed and was declared dead at 11:10 a.m. ([[Indian Standard Time|IST]]) that day. Prior to his death, Savarkar had asked his relatives to perform only his [[Funeral#Hindu|funeral]] and do away with the rituals of the 10th and 13th day of the Hindu faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Savarkar dead|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YYplAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d54NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=219%2C831059|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=The Indian Express|date=27 February 1966|pages=1, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, his last rites were performed at an electric crematorium in Mumbai's Sonapur locality by his son Vishwas the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Savarkar's last journey|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19660228&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 February 2018|newspaper=The Indian Express|agency=Press Trust of India|date=28 February 1966|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was mourned by large crowds that attended his cremation. He left behind a son Vishwas and a daughter Prabha Chiplunkar. His first son, Prabhakar, had died in infancy. His home, possessions and other personal relics have been preserved for public display{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=January 2016}}.There was no official mourning by the then Congress party government of Maharashtra or at the centre{{sfn|McKean|1996|p=95}}

==Political Views==

===Hindu nationalism===
{{See also|Hindutva}}

During his incarceration, Savarkar's views began turning increasingly towards Hindu cultural and political nationalism, and the next phase of his life remained dedicated to this cause.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web| last = Lal| first = Vinay| date = 22 October 2006

Smuggled out of the prison, it was published by Savarkar's supporters under his alias "Maharatta." In this work, Savarkar promotes a radical new vision of Hindu social and political consciousness. Savarkar began describing a "Hindu" as a patriotic inhabitant of [[Bharatavarsha]],&lt;ref name=Bharat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlshq.org/download/hinduismbk.htm#_VPID_9 |title=Origin of classical name for India - Bharata-Varsha or Bharata-Khanda, used in Sanskrit literature |publisher=Dlshq.org |date= |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; venturing beyond a religious identity.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VDS-09&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haindavakeralam.com/hkpage.aspx?PageID=10485&amp;SKIN=B |title=Feb 26-Atmasamarpan divas of Veer Savarkar |publisher=Haindavakeralam.com |date= |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While emphasising the need for patriotic and social unity of all Hindu communities, he described [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] as one and the same. He outlined his vision of a "[[Hindu Rashtra]]" (''Hindu Nation'') as "[[Akhand Bharat]]" (''United India''), purportedly stretching across the entire [[Indian subcontinent]]. He defined Hindus as being neither [[Aryan race|Aryan]] nor [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] but as "People who live as children of a common motherland, adoring a common holyland."&lt;ref name="Savarkar-1923"&gt;{{cite book|last=Savarkar|first=Vinayak D.|title=Essentials of Hindutva|location=Ratnagiri|year=1923|chapter=Who is a Hindu|url=http://www.savarkar.org/content/pdfs/en/essentials_of_hindutva.v001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another activity he started was to reconvert to Hinduism those who had converted to other faiths. This included the eight members of a Brahmin family named Dhakras who had converted to Christianity.

===Jews===

Savarkar supported the establishment of the [[Jewish state|Jewish State]] of [[Israel]], which was not only in the spirit of his nationalism but also what Savarkar saw in the Jewish state as a barricade against the Muslim Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Partisan Histories: The Past in Contemporary Global Politics|author=M.

===Muslims===
Rachel McDermott, [[Leonard A. Gordon]], [[Ainslie Embree]], Frances Pritchett and [[Dennis Dalton]] state that Savarkar promoted an anti-Muslim form of Hindu nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sources of Indian Traditions: Modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh |editors=Rachel Fell McDermott, Leonard A. Gordon, Ainslie T. Embree, Frances W. Pritchett, Dennis Dalton |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Vinayak Chaturvedi states that Savarkar was known for his anti-Muslim writings.&lt;ref name="Chaturvedi2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chaturvedi |first1=Vinayak |title=Vinayak &amp; me: Hindutva and the politics of naming |journal=Social History |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=155–173 |doi=10.1080/0307102032000082525 |quote=Savarkar had acquired an important public reputation throughout India, especially within the Hindu Mahasabha, for his nationalist and anti-Muslim writings, for his patriotic actions in India and Britain, and for having spent the bulk of his adult life as a political prisoner.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaturvedi2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chaturvedi |first1=Vinayak |title=Rethinking knowledge with action: V.

Savarkar saw Muslims in the Indian police and military to be "potential traitors". He advocated that India reduce the number of Muslims in the military, police and public service and ban Muslims from owning or working in munitions factories.{{sfn|McKean|1996|p=89}}
Savarkar criticized Gandhi for being concerned about Indian Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hinduism, Modernity and Knowledge: India |chapter=International Handbook of Comparative Education |author=Joseph W.

This was omitted in his later writings; his 1925 ''Hindu-pad-paatshahi'' included Hindu heroes but not Muslim ones. In his 1963 ''Six Glorious Epochs'', Savarkar says Muslims and Christians wanted to "destroy" Hinduism.&lt;ref name=shift/&gt;


==Religious views==
Although Savarkar is regarded as a Hindu Nationalist, he professed atheism ([[nastika|''nirīśvaravāda'']]). It should however, be noted that [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism within Hinduism]] is different from its Western counterpart. Many Hindus do not profess belief in deities or a God, as it is not a single religion, but a collection of many diverse philosophies and faiths. Savarkar still had spirituality, and a mystical view of life, and gave great importance to mythology and symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxuJCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=State and Civil Society under Siege: Hindutva, Security and Militarism in India|last=Joshy|first=P.

Savarkar's literary works in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] include "''Kamala''", "''Mazi Janmathep''" (My Life Sentence), and most famously ''1857 - The First War of Independence'', in which Savarkar popularised the term "[[Sepoy Mutiny|First War of Independence]]" for what the British referred to as the "Sepoy Mutiny". Another book was ''Kale Pani'' (''Black Water'' which means "life sentence" on the island prison on the Andaman islands), which reflected the treatment of Indian Independence activists by the British. To counter the then British propagated view that India's history was a saga of continuous defeat, he wrote an inspirational historical work, ''Saha Soneri Pane'' (Six Golden Pages), recounting some of the "Golden periods" of Indian history. At the same time, religious divisions in India were beginning to be exacerbated. He described what he saw as the atrocities of British and Muslims on Hindu residents in Kerala in the book, ''Mopalyanche Band'' (Muslims' Strike) and also ''Gandhi Gondhal'' (Gandhi's Confusion), a political critique of Gandhi's politics. Savarkar, by now, had become a committed and persuasive critic of the Gandhian vision of India's future.

He is also the author of the poems ''Sagara pran talmalala'' (''O Great Sea, My Heart Aches for the Motherland''), and ''Jayostute'' (written in praise of freedom). When in the Cellular jail, Savarkar was denied pen and paper. He composed and wrote his poems on the prison walls with thorns and pebbles, memorised thousands lines of his poetry for years till other prisoners returning home brought them to mainland India. Savarkar is credited with several [[neologisms]] in Marathi and [[Hindi language|Hindi]], including "Hutatma" (Martyr), "Mahapaur" ( Mayor), ''Digdarshak'' (leader or director, one who points in the right direction), ''Shatkar'' (a score of six [[Run (cricket)|run]]s in [[Cricket (game)|cricket]]), ''Saptahik'' (weekly), ''Sansad'' (''Parliament''), "doordhwani" (''telephone''), "tanklekhan" (''typewriting'') among others.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

He chaired [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]] in 1938.

[[Image:Haggis scoticus.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A fictional wild haggis specimen, ''Haggis scotticus'', as displayed in the Glasgow [[Kelvingrove Gallery]], next to a prepared example.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;]] 
'''Wild haggis''' (given the humorous taxonomic designation ''Haggis scoticus'') is a [[fictional creature]] of [[Scottish folklore]],&lt;ref name=green&gt;[[Jonathan Green (speculative fiction writer)|Jonathan Green]], ''Scottish Miscellany: Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Scotland the Brave'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol56FSFMLe4C&amp;pg=PA128 p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt; said to be native to the [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/scotland/glasgow/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154683241450 Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum] in the ''[[New York Times]]'', accessed 9 February 2009 ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221043957/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/scotland/glasgow/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154683241450 |date=21 February 2009 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=article/&gt; It is comically claimed to be the source of [[haggis]], a traditional Scottish dish that is in fact made from the innards of sheep (including heart, lungs, and liver).&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

According to some sources, the wild haggis's left and right legs are of different lengths (cf. [[Sidehill gouger]] or [[Dahu]]), allowing it to run quickly around the steep mountains and hillsides which make up its natural habitat, but only in one direction.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;&lt;ref name=article/&gt; It is further claimed that there are two varieties of haggis, one with longer left legs and the other with longer right legs. The former variety can run clockwise around a mountain (as seen from above) while the latter can run &lt;!-- per MOS please retain UK term anticlockwise, not US term counterclockwise --&gt; anticlockwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/haggis/wildhaggis.html Wild Haggis] at Undiscovered Scotland.co.uk, accessed 9 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The two varieties coexist peacefully but are unable to interbreed in the wild because in order for the male of one variety to mate with a female of the other, he must turn to face in the same direction as his intended mate, causing him to lose his balance before he can mount her. As a result of this difficulty, differences in leg length among the haggis population are accentuated.&lt;ref name=article&gt;A. M. King, L. Cromarty, C. Paterson, J. S. Boyd, "[http://ult.sagepub.com/content/10/2/47.extract Applications of ultrasonography in the reproductive management of Dux magnus gentis venteris saginati]", ''BMUS Bulletin'' (British Medical Ultrasound Society), Vol. 10, no.2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haggis abroad==
The notion of the wild haggis is widely believed, though not always including the idea of mismatched legs. According to an online survey commissioned by haggis manufacturers Hall's of Broxburn, released on 26 November 2003, one-third of U.S. visitors to Scotland believed the wild haggis to be a real creature.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;John Carvel, "[http://travel.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,7445,1093930,00.html Majestic haggis of the glens proves elusive for US tourists]" in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Thursday 27 November 2003 02.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/26/1069825845544.html?from=storyrhs US tourists want to hunt wild haggis]" in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 27 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice '''William Alfred Wearing''' QC (12 November 1816 – 24 February 1875) was a prominent jurist in the Colony of [[South Australia]], who lost his life in the wreck of ''[[SS Gothenburg|S.S. Gothenburg]]''

William A. Wearing was born in London, a son of businessman Christopher Hammond Wearing (ca.1785 – 29 February 1860) and his wife Elizabeth Augusta, née Soulsby. He was educated at Trinity College,&lt;ref name=sketches/&gt; or St John's College,&lt;ref name=adb&gt;'Wearing, William Alfred (1816–1875)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/wearing-william-alfred-4818/text8035, accessed 2 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge, where he took the degree of B.A. He studied law, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1847. He shortly afterwards left for South Australia, following his parents, who had emigrated in 1839. He immediately began practising and it was not long before he was taken into partnership with the Charles Fenn, one of the largest practices in Adelaide. The partnership was dissolved, and Mr. Wearing was appointed Crown Solicitor, but was able to continue in private practice.

In the earlier days of the colony he occasionally took part in colonial politics; working for the election of Mr. (later Judge) Gwynne, and also in securing the return of Dr. Wark.&lt;ref name=sketches/&gt; In 1866 he served on the secret court of inquiry which forced the resignation of Police Commissioner Peter Warburton.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He took an active part in the 1867 sacking of Mr. Justice [[Benjamin Boothby]] and was appointed by the [[Arthur Blyth|Hon.
