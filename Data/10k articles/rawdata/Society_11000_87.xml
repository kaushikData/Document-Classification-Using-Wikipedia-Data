'''Arabs in Bulgaria''' ({{lang-bg|Араби в България}}, {{lang-ar|العرب في بلغاريا}}) are the people from [[Arab countries]], particularly [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Palestinian Territories]], [[Iraq]], and [[Jordan]] and also small groups from [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Sudan]], who emigrated from their native nations and currently reside in Bulgaria. Most Arab Bulgarians are of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] or Syrian origin, because they were the first Arabs to arrive in Bulgaria. The first Arabs came to Bulgaria in the late 1960s and early 1970s as students in Bulgarian universities. In the over forty-year history of this community, 11,400 Arabs have migrated to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;http://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/10375/BU&lt;/ref&gt; According to other data from two teams of anthropologists and sociologists, the number of Arabs in Bulgaria who are legal residents and officially have work permits was 17,000 in 2004. (the number 17,000 includes not only Arabs but also Kurds, Iranians, Afghans, Berber and others.)&lt;ref name="Imir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imir-bg.org/imir/books/Imigraciata%20v%20Balgaria.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219164418/http://www.imir-bg.org/imir/books/Imigraciata%20v%20Balgaria.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://ruslantrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/imigraciata-v-balgaria1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Bulgaria has people from Arab countries, who have the status of refugees ([[refugees of the Syrian civil war]], but only 10% of them are Syrian Arabs, the other 90% of them are [[Kurds in Syria|Syrian Kurds]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standartnews.com/mneniya-intervyuta/90_ot_begaltsite_ot_siriya_sa_kyurdi-210525.html 90% от бегълците от Сирия са кюрди&lt;/ref&gt;) or illegal immigrants (Algerians of mainly Berber descent and usually mistakenly called Arabs) trying to immigrate to Western Europe.

The '''Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award''' is an award that recognizes registered nurses and other non-physician, clinical, health care professionals who work directly with patients in the United States. The award invites anyone to nominate a health care professional for exceptional service, sacrifice or innovation. The award is named after Cherokee Uniforms, a designer, manufacturer and distributor of uniforms, [[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]] and lab coats worn by health care, dental and veterinary professionals internationally.

== History ==

Cherokee Uniforms created the award in 2003 to increase national awareness of health care professionals who serve patients, co-workers and communities in ways that would be considered exceptional by the general public and health care industry. In its inaugural year, the award was bestowed on ten health care professionals: a nurse practitioner and nine registered nurses. In 2003, 526 persons were nominated. In 2007, 1,019 persons were nominated. Since its inception in 2003, 5,400 health care professionals and student nurses have been nominated for the award. All of the award’s recipients are described on [http://inspiredcomfort.com/recipients.php].

=== Notable recipients ===

*'''2003 - Mona Counts, PhD, CRNP, FNAP, FAANP,''' a recipient of the inaugural 2003 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award, was honored for taking out a second mortgage on her home to fund the creation of a clinic (the Mt. Morris [[Primary Care Clinic]]) to serve the general health care needs of the 5,000 Appalachian residents in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Nurse practitioners provide most of the health care services at the rural clinic under the direction of Counts, a nurse practitioner and the Elouise Ross Eberly Professor of Nursing at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] School of Nursing.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In July 2004, Reader’s Digest profiled Counts as an “Everyday Hero”, which features “ordinary citizens who perform extraordinary acts at great personal risk or sacrifice.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; In 2004, Counts was elected to serve a two-year term as President-Elect of the [[American Academy of Nurse Practitioners]], from 2005 through 2007. Counts was featured in ''A Nurse I Am'', a two-film project, produced in 2006 for nurses and nursing students, funded by Cherokee Uniforms. More at [http://www.inspiredcomfort.com/2003/index.php?ica=2003&amp;page=counts] (Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award website)
*'''2003 - Mandy Larson, RN,''' a recipient of the 2003 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award, nearly lost her life as a Good Samaritan. Following her shift as a clinical nurse specialist in the neonatal intensive care unit at [[Medical University of South Carolina]]’s Children’s Hospital, Larson was visiting her husband at the hospital-based ambulance service when an accident occurred nearby. When they ran to help, the uninjured motorist aimed a handgun at Larson and fired five times. Bullets hit her in the hip, arm and shoulder. She lost two liters of blood and credited her husband, an EMT, with saving her life. A hospital flight nurse and a police officer died of gunshot wounds. Following numerous surgeries, she returned to work.
*'''2004 - Susan Fleming, RN,''' was a recipient of a 2004 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award. After four years as a nursing aide, Fleming applied to nursing school. A prosthesis took the place of her left hand and allowed her to accomplish most tasks without assistance. Susan is earning a master’s degree in nursing while working as a nurse in the Pacific Northwest. Susan advocates for nurses with disabilities as a board member of the non-profit ExceptionalNurse.com. More at [http://www.exceptionalnurse.com]. (Organization's website)
*'''2005 - Michelle Hokanson,''' was studying to become a nurse when she received a Grand Prize in the 2005 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award for an honor’s project at Montgomery College, in Conroe, Texas. After learning that all cultures do not express pain in the same manner, she developed two pain-assessment scales to help nurses accurately understand and manage patients’ pain: one for Hispanic females, another for African-American males. The scale uses photographs of people whose body language expresses physical pain. The project received the college’s top award, and Hokanson maintained a 4.0 GPA in nursing courses while also working full-time at a local hospital and volunteered in a hospice.

== About the Award ==

The award is offered annually. Nominations are submitted by entering the names and occupational-specific information about the nominee into the award-nomination process via electronic or paper nomination forms which are hosted on [http://www.inspiredcomfort.com] (the award’s website). The nomination period is from March 1 through May 31, and recipients are announced on the award’s website and in the U.S. media in late September.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The award has five nomination categories: [[advanced practice nurse]]s, registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses/ licensed practical nurses, students who are enrolled in schools of nursing, and other non-physician, clinical, health care professionals who work directly with patients.

Recipients may be chosen in each nomination category. The number of recipients chosen in a given year depends on the quality of nominations that are submitted. In 2006, there were eleven recipients: two advanced practice nurses, four registered nurses, two licensed vocational nurses/ licensed practical nurses, two nursing students, and one non-physician health care professional. There are three levels of prize winners: grand prize winners, top national winners and national winners. Typically, there is one grand prize winner and one top national winner in each nomination category. The number of national winners in each category depends on the quality of the nominations received.

=== Award Features ===

Recipients of each year’s Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award appear in the following year’s calendar, distributed to schools of nursing, professional associations and health care employers, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The calendars also are distributed through retailers who sell health care uniforms. Calendars include a photography portrait of each of the preceding year’s recipients, an inspirational quotation, and health care professional awareness and recognition days and weeks. Calendars are free of charge.

Cherokee promotes the recipients of the Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award in the national media, to media serving the health care professions, and to media serving each recipient’s geographic areas. Media coverage of the awards has appeared in Nurseweek, Nursing Spectrum, [http://nursing.advanceweb.com/Article/Colorado-Nurse-Wins-National-Cherokee-Inspired-Comfort-Award.aspx Advance For Nurses], [http://lpn.advanceweb.com/Article/Cherokee-Uniforms-Calls-for-LPN-Nominations.aspx Advance For LPNs], [http://nurse-practitioners.advanceweb.com/Article/Cherokee-Award-Nomination-Period-Open.aspx Advance For Nurse Practitioners], [http://physical-therapy.advanceweb.com/Article/Industry-News-83.aspx Advance For Physical Therapists and Physical Therapy Assistants], the Baltimore Sun, and Reader’s Digest. Health care associations, state and specialty nurses associations, and associations of other kinds of professional and educational associations promote the award to members in member communications vehicles and on their websites.

=== Judging Process ===

A panel of nurse leaders, Cherokee management personnel, and former award recipients choose recipients who best meet the program’s key requirements of exceptional service, sacrifice and innovation.

=== Prizes ===

The grand prize winner in each nomination category receives an all-expense-paid Caribbean cruise for two. Additional winners in each category receive all-expense-paid trips to a medical conference of each winner’s choice, an annual membership to their preferred clinical association and a donation of $500 to the nonprofit organization of their choice.

Every award winner receives a trophy, Cherokee medical uniforms and Rockers Footwear worth more than $1,000 (if purchased from a retailer), a gold Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award insignia pin, and a profile in a nationally distributed calendar. Those who nominate the grand prize winner in each category receive Cherokee medical uniforms and a donation of $500 to the nonprofit organization of their choice.

== ''A NURSE I AM'' ==

=== An Inspirational Film ===

Alarmed at the disturbing number of nurses leaving the profession within their first few years in practice, Cherokee Uniforms provided a grant to Emmy Award and Peabody Award-winning director [[David Hoffman (filmmaker)|David Hoffman]] to create a film for nurses and nursing students that would encourage, inspire and instruct. Hoffman completed two films with the same title: ''A Nurse I Am.''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; One, a 32-minute educational film, features four former recipients of the Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award as role models who adhere to accepted nursing practices and who exhibit compassion and commitment toward patients. Read about Hoffman’s motivation behind making the film at [http://www.anurseiam.com/david_hoffman.php]. The film follows the nurses as they treat patients and provide recommendations on how to survive and succeed in the nursing profession.

The educational version of the film was created as a tool for instructors to use in classrooms in schools of nursing and includes a classroom discussion guide for instructors. This version of the film received endorsements from the Ohio Nurses Association, the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses, the [[American Assembly for Men in Nursing]], Nurses House, Inc., and the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners. (The endorsements are printed on the cover insert of the DVD containing only the educational version.) More than 100 schools of nursing in the U.S. use the educational version of the film as part of their teaching curricula. These include the schools of nursing at Yale University, [[Michigan State University]], [[Indiana State University]], University of Texas, [[North Dakota State University]], [[New Mexico State University]], [[Seattle Pacific University]], University of Alabama, University of Alaska, and University of Washington. A comprehensive list is at [http://www.anurseiam.com/for_educators.php?alt_page=2] (film website).
A second film, a 62-minute documentary with the same title, follows the personal and professional lives of three of the nurses featured in the educational version. The documentary reveals what motivates these nurses to pursue excellence despite difficult challenges and shows how these nurses maintain personal balance within careers filled with high pressure and disappointments. Watch a 7-minute clip of the film on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDfKEHHMInY].
More about the film at [http://www.ANurseIAm.com] (film’s website).

=== ''A NURSE I AM'' Scholarship ===

Cherokee Uniforms established the A Nurse I Am Scholarship Program in 2006, and the first 10 winners were awarded $2,000 checks in 2007. Applicants were required to watch either version of the film A Nurse I Am and to submit an essay describing what the film meant to them.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''civic society''' is a voluntary body or society which aims to represent the needs of a local community. Some also take the role of an [[amenity society]].

A civic society may campaign for high standards of [[Urban planning|planning]] of new buildings or traffic schemes, conservation of historic buildings, and may present awards for good standards. They may organise [[litter]] collections or "best kept village" cleanups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicsocieties.org.uk/faqs/what-does-a-civic-society-do/ Civic Societies - FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic Voice==
[http://www.civicvoice.org.uk/ Civic Voice] replaced the former [[Civic Trust (England) |Civic Trust]] and acts as an umbrella organisation for a large number of local civic and amenity societies.

'''Communibiology''' is a term referring to a research paradigm that emphasizes the "[[neurobiological]] foundations of human communication behavior".&lt;ref name=Heisel1999&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heisel | first1 = A. D. | last2 = McCroskey | first2 = J. C. | last3 = Richmond | first3 = V. P. | title = Testing theoretical relationships and non-relationships of genetically-based predictors: Getting started with communibiology | journal = Communication Research Reports | volume = 16 | pages = 1 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1080/08824099909388695}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communibiologists take the nature side of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate in communication development. The communibiological paradigm was developed by Beatty and McCroskey as an alternative to the nature side supporting [[social learning theory|social learning paradigm]].&lt;ref name=BeattyMcCroskey2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McCroskey | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Beatty | first2 = M. J. | title = The communibiological perspective: Implications for communication in instruction | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 1 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379187}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe [[genetics]] to be far more important in the development of [[communication behavior]] than [[learning process]]es and the environment.&lt;ref name=BeattyMcCroskey2000 /&gt;   These researchers do concede, however, that genetic factors are not the sole source of communication behavior. One accepted ratio is 20% influence of cultural, situational, or environmental stimuli and 80% influence of inborn, neurobiological structures on behavior.&lt;ref name=BeattyMcCroskey2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BorenVeksler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boren|first=Justin P.|author2=Veksler, Alice E.|title=A decade of research exploring biology and communication: The brain, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems|journal=Communication Research Trends|year=2011|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1–31|url=http://justinboren.com/pdf/CRT_v30_n4.pdf|issn=0144-4646}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A main idea of communibiology is that [[temperament]]s are based on genetics and not learned. Communication behavior is an expression of a person's temperament, though the behavior and the temperament do not completely correlate with one another.&lt;ref name=McCroskey2006 /&gt; Identical genetics producing identical temperaments may result in non-identical communication behaviors because one's temperament can be expressed in various ways. The behaviors, though, will be very similar.&lt;ref name=McCroskey2006 /&gt;

==Influences on the communibiological paradigm==

===Hans Eysenck's personality theory===
[[Hans Eysenck]] found that the two main aspects of [[personality]] are temperament and [[intelligence]]. He identified three personality types:
*[[Extraversion and introversion|Extraversion]] –sociable, lively, active, assertive, sensation-seeking, carefree dominant, surgent and venturesome.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = L. | last2 = Keaten | first2 = J. A. | title = Treating communication anxiety: Implications of the communibiological paradigm | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 45 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neuroticism]] – [[anxiety|anxious]], [[depression (mood)|depressed]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] feelings, [[low self-esteem]], tense, irrational, shy, moody emotional.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;
*[[Psychoticism]] – [[aggressive]], cold, [[ego-centric]], impersonal, [[impulsive behaviour|impulsive]], [[anti-social beahviour|antisocial]], unempathic, creative, and tough-minded.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;
Eysenck argues that these three personalities are inherited&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt; lending it useful to the communibiological paradigm. Other research has also found that the genetic component of these three personalities is between 50% and 80%.&lt;ref name=Heisel1999 /&gt;

===J.A. Gray's theory of neuropsychology of temperament===
J.A. Gray proposed a [[behavioral inhibition system]] (BIS) and a [[behavioral activation system]] (BAS). The threshold for activation of the BIS or BAS is inherited.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;

===Cary Horvath's twins study===
Horvath compared identical and [[fraternal twins]] in order to determine if communicator styles were inherited.  This was the first study of heredity and communication and it found that communicator style variables are partially inherited,&lt;ref name=Horvath1995&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = C. W. | title = Biological origins of communicator style | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 394–407 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1080/01463379509369987}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading the way for the future studies regarding inheritance and communication behavior.

==Model for communibiological research (as used by Beatty, et al.)==
#Select or create a theory that proposes an explanation for an aspect of human communication behavior.
#Relate the theory to specific biological elements or [[biological process|processes]].
#Select or create a measure related to those biological elements or processes.
#Establish a relationship between the measurements, human communication behavior, and biological elements or processes.&lt;ref name=Heisel1999 /&gt;

==Opponents==
There exist many opponents to the communibiological paradigm. First are the "nurture" and social learning paradigm supporters that believe learning has more to do with communication behavior than genetics. Then there are others who believe the whole argument is pointless. Condit calls for a multi-causal model that would incorporate both nature and nurture. Condit also claims that the 80% genetic influence found by Beatty and McCroskey lacks solid evidence and a number in the 40-60% range is more likely, helping to support her view of incorporating both nature and nurture.&lt;ref name=Condit2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Condit | first1 = C. M. | title = Culture and biology in human communication: Toward a multi-causal model | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 7–9 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communibiological perspective on communication apprehension==
[[Communication apprehension]] afflicts millions of people worldwide. Much of the communibiological research done on communication apprehension has found that the causes of the affliction are inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, C. (2016). Student oral presentations: developing the skills and reducing the apprehension. In: Proceedings of 10th International Technology, Education and Development Conference Valencia, Spain. 7-9 March, 2016. IATED (2016). IATED, Valencia, Spain, pp. 1474-1483. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297715071_Student_oral_presentations_developing_the_skills_and_reducing_the_apprehension&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatty and McCroskey===
Beatty and McCroskey first developed their communibiological paradigm in order to more effectively diagnose communication apprehension. Using [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]]'s personality theory they identified the primary components of communication apprehension to be introversion and neuroticism.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt; They also used Gray's theory to say that activation of the behavioral inhibition system is related to anxiety.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt; They make note that both the personalities of Eysenck's theory and the activation threshold of the BIS in Gray's theory have been found to be inherited. Differences in communication apprehension correspond to differences in BIS activation threshold,&lt;ref name=BeattyValencic2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beatty | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Valencic | first2 = K. M. | title = Context-based apprehension versus planning demands: A communibiological analysis of anticipatory public speaking anxiety | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 58 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379193}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the idea that communication apprehension is genetically determined.

===Interpersonal communication motives===
Interpersonal communication motives explain why people with communication apprehension communicate the way they do. People with low communication apprehension communicate for [[pleasure]], [[affection]], control, and [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] while people with high communication apprehension communicate for [[social inclusion|inclusion]] and escape.&lt;ref name=PaulselMottet2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paulsel | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Mottet | first2 = T. P. | title = Interpersonal communication motives: A communibiological perspective | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 182 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1080/01463370409370189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulsel and Mottet (2004)&lt;ref name=PaulselMottet2004 /&gt; found that interpersonal communication motives such as these are at least a partially influenced by genetically inherited traits.

===Communication apprehension in second languages===
Jung and McCroskey (2004)&lt;ref name=JungMcCroskey2004 /&gt; studied the presence of communication apprehension in those speaking their [[first language]] and those speaking their [[second language]]. Communication apprehension in the first language predicted communication apprehension in the second language. This combated the social learning perspective which would say that the learning of the second language would influence and change the communication apprehension in the second language. They concluded that communication apprehension is a cross-linguistic trait and that the trait is genetically inherited.&lt;ref name=JungMcCroskey2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jung | first1 = H. Y. | last2 = McCroskey | first2 = J. C. | title = Communication apprehension in a first language and self-perceived competence as predictors of communication apprehension in a second language: A study of speakers of English as a second language | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 170 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1080/01463370409370188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
The fact that the causes of communication apprehension are inherited has major implications in how it can be treated as some believe that if communication apprehension is genetically inherited then it cannot be changed. Others contend, as Beatty and McCroskey did, that since traits are not exclusively genetically inherited, treatment is viable. Treatment in terms of the communibiological paradigm involves learning to control the negative aspects of one's inherited temperament.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;

==The role of culture==
Comminubiologists argue that people are born with specific temperaments based on their genetics. This does not, however, mean that they do not learn. [[Culture]] plays an important role in this learning process. While they are born with a certain temperament a person learns how to respond to specific temperamental demands based on the culture they are surrounded by.&lt;ref name=McCroskey2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1= McCroskey|first1= James C.|year= 2006|title= The Role of Culture in a Communibiological Approach to Communication|journal= Human Communication|volume= 9|issue= 1|pages= 31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children they learn which temperamental actions are appropriate and which are not. So while the basis of a person's communication behavior is based on genetics, a good portion of their behavior is also affected by the culture they are raised in. In fact, the communication behaviors [[ethnocentrism]] and [[homophobia]] were found to have no relationship with a person's [[genetic make-up]] or temperament.&lt;ref name=McCroskeyWrench2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wrench | first1 = J. S. | last2 = McCroskey | first2 = J. C. | title = A communibiological examination of ethnocentrism and homophobia | journal = Communication Research Reports | volume = 20 | pages = 24 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1080/08824090309388796}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traits are instead developed through culture.

'''Crime in Germany''' is combated by the [[Law enforcement in Germany|German Police]] and other agencies.

==By type==
In Germany's 2010 crime statistics, 5.93 million criminal acts were committed, down two percent from 2009.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15093336,00.html Crime rate drops to record low], Deutsche Welle. Retrieved June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Interior Ministry, it is the first time the figure has fallen below six million offenses since 1991 (the year after [[Reunification of Germany|reunification]]), and is the lowest crime level since records began.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; The rate of crimes solved in 2010 was 56 percent, a record high, up from 2009's 55.6%.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

Internet related crime climbed 8.1 percent in 2010, with around 224,000 reported cases.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; The number of homes broken into in 2010 was also up by 6.6 percent.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
According to 2015 statistics, there were 127 000 victims of domestic violence (German: ''Häusliche Gewalt)'' of which 82% were female. This represented a rise of 5.5% over 2012 statistics. The most common crime is bodily harm: a slap or a strike enough to be prosecuted but often are not. The two next most common crimes were threats (14.4%) and grievous bodily harm (German: ''schwere Körperverletzung'') or injury with deadly outcome (German: ''Verletzung mit Todesfolge'') at 12%. A fourth of the suspects [[Alcohol|were drunk]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fr.de/panorama/kriminalstatistik-haeusliche-gewalt-gegen-frauen-nimmt-zu-a-291373|title=Kriminalstatistik: Häusliche Gewalt gegen Frauen nimmt zu|last=Rundschau|first=Frankfurter|work=Frankfurter Rundschau|access-date=2018-11-09|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex partner victims were mostly targeted by [[stalking]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Murder===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2011, Germany had a murder rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html|title=UNODC: Global Study on Homicide|author=agt|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized crime==
In 2017, statistics suggested that German citizens constitute the largest group of suspects in organised crime trials. The proportion of non-German citizen suspects increased from 67.5% to 70.7% from the previous year. 14.9% of the German citizens involved held a different citizenship at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/JahresberichteUndLagebilder/OrganisierteKriminalitaet/organisierteKriminalitaetBundeslagebild2017.html;jsessionid=A99EC3231788A672D2AEA397F21B1FEC.live2302?nn=27988|title=BKA - Bundeslagebilder Organisierte Kriminalität - Bundeslagebild Organisierte Kriminalität 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bka.de|page=13|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab mafia===
''[[Die Welt]]'' reported in 2016 that Berlin and Bremen have significant problems with organised crime in the form of "Arab Families," of which seven to nine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/kriminelle-clans-versuchen-gezielt-fluechtlinge-zu-rekrutieren_id_5424369.html|title=Kriminelle Clans versuchen gezielt Flüchtlinge zu rekrutieren|date=10 April 2016|work=Focus Online|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are criminally conspicuous and today "control most of organised crime."  For example, the prostitutes in the [[Schöneberg]] neighbourhood are controlled by one family.  Disputes are solved through mutually agreed mediators, who can include imams and heads of families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Behrendt|first1=Michael|title=Berlin Underworld is lost to the Arab clans - Berlins Unterwelt ist verloren an die arabischen Clans|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article154174175/Berlins-Unterwelt-ist-verloren-an-die-arabischen-Clans.html|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=10 April 2016|quote=Berlin hat, neben Bremen, große Probleme mit kriminellen arabischen Großfamilien. Laut Behörden gibt es in Berlin 15 bis 20 Großfamilien, von denen sieben bis neun kriminell auffällig sind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian organized crime===
The [['Ndrangheta]], [[Camorra]] and [[Sicilian Mafia|Cosa Nostra]] all operate in Germany; the 'Ndrangheta has the strongest presence. There are some estimated 1200 members of the Ndrangheta active in Germany, mostly in the cocaine trade. Apart from the Ndrangheta, the Neapolitan Camorra has also infiltrated the construction industry in Germany. Furthermore, there are also five Sicilian Mafia groups active in the country, but they seem to have lost power.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/kriminalitaet-geheim-und-unsichtbar/1020726.html|title=Kriminalität: Geheim und unsichtbar - Welt - Tagesspiegel|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Italian crime groups can mostly be found in the [[Ruhr]] district and in the west of Germany.

===Outlaw motorcycle gangs===
OMCGs such as [[Hells Angels]], [[Bandidos]], [[Gremium Motorcycle Club|Gremium]] and more recently, [[Satudarah]], [[Night Wolves]] are active throughout Germany. While not all members of motorcycle clubs are criminal, some are reputed to be well known faces in the [[red-light districts]] and in the [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]-scene who control a large chunk of the drug trade within bars and clubs.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel.de"/&gt;

===Albanian mafia===
{{see also|Albanian mafia}}
[[Albanian mafia]] families are active in some of the German urban centres, in particular [[Hamburg]]. They play an important role in the drug trade and the red light districts of the country.

"Ethnic Albanians" (as the German police officially calls them), who come into Germany typically from Albania or the Republic of Macedonia or Kosovo, have created for a very short time in the last decade of the century, a very powerful criminal network, says Manfred Quedzuweit, director of the Police Department for Fighting the Organized Crime in Hamburg. "Here, it could be heard that they are even more dangerous than Cosa Nostra. Albanian "banks" in Germany are a special story. They are used for the transfer of money from Germany, which amounts to a billion of D-marks a year.

One of these banks was discovered by accident by the Düsseldorf police while checking a travel agency "Eulinda" owned by the Albanians. "We haven't found a single travel related catalogue or brochure at the agency. The computers were nonfunctional, the printer had never been used. We found that "Eulinda" was a coverup for some other business", said high criminal counselor from Düsseldorf Rainer Bruckert. "Eventually we found out that "Eulinda" had already transferred $150 million to Kosovo—for 'humanitarian purposes'", says Bruckert. "Money was being transferred by the couriers in special waist belts with multiple pockets. So, in a single one-way trip, it was possible to carry up to six million D-marks." {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

BND reports state that Albanian Mafia activities are thoroughly spread throughout Germany. One mafia family in Hamburg, for instance, according to BND reports, has over "300 million euros in real estate portfolios". Further, the clan has considerable ties to police, judges and prosecutors in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/panorama/artikeldetail/artikel/mafia-banden-regieren-den-kiez-in-hamburg.html|title=Mörderischer Norden: Mafia-Banden regieren den Kiez in Hamburg - shz.de|author=Klaus Lohmann, Schleswig-Holstein am Sonntag|date=15 May 2012|work=shz|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to British criminal Colin Blaney in his autobiography 'Undesirables', Albanian criminals in Germany also frequently come to blows with British criminals who operate in the nation. Albanian people traffickers have been involved in confrontations with an English organized crime group known as the Wide Awake Firm, including an incident in which a member of the English group was stabbed through the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |pages=294–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian mafia===
Russian-speaking crime groups, in particular the [[Tambov gang]] are active in cities such as [[Düsseldorf]]. Especially [[money laundering]], [[prostitution]] and [[extortion]] seem to be their activities of choice. ''Russian'' criminal activity doesn't only concern ethnic [[Russians]] but also [[Russian Jews]] which was evident with the arrest of Mikhail Rabo, a senior member of the Jewish community in Berlin and a high-ranking member of the Tambov gang.&lt;ref name="wz-newsline.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wz-newsline.de/home/politik/nrw/organisierte-kriminalitaet-italienische-mafia-nur-auf-platz-6-1.471446|title=Organisierte Kriminalität|author=Von Horst Kuhnes|date=20 August 2007|work=Westdeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the ''Russian'' groups, [[Georgian people|Georgian]], [[Armenians|Armenia]] and [[Chechens|Chechen]] crime groups are active in Germany as well. Very often these gangs and the ''Russian'' groups are named together in one breath even when they have little to do with each other.

Another major form of ''Russian-speaking'' organized crime in Germany consists of so-called criminal ''Aussiedler'' families. ''Aussiedlers'' are ethnic [[Germans]] (also called [[Volga Germans]]) that were born in the former Soviet Union. While a lot of ''Aussiedlers'' adapted well and quickly mastered the German language, a lot of families held unto the traditional lifestyle they lived in [[Russia]] and surrounding states. This led to the formation of individual as well as clan-based groups of ''Aussiedlers'' involved in organized criminal activities such as [[drug trafficking]], [[extortion]], [[prostitution]], as well as extreme violence. Due to the large number of ''Aussiedlers'' they are seen as the major form of ''Russian'' organized crime in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/So-herrscht-die-Russen-Mafia-im-Gefaengnis-id6990716.html|title=Prozess in Augsburg: So herrscht die Russen-Mafia im Gefängnis - Nachrichten Bayern |work=Augsburger Allgemeine|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbian mafia===
The [[Zemun clan]] is active in Germany in [[drug trafficking]] and [[prostitution]]. Members are largely ethnic [[Serbs]], some of them former soldiers, but [[Montenegrins]] and [[Bosniaks]] from the Serbian region of [[Sandzak]] are part of the ex-Yugoslavian gangs as well.&lt;ref name="wz-newsline.de"/&gt;

===Turkish organized  crime===
''Turkish'' crime groups which consist of ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Laz people|Laz]] and [[Kurds]] from Turkey are active throughout Germany in [[extortion]], [[weapon trafficking]] and [[drug trafficking]]. Often the gangs can be linked to political groups from their home country, such as the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] for right-wing [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Dev Sol]] for left-wing [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]].&lt;ref name="wz-newsline.de"/&gt;

In 2014, the annual report into organized crime, presented in [[Berlin]] by interior minister Thomas de Maizière, showed that there were 57 Turkish and 4 Kurdish gangs in Germany. According to the report, alongside their more traditional fields of drug smuggling, gangs are also increasingly turning their attention to burglary, car theft and fraud. Ten percent of Germany's gang members were reported to be [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and according to statistics, the activity of [[Turkish gangs in Germany]] had decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Organisierte Kriminalität|url=http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Nachrichten/Pressemitteilungen/2014/09/bundeslagebild_2013_ok.pdf;jsessionid=DFA1E5D3C23FC33616FE40FE6CA6A1D3.2_cid295?__blob=publicationFile|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Organized crime on the rise in Germany|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20141002/organized-crime-on-the-rise-in-germany-mafia|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=www.thelocal.de|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[Die Welt]]'' and ''[[Bild]]'' reported that new Turkish motorbike gang, the Osmanien Germania is growing rapidly. The Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper claimed that the Osmanien Germania is advancing more and more into red-light districts, which increases the likelihood of a bloody territorial battle with established gangs like the [[Hells Angels]] Motorcycle Club and the [[Mongols Motorcycle Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Working Out with a Notorious German Biker Gang |url=https://www.vice.com/read/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=Vice|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Osmanen drängen ins Rotlichtmilieu und fordern Rockerclubs heraus – HAZ |url=http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Panorama/Uebersicht/Osmanen-draengen-ins-Rotlichtmilieu-und-fordern-Rockerclubs-heraus|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rockergruppe Osmanen Germania wächst rasant|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/nrw/article151711765/Rockergruppe-Osmanen-Germania-waechst-rasant.html|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=Welt Online|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turek|first1=Zlatan Alihodzic und Michael|title=Polizeieinsatz in mehreren Städten gegen "Osmanen Germania"|url=https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/nachrichten-aus-dinslaken-huenxe-und-voerde/polizeieinsatz-in-mehreren-staedten-gegen-osmanen-germania-id11745728.html|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=WAZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frigelj|first1=Kristian|title="Wir kommen und übernehmen das ganze Land"|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article152291068/Wir-kommen-und-uebernehmen-das-ganze-Land.html|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=Welt Online|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warum sehe ich Bild.de nicht|url=http://www.bild.de/wa/ll/bild-de/unangemeldet-42925516.bild.html|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=Bild.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Eastern crime clans===

Middle Eastern crime clans have become a major player in the underworld of Germany since the mass emigration of large Middle Eastern families, also called ''Großfamilie''. Especially in cities such as [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]] Middle Eastern clans are highly active in the trafficking of [[heroin]] as well as being involved in the [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]-scene. Middle Eastern crime families mostly have origins in [[Lebanon]], [[Afghanistan]] (mainly in Hamburg) and [[Morocco]] (mostly in Frankfurt).

Middle Eastern crime clans come from different backgrounds, but the most numerous of them are the Lebanese [[Mhallami]] clans such as the [[Al-Zein Clan]] and the [[Miri clan]] among others.

==== Lebanese gangs ====
Lebanese clans are active in [[drug trafficking]], including Afghan [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], [[hashish]] and [[methamphetamine]], [[weapon trafficking]], [[extortion]], [[prostitution]] and [[loan sharking]]. The main center of Lebanese organized crime in Germany is [[Berlin]], with other clans spread in [[Bremen]] and [[Essen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/kriminalitaet-sturz-des-praesidenten_aid_210228.html|title=Kriminalität: Sturz des "Präsidenten"|date=1 May 2005|work=Focus Online|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article121065099/Eine-Familie-tief-verstrickt-ins-Verbrechen.html|title=Miri-Clan: Eine Familie, tief verstrickt ins Verbrechen|author=Per Hinrichs|date=21 October 2013|work=Die Welt|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Afghan gangs ====
Afghan clans (often of [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] background) are active in [[Hamburg]], a city with a large Afghan population. Like the [[Turkish mafia|Turkish]] and [[Turkish mafia|Turkish-Kurdish]] as well as [[Albanian mafia|Albanian]] gangs in the city, Afghan organized crime is active in [[hashish]] and [[heroin]] trafficking, [[extortion]] and [[prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mopo.de/news/schutzgeld-gang-plante-uebernahme-des-lokstedter-bordells-machtkampf-im-milieu--sie-wollten-alles,5066732,6205364.html|title=Schutzgeld-Gang plante Übernahme des Lokstedter Bordells: Machtkampf im Milieu: Sie wollten alles|work=Mopo.de|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mopo.de/nachrichten/blutige-afghanen-fehde-bandenkrieg-in-hamburg-wegen-nacktfotos-auf-facebook,5067140,25141510.html|title=Blutige Afghanen-Fehde: Bandenkrieg in Hamburg wegen Nacktfotos auf Facebook|work=Mopo.de|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moroccan gangs ===
Moroccan organized crime groups, often of [[Riffian people|Riffian]] descent, on the other hand have been reported in [[Frankfurt]]. Next to [[Serbian mafia]] and Balkan gangs, Moroccan organized crime has become one of the main factors in the Frankfurt underworld active in the [[heroin]] trade as well as other criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/frankfurt/drogenhandel/rache-im-bahnhofsviertel-16200174.bild.html|title=Rache geschworen: Droht ein Drogenkrieg im Bahnhofsviertel?|author=Max Schneider und Jürgen Mahnke (Fotos)|work=Bild.de|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnamese crime groups===

Vietnamese groups active in [[human trafficking]] and [[cigarette smuggling]] have been reported in Germany. Chinese Triads on the other hand have been reported but don't seem to have substantial power in Germany.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel.de"/&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Main|Corruption in Germany}}

[[Transparency International]]’s Global corruption barometer 2013 reveals that [[Political parties in Germany|political parties]] and businesses are the most corrupt institutions in [[Germany]]. The same report also indicates that [[petty corruption]] is not as uncommon as other [[Europe]]an countries. The survey shows that 11% of the respondents claim to have been asked to pay a bribe at one point in their life and only few of those said that they had refused to pay the bribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Immigration and crime in Germany}}In 2018, the [[The Wall Street Journal|''Wall Street Journal'']] analysed German crime statistics for crime suspects and found that the  foreigners, overall 12.8% of the population, make up a disproportionate share of crime suspects (34.7%), see horizontal bar chart.&lt;ref name="wsj20181016"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethnic-crime-families-provoke-german-crackdown-1539604801|title=An Ice-Cream Truck Slaying, Party Drugs and Real-Estate Kings: Ethnic Clans Clash in Berlin’s Underworld|last=Pancevski|first=Bojan|date=2018-10-15|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime in Tuvalu''' is not a significant social problem due to an effective criminal justice system and also due to the influence of the social institutions of [[Tuvalu]], which include the ''[[Falekaupule]]'' (the traditional assembly of elders) and the central role of [[Religion in Tuvalu|religious institutions]] in the Tuvaluan community.  The ''Falekaupule'' continues to play an important role in Tuvaluan society, as the [[List of islands of Tuvalu|islands of Tuvalu]] have small communities living in villages. The largest community is on [[Funafuti]] atoll, the capital of Tuvalu, with 4,492 residents in the 2002 census.&lt;ref name="CSD"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |work= 2002 Census of Tuvalu |title= Tuvalu Central Statistics Division|page= 5|date = May 2010|url= http://www.spc.int/prism/tuvalu/| accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social problems that exist in large societies, such as violent crime, illegal substance abuse and prostitution, do not exist in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name="IPO"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |work= Decent Work Country Programme for Tuvalu |title= International Labour Organization|page= 5|date = May 2010|url= http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/program/dwcp/download/tuvalu.pdf| accessdate=10 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054805/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/program/dwcp/download/tuvalu.pdf

Tuvalu has a [[Law enforcement in Tuvalu|police service]] and an island based Magistrates Court system. Serious offences, such as rape and murder, are dealt with in the [[High Court of Tuvalu]].&lt;ref name="pacliiCT"&gt;{{cite web| work=PACLII|title=Tuvalu Courts System Information|url= http://www.paclii.org/tv/courts.html| accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social institutions of Tuvalu==

Each island has its own high-chief, or ulu-aliki, and several sub-chiefs ([[aliki]]s). The community council is the ''Falekaupule'' (the traditional assembly of elders) or te sina o fenua (literally: "grey-hairs of the land").  As defined in the Falekaupule Act (1997), ''[[Falekaupule]]'' means "traditional assembly in each island...composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island". ''Aganu'' means traditional customs and culture.

Section 41 and Schedule 3 of the Falekaupule Act (1997) provides that “[i]t shall be the duty of every Falekaupule and of every Kaupule to use its resources to assist the police in the detection and prevention of crime within the area of its authority.”&lt;ref name="pacliiF"&gt;{{cite web| work=PACLII|title= Falekaupule Act (1997)|url=http://www.paclii.org/tv/legis/consol_act_2008/fa121/ | accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority on each island. Ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry. Their powers are now shared with the pule o kaupule (elected village presidents; one on each island).&lt;ref name="Bennetts"&gt;{{cite book | author= Peter Bennetts and Tony Wheeler | title=Time &amp; Tide: The Islands of Tuvalu | year= 2001 | isbn=1-86450-342-4 | publisher= Lonely Planet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Criminal Law of Tuvalu==
{{Main| Law of Tuvalu}}

The Penal Code (1965) was first enacted during the time that Tuvalu was part of the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony. The Code is drafted to provide the complete criminal code of Tuvalu, although the Code is supplemented by offences created in other legislation including the Dangerous Drugs Act (1948), Alcoholic Drink Act (1985), Arms and Ammunition Act (1964) and the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Organised Crime Act (2009). The Criminal Procedure Code (1963) provides for powers of arrest and search and rule for the administration of the criminal proceedings in the courts.

While human trafficking is not a problem in Tuvalu, the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Organised Crime Act 2009 (2009) provides protection for trafficking victims, particularly children. It expressly forbids the [[trafficking of children]] into and within Tuvalu or to another country for any purpose. It also provides trafficking victims with legal protections from criminal prosecution. The Penal Code (1965) provides for an offence of cruelty to children in section 226.

The central role of [[Religion in Tuvalu|religious institutions]] in the Tuvaluan community is acknowledged in the [[Constitution of Tuvalu]], in which the preamble to refers to Tuvaluan society being based on [[Christian]] principles:-
:AND WHEREAS the people of Tuvalu, acknowledging God as the Almighty and Everlasting Lord and giver of all good things, humbly place themselves under His good providence and seek His blessing upon themselves and their lives;
:AND WHEREAS the people of Tuvalu desire to constitute themselves as an independent State based on Christian principles, the Rule of Law, and Tuvaluan custom and tradition; ……

Part XV of the Penal Code (1965) creates offences relating to religion: insult to religion of any class (s. 123); disturbing religious assemblies (s. 124); trespassing on burial places (s. 125); hindering burial of dead body, etc. (s. 126); and writing or uttering words with intent to wound religious feelings (s. 127). As well, sorcery is an offence under section 183.

The legislation that is part of the [[Law of Tuvalu]] is published online by the Office of the Attorney General of Tuvalu;&lt;ref name="AGT"&gt;{{cite web| work=Office of the Attorney General of Tuvalu|title=Tuvalu - Tuvalu Legislation On-line |url= http://www.tuvalu-legislation.tv/cms/| accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also by the [[Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute]], with the law set out in the 2008 Revised Edition;&lt;ref name="paclii2008"&gt;{{cite web| work=PACLII|title=Tuvalu - Laws of Tuvalu 2008 Revised Edition|url= http://www.paclii.org/tv/indices/legis/Tuvalu_Laws_2008_NumericalIndex.htm | accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a list of current legislation (up to 2012).&lt;ref name="pacliicur"&gt;{{cite web | work=PACLII | title=Tuvalu – Current Legislation - alphabetical Index | url=http://www.tuvalu-legislation.tv/cms/index.php/legislation/index.html | accessdate=10 March 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330082329/http://www.tuvalu-legislation.tv/cms/index.php/legislation/index.html | archivedate=30 March 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuvalu Police Service==
{{Main|Law enforcement in Tuvalu}}

Tuvalu’s national police force, the ''Tuvalu Police Service'', is headquartered in [[Funafuti]]. It includes a maritime [[surveillance]] unit, customs, prisons and immigration. Police officers wear [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British style]] [[uniform]]s. The police have a [[Pacific-class patrol boat]], the [[HMTSS Te Mataili (801)|HMTSS ''Te Mataili'']], provided by Australia in October 1994 under the Pacific Patrol Boat Program for use in maritime surveillance and [[fishery]] patrol and for search-and-rescue missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/GEO/tuvalu/tuvalu_brief.html |title=Tuvalu country brief |publisher=Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |accessdate=14 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The police service is managed in accordance with the Police Powers and Duties Act (2009) and the Police Powers and Duties Regulations (2012).
* Powers of arrest and search are described in Part III of the Criminal Procedure Code (1963).

==The People's Lawyer in Tuvalu==

There are no lawyers in private practice in Tuvalu. The government funds the service of the "People's Lawyer", whose advice services are available free of charge for arrested persons. The People's Lawyer not only acts as the public defender but also represents people in the courts for cases that involve "land dispute resolution, civil disputes, family and some business formation."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/christmas-spirit-why-solicitors-like-working-for-charities-whether-in-an-in-house-capacity-from-private-practice-or-on-a-voluntary-basis-/20695.article|title=Christmas spirit -- why solicitors like working for charities, whether in an in-house capacity from private practice or on a voluntary basis|last=|first=|date=|work=Law Society Gazette|access-date=2018-03-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Lawyer is based on the main island of [[Funafuti]]; the outer islands may have limited access to legal services as the people's lawyer infrequently travels to the outer islands.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt;

* The services of the People's Lawyer is managed under the People’s Lawyer Act (1988) and the People's Lawyer (Fees) Regulations (2012).
According to a 2008 source,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/TUV/INT_CEDAW_NGO_TUV_44_10207_E.pdf|title=TUVALU - NGO Submission to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review|last=|first=|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "there have been instances [in which] the position of the People’s Lawyer has remained unfulfilled for significant periods of time causing excessive delay in hearing clients’ cases." For the greater part of the position's history, the Australian Volunteers International Scheme recruited expatriate lawyers from either Australia or the United Kingdom to serve as The People's Lawyer. Since 2010, the position has been filled by Tuvaluans: Isala T. Isala (male lawyer; 2010-2015) and Filiga Taukiei Niko (female lawyer; 2015 - ).

==Magistrates Court and High Court==

The jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court is described in Part II of the Criminal Procedure Code (1963); any offence may be tried by the Senior Magistrate's Court where the penalty does not exceed a term of imprisonment for a term of 14 years (s. 4). However the sentences the Senior Magistrate's Court may impose are limited to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and a fine not exceeding $1,000 (s. 7 of Criminal Procedure Code).

The [[superior court]] is the [[High Court of Tuvalu]] as it has unlimited jurisdiction to try criminal offences and to impose the penalties set out in the Part VI of the Penal Code and in other legislation (s. 6 of Criminal Procedure Code). The High Court also hears appeals from the Magistrates Court.

The criminal justice system is administered under the provisions of:
* The [[Constitution of Tuvalu]], the Criminal Procedure Code (1963), the Magistrates’ Courts Act (1963) and the Magistrates’ Courts (Costs in Criminal Cases) Rules (1965).
* Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (2004) and the Proceeds of Crime Act (2004).
* Sentencing of convicted offenders is addressed in Part VI of the Penal Code (which provides for punishments that include prison, fines and weekend detention) and the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (1991).

==Tuvalu’s prison==

The jail is on [[Fongafale]] islet on [[Funafuti]].&lt;ref name="TIFunC"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  |first1= |authorlink1= |title=Map of Funafuti Centre - Fogafale Motu|url= http://www.tuvaluislands.com/maps/m-funa2.htm|accessdate=  |year= |publisher=Tuvaluislands.com|location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page=|pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu’s jail is administered under the Prisons Act (1985) and the Prisons Regulations (1952).

The [[United States Department of State]] provide periodic reports as to aspects of human rights practice in Tuvalu including information on the prison system:
* As of October 2010 Tuvalu’s jail held 7 convicted prisoners and one pretrial detainee, all male. The pretrial detainee was held in a separate facility from the prisoners. At that time there were no juvenile offenders (defined as those under age 18) in custody.&lt;ref name="State10"&gt;{{cite web| work=U.S. State Department |title=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (Tuvalu)|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/160107.pdf| accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of December 2012 Tuvalu’s jail held 12 convicted prisoners (11 men and one woman).

==Crimes against morality including rape and unlawful sexual intercourse==

Part XVI of the Penal Code (1965), provides for offences against morality, which include: rape (s. 128); abduction of girl under 18 years of age with intent to have sexual intercourse (s. 132); indecent assaults on females (s. 133); defilement of girl under 13 years of age (s. 134); and defilement of a girl between 13 and 15 years of age, or of idiot or imbecile (s.125). The punishment of rape is a minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment, however spousal rape is not included in the legal definition of the offence of rape.

Domestic violence is considered in Tuvalu’s 2009 Report on compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The Report said that “Committee’s experts expressed concern over the sanctioning of local custom in the [Tuvalu] Constitution and legal system, noting, for example, that husbands were permitted to ‘discipline’ their wives [as well as children]”. As many Tuvaluan families have migrated to [[New Zealand]] these practices are in direct conflict with New Zealand’s laws and social environment.&lt;ref name="TFT"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |title= Toku fou tiale: A Tuvalu Conceptual Framework for addressing family violence|publisher= The Tuvalu Working Group (New Zealand)|chapter=|date =March 2012 |url= http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/documents/working-with-us/programmes-services/pacific-framework-tuvalu-fa-lr.pdf| accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] provide periodic reports as to aspects of human rights practice in Tuvalu including information on rape and domestic violence:
* In 2010 there were both arrests and trials for rape-related offenses. The High Court convicted one defendant of rape and sentenced him to seven years' imprisonment. A second rape case was scheduled for trial in March 2011.&lt;ref name="State10"/&gt;
* In 2012 one case of attempted rape was prosecuted. There were also five sexual assault cases, one case of defilement, and three cases of indecent assault.&lt;ref name="State12"/&gt;
* In 2013 there were prosecutions of two sexual assault cases, one case of defilement, and one case of indecent assault.&lt;ref name="State13"/&gt;

The Penal Code (1965) does not specifically address domestic violence, which is prosecuted under the common assault provisions of the Code. The maximum penalty for common assault is six months’ imprisonment, and for assault with actual bodily harm, the penalty is up to five years’ imprisonment. The police service report that as of September 2012, there were 93 domestic violence cases on record.&lt;ref name="State12"/&gt; The police also report that it has a dedicated Domestic Violence Unit and that it operates a “no-drop” policy in relation to the conduct of prosecutions of violence against women.&lt;ref name="State12"/&gt;

In July 2013 the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community published drafting options for legislative reform to assist Tuvalu to make changes to the laws and policies relating to violence against women in order to ensure the full protection of women from all forms of violence.&lt;ref name="NBF"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |title= Tuvalu - Legal analysis on violence against women: drafting options for legislative reform | publisher= Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team |chapter=|date =July 2013|url= http://www.rrrt.org/| accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuvalu National Council of Women, operates a Women’s Crisis Center, in [[Funafuti]], which provided counselling services, but there were no shelters or hotlines for abused women.&lt;ref name="State13"/&gt;

The U.S. Department of State’s Report on Human Rights Practices for 2014 stated that the Tuvaluan police have a Domestic Violence Unit and a “no-drop” (evidence-based) prosecution policy in cases of violence against women and operated a 24-hour emergency line for victims of domestic violence. As of August 2014 the police reported 100 domestic violence cases.&lt;ref name=reportHR14/&gt;

'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''', commonly known as '''DDT''', is a colorless, tasteless, and almost odorless [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] chemical compound, an [[organochlorine]], originally developed as an [[insecticide]], and ultimately becoming infamous for its environmental impacts. It was first synthesized in 1874. DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist [[Paul Hermann Müller]] in 1939. DDT was used in the second half of [[World War II]] to control [[malaria]] and [[typhus]] among civilians and troops. Müller was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several [[arthropods]]" in 1948.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/ NobelPrize.org: The Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine 1948], accessed July 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s book ''[[Silent Spring]]''. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environmental and health effects. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lear"&gt;{{cite book|first=Linda |last=Lear|title=Rachel Carson: Witness for Nature|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=36euz6DjmwUC}}|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0-547-23823-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], but its limited and still-controversial use in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] [[Vector control|control]] continues,&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larson |first=Kim | name-list-format = vanc |date=December 1, 2007 |title=Bad Blood |journal=On Earth |issue=Winter 2008 |url=http://www.onearth.org/article/bad-blood? |accessdate=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyers&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moyers |first=Bill | name-list-format = vanc |author-link=Bill Moyers |title=Rachel Carson and DDT |date=September 21, 2007 |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09212007/profile2.html |accessdate=March 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.

Along with the passage of the [[Endangered Species Act]], the United States ban on DDT is a major factor in the comeback of the [[bald eagle]] (the [[Bald eagle#National bird of the United States|national bird of the United States]]) and the [[peregrine falcon]] from near-extinction in the [[contiguous United States]].&lt;ref name=Stokstad07&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stokstad E | title = Species conservation.

==Properties and chemistry==
DDT is similar in structure to the insecticide [[methoxychlor]] and the [[acaricide]] [[dicofol]]. It is highly [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and nearly [[Solubility|insoluble]] in [[Properties of water|water]] but has good solubility in most [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[solvent]]s, [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s. DDT does not occur naturally and is synthesised by a [[Friedel–Crafts reaction#Friedel–Crafts hydroxyalkylation|Friedel–Crafts hydroxyalkylation]] reaction between [[chloral]] ({{chem|CCl|3|CHO}}) and [[chlorobenzene]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|Cl}}), in the presence of an acidic [[Catalysis|catalyst]]. DDT has been marketed under [[trade name]]s including Anofex, Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Clofenotane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol, Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron, Ixodex, Neocid, Neocidol and Zerdane.&lt;ref name=EHC009/&gt;

===Isomers and related compounds===
[[File:o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane.svg|thumb|''o,p' ''-DDT, a minor component in commercial DDT.]]
Commercial DDT is a mixture of several closely–related compounds. The major component (77%) is the ''[[Arene substitution patterns|p]]'',''p' '' [[isomer]] (pictured above). The ''o'',''p' '' isomer (pictured to the right) is also present in significant amounts (15%). [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene]] (DDE) and [[dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane]] (DDD) make up the balance. DDE and DDD are the major [[metabolite]]s and environmental breakdown products.&lt;ref name=EHC009/&gt; DDT, DDE and DDD are sometimes referred to collectively as DDX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22020740 |journal=J.

===Production and use ===
DDT has been formulated in multiple forms, including [[solution]]s in [[xylene]] or [[petroleum]] [[Distillation|distillates]], [[Emulsion|emulsifiable]] [[concentrate]]s, water-[[wettable powder]]s, granules, [[aerosol]]s, [[Smoke bomb|smoke candles]] and charges for vaporizers and lotions.&lt;ref name=EHC83&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 83 | name = DDT and Its Derivatives: Environmental Aspects | isbn = 92-4-154283-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism of insecticide action===
In insects, DDT opens [[Sodium channel|sodium ion channels]] in [[neuron]]s, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeCarvalho Anderson|first1=Juliana|title=DDT|url=http://www.toxipedia.org/display/toxipedia/DDT|website=Toxipedia|accessdate=27 August 2016|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects with certain [[mutation]]s in their sodium channel [[gene]] are resistant to DDT and similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing [[cytochrome P450]] in some insect species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Denholm I, Devine GJ, Williamson MS | title = Evolutionary genetics. Insecticide resistance on the move | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5590 | pages = 2222–23 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12351778 | doi = 10.1126/science.1077266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as greater quantities of some enzymes of this group accelerate the toxin's metabolism into inactive metabolites. (The same enzyme family is up-regulated in mammals too, e.g., in response to ethanol consumption.) Genomic studies in the model genetic organism ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' revealed that high level DDT resistance is polygenic, involving multiple resistance mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pedra JH, McIntyre LM, Scharf ME, Pittendrigh BR | title = Genome-wide transcription profile of field- and laboratory-selected dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)-resistant Drosophila | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 18 | pages = 7034–39 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15118106 | pmc = 406461 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0400580101 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15118106 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.7034P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT is the best-known of several [[chlorine]]-containing pesticides used in the 1940s and 1950s. With [[pyrethrum]] in short supply, DDT was used extensively during [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to control the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of [[typhus]] – nearly eliminating the disease in many parts of [[Europe]]. In the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], it was sprayed aerially for malaria and dengue fever control with spectacular effects. While DDT's chemical and insecticidal properties were important factors in these victories, advances in application equipment coupled with competent organization and sufficient manpower were also crucial to the success of these programs.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Dunlap|title=DDT: Scientists, Citizens, and Public Policy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PLL_AwAAQBAJ}}|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5385-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, DDT was made available to farmers as an agricultural insecticide&lt;ref name=EHC009/&gt; and played a role in the final (for a time) elimination of malaria in Europe and [[North America]].&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Zulueta J | title = The end of malaria in Europe: an eradication of the disease by control measures | journal = Parassitologia | volume = 40 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 245–46 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9653750 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/elimination_us.html |title=CDC – Malaria – About Malaria – History – Elimination of Malaria in the United States (1947–1951) |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the [[World Health Organization]] commenced a program to eradicate malaria in countries with low to moderate transmission rates worldwide, relying largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to reduce transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendis K, Rietveld A, Warsame M, Bosman A, Greenwood B, Wernsdorfer WH | title = From malaria control to eradication: The WHO perspective | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 802–09 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19497083 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02287.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program eliminated the disease in "North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union,"&lt;ref name="AmJTrop"/&gt; and in "[[Taiwan]], much of the [[Caribbean]], the [[Balkans]], parts of northern Africa, the northern region of Australia, and a large swath of the South Pacific"&lt;ref name="Gladwell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |author-link=Malcolm Gladwell | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Mosquito Killer |newspaper=The New Yorker |date=July 2, 2001 |url=http://gladwell.com/the-mosquito-killer/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dramatically reduced mortality in [[Sri Lanka]] and India.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;

However, failure to sustain the program, increasing mosquito tolerance to DDT, and increasing parasite tolerance led to a resurgence. In many areas early successes partially or completely reversed, and in some cases rates of transmission increased.&lt;ref name=Chapin81&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapin G, Wasserstrom R | title = Agricultural production and malaria resurgence in Central America and India | journal = Nature | volume = 293 | issue = 5829 | pages = 181–85 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7278974 | doi = 10.1038/293181a0 | bibcode = 1981Natur.293..181C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with "high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission".&lt;ref name="AmJTrop"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadasivaiah S, Tozan Y, Breman JG | title = Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for indoor residual spraying in Africa: how can it be used for malaria control? | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 77 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 249–63 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18165500 | url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/full/77/6_Suppl/249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT was less effective in tropical regions due to the continuous life cycle of mosquitoes and poor infrastructure. It was not applied at all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] due to these perceived difficulties. Mortality rates in that area never declined to the same dramatic extent, and now constitute the bulk of malarial deaths worldwide, especially following the disease's resurgence as a result of resistance to drug treatments and the spread of the deadly malarial variant caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. Eradication was abandoned in 1969 and attention instead focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and financial implementation.&lt;ref name=Chapin81/&gt; Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of [[Mosquito net|bednets]] impregnated with insecticides and other interventions.&lt;ref name="AmJTrop"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogan05&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogan WJ, Chen A | title = Health risks and benefits of bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9487 | pages = 763–73 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16125595 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67182-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States ban===
By October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States, used both as an agricultural pesticide and as a household insecticide.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;  Although its use was promoted by government and the agricultural industry, US scientists such as FDA pharmacologist [[Herbert O. Calvery]] expressed concern over possible hazards associated with DDT as early as 1944.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Frederick Rowe|title=Banned : a history of pesticides and the science of toxicology.|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0300205176|pages=26|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=kuIdBQAAQBAJ|page=26}}|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; In 1947, [[Bradbury Robinson|Dr. Bradbury Robinson]], a physician and nutritionist practicing in [[St. Louis, Michigan]], warned of the dangers of using the pesticide DDT in agriculture. DDT had been researched and manufactured in St. Louis by the [[Michigan Chemical Corporation]], later purchased by [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velsicol.com/|title=Leading Chemical Company - Manufacture, Distribution &amp; Sales - Velsicol Chemical, LLC|first=Super|last=User|website=Leading Chemical Company - Manufacture, Distribution &amp; Sales - Velsicol Chemical, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had become an important part of the local economy.&lt;ref name= STLH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouismi.com/1/stlouis/history_by_decades.asp|title=History by Decades|website=www.stlouismi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing research performed by [[Michigan State University]]&lt;ref&gt;American Potato Journal June 1947, Volume 24, Issue 6, pp 183-187 Results of spraying and dusting potatoes in Michigan in 1946&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946, Robinson, a past president of the local Conservation Club,&lt;ref&gt;"Conservation Club, St. Louis, Has Program", ''Lansing State Journal'' (Lansing, Michigan), Page 14, March 2, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; opined that:  &lt;blockquote&gt;... perhaps the greatest danger from D.D.T. is that its extensive use in farm areas is most likely to upset the natural balances, not only killing beneficial insects in great number but by bringing about the death of fish, birds, and other forms of wild life either by their feeding on insects killed by D.D.T. or directly by ingesting the poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | title = A Nutritionist Ponders the D.D.T.

As its production and use increased, public response was mixed. At the same time that DDT was hailed as part of the "world of tomorrow," concerns were expressed about its potential to kill harmless and beneficial insects (particularly [[pollinators]]), birds, fish, and eventually humans. The issue of toxicity was complicated, partly because DDT's effects varied from species to species, and partly because consecutive exposures could accumulate, causing damage comparable to large doses. A  number of states attempted to regulate DDT.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conis|first1=Elena |title=Beyond Silent Spring: An Alternate History of DDT |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=16–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EHC009&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 009 | name=DDT and its derivatives | date = 1979 | isbn = 92-4-154069-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s the federal government began tightening regulations governing its use.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt; These events received little attention. Women like Dorothy Colson and Mamie Ella Plyler of [[Claxton, Georgia]] gathered evidence about DDT's effects and wrote to the Georgia Department of Public Health, the National Health Council in New York City, and other organizations.&lt;ref name="Conis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conis|first1=Elena | name-list-format = vanc |title=DDT Disbelievers: Health and the New Economic Poisons in Georgia after World War II|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/ddt-disbelievers-health-and-new-economic-poisons-georgia-after-world-war-ii|accessdate=25 July 2017|work=Southern Spaces|date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported an unsuccessful struggle to restrict DDT use in [[Nassau County, New York]], and the issue came to the attention of the popular naturalist-author Rachel Carson.  William Shawn, editor of ''The New Yorker'', urged her to write a piece on the subject, which developed into her 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book argued that [[pesticide]]s, including DDT, were poisoning both wildlife and the environment and were endangering human health.&lt;ref name="Lear"/&gt; ''Silent Spring'' was a best seller, and public reaction to it launched the modern [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] in the United States. The year after it appeared, [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] ordered his Science Advisory Committee to investigate Carson's claims. The committee's report "add[ed] up to a fairly thorough-going vindication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring thesis," in the words of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenberg DS | title = Pesticides: White House Advisory Body Issues Report Recommending Steps to Reduce Hazard to Public | journal = Science | volume = 140 | issue = 3569 | pages = 878–79 | date = May 1963 | pmid = 17810673 | doi = 10.1126/science.140.3569.878 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17810673 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090628043549/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17810673 | deadurl = yes | archivedate=June 28, 2009| bibcode = 1963Sci...140..878G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended a phaseout of "persistent toxic pesticides".&lt;ref name="Michaels2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Michaels |first=David | name-list-format = vanc | title = [[Doubt is Their Product]]: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-530067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT became a prime target of the growing anti-chemical and anti-pesticide movements, and in 1967 a group of scientists and lawyers founded the [[Environmental Defense|Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) with the specific goal of enacting a ban on DDT. [[Victor Yannacone]], Charles Wurster, [[Art Cooley]] and others in the group had all witnessed bird kills or declines in bird populations and suspected that DDT was the cause. In their campaign against the chemical, EDF petitioned the government for a ban and filed lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sue the Bastards |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910111-2,00.html |work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]] |date=October 18, 1971 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKxR0D6f?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910111-2,00.html |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, [[toxicologist]] [[David Peakall]] was measuring [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] levels in the eggs of [[peregrine falcons]] and [[California condor]]s and finding that increased levels corresponded with thinner shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1979.tb04962.x/full|first1=David B.|last1=Peakall|first2=lloyd F.|last2=Kiff | name-list-format = vanc |title=Eggshell thinning and dde residue levels among peregrine falcons falco peregrinus: a global perspective|publisher=Wiley Online Library|date=April 1979|doi= 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1979.tb04962.x|access-date=March 4, 2018|volume=121|journal=Ibis|pages=200–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to an EDF suit, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in 1971 ordered the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to begin the de-registration procedure for DDT. After an initial six-month review process, [[William Ruckelshaus]], the Agency's first [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] rejected an immediate suspension of DDT's registration, citing studies from the EPA's internal staff stating that DDT was not an imminent danger.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt; However, these findings were criticized, as they were performed mostly by [[economic entomologist]]s inherited from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], who many environmentalists felt were biased towards [[agribusiness]] and understated concerns about human health and wildlife. The decision thus created controversy.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;

The EPA held seven months of hearings in 1971–1972, with scientists giving evidence for and against DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced the cancellation of most uses of DDT – exempting public health uses under some conditions.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt; Immediately after the announcement, both EDF and the DDT manufacturers filed suit against EPA. Industry sought to overturn the ban, while EDF wanted a comprehensive ban. The cases were consolidated, and in 1973 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ]] ruled that the EPA had acted properly in banning DDT.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt;

Some uses of DDT continued under the public health exemption. For example, in June 1979, the California Department of Health Services was permitted to use DDT to suppress [[flea]] vectors of [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref name="urlAEI – Short Publications – The Rise, Fall, Rise, and Imminent Fall of DDT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/outlook/27063 |title=AEI – Short Publications – The Rise, Fall, Rise, and Imminent Fall of DDT |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKxRwUwH?url=http://www.aei.org/outlook/27063 |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; DDT continued to be produced in the United States for foreign markets until 1985, when over 300 tons were exported.&lt;ref name="ATSDRc5"/&gt;

===International usage restrictions===
In the 1970s and 1980s, agricultural use was banned in most developed countries, beginning with [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvm.hu/main.php?folderID=1564&amp;articleID=6169&amp;ctag=articlelist&amp;iid=1&amp;part=2 |title=Selected passages from the history of the Hungarian plant protection administration on the 50th anniversary of establishing the county plant protection stations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110025539/http://www.fvm.hu/main.php?folderID=1564&amp;articleID=6169&amp;ctag=articlelist&amp;iid=1&amp;part=2 |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] in 1970, [[West Germany]] and the United States in 1972, but not in the [[United Kingdom]] until 1984. By 1991 total bans, including for disease control, were in place in at least 26 countries; for example Cuba in 1970, the US in the 1980s, Singapore in 1984, Chile in 1985 and the Republic of Korea in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pic.int/Portals/5/DGDs/DGD_DDT_EN.pdf |title=DDT, Decision Guidance Document, Joint FAO/UNEP Programme for the operation of Prior Informed Consent, UNEP/FAO, Rome, Italy, 1991.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], which took effect in 2004, put a global ban on several [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, and restricted DDT use to [[vector control]]. The Convention was ratified by more than 170 countries. Recognizing that total elimination in many malaria-prone countries is currently unfeasible absent affordable/effective alternatives, the convention exempts public health use within [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) guidelines from the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF |title=Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resolution 60.18 of the [[World Health Assembly]] commits WHO to the Stockholm Convention's aim of reducing and ultimately eliminating DDT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ipcs/capacity_building/ddt_statement/en/ |title=WHO.

DDT is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] that is readily adsorbed to [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms.&lt;ref name=EHC83/&gt; Depending on conditions, its soil [[half-life]] can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, [[photolysis]] and [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] [[biodegradation]]. Due to [[hydrophobic]] properties, in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water (however, its half-life in aquatic environments is listed by the [[National Pesticide Information Center]] as 150 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DDT (Technical Fact Sheet)|url=http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/ddttech.pdf|access-date= 1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties.&lt;ref name="ATSDRc5"/&gt; DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the [[Arctic]] by the phenomenon of [[global distillation]], where they then accumulate in the region's [[food web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Grasshopper Effect and Tracking Hazardous Air Pollutants |journal=The Science and the Environment Bulletin |publisher=Environment Canada |issue=May/June 1998 |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/science/sandemay/PrintVersion/print2_e.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928235911/http://www.ec.gc.ca/science/sandemay/printversion/print2_e.html |archivedate=September 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical researchers in 1974 found a measurable and significant difference in the presence of DDT in human milk between mothers who lived in [[New Brunswick]] and mothers who lived in [[Nova Scotia]], "possibly because of the wider use of insecticide sprays in the past."&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01709117 "Presence of PCB, DDE and DDT in human milk in the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada"], ''Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology'' September 1974, Volume 12, Issue 3, pp 258–267.

Because of its [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] properties, DDT can [[bioaccumulate]], especially in [[predatory birds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Ecotoxicology |publisher=Blackwell Science |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-632-03852-7 |page=68 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=X-ik73-vnXAC|page=68}} | first1 = Des W. | last1 = Connell | first2 = Paul | last2 = Lam | first3 = Bruce | last3 = Richardson | first4 = Rudolf | last4 = Wu | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; DDT is toxic to a wide range of living organisms, including marine animals such as [[crayfish]], [[daphnia|daphnids]], [[shrimp|sea shrimp]] and many species of [[fish]].

DDT is classified as "moderately toxic" by the US [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC33482|title=DDT, p,p' - toxicity, ecological toxicity and regulatory information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "moderately hazardous" by WHO, based on the rat oral {{LD50}} of 113&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name = "zvgfrt"&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_rev_3.pdf ''The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard''], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect exposure is considered relatively non-toxic for humans.&lt;ref name="Agarwal"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agarwal A, Aponte-Mellado A, Premkumar BJ, Shaman A, Gupta S | title = The effects of oxidative stress on female reproduction: a review | journal = Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 49 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22748101 | pmc = 3527168 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7827-10-49 | quote = In general, incidental human exposure to DDT has been considered relatively non-toxic, but prolonged exposure has long been recognized to adversely affect reproduction. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic toxicity ===
Primarily through the tendency for DDT to buildup in areas of the body with high lipid content, chronic exposure can affect reproductive capabilities and the embryo or fetus.&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt;
* A review article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' states, "research has shown that exposure to DDT at amounts that would be needed in malaria control might cause preterm birth and early weaning&amp;nbsp;... toxicological evidence shows [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting]] properties; human data also indicate possible disruption in semen quality, menstruation, gestational length, and duration of lactation."&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt;

* Studies are inconsistent on whether high blood DDT or DDE levels increase time to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="PineRiver"/&gt; In mothers with high DDE blood serum levels, daughters may have up to a 32% increase in the probability of conceiving, but increased DDT levels have been associated with a 16% decrease in one study.&lt;ref name="Eskenazi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eskenazi B, Chevrier J, Rosas LG, Anderson HA, Bornman MS, Bouwman H, Chen A, Cohn BA, de Jager C, Henshel DS, Leipzig F, Leipzig JS, Lorenz EC, Snedeker SM, Stapleton D | title = The Pine River statement: human health consequences of DDT use | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 117 | issue = 9 | pages = 1359–67 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19750098 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.11748 | quote = Overall, the few studies conducted to date suggest that DDT exposure may affect time to pregnancy, but more research is needed. | pmc=2737010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carcinogenicity ===
In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] classifies DDT as Group 2A "probably carcinogenic to humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr236_E.pdf|title=IARC Monographs evaluate DDT, lindane, and 2,4-D|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous assessments by the U.S. [[National Toxicology Program]] classified it as "reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen" and by the EPA classified DDT, DDE and DDD as class B2 "probable" [[carcinogen]]s; these evaluations were based mainly on animal studies.&lt;ref name="ATSDRc5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt; &lt;!--In 2002, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported, "Overall, in spite of some positive associations for some cancers within certain subgroups of people, there is no clear evidence that exposure to DDT/DDE causes cancer in humans."&lt;ref name="ATSDRc5"/&gt; --&gt;

A 2005 Lancet review stated that occupational DDT exposure was associated with increased [[pancreatic cancer]] risk in 2 case control studies, but another study showed no DDE dose-effect association. Results regarding a possible association with [[liver cancer]] and biliary tract cancer are conflicting: workers who did not have direct occupational DDT contact showed increased risk. White men had an increased risk, but not white women or black men. Results about an association with multiple myeloma, prostate and testicular cancer, endometrial cancer and colorectal cancer have been inconclusive or generally do not support an association.&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt; A 2017 review of liver cancer studies concluded that "organochlorine pesticides, including DDT, may increase [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = VoPham T, Bertrand KA, Hart JE, Laden F, Brooks MM, Yuan JM, Talbott EO, Ruddell D, Chang CH, Weissfeld JL | title = Pesticide exposure and liver cancer: a review | journal = Cancer Causes &amp; Control | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–190 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28194594 | pmc = 5336347 | doi = 10.1007/s10552-017-0854-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review, whose co-authors included persons engaged in DDT-related litigation, reached broadly similar conclusions, with an equivocal association with testicular cancer. Case–control studies did not support an association with leukemia or lymphoma.&lt;ref name="PineRiver"/&gt;

====Breast cancer====
The question of whether DDT or DDE are [[Risk factors for breast cancer|risk factors in breast cancer]] has not been conclusively answered. Several meta analyses of observational studies have concluded that there is no overall relationship between DDT exposure and breast cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JH, Cha ES, Ko Y, Hwang MS, Hong JH, Lee WJ | title = Exposure to Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and the Risk of Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–84 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24955316 | pmc = 4064641 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrp.2014.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingber SZ, Buser MC, Pohl HR, Abadin HG, Murray HE, Scinicariello F | title = DDT/DDE and breast cancer: a meta-analysis | journal = [[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]] | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–33 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24021539 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2013.08.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Institute of Medicine reviewed data on the association of breast cancer with DDT exposure in 2012 and concluded that a causative relationship could neither be proven nor disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith-Bindman R | title = Environmental causes of breast cancer and radiation from medical imaging: findings from the Institute of Medicine report | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 172 | issue = 13 | pages = 1023–27 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22688684 | pmc = 3936791 | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2012.2329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 case control study&lt;ref name="Cohn07"/&gt; using archived blood samples found that breast cancer risk was increased 5-fold among women who were born prior to 1931 and who had high serum DDT levels in 1963. Reasoning that DDT use became widespread in 1945 and peaked around 1950, they concluded that the ages of 14–20 were a critical period in which DDT exposure leads to increased risk. This study, which suggests a connection between DDT exposure and breast cancer that would not be picked up by most studies, has received variable commentary in third party reviews. One review suggested that "previous studies that measured exposure in older women may have missed the critical period."&lt;ref name="PineRiver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clapp RW, Jacobs MM, Loechler EL | title = Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007 | journal = Reviews on Environmental Health | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–37 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18557596 | pmc = 2791455 | doi = 10.1515/REVEH.2008.23.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Toxicology Program notes that while the majority of studies have not found a relationship between DDT exposure and breast cancer that positive associations have been seen in a "few studies among women with higher levels of exposure and among certain subgroups of women"&lt;ref name=NTP-DDT/&gt;

A 2015 case control study identified a link (odds ratio 3.4) between ''in-utero'' exposure (as estimated from archived maternal blood samples) and [[breast cancer]] diagnosis in daughters. The findings "support classification of DDT as an endocrine disruptor, a predictor of breast cancer, and a marker of high risk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohn BA, La Merrill M, Krigbaum NY, Yeh G, Park JS, Zimmermann L, Cirillo PM | title = DDT Exposure in Utero and Breast Cancer | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 100 | issue = 8 | pages = 2865–72 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26079774 | pmc = 4524999 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2015-1841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaria control{{anchor|Use_against_malaria}}==
[[Malaria]] remains the primary [[public health]] challenge in many countries. In 2015, there were 214 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 438,000 deaths, 90% of which occurred in Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO15&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria Fact sheet N°94|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDT is one of many tools to fight the disease. Its use in this context has been called everything from a "miracle weapon [that is] like [[Kryptonite]] to the mosquitoes,"&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news | first = Kirsten | last = Weir | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rachel Carson's birthday bashing |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/29/rachel_carson/ |publisher=Salon.com |date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "toxic colonialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Paull | first = John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Toxic Colonialism |journal=New Scientist |issue=2628 |page=25 |date=November 3, 2007 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626280.400-toxic-colonialism.html/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before DDT, eliminating mosquito breeding grounds by drainage or poisoning with [[Paris green]] or [[pyrethrum]] was sometimes successful. In parts of the world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation.&lt;ref name="Gladwell"/&gt; A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include [[antimalarial drugs]] to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; [[mosquito net|bednets]] and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and [[vector control]] strategies&lt;ref name="wmr09"&gt;{{cite web | date = 2009 | publisher = World Health Organization | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241563901_eng.pdf | title = World Malaria Report }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[larvacide|larvaciding]] with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and [[indoor residual spraying]] (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of interior walls and ceilings with insecticides. It is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides.&lt;ref name="AmJTrop"/&gt;

WHO's anti-malaria campaign of the 1950s and 1960s relied heavily on DDT and the results were promising, though temporary in developing countries. Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased [[irrigation]]. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. [[chloroquine]]) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref name="DDTBP.1/2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feachem RG, Sabot OJ | title = Global malaria control in the 21st century: a historic but fleeting opportunity | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 20 | pages = 2281–84 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17519417 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.20.2281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance was largely fueled by unrestricted agricultural use. Resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to curtail DDT use in vector control and agriculture.&lt;ref name=Chapin81/&gt; In 2006 WHO reversed a longstanding policy against DDT by recommending that it be used as an indoor pesticide in regions where malaria is a major problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/15/AR2006091501012.html |title=WHO Urges Use of DDT in Africa |date=September 16, 2006 |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the mainstay of anti-malaria campaigns, as of 2008 only 12 countries used DDT, including India and some southern African states,&lt;ref name=wmr09/&gt; though the number was expected to rise.&lt;ref name="DDTBP.1/2"/&gt;

===Initial effectiveness===
When it was introduced in World War II, DDT was effective in reducing malaria [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt; WHO's anti-malaria campaign, which consisted mostly of spraying DDT and rapid treatment and diagnosis to break the transmission cycle, was initially successful as well. For example, in [[Sri Lanka]], the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance |page=51 | last = Garrett | first = Laurie |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=v9RY2PVOtOMC|page=51}}|date=31 October 1994|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-5327-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/health/28global.html | title = Malaria: A Disease Close to Eradication Grows, Aided by Political Tumult in Sri Lanka | first = Donald G. | last = McNeil | name-list-format = vanc | work = The New York Times | date = December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to [[malathion]], but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc | title = Mosquitoes, Malaria, and Man: A History of the Hostilities Since 1880|isbn=978-0-525-16025-0|first=Gordon A. |last=Harrison|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mfkBr2oskyEC}}|date=1 June 1978|publisher=Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karunaweera ND, Galappaththy GN, Wirth DF | title = On the road to eliminate malaria in Sri Lanka: lessons from history, challenges, gaps in knowledge and research needs | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 13 | issue = | page = 59 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24548783 | pmc = 3943480 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-13-59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT remains on WHO's list of insecticides recommended for IRS. After the appointment of [[Arata Kochi]] as head of its anti-malaria division, WHO's policy shifted from recommending IRS only in areas of seasonal or episodic transmission of malaria, to advocating it in areas of continuous, intense transmission.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/index.html | publisher = World Health Organization | title = Who gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria }}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO reaffirmed its commitment to phasing out DDT, aiming "to achieve a 30% cut in the application of DDT world-wide by 2014 and its total phase-out by the early 2020s if not sooner" while simultaneously combating malaria. WHO plans to implement alternatives to DDT to achieve this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/malaria_ddt_20090506/en/index.html | title = Countries move toward more sustainable ways to roll back malaria | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa continues to use DDT under WHO guidelines. In 1996, the country switched to alternative insecticides and malaria incidence increased dramatically. Returning to DDT and introducing new drugs brought malaria back under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamey G | title = Roll Back Malaria: a failing global health campaign | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7448 | pages = 1086–87 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15130956 | pmc = 406307 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria cases increased in [[South America]] after countries in that continent stopped using DDT. Research data showed a strong negative relationship between DDT residual house sprayings and malaria.

===Mosquito resistance===
In some areas resistance reduced DDT's effectiveness. WHO guidelines require that absence of resistance must be confirmed before using the chemical.&lt;ref name="IRS-WHO"&gt;
[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_HTM_MAL_2006.1112_eng.pdf Indoor Residual Spraying: Use of Indoor Residual Spraying for Scaling Up Global Malaria Control and Elimination.] World Health Organization, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance is largely due to agricultural use, in much greater quantities than required for disease prevention.

Resistance was noted early in spray campaigns. Paul Russell, former head of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Anti-Malaria campaign, observed in 1956 that "resistance has appeared after six or seven years."&lt;ref name="Gladwell"/&gt; Resistance has been detected in Sri Lanka, [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]] and [[Central America]] and it has largely been replaced by [[organophosphate]] or [[carbamate]] insecticides, ''e.g.'' malathion or [[bendiocarb]].&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Curtis CF | url = http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/curtiscf.htm | title = Control of Malaria Vectors in Africa and Asia | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20071002124232/http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/curtiscf.htm | archive-date = October 2, 2007 | dead-url = yes | date = February 1996 | publisher = University of Minnesota }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of [[India]], DDT is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma VP | title = Current scenario of malaria in India | journal = Parassitologia | volume = 41 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 349–53 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10697882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural uses were banned in 1989 and its anti-malarial use has been declining. Urban use ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=No Future in DDT: A case study of India |last=Agarwal |first=Ravi | name-list-format = vanc | journal=Pesticide Safety News |date=May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study concluded that "DDT is still a viable insecticide in indoor residual spraying owing to its effectivity in well supervised spray operation and high excito-repellency factor."&lt;ref name="mrc"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma SN, Shukla RP, Raghavendra K, Subbarao SK | title = Impact of DDT spraying on malaria transmission in Bareilly District, Uttar Pradesh, India | journal = Journal of Vector Borne Diseases | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 54–60 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16161701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of malaria-vector mosquitoes in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]], [[South Africa]] found susceptibility to 4% DDT (WHO's susceptibility standard), in 63% of the samples, compared to the average of 87% in the same species caught in the open. The authors concluded that "Finding DDT resistance in the vector ''An. arabiensis'', close to the area where we previously reported pyrethroid-resistance in the vector ''An. funestus'' Giles, indicates an urgent need to develop a strategy of [[insecticide resistance]] management for the malaria control programmes of southern Africa."&lt;ref name="Hargreaves"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hargreaves K, Hunt RH, Brooke BD, Mthembu J, Weeto MM, Awolola TS, Coetzee M | title = Anopheles arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus resistance to DDT in South Africa | journal = Medical and Veterinary Entomology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–22 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14651656 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2915.2003.00460.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT can still be effective against resistant mosquitoes&lt;ref name=PLoS1/&gt; and the avoidance of DDT-sprayed walls by mosquitoes is an additional benefit of the chemical.&lt;ref name="mrc"/&gt; For example, a 2007 study reported that resistant mosquitoes avoided treated huts. The researchers argued that DDT was the best pesticide for use in IRS (even though it did not afford the most protection from mosquitoes out of the three test chemicals) because the others pesticides worked primarily by killing or irritating mosquitoes – encouraging the development of resistance.&lt;ref name="PLoS1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grieco JP, Achee NL, Chareonviriyaphap T, Suwonkerd W, Chauhan K, Sardelis MR, Roberts DR | title = A new classification system for the actions of IRS chemicals traditionally used for malaria control | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | page = e716 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17684562 | pmc = 1934935 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000716 | editor1-last = Krishna | editor1-first = Sanjeev | bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..716G }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the avoidance behavior slows eradication.&lt;ref name="Musawenkosi"/&gt; Unlike other insecticides such as [[pyrethroid]]s, DDT requires long exposure to accumulate a lethal dose; however its irritant property shortens contact periods. "For these reasons, when comparisons have been made, better malaria control has generally been achieved with pyrethroids than with DDT."&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt; In India outdoor sleeping and night duties are common, implying that "the excito-repellent effect of DDT, often reported useful in other countries, actually promotes outdoor transmission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=DDT: The fallen angel |first=V.

===Residents' concerns===
{{Main|Indoor residual spraying#Residents' opposition to IRS}}
IRS is effective if at least 80% of homes and barns in a residential area are sprayed.&lt;ref name="IRS-WHO"/&gt; Lower coverage rates can jeopardize program effectiveness. Many residents resist DDT spraying, objecting to the lingering smell, stains on walls, and the potential exacerbation of problems with other insect pests.&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Musawenkosi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mabaso ML, Sharp B, Lengeler C | title = Historical review of malarial control in southern African with emphasis on the use of indoor residual house-spraying | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 846–56 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15303988 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01263.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thurow"&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Malaria-New-Strain.htm In Malaria War, South Africa Turns To Pesticide Long Banned in the West] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013113406/http://mindfully.org/Health/Malaria-New-Strain.htm |date=October 13, 2007 }}, Roger Thurow, [[Wall Street Journal]], July 26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrethroid]] insecticides (e.g. [[deltamethrin]] and [[lambda-cyhalothrin]]) can overcome some of these issues, increasing participation.&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt;

===Human exposure===
A 1994 study found that [[South Africa]]ns living in sprayed homes have levels that are several orders of magnitude greater than others.&lt;ref name="PineRiver"/&gt; [[Breast milk]] from South African mothers contains high levels of DDT and DDE.&lt;ref name="PineRiver"/&gt; It is unclear to what extent these levels arise from home spraying vs food residues. Evidence indicates that these levels are associated with infant neurological abnormalities.&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt;

Most studies of DDT's human health effects have been conducted in developed countries where DDT is not used and exposure is relatively low.&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PineRiver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090504122058.htm |title=Unprecedented Use Of DDT Concerns Experts |last=Science Daily |date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=ScienceDaily.com |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illegal diversion to agriculture is also a concern as it is difficult to prevent and its subsequent use on crops is uncontrolled. For example, DDT use is widespread in Indian agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Markets/Commodities/Pesticide-level-in-veggies-fruits-rises/articleshow/4637527.cms|title=Pesticide level in veggies, fruits rises|last=Jayashree|first=Jayashree| name-list-format = vanc | date = 10 June 2009|publisher=Economic Times|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[mango]] production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanjana|date=June 13, 2009|title=A Whole Fruit|journal=Tehelka Magazine|volume=6|issue=23|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main42.asp?filename=cr130609a_whole.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is reportedly used by librarians to protect books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/State-public-libraries-gasp-for-breath/472785|title=State public libraries gasp for breath|last=Chakravartty|first=Anupam | name-list-format = vanc | date = 8 June 2009|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include Ethiopia, where DDT intended for malaria control is reportedly used in coffee production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Katima | first = Jamidu | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 2009 | title = African NGOs outline commitment to malaria control without DDT | url = http://www.pan-uk.org/pestnews/Issue/pn84/PN84_5.pdf | journal = Pesticides News | issue = 84 | page = 5 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160224231607/http://www.pan-uk.org/pestnews/Issue/pn84/PN84_5.pdf | archivedate = February 24, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ghana where it is used for fishing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/s_social/r_9596/ |title=Ministry moves to check unorthodox fishing methods |last=Ghana News Agency |date=November 17, 2009 |publisher=Ghana News Agency |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKxjHSId?url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/s_social/r_9596/ |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.myjoyonline.com/news/201004/45316.asp|title=Northern fisherfolks complain of committee’s harassment|last=Appiah|first=Samuel|name-list-format=vanc|date=27 April 2010|publisher=Joy Online|accessdate=April 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429002159/http://news.myjoyonline.com/news/201004/45316.asp|archivedate=April 29, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residues in crops at levels unacceptable for export have been an important factor in bans in several tropical countries.&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt; Adding to this problem is a lack of skilled personnel and management.&lt;ref name="Musawenkosi"/&gt;

===Criticism of restrictions on DDT use===
A few people and groups have argued that limitations on DDT use for public health purposes have caused unnecessary morbidity and mortality from vector-borne diseases, with some claims of malaria deaths ranging as high as the hundreds of thousands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01EFDA143CF931A25750C0A9639C8B63&amp;legacy=true |work=The New York Times|date=March 12, 2005 |title=I Have a Nightmare |first=Nicholas D. |last=Kristof | name-list-format = vanc | page=A-15 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; and millions.&lt;ref name="Crichton"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rachel Carson Didn’t Kill Millions of Africans | first = William | last = Souder | name-list-format = vanc |date=September 4, 2012 |work=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/09/silent_spring_turns_50_biographer_william_souder_clears_up_myths_about_rachel_carson_.html |accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gwadz of the US [[National Institutes of Health]] said in 2007, "The ban on DDT may have killed 20 million children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = Michael Finkel | last = Finkel | first = Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=Malaria |url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0707/feature1/text4.html |publisher=National Geographic |date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments were rejected as "outrageous" by former WHO scientist Socrates Litsios.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; May Berenbaum, [[University of Illinois]] entomologist, says, "to blame environmentalists who oppose DDT for more deaths than Hitler is worse than irresponsible."&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; More recently, Dr. Michael Palmer, a professor of chemistry at the University of Waterloo, has pointed out that DDT is still used to prevent malaria, that its declining use is primarily due to increases in manufacturing costs, and that in Africa, efforts to control malaria have been regional or local, not comprehensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~mpalmer/stuff/DDT-myth.pdf |title=The ban of DDT did not cause millions to die from malaria |format=PDF |first=Michael |last=Palmer |date=29 September 2016 |publisher=University of Waterloo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of a DDT "ban" often specifically reference the 1972 United States ban (with the erroneous implication that this constituted a worldwide ban and prohibited use of DDT in vector control). Reference is often made to ''Silent Spring,'' even though Carson never pushed for a DDT ban. [[John Quiggin]] and Tim Lambert wrote, "the most striking feature of the claim against Carson is the ease with which it can be refuted."&lt;ref name="quig"&gt;{{cite news |first1=John |last1=Quiggin |first2=Tim |last2=Lambert |title=Rehabilitating Carson |newspaper=Prospect |date=May 2008 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/rehabilitatingcarson/ | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===

====Insecticides====
{{Main|Indoor residual spraying}}
Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, ''e.g.'' malathion and [[bendiocarb]], respectively, are more expensive than DDT per kilogram and are applied at roughly the same dosage. [[Pyrethroid]]s such as [[deltamethrin]] are also more expensive than DDT, but are applied more sparingly (0.02–0.3&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vs 1–2&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so the net cost per house is about the same.&lt;ref name="AmJTrop"/&gt;

====Non-chemical vector control====
Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or curtailed in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning mosquito breeding grounds and larva habitats, for example by eliminating standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killeen GF, Fillinger U, Kiche I, Gouagna LC, Knols BG | title = Eradication of Anopheles gambiae from Brazil: lessons for malaria control in Africa? | journal = The Lancet.

It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict when and where the breeding sites will form, and to find and treat them before the adults emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/vector_control.html |title=CDC – Malaria – Malaria Worldwide – How Can Malaria Cases and Deaths Be Reduced? – Larval Control and Other Vector Control Interventions |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative effectiveness of IRS versus other malaria control techniques (e.g. bednets or prompt access to anti-malarial drugs) varies and is dependent on local conditions.&lt;ref name="AmJTrop"/&gt;

A WHO study released in January 2008 found that mass distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and [[artemisinin]]–based drugs cut malaria deaths in half in malaria-burdened Rwanda and Ethiopia. IRS with DDT did not play an important role in mortality reduction in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/ReportGFImpactMalaria.pdf Impact of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs) and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) measured using surveillance data in four African countries.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215004936/http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/ReportGFImpactMalaria.pdf |date=February 15, 2008 }} World Health Organization, January 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/01/MN4EUPS3D.DTL&amp;type=health Malaria deaths halved in Rwanda and Ethiopia Better drugs, mosquito nets are the crucial tools], David Brown (Washington Post), ''SF Chronicle'', A-12, February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vietnam]] has enjoyed declining malaria cases and a 97% mortality reduction after switching in 1991 from a poorly funded DDT-based campaign to a program based on prompt treatment, bednets and pyrethroid group insecticides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf World Health Organization, "A story to be shared: The successful fight against malaria in Vietnam," November 6, 2000.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224853/http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf |date=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, effective and affordable chemical and non-chemical strategies were so successful that the Mexican DDT manufacturing plant ceased production due to lack of demand.&lt;ref name="PMC1119118"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_ipenreport_english.pdf |title=DDT &amp; Malaria |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pt5PazSh?url=http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_ipenreport_english.pdf |archivedate=May 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of fourteen studies in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine and changing front–line drug treatment, found decision making limited by the lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the small number of cost-effectiveness analyses, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects of packages of measures and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two cost-effectiveness estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the cost-effectiveness of DDT spraying; the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of cost-effectiveness in current programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman CA, Mills AJ | title = The evidence base on the cost-effectiveness of malaria control measures in Africa | journal = Health Policy and Planning | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–12 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10787646 | doi = 10.1093/heapol/14.4.301 | url = http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/4/301.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study in Thailand found the cost per malaria case prevented of DDT spraying ([[United States dollar|US$]]1.87) to be 21% greater than the cost per case prevented of [[lambda-cyhalothrin]]–treated nets (US$1.54),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamolratanakul P, Butraporn P, Prasittisuk M, Prasittisuk C, Indaratna K | title = Cost-effectiveness and sustainability of lambdacyhalothrin-treated mosquito nets in comparison to DDT spraying for malaria control in western Thailand | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 279–84 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11693869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; casting some doubt on the assumption that DDT was the most cost-effective measure. The director of Mexico's malaria control program found similar results, declaring that it was 25% cheaper for Mexico to spray a house with synthetic pyrethroids than with DDT.&lt;ref name="PMC1119118"/&gt; However, another study in South Africa found generally lower costs for DDT spraying than for impregnated nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman CA, Mnzava AE, Dlamini SS, Sharp BL, Mthembu DJ, Gumede JK | title = Comparison of the cost and cost-effectiveness of insecticide-treated bednets and residual house-spraying in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 280–95 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11348519 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3156.2001.00700.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more comprehensive approach to measuring cost-effectiveness or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure the cost in dollars, as well as the number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative human health impacts. One preliminary study found that it is likely that the detriment to human health approaches or exceeds the beneficial reductions in malarial cases, except perhaps in epidemics. It is similar to the earlier study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jcu.edu.au/jrtph/vol/v04corin.pdf |format=PDF |last1=Corin |first1=S.E. |last2=Weaver |first2=S.A. |year=2005 |title=A risk analysis model with an ecological perspective on DDT and malaria control in South Africa |journal=Journal of Rural and Tropical Public Health |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=21–32 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in the [[Solomon Islands]] found that "although impregnated bed nets cannot entirely replace DDT spraying without substantial increase in incidence, their use permits reduced DDT spraying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Over M, Bakote'e B, Velayudhan R, Wilikai P, Graves PM | title = Impregnated nets or DDT residual spraying? Field effectiveness of malaria prevention techniques in solomon islands, 1993–1999 | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 71 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 214–23 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15331840 | url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/full/71/2_suppl/214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparison of four successful programs against malaria in Brazil, India, Eritrea and Vietnam does not endorse any single strategy but instead states, "Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barat LM | title = Four malaria success stories: how malaria burden was successfully reduced in Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–16 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16407339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT resistant mosquitoes have generally proved susceptible to pyrethroids. Thus far, pyrethroid resistance in ''Anopheles'' has not been a major problem.&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Solomon Islands]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The Solomon Islanders comprise diverse cultures, languages, and customs. Of its,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/01-Nodes_Uebersichtsseiten/Salomonen_node.html&lt;/ref&gt; 94.5% are [[Melanesia]]n, 3% [[Polynesia]]n, and 1.2% [[Micronesia]]n.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html Country profile: Solomon Islands] URL Accessed 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, small numbers of [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] and [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] are registered. About 120 [[vernacular]]s are spoken.

Most people reside in small, widely dispersed settlements along the coasts. Sixty percent live in localities with fewer than 200 persons, and only 10% reside in urban areas.

The capital city of [[Honiara]] is situated on [[Guadalcanal]], the largest island. The other principal towns are [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]], [[Auki]], and [[Kirakira]].

Most Solomon Islanders are [[Christian]], with the [[Anglican]], [[Methodist]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[South Seas Evangelical]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] faiths predominating. About 5% of the population maintain traditional beliefs.

The chief characteristics of the traditional Melanesian social structure are:
* The practice of [[subsistence economy]];
* The recognition of bonds of kinship, with important obligations extending beyond the immediate family group;
* Generally egalitarian relationships, emphasising acquired rather than inherited status; and
* A strong attachment of the people to the land.

Most Solomon Islanders maintain this traditional social structure and find their roots in village life.

[[Image:Le droit du Seigneur by Vasiliy Polenov.jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Vasily Polenov]]: ''Le droit du Seigneur'' (1874); a nineteenth-century artist's painting of an old man bringing his young daughters to their feudal lord.]]

'''''Droit du seigneur''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|ɑː|_|d|ə|_|s|eɪ|ˈ|n|j|ɜr}}; {{IPA-fr|dʁwa dy sɛɲœʁ|lang}}, 'lord's right'), also known as '''''jus primae noctis''''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|p|r|aɪ|m|i|_|ˈ|n|ɒ|k|t|ɪ|s}}; {{IPA-la|ju:s ˈpri:mae̯ 'nɔktɪs|lang}}, 'right of the first night'), refers to a supposed [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] in medieval Europe, allowing [[Feudalism|feudal lords]] to have sexual relations with subordinate women, in particular, on their wedding nights.

Some scholars believe the "right" might have existed in medieval Europe.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}{{sfn|McKechnie|1930|pages=310–311}} Others say that it is a myth, and that all references to it are from later periods.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=311–312}}

Similar customs have been recorded elsewhere.

==Terminology==
The French expression ''droit du seigneur'' translates as "right of the lord", but native French prefer the terms ''droit de jambage'' ({{IPA-fr|dʁwa d(ə) ʒɑ̃baʒ|lang}}, from ''jambe'', 'leg') or ''droit de cuissage'' ({{IPA-fr|dʁwa d(ə) kɥisaʒ|lang}}, from ''cuisse'', 'thigh').

The term is often used synonymously with ''jus primae noctis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|jus primæ noctis}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "right of the first night".

==Ancient era==

In the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', [[Gilgamesh]] is described as having practiced a similar custom:  "He is king, he does whatever he wants... takes the girl from her mother and uses her, the warrior's daughter, the young man's bride."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gilgamesh: A New English Version|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|publisher=Free Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7432-6164-7|location=New York, USA|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions a similar custom among the [[Marmarica|Adyrmachidae]] in [[ancient Libya]]: "They are also the only tribe with whom the custom obtains of bringing all women about to become brides before the king, that he may choose such as are agreeable to him."&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, iv.168 ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.htm on-line text]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the plebians of the Etruscan city of [[Volsinii]] rebelled against the aristocrats in 280 BC, "They took their wives for themselves and placed the daughters of the nobles under the ''jus primae noctis'', while all their former masters on whom they could lay hands were tortured to death."&lt;ref&gt;Von Vacano, Otto-Wilhelm, ''The Etruscans in the Ancient World'', at 164 (Indiana University Press)({{ISBN|0253200814}}). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
[[File:Ivrea Carnevale Mugnaia 03.JPG|thumb|287px|The [[Battle of the Oranges#Miller's daughter|Mugnaia]] in [[Ivrea]], Italy, taking part in a festival that supposedly commemorates a revolt against the ''droit du seigneur'']]
The medieval marriage fine or [[merchet]] has been interpreted as a payment for the ''droit du seigneur'' to be waived.&lt;ref name="fibri.de"&gt;''[http://www.fibri.de/jus/arthbes.htm The jus primae noctis as a male power display: A review of historic sources with evolutionary interpretation]'' by Jörg Wettlaufer - Evolution and Human Behavior, Vol 21, Nr. 2 (2000): 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it has been interpreted as compensation to the lord for the young women leaving his lands.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} 

A similar payment to church authorities has also been interpreted as relating the ''droit du seigneur''. However, according to British scholar WD Howarth, the church at some times prohibited consummation of a marriage on the first night. The payment was for an indulgence from the church to waive this prohibition.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=301–302}}

The life of [[Gerald of Aurillac]] written by [[Odo of Cluny]] (879-942) gives an account of the young nobleman demanding sex with one of his serfs, only to have the act averted by a miracle, sending Gerald on the road to sainthood. American historian [[Vern Bullough]] suggested that this illustrates that such behaviour was commonplace in the period, and that the "legend [of ''droit du seigneur''] reflected the reality".{{sfn|Bullough|1991|pp=164–165}}

In the fourteenth-century French epic poem ''[[Baudouin de Sebourc]]'', a tyrannical lord claims the ''jus primae noctis'' unless he receives part of the bride's dowry.&lt;ref name="fibri.de"/&gt;

The supposed right was abolished by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in Article 9 of the ''[[Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe]]'' in 1486.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=239}}

==Later European references==
[[File:HectorBoece.jpg|left|thumb|Hector Boece, the first historian to record the ''droit due seigneur'', in 1527]]
In 1527, Scottish historian [[Hector Boece]] wrote that the "right" had existed in Scotland until abolished by [[Malcolm III]] (r. 1058-93) under the influence of his wife, Margaret (later [[St Margaret of Scotland]]). The payment of [[merchet]] was instituted in its place.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} Boece attributed the law to a legendary [[King Ewen]] (Evenus) III.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=298}} Modern French scholar Alain Boureau says that Boece probably invented King Ewen, but he was mythologising not polemicising.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|pp=17–18}}

Other Scottish scholars of his era quoted Boece with approval, including [[John Lesley]] (1578),  [[George Buchanan]] (1582), and [[Habbakuk Bisset]] (1626).{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=17}} The historical existence of the custom in Scotland was also accepted in Scottish legal works such as [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich|James Balfour]]'s ''Practicks'' (c 1579), [[John Skene, Lord Curriehill|John Skene]]'s ''De Verborum'' (1597), and [[Thomas Craig (jurist)|Thomas Craig]]'s ''Jus Feudale'' (1603).{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} English scholar [[Henry Spelman]] stated in his ''Glossary'' (1664) that the custom had existed in Scotland, but not in England.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} English jurist [[William Blackstone]] cited Boece's statement in his [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] (1765–1769), while similarly noting that the custom had never existed in England.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/blackstone-commentaries-on-the-laws-of-england-in-four-books-2-vols Commentaries on the Laws of England]'', volume 1, book 1, chapter 6, p. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2140#lf1387-01_mnt_537 83].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, Scottish jurist [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] disputed the existence of the custom, arguing Boece's account was purely legendary, but his position was often seen as based on Scottish patriotism.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=305–306, 310}} However, according to Scottish legal scholar [[David Maxwell Walker]], there have been instances recorded of the ''jus'' being claimed up to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}{{sfn|McKechnie|1930|pp=309–310}} Walker concluded that it is possible that the ''jus'' existed as a custom in Scotland, dependent on the attitude of the king, and survived longer in remote regions.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}

The right was mentioned in 1556 in the ''Recueil d'arrêts notables des cours souveraines de France'' of French lawyer and author [[Jean Papon]].{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=203}} French writer [[Antoine du Verdier]] also commented on it in 1577.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=301}}

In Shakespeare's play, ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' (c 1591), the rebel [[Jack Cade]] proclaimed, "there shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|first=William|last=Shakespeare|title=Henry VI, Part 2|page=Act IV, Scene VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to French scholar Alain Boureau, Cade was demanding the payment of merchet, not the right of first night,{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=266}} but others disagree.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=299–300}}

The Spanish novel [[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]] (1617) by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] contains an episode where a bride and groom escape a barbaric marriage custom in Ireland. According to British scholar WD Howarth, Cervantes was inspired by Peruvian marriage ceremonies and what is described is different from the classic version of the ''droit du seigneur'' as it involves multiple virgins. However, Cervantes' story was a source for the English play [[The Custom of the Country (play)|The Custom of the Country]], written by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and [[Philip Massinger]] and published in 1647. The play has the classic version of the "right of first night" with money payment as an alternative. According to Howarth, this suggests that ''droit du seigneur'' was a familiar notion to people at that time, which he traces back to Boece.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=296–298}}

The [[Jesuit]] hagiographical work [[Acta Sanctorum]] (Acts of the Saints), published from 1643 onwards, recorded the existence of ''jus primae noctis'' in its biographies of St Margaret and [[St Forannan]].{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=19–20}}

English lexicographer [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]] recorded the "right" as a medieval custom of some English manors in ''Fragmenta Antiquitatis'' in 1679.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=300}}

French philosopher [[Montesquieu]] referred to the practice in [[The Spirit of the Laws]] (1748), saying that it had been enforced in France over three nights.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=302}}

[[File:Maurice Quentin de La Tour, portrait de Voltaire (1735) avec agrandissement.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Voltaire, the first person to use the term ''droit du seigneur'', in 1762]]
[[Voltaire]] mentioned the practice in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', published in 1764.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=41}} He wrote the five-act comedy ''Le droit du seigneur'' or ''L'écueil du sage''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|2-911825-04-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1762, although it was not performed until 1779, after his death. This play was the first time the term ''droit du seigneur'' was used.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=304}} In eighteenth-century France, a number of writers made other claims about the supposed power of the overlords during the [[Ancien Régime]], such as the ''droit de ravage'' (right of ravage; providing to the lord the right to devastate fields of his own domain), and the ''droit de prélassement'' (right of lounging; it was said that a lord had the right to disembowel his serfs to warm his feet in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Péricard-Méa|first=Denise|title=Le Moyen âge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRwi1yDx-H8C&amp;pg=PA90|year=2005|publisher=Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot|isbn=9782877478236|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their travels in Scotland in 1773, [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] documented the custom of the payment of [[merchet]], linking it with the "right of first night". They paralleled it with that custom of [[Borough English]], suggesting that the English custom favored the youngest son because the paternity of the eldest son was doubtful.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=299}}

In [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', which premiered in 1786 with a libretto by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], the comic plot revolves around the successful efforts of the young bride and groom, Figaro and Susanna, to block the efforts of the unfaithful Count Almaviva to seduce Susanna. To achieve his aim, the frustrated Count threatens to reinstitute ''droit du seigneur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMarriageOfFigaro|title=The Marriage of Figaro (Theatre) - TV Tropes|website=TV Tropes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on a play by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]].{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}}

British writer [[Isaac D'Israeli]] stated the practice had been widespread across Europe in his best-selling book, ''The Curiosities of Literature'' (1823).{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=302, 310}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] mentioned the custom in his historical Scottish novel, [[The Fair Maid of Perth]] (1828).{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}}

==Debate in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries==

Scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth century gave the historical basis of the "right of first night" a good deal of attention.{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}} Over time, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and the [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] encyclopedias dramatically changed their opinion on the topic.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=292–293}} French writer [[Louis Veuillot]], a champion of Catholicism, wrote a book in 1854 disputing its existence.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=308–309}} After an historical exhaustive study, German jurist Karl Schmidt concluded in 1881 that it was a scholarly misconception.{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}} After Schmidt, many of those who believed in the existence of the custom based their opinions on anthropological studies of tribal societies, though according to WD Howarth this was a misguided argument because of the disparity between the tribal societies and medieval European society.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=293–295}}

In ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' in 1884, socialist [[Friedrich Engels]] argued it was real and had an anthropological origin.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State''], 1884, pp 28, 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1930, Scottish legal scholar Hector McKechnie concluded, based on historical evidence, that the practice had existed in Scotland in early times.{{sfn|McKechnie|1930|pages=310–311}}

Italian scholar [[Paolo Mantegazza]], in his 1935 book ''The Sexual Relations of Mankind'', said that while not a law, it was most likely a binding custom.{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}}

In the Hawaiian Islands, marriage in the Western sense did not exist until the arrival of Christian missionaries; there was no word for husband or wife in the Hawaiian language. The privilege for chiefs was often observed, according to "''Sexual Behavior in Pre Contact Hawai‘i''" by [[Milton Diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;(Revista Española del Pacifico. 2004. 16: 37-58)&lt;/ref&gt;  A young girl's parents viewed the coupling with favor.&lt;ref&gt;(Pukui, Haertig, and Lee, 1972, p. 91; Sahlins, 1985, p. 24)&lt;/ref&gt; If she were lucky, she might conceive his offspring and be allowed to keep it. When western ships arrived, young girls and wives eagerly coupled with sailors who, given their weapons and large ships, were thought to be gods.&lt;ref&gt;(Pukui, Haertig, and Lee, 1972, p. 92)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to describe the sexual exploitation of slaves in the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin of Others|last=Morrison|first=Toni|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-674-97645-0|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-Portuguese era===
According to tradition, [[Bartholomew the Apostle]] visited India and elsewhere during the first century AD. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Jordanus|Jordanus Catalani]], who was [[Catalonia|Catalan]] or [[Occitania|Occitan]] (southern French), began evangelizing in [[Nala Sopara|Sopara]], [[Thane|Thana]] and north [[Konkan]]. Sopara was an ancient port and an international trading center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-I/population_christians.html#2 Thana District Gazetteer Part – I: Population:Christians-History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110033730/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-I/population_christians.html#2 |date=10 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Indian church history was lost between the ninth and fourteenth centuries as Persia converted to [[Nestorianism]] in 800 AD. Since church offices and public worship was dependent on a foreign source, when the foreign aid was withdrawn Indians became [[nominal Christian]]s.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===Portuguese era===
{{Main|History of Bombay under Portuguese rule (1534–1661)}}
The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] came to India in 1498, and their policy was to return the Indian Christians to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name="bapp"/&gt; Although Brahmins and other high-status Hindus who were ceremoniously converted by the Portuguese were treated with honor and distinction,&lt;ref name="bapp"/&gt; groups engaged in agriculture, fishing and other rural occupations handed down by their ancestors received neither secular nor religious education.&lt;ref name="bapp"/&gt; Among the Portuguese converts were a number of descendants of the Christian community reportedly founded by [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Apostle St. Bartholomew]],&lt;ref name="bapp"/&gt; whom the Portuguese molded into a community&lt;ref name="bapp"/&gt; sometimes known as "Portuguese Christians".&lt;ref name="bapp"/&gt;

The [[Franciscans]] spearheaded the evangelization of the "Province of the North" (Província do Norte).&lt;ref name="Machado1"/&gt; From 1534 to 1552 a priest, António do Porto, converted over 10,000 people, built a dozen churches and founded a number of orphanages and monasteries. Prominent among the converts were two yogis from the [[Kanheri Caves]] who became known as Paulo Raposo and Francisco de Santa Maria. They introduced Christianity to their fellow yogis, converting many in the process.&lt;ref name="Machado1"/&gt; Another notable convert during this period was the Brahmin astrologer Parashuram Joshi, who was baptized on 8 September 1565 with the name Henrique da Cunha. Joshi was followed by 250 Hindus, including over 50 Brahmins.&lt;ref name="Machado1"/&gt; In Salsette, the priest Manuel Gomes converted over 6,000 Hindus in Bandra and was known as the Apostle of Salsette.&lt;ref name="Machado1"/&gt;

In 1573, 1,600 people were converted. Beginning in 1548, [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Bassein (Baçaim) and Bandra converted many upper-class Indians; [[Vasai|Bassein]] Cathedral recorded 9,400 [[baptism]]s. The Jesuit superior Gonçalo Rodrigues baptized between 5,000 and 6,000 people in Thane (Tana), many of whom were orphans or the young children of lower-caste Hindus who were sold by their parents.&lt;ref name="Machado1"&gt;{{harvnb|Machado|1999|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century the Roman Catholic population of the Portuguese Province of the North was 10,000 to 15,000, centered mainly in and around Bassein.&lt;ref name="Machado"&gt;{{harvnb|Machado|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of the Portuguese by the [[Maratha]], Catholics were discriminated against by the state government.&lt;ref name="Machado2"/&gt; Following the fall of Bassein, many Catholics were heavily taxed by Maratha who used the money to feed Brahmins and conduct a successful campaign to return them to Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Machado2"/&gt; Most Portuguese priests were forced to leave, and only five churches (three in Bassein City, one in Bassein District and one in Salsette) were permitted to remain.&lt;ref name="Machado2"/&gt; The remainder of the Christian population was left to native clergy under a [[vicar general]] in [[Holy Cross Church, Kurla|Kurla]]. When Antequil du Perron visited Salsette in 1757, he found a flourishing Catholic population with many churches rebuilt and Christianity practiced openly but no European priests.&lt;ref name="Machado2"&gt;{{harvnb|Machado|1999|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Bombay under British rule|Bombay Presidency}}
Changes occurred under British rule.&lt;ref name="bapp"/&gt; On 11 May 1661, the marriage treaty of [[Charles II of England]] and [[Catherine of Braganza]]—Catarina de Bragança, daughter of King [[John IV of Portugal|João IV of Portugal]]—made Bombay part of the British Empire as intended since the British takeover of [[Surat Agency|Surat]] (allegedly as part of Catherine's dowry to Charles). A weakened Portugal, no longer part of the Crown of Spain, had to oblige. Nevertheless, parts of present-day Mumbai (such as Bandra, Thane and Vasai) remained Portuguese well into the first third of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Catherine of Bragança (1638–1705)
|publisher=[[BBC]]
|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early days of the East India Company, there were no other Indian Christians in the North Konkan except the East Indian Catholics. Employment intended for Christians was monopolized by the East Indians. With railways and steamships came immigrants from Goa who were also known as Portuguese Christians. The British adopted a designation which would distinguish
the Christians of North Konkan (who were British subjects) from the [[Goan Catholics]], who were Portuguese subjects (the [[Mangalorean Catholics]] were no longer Portuguese subjects). For Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, the Christians of North Konkan changed their name from "Portuguese Christians" to "East Indian" to impress on the British government of Bombay that they were the earliest Roman Catholic subjects of the British Crown in that part of India and were entitled to certain natural rights and privileges compared with the immigrants.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The Bombay East Indian Association was founded on 26 May 1887 to advance the education, employment, rights and economic development of the East Indians. P. F. Gomes, who was knighted by Pope Leo XIII in 1888, was its first president and J. L. Britto its first sSecretary. D. G. Almeida donated {{INR|100,000|link=yes}} to establish an education fund.

During the 1960s, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay|Archdiocese of Bombay]] estimated that there were 92,000 East Indians in Bombay: 76,000 in [[Mumbai Suburban district|suburban Bombay]] and 16,000 in [[Mumbai City district|the city]].&lt;ref name="bapp"&gt;{{harvnb|Baptista|1967|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, local [[non-governmental organization]]s such as the Watchdog Foundation, Mobai Gaothan Panchayat, the Bombay East India Association, Vakola Advanced Locality Management, Kalina Civic Forum and the Kolovery Welfare Association formed the [[Maharashtra Swaraj Party]] (MSP).&lt;ref&gt;

A typical Koli house consists of a [[veranda]] (''oli''), used for repairing nets and receiving visitors; a sitting-room (''angan''), used by women for household work; a kitchen, a central apartment, a bedroom, a devotional room (''devaghar'') and a detached bathroom.&lt;ref name="koli"/&gt;

==Language and literature==
East Indian Catholics speak a dialect of [[Marathi language|Marathi]], which they retained despite Portuguese influence. The Marathi language is central to the community's identity. The author of ''Trans. Bomb. Geog. Soc., 1836–38, Vol. I.'' mentions the dialect of Marathi spoken by the East Indians of [[Salsette]], [[Mahim]], [[Matunga]] and [[Mazagon]], similar to the language spoken by the Kulbis, Kolis, Bhandaris, Palshes, Prabhus, [[Panchkalshi]]s, Kuparis and Vadvals; this may have been [[Konkani language|Konkani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island I, II &amp; III|1997|loc=[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/volume_1/Languages.html Chapter III : Population : Languages]|Ref=gz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some East Indian upper-class families in the Khatri ward of [[Thane]] speak Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-I/population_christians.html#4 Thane Gazetteer: Population: Christians – Speech]&lt;/ref&gt; 110 Portuguese lexical items are found in Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=={{anchor|Costumes and ornaments}}Dress==
Traditional dress for women is the ''[[Kasta sari|lugra]]'', and for men are [[khaki]] shorts and a white ''[[Vest|banian]]''. A Koli Christian bridegroom usually wears an older Portuguese admiral's uniform, which is preserved and lent out for such occasions.&lt;ref name="koli"&gt;{{harvnb|Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island I, II &amp; III|1997|loc=[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/volume_1/The%20Kolis.html Chapter III : Population : The Kolis]|Ref=gz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
East Indian women wore a blouse and cotton ''lugra'', with the back pleats tucked into the waist; women did not use of the upper portion of the sari (covering the head and breast) until they were married. This mode of wearing the sari is known as ''sakacch nesane''. ''Gol nesane'', a cylindrical style, is popular with young girls and women.&lt;ref name="sari"&gt;{{harvnb|Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island I|1986|loc=[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/greater_bombay/people.html#17 Chp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1212">The '''Lunda''' people of the [[Luapula River]] valley in [[Zambia]] and [[DR Congo]] are called by others the '''''Eastern Lunda''''' to distinguish them from the [[Lunda people|'western' Lunda people]] who remained in the heartland of the former [[Lunda Kingdom]], but they themselves would use '''''Kazembe-Lunda''''' or '''Luunda''' with an elongated 'u' to make that distinction. (The name 'Lunda' may also be spelled '''Luunda''').

The Eastern Lunda migrated in the 18th Century to their current area under the leader [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]]. Their neighbours in northern Zambia to whom they are allied, the [[Bemba people|Bemba]], did so at the same time, and the Eastern Lunda took on the [[Bemba language]] in place of the [[Chilunda]], their original language. Their (western) Lunda compatriots in the [[North-Western Province (Zambia)|North-Western Province]] of Zambia still speak Chilunda however.

In economics, '''economic transformation''' refers to the continuous process of (1) moving labour and other resources from lower- to higher-productivity sectors ('''[[structural change]]''' or '''structural transformation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Berthold |last=Herrendorf |first2=Richard |last2=Rogerson |first3=Ákos |last3=Valentinyi |title=Growth and Structural Transformation |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 18996 |date=April 2013 |doi=10.3386/w18996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and (2) raising within-sector '''[[productivity]]''' growth.&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, M., J. Page, D. Booth and D.W. te Velde (2017). [http://set.odi.org/set-approach-paper/ ''Supporting Economic Transformation: An approach paper.'']&lt;/ref&gt; As such, economic transformation emphasises the movement from low- to high-productivity activities within and across all sectors (which can be tasks or activities that are combinations of agriculture, manufacturing and services). This movement of resources from lower productivity to higher-productivity activities is a key driver of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McMillan |first=M. |last2=Rodrik |first2=D. |title=Globalization, Structural Change and Productivity Growth |work=NBER Working Paper No. 17143 |date=June 2011 |doi=10.3386/w17143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Within-sector productivity growth entails the adoption of new technologies and management practices that increase the efficiency of production. It can come about as a result of the increased efficiency of existing firms or as a result of the reallocation of resources away from the least productive firms towards more productive firms.

== Measures of economic transformation ==
Economic transformation can be measured through production/value-added measures and trade-based measures. Production-based measures include: (1) sector value added and employment data, to show productivity gaps between sectors; and (2) firm-level productivity measures, to examine average productivity levels of firms within one sector.&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, M., J. Page, D. Booth and D.W. te Velde (2017). [http://set.odi.org/set-approach-paper/ ''Supporting Economic Transformation: An approach paper''.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trade-based measures include: (1) measures of [[revealed comparative advantage]] to show the levels of specialisation of a country in certain exports; and (2) export diversification measures such as those produced by the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;International Monetary Fund Diversification Toolkit, available here: https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/dfidimf/diversification.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, J. and te Velde, D.

A [[System Reference Document]] (SRD) of the 3rd edition of ''D&amp;D'' had been licensed under the [[Open Gaming License]] (OGL). The OGL is a [[copyright license]], allowing the use of copyrighted text created by others in one's products. Also released at the same time was the [[d20 System]] Trademark License, allowing third-party publishers to indicate compatibility using a system logo, but not allowing the use of the ''D&amp;D'' trademark.

The GSL, however, grants use of the 4th Edition System Reference Document, which lists trademarks, words, and short phrases that could be used to refer to materials in the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition rules, but contains no rules itself. People wishing to use this license are also granted a logo that must be placed onto their products to state that they are compatible with ''Dungeon &amp; Dragons'' 4th Edition.&lt;ref name="GSL text"/&gt; The license also can be updated by Wizards of the Coast and updates affect all licensees; in case of litigation the licensees must pay the legal costs of Wizards of the Coast.

Prior to [[Gen Con]] 2008, it was announced that the GSL was undergoing a revision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4news/20080811 WotC to Revise D&amp;D 4th Edition GSL and SRD]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the end of the convention a number of Wizards of the Coast's jobs were eliminated, including the Licensing Manager position that was held by [[Linae Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.wizards.com/Company/Press/?doc=20080820 Wizards Announces New Organizational Alignment]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the 5th edition of ''D&amp;D'' in 2014, and the release under the OGL of an SRD for that edition, the GSL fell into disuse, though it remains the only license for 4th edition.

The '''[[Germans|German]]''' minority in [[Paraguay]] came into existence with immigration during the [[industrial age]]. The "[[Nueva Germania]]" colony was founded in Paraguay in 1888; though regarded as a failure, still exists despite being abandoned by many of its founders in the 1890s. Paraguay was a popular place for German leaders accused of [[war crime]]s to retreat after the [[second World War]]. Also, there is a large minority of German descendants living in the department of [[Itapúa Department|Itapúa]], mainly in the Departmental Capital, [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]] and the German town of [[Hohenau (Paraguay)|Hohenau]]. Most of the Germans who settle in this region came from the larger German colonies from neighboring [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Some recent Brazilian immigrants to Paraguay have also German ancestry ([[Brasiguayos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Tony|title=Paraguay Mennonites Find Success a Mixed Blessing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/world/paraguay-mennonites-find-success-a-mixed-blessing.html|work=The New York Times|date=10 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable Paraguayans of German descent include the former president of Paraguay [[Alfredo Stroessner]].

==Russian Mennonites==
{{Main|Mennonites in Paraguay}}
Another large group of Germans who immigrated to Paraguay are [[Russian Mennonite]]s, Germans who immigrated to Russia under the rule of the ethnic German [[Catherine II of Russia|Czarina Catherine the Great]]. The Paraguayan Mennonite community left Russia in two waves: the first in the 19th century when their exemption from military service ended, and the second to avoid Stalin's collectivization programs. Russian Mennonites are different from another German-Russian group, the [[Volga Germans]], through religion and reasons of immigrating to Russia. Russian Mennonites are religious [[Mennonites]] while the Volga Germans are religious [[Lutherans]] and [[Roman Catholics]]. Russian Mennonites went to Russia for purposes of freedom of worship, while the Volga Germans went for economic reasons and land.

When the Communists came to power in Russia, the German-speaking population were persecuted by the new Soviet Government. Some Russian Mennonites saw Paraguay as a perfect place to settle because it looked isolated. The government of Paraguay wanted settlement in the Chaco region, which was under dispute with its southern neighbor, Argentina, and its western neighbor, Bolivia. The move to Paraguay was difficult for the Russian Mennonites, because they were new to the climate. Some Russian Mennonites left Paraguay for neighboring Argentina, where they met many Volga Germans, who decided to settle in Argentina to escape the persecution in Russia. The situation changed and the Russian Mennonites began to prosper in Paraguay.

The Russian Mennonites settled in the [[Boquerón Department]] in Paraguay. They established the [[Fernheim Colony]], which includes the town of [[Filadelfia]]; [[Neuland Colony]]; and [[Menno Colony]]. The descendants of the Russian Mennonite immigrants continue to live these colonies.

'''Jews and Judaism in China''' are predominantly composed of [[Sephardi Jews]] and their descendants. Other [[Jewish ethnic divisions]] are also represented, including [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Mizrahi Jews]] and a number of converts.

The Jewish Chinese community manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions, and it also encompasses the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance. Though a small minority, Chinese Jews have had an open presence in the country since the arrival of the first Jewish immigrants during the 8th century CE. Relatively isolated communities of Jews developed through the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Dynasties (7th to 13th centuries CE) all the way through the [[Qing Dynasty]] (19th century), most notably the [[Kaifeng Jews]] (the term "Chinese Jews" is often used in a restricted sense in order to refer to these communities). Unlike other places, the Chinese authorities had tremendous respect for Jewish communities and they did not face significant [[anti-Semitism]] in comparison to [[Jews in Europe|Europe]] and [[Jews in America|America]].

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish merchants from around the world began to trade in Chinese ports, particularly in the commercial centers of [[Hong Kong]], which was for a time a British colony; [[Shanghai]] (the [[Shanghai International Settlement|International Settlement]] and [[French Concession]]); and [[Harbin]] (the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]). In the first half of the 20th century, thousands of Jewish refugees escaping from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917 Russian Revolution]] arrived in China. By the time of the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, only a few Chinese Jews were known to have maintained the practice of their religion and culture though the Kaifeng synagogue survived for around seven centuries until 1860. China's Jewish communities have been ethnically diverse ranging from the Jews of Kaifeng and other places during the [[History of China#Imperial China|history of Imperial China]], who, it is reported, came to be more or less totally assimilated into the majority Han Chinese populace due to widespread intermarriage.&lt;ref name="Walgrove"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.momentmag.com/jewish-history-in-china-boosting-sino-israeli-relations/ |title=Jewish History in China Boosting Sino-Israeli Relations |last=Walgrove |first=Amanda |date=March 25, 2011 |website=Moment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eikenburg"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.speakingofchina.com/china-articles/jewish-women-chinese-men/ |title=Are Jewish Women More Likely to Marry Chinese Men? |last=Eikenburg  |first=Jocelyn |date=February 28, 2011 |website=Speaking of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, however, some international Jewish groups have helped Chinese Jews rediscover their Jewish heritage and reconnect with their Jewish roots.&lt;ref name="Jpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/FUNDAMENTALLY-FREUND-Stop-the-crackdown-on-Chinas-Jews-467140|title=Stopping the crackdown on China’s Jews - Opinion - Jerusalem Post|date=2016-09-08|publisher=Jpost.com|accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews remain a small minority in China, but unlike Jewish communities in many other parts of the world, Jews have historically lived in China without any instances of [[antisemitism]] from the Han majority populace contributing to mutual respect and admiration between the two peoples.&lt;ref name="Gerstenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walgrove"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Revitalizing the silk route"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biubogrim.org.il/?CategoryID=305&amp;ArticleID=1732 |title=Revitalizing the silk route |publisher=Biubogrim.org.il |date= |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olds"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theblot.com/israeli-woman-in-china-gets-respect-not-anti-semitism-7738872 |title= Israeli Woman in China Gets Respect, Not Anti-Semitism |last=Olds |first=Dorri |date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Han Chinese have developed a favorable view of Jews, admiring them for their contributions to humanity, their ability to survive, the sharing of Chinese values such as family, frugality, hard work and education, and being products of ancient civilizations have been an impetus towards the long and enduring friendship between the Chinese and Jewish peoples.&lt;ref name="zionistcouncil.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khlystov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walgrove"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2012/06/22/stop-and-smell-the-blossoming-ties-between-israel-and-china/ |title=Stop and smell the blossoming ties between Israel and China |date= June 22, 2012 |website=Jewish News of Northern California}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the intrinsic affinity that the Chinese people feel for the Jews, relations between the two communities have been mutually close, harmonious and friendly, due to shared common cultural similarities between the two peoples which has resulted in Jews enjoying equal rights and coexisting peacefully alongside the mainstream Han Chinese populace with instances of Jews assimilating into the Han Chinese community through intermarriage.&lt;ref name="Walgrove"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wald 2004 63"&gt;{{Cite book |title=China and the Jewish People |last=Wald |first=Shalom Salomon  |publisher=The Jewish People Planning Policy Institute / GefenPublishing House |year=2004 |isbn=965-229-347-4 |location=Jerusalem |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eikenburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asia Times Online"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/CHIN-01-100114.html| title=Common traits bind Jews and Chinese | publisher=Asia Times Online | date=Jan 10, 2014 | accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spengler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pjmedia.com/spengler/2014/01/11/common-traits-bind-jews-and-chinese/|title=Common Traits Bind Jews and Chinese|work=Spengler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared affinities and similar cultural commonalities has not only been an impetus for the close bonds between China and Israel but has also created a symbol of brotherhood between the two communities.&lt;ref name="zionistcouncil.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leichman"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.israel21c.org/noa-still-searching-for-another-way/ |title=Noa – still searching for another way |last=Leichman	 |first=Abigail  |website=Israel21C |publication-date=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
China’s first contact with the Jewish people came as a result of the development of the [[Silk Road]], an ancient trade route linking China with the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]] that was created during the [[Han Dynasty]] in 206 BCE and incorporated existing trade routes that were established 200 years earlier by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.thetower.org/article/through-trade-and-tourism-china-turns-its-attention-to-israel/ |title=Through Trade and Tourism, China Turns Its Attention to Israel |last=Stub  |first=Sara Toth |date=January 31, 2017 |website= The Tower Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of Jews to China traveled from [[West Asia]] over the Silk Road and by sea via [[India]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907 CE). They consisted of Babylonian and Persian Jews (modern day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]]) who traveled along the Silk Road and received the Tang Emperor’s blessing to reside in [[Kaifeng]].&lt;ref name="Jpost.com"/&gt; They eventually formed a distinct Kaifeng Jewish Community during the Song Dynasty where many eventually became prominent government officials, doctors, rabbis, and businessmen. They eventually assimilated into Chinese culture, learned the language, and began to intermarry with the Han populace.&lt;ref name="Walgrove"/&gt; Other Western scholars speculate that the first wave of Jewish settlement in China may have arrived even earlier during the Later Han dynasty (25 – 220 CE), which coincides with the Roman persecution of Judean Jews after the Roman destroyed the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|Temple at Jerusalem in 70 CE]].&lt;ref name="sino-judaic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sino-judaic.org/index.php?page=general_history |title=The Sino-Judaic Institute |publisher=Sino-judaic.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a community of Jewish immigrants in China is consistent with the history of the Jewish people during the first and second millennia CE, which saw them disperse and settle throughout the Eurasian landmass, with an especially large concentration of Jews settling throughout [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=Bukhara&gt;"[http://www.asiasource.org/news/at_mp_02.cfm?newsid=25071 Jewish Communities in Asia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206051818/http://asiasource.org/news/at_mp_02.cfm?newsid=25071 |date=2006-12-06 }}." Asia Society. 12 July 2000 (Accessed 19 Nov 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th century, the Persian geographer [[ibn Khordadbeh]] noted the travels of Jewish merchants called ''[[Radhanite]]s'', whose trade took them to China via the [[Silk Road]] through Central Asia and India.

During the period of China's opening to the West and British quasi-colonialism, the first group to settle in China were Jews who arrived in China under British protection following the [[First Opium War]]. Many of these Jews were of Sephardic [[Indian Jews|Indian]] or [[Iraqi Jews|Iraqi]] origin, due to significant British colonialism in these regions. The second community came in the first decades of the 20th century when many Jews arrived in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] during those cities' periods of economic expansion.
Many more Jews arrived as refugees from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. A surge of Jews and Jewish families was to arrive in the late 1930s and 1940s, for the purpose of seeking refuge from the [[Holocaust]] in Europe and were predominantly of European origin. Shanghai was notable for its volume of Jewish refugees, most of whom left after the war, the rest relocating prior to or immediately after the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]].

Over the centuries, the Kaifeng community came to be virtually indistinguishable from the Han Chinese population and is not recognized by the Chinese government as a separate [[minorities of China|ethnic minority]]. This is as a result of having maintained already-Jewish and adopted many [[Han Chinese]] customs including [[patrilineal descent]] and extensive intermarriage with the local Han population.&lt;ref name="Eikenburg"/&gt; Since their religious practices are considered to be functionally extinct, they are not eligible for expedited immigration to Israel under the [[Law of Return]] unless they explicitly convert.&lt;ref name="Interfaithfamily.com"&gt;[http://www.interfaithfamily.com/news_and_opinion/synagogues_and_the_jewish_community/The_Truth_About_Matrilineal_Descent.shtml "The Truth About Matrilineal Descent"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eikenburg"/&gt;

Today, many descendants of the Jews have assimilated into the majority [[Han Chinese]] populace. Some of them, as well as international Jewish communities are beginning to search for these descendants to help them revive their interest in their Jewish roots. This is especially important in modern China because belonging to any minority group includes a variety of benefits including [[One-child policy|reduced restrictions on the number of children]] and easier admission standards to [[tertiary education]].

The study of Judaism in China has been, like other Abrahamic religions, a subject of interest to some Westerners, and has achieved moderate success compared to other Western studies in China.{{dubious|date=June 2016}}

==History==
It has been asserted by some that the Jews who have historically resided in various places in China originated with the [[Lost Ten Tribes]] of the exiled ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] who relocated to the areas of present-day China. Traces of some ancient [[613 mitzvot|Jewish rituals]] have been observed in some places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/israel/losttribes3.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Lost Tribes of Israel &amp;#124; Where are the Ten Lost Tribes? (3) |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One well-known group was the [[Kaifeng Jews]], who are purported to have traveled from [[Persia]] to [[India]] during the mid-[[Han Dynasty]] and later migrated from the Muslim-inhabited regions of northwestern China (modern day [[Gansu]] province) to [[Henan]] province during the early [[Northern Song Dynasty]] ([tel:960-1127 960-1127]).&lt;ref name=stone/&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jews of Kai-Fung-Foo, China.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jews of Kaifeng, late 19th or early 20th century]]
There is an oral tradition that the first Jews immigrated to China through Persia following the Roman Emperor [[Titus]]'s capture of Jerusalem in 70 CE. A large number of Jews emigrated from Persia during the reign of [[Emperor Ming of Han]] (58-75 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_4cTxL3MF3YC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=jerusalem+titus+china+jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Vi0QR8bhB&amp;sig=vXVDJfrbDC-1sRgA3Km4d3guU5A&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=PLM2SvfKOpLJ_gbQqvH0Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PPA71,M1 Alfred Edelsheim. History of the Jewish Nation after the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus. Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 71.] {{ISBN|1-4179-1234-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in 1900, Father Joseph Brucker hypothesized that Jews came to China from India by a sea route during the [[Song dynasty]] between 960 and 1126.

Three [[stele]]s with inscriptions found at Kaifeng bear some historical suggestions. The oldest, dating from 1489, commemorates the construction of a synagogue (1163) (bearing the name ''[[Qīngzhēn]] Sì'', a term often used for mosque in Chinese), states the Jews entered China from India in the Later [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 [[Common Era|CE]]), the Jews' 70 [[Chinese surnames]], their audience with an "un-named" [[Song Dynasty]] Emperor, and finally lists the transmission of their religion from [[Abraham]] down to the prophet [[Ezra]]. The second tablet, dated 1512 (found in the synagogue ''Xuanzhang Daojing Si'') details the Jews' religious practices. The third is dated 1663 and commemorates the re-rebuilding of the ''Qingzhen si'' synagogue and recaps the information from the other two steles.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;Weisz, Tiberiu. ''The Kaifeng Stone Inscriptions: The Legacy of the Jewish Community in Ancient China''. New York: iUniverse, 2006 ({{ISBN|0-595-37340-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Joseph Brucker believed [[Matteo Ricci]]'s manuscripts indicate there were only approximately ten or twelve Jewish families in Kaifeng in the late 16th and early 17th century, and that they had reportedly resided there for five or six hundred years. It was also stated in the manuscripts that there was a greater number of Jews in [[Hangzhou]]. This could be taken to suggest that loyal Jews fled south along with the soon-to-be crowned [[Emperor Gaozong of Song China|Emperor Gaozong]] to [[Hangzhou]]. In fact, the 1489 stele mentions how the Jews "abandoned Bianliang" ([[Kaifeng]]) after the [[Jingkang Incident]].[[File:Yue Fei tatoo on Jewish stele (highlighted).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Section of the 1512 stele which mentions Yue's famous tattoo.]]

Many Jewish communities were established in China in the Middle Ages. However, not all left evidence of their existence. The following are those known today: [[Kaifeng]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Ningbo]], [[Yangzhou]], and [[Ningxia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA156,M1 Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

===Names===
The contemporary term for Jews in use among Chinese today is ''Youtairen'' ({{zh|c=猶太人|p=Yóutài Rén}}) in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] Chinese. The term ''Youtai'' has a similar pronunciation to ''יהודאי'' (''Yehudai'')--the ''[[Aramaic]]'' word for Jew—and to ''Ἰουδαῖος'' (''iudaios''), the Greek word.

It has been recorded that the Chinese historically called the Jews ''Tiao jin jiao'' (挑筋教), loosely, "the religion which removes the sinew,"&lt;ref name="Broomhall1910 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan &amp; Scott, Limited|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably referring to the Jewish [[Kashrut|dietary prohibition]] against eating the [[sciatic nerve]] (from ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' 32:32).&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish dietary law (''[[kashruth]]''), which forbids the eating of, among other foods, non-[[ruminant]] mammals, [[shellfish]] and [[reptiles]], would have most likely caused Jewish communities to stand out from the surrounding mainstream Chinese population{{Original research inline|date=January 2016}}, as Chinese culture is typically very free in the range of items it deems suitable for food.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Jews have also been called the Blue-Hat [[Hui people|Hui]] ({{zh|c=藍帽回|p=Lánmào Húi}}), in contrast to other populations of Hui people, who have identified with hats of other colors.&lt;ref name="Broomhall1910 2"/&gt; The distinction between Muslim and Jewish Hui is not, and historically has not been, well recognised by the dominant Han population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

A modern translation of the "Kaifeng Steles" has shown the Jews referred to their [[synagogue]] as "The Pure and Truth", which is essentially the same as the term used in modern China to refer to Muslim [[mosque]]s (清真寺). lǐbàisì 礼拜寺 and qīngzhēnsì 清真寺 were used as names of both synagogues and mosques by Jews and Muslims.&lt;ref name="Broomhall1910 3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan &amp; Scott, Limited|pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an oral tradition dictated by [[Xu Xin (Judaic scholar)|Xu Xin]], Director of the Center for Judaic Studies at [[Nanjing University]], in his book ''Legends of the Chinese Jews of Kaifeng'', the Kaifeng Jews called Judaism ''Yīcìlèyè jiào'' (一賜樂業教), lit. the religion of Israel. ''Yīcìlèyè'' is a transliteration and partial translation of "[[Israel]]". Xu Xin translates this phrase as "Chosen people, endowed by God, and contented with their lives and work".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Early record===
[[File:Exterior of Kaifeng synagogue.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Bird's eye view of the [[synagogue]] of Kaifeng.]]
The earliest evidence showing the presence of Jews in China is from the beginning of the 8th century: a business letter written in the [[Judeo-Persian]] language, discovered by [[Marc Aurel Stein]]. The letter (now housed in the British Museum) was found in [[Dandan Oilik|Dandan Uiliq]], an important post along the [[Silk Road]] in northwest China during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907). The text is thirty-seven lines in length and was written on paper, a product then manufactured only in China. It was identified, by [[David Samuel Margoliouth]], as dating from 718 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GAAWkYBNu5sC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=china+jewish+orientalist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SOhKf0ZNkW&amp;sig=FwYyT6ZTZh91PVDbpSJTH-tzNzU&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=sGNoSsPpGt7RjAfEssGmCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9 Xu Xin, ''The Jews of Kaifeng, China.

Sources indicate that Jews in China were often mistaken for [[Islam in China|Muslims]] by other Chinese. The first plausible recorded written Chinese mention of Jews uses the term ''Zhuhu'' (竹忽), or ''Zhuhudu'' (朱乎得) (perhaps from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Yehoud'', or from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Yehudim'', "Jews") found in the ''Annals of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]'' in 1329 and 1354. The text spoke of the reinforcement of a tax levied on "dissenters" and of a government decree that the Jews come en-masse to [[Beijing]], the [[capital city|capital]].

Famous [[Venice|Venetian]] traveler [[Marco Polo]], who visited China, then under the [[Yuan Dynasty]], in the late 13th century, described the prominence of Jewish traders in Beijing. Similar references can be found in the notes of the Franciscan [[John of Montecorvino]], first archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beijing]] in the early 14th century, and the writings of [[Ibn Batuta]], an Arabian envoy to the [[Mongol Empire]] in the middle of the 14th century.

[[Genghis Khan]] called both Jews and Muslims ''[[Hui people|Huihui]]'' when he forbade Jews and Muslims from practicing [[kosher]] and [[halal]] preparation of their food, calling both of them "slaves" and forcing them to eat [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongol food]], and banned them from practicing [[circumcision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=chinggis%20khan%20forbidden%20halal&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=%20halal%20chinggis%20khan%20you%20are%20our%20slaves%20&amp;f=false|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=illustrated|location=|page=228|isbn=0-8122-4237-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say “we do not eat Mongol food”. [Cinggis Qa’an replied:] “By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?” He thereupon made them eat. “If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.” He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: “if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat”. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.

During the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), a Ming emperor conferred seven surnames upon the Jews, by which they are identifiable today: Ai (艾), Shi (石), Gao (高), Gan (甘), Jin (金), Li (李), Zhang (張), and Zhao (趙).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gkGnssTpGu4C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;lpg=PR20&amp;dq=%22zhao+xiangru%22+kaifeng&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bpIhiuP_9g&amp;sig=qijM268bsS9l0WTW7ajWTU_tYC4&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=zbsmSsKSG-TMjAeWj9HaBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PPA177,M1 M.

The first modern [[Western world|Western]] record of Jews residing in China is found in the records of the 17th-century [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] in [[Beijing]]. The prominent Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]], received a visit from a young Jewish Chinese man in 1605. Ricci mentioned this man's name as Ngai, who has since been identified by the French sinologist [[Paul Pelliot]] as a Jew named Ai T'ien, who explained that the community he belonged to was [[monotheistic]], or believing in only one [[God]]. It is recorded that when he saw a [[Christian]] [[Madonna and Child|image of Mary with the child Jesus]], he took it to be a picture of [[Rebekah|Rebecca]] with [[Esau]] or [[Jacob]], figures from [[Hebrew Scripture]]. Ngai (Ai Tian, Ai T'ien) declared that he had come from [[Kaifeng]], and stated that this was the site of a large Jewish population.&lt;ref name=ricci&gt;''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', Book One, Chapter 11. Pages 107-111 in the English translation: Gallagher (1953). "China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953.
The Latin original text, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu] can be found on [[Google Books]]. The corresponding text is on [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA123#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pages 131 and onward] of Book One of the Latin text.&lt;/ref&gt; Ricci sent an ethnic Chinese Jesuit Lay Brother to visit Kaifeng;&lt;ref name=ricci/&gt; later, other Jesuits (mostly European) also visited the city. It was later discovered that the Jewish community had a [[synagogue]] (''Libai si''), which was constructed facing the [[west]], and housed a number of written materials and books.

The Jews who managed the synagogue were called "[[Mullah]]s". Floods and fire repeatedly destroyed the books of the Kaifeng synagogue, they obtained some from Ningxia and Ningbo to replace them, another Hebrew roll of law was bought from a Muslim in Ning-keang-chow in Shen-se (Shanxi), who acquired it from a dying Jew at Canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04kdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mohammedan#v=snippet&amp;q=mohammedan%20roll%20law%20purchase&amp;f=false|title=Chinese and Japanese repository of facts and events in science, history and art, relating to Eastern Asia, Volume 1|author=|editor=|year=1863|publisher=s.n.|edition=|location=|page=48|isbn=|volume=|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese called Muslims, Jews, and Christians in ancient times by the same name, "Hui Hui" (Hwuy-hwuy). Crossworshipers (Christians) were called "Hwuy who abstain from animals without the cloven foot", Muslims were called "Hwuy who abstain from pork", Jews were called "Hwuy who extract the sinews (removes the [[Gid hanasheh|sciatic nerve]])". Hwuy-tsze (Hui zi) or Hwuy-hwuy (Hui Hui) is presently used almost exclusively for Muslims, but Jews were still called Lan Maou Hwuy tsze (Lan mao Hui zi) which means "Blue cap Hui zi". At Kaifeng, Jews were called "Teaou kin keaou "extract sinew religion". Jews and Muslims in China shared the same name for synagogue and mosque, which were both called "Tsing-chin sze" (Qingzhen si) "Temple of Purity and Truth", the name dated to the 13th century. The synagogue and mosques were also known as Le-pae sze (Libai si). A tablet indicated that Judaism was once known as "Yih-tsze-lo-nee-keaou" (israelitish religion) and synagogues known as Yih-tsze lo nee leen (Israelitish Temple), but it faded out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04kdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mohammedan#v=snippet&amp;q=mohammedans%20and%20jews%20fraternal%20link&amp;f=false|title=Chinese and Japanese repository of facts and events in science, history and art, relating to Eastern Asia, Volume 1|author=|editor=|year=1863|publisher=s.n.|edition=|location=|page=18|isbn=|volume=|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
During the [[Taiping rebellion]] of the 1850s, the Jews of [[Kaifeng]] apparently suffered a great deal and were dispersed. Following this dislocation, they returned to Kaifeng, yet continued to be small in number and to face hardships, as is recorded in the early 20th century.

[[Shanghai]]'s first wave of Jews came in the second half of the 19th century, many being Mizrahi Jews from Iraq. The first Jew who arrived there was [[Elias David Sassoon]], who, about the year 1850, opened a branch in connection with his father's Bombay house. Since that period Jews gradually migrated from India to Shanghai, most of them being engaged from Bombay as clerks by the firm of [[David Sassoon &amp; Co]]. The community was composed mainly of "Asian," (Sephardi) German, and Russian Jews, though there were a few of Austrian, French, and Italian origin among them. Jews took a considerable part in developing trade in China, and several served on the municipal councils, among them being [[Silas Aaron Hardoon]], partner in the firm of [[E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co]]., who served on the French and English councils at the same time. During the early days of Jewish settlement in Shanghai Jews were involved in the trade in opium and Bombay cotton yarn.

==Modern times==
[[File:Jewish Middle School sign, Harbin.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque commemorates the former Jewish Middle School in Harbin, now the [[Harbin No. 2 Korean Middle School|No. 2 Korean Middle School]]]]
Contemporaneous sources estimated the Jewish population in China in 1940 — including [[Manchukuo]] — at 36,000 (source: Catholic Encyclopedia).

Jewish life in Shanghai had really taken off with the arrival of the British. [[Mizrahi Jew]]s from the Middle East came as traders via India and Hong Kong and established some of the leading trading companies in the second half of the 19th century. Later, after [[World War I]], many [[Ashkenazi Jews]] came from Europe. [[Rebbe]] Meir Ashkenazi ([[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]]) was the Chief Rabbi of Shanghai (1926–1949).

At the early 20th century many Russian Jews fleeing pogroms in several towns in [[Russian Empire]] decided to move to northeast China for permanent settlement ([[Rabbi]] [[Aharon Moshe Kiselev]] served in [[Harbin]] from 1913 until his death in 1949). After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], many [[White émigré|White Russians]], fled to Harbin (former [[Manchuria]]). These included, among others, Dr. [[Abraham Kaufman]], who played a leading role in the Harbin Jewish community after 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA156,M1 Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

According to estimates, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin and played a key role in the shaping of local politics, economy and international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Fuliang Shan, “‘A Proud and Creative Jewish Community:’ The Harbin Diaspora, Jewish Memory and Sino-Israeli Relations,” American Review of China Studies, Fall 2008, pp.15-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], founder of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], held admiration for the Jewish people and [[Zionism]], and he also saw parallels between the [[persecution of Jews]] and the domination of China by the Western powers. He stated, "Though their country was destroyed, the Jewish nation has existed to this day... [Zionism] is one of the greatest movements of the present time. All lovers of
democracy cannot help but support wholeheartedly and welcome with enthusiasm the movement to restore your wonderful and historic nation, which has contributed so much to the civilization of the world and which rightfully deserve [sic] an honorable place in the family of nations."&lt;ref name="Berton"&gt;Berton, Peter. The Evolution of Sino-Israeli Relations. Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, Vol. IV, No. 3. September 2010, pp. 69-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese occupation of [[Northeast China]] in 1931 and the establishment of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932 had a negative impact on the Harbin Jewish community (13,000 in 1929). Most of those Jews left Harbin for [[Tianjin]], [[Shanghai]], and the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. Until 1939, the Russian Jews were about 5,000 in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dangoor.com/71page18.html Shanghai Jews as seen by Chinese]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{Main article|Shanghai Ghetto}}
Another wave of 18,000 Jews from [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Poland]] immigrated to [[Shanghai]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Return of a Shanghai Jew |author=Adam Minter |date=January 15, 2006 |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln270/Shanghai%20Jew%20returns.htm |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanghai was an open city at the time and it did not have restrictions on immigration, and some Chinese diplomats such as [[Ho Feng Shan]] issued "protective" passports and the Japanese diplomat [[Chiune Sugihara]] issued transit visas with which refugees could go to Shanghai after a short stay in [[Japan]]. In 1943, the occupying Japanese army required these 18,000 Jews, formally known as "stateless refugees," to relocate to an area of {{convert|0.75|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} in Shanghai's Hongkew district (today known as the [[Hongkou District]]) where many lived in group homes called "Heime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200511/11/eng20051111_220515.html  |date=November 11, 2005 |title=Former Jewish refugees revisit Shanghai Ark |work=People's Daily / Xinhua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Jews who entered Shanghai during this period equaled the total number of Jews who fled to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]] combined. Many of the Jews in China later moved to found the modern state of [[Israel]].

Shanghai was an important safe-haven for Jewish refugees during the Holocaust, since it was one of the few places in the world where one didn't need a visa. However, it was not easy to get there. The Japanese, who controlled the city, preferred to look the other way. However,some corrupt officials also exploited the plight of the Jews. By 1941, nearly 20,000 European Jews had found shelter there.

Late in the war, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] representatives pressured the Japanese army to devise a plan to exterminate Shanghai's Jewish population, and this pressure eventually became known to the Jewish community's leadership. However, the Japanese had no intention of further provoking the anger of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after their already notorious invasion of China and their additional invasion of a number of other Asian nations, so they delayed the German request until the War ended. With the intercession of the Amshenower Rebbe and the translation skills of [[Leo Hanin|Leo (Ariyeh) Hanin]], the Japanese ultimately kept the Jews of Shanghai safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Fugu Plan: The Untold Story of the Japanese and the Jews During World War II |first1=Marvin |last1=Tokayer |first2=Mary |last2=Swartz |publisher=Gefen Publishing House Ltd |date=2004-05-31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dCY1mp2R2gC&amp;dq=fugu+plan+hanin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, in the period from 1845 to 1945, more than 40,000 Jews came to China to do business or in search of a safe haven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA156,M1 Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

===Late 20th century===
After [[World War II]] and the establishment of the PRC in 1949, most of these Jews emigrated to [[Israel]] or the [[Western world|West]], although a few remained. Three prominent non-Chinese lived in China from the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] to the contemporary period: [[Sidney Shapiro]], [[Israel Epstein]], and [[Ruth Weiss]], two [[United States|American]] emigres and one Austrian emigre, are of Jewish descent. Another Jewish-American, [[Sidney Rittenberg]] served as interpreter to many top Chinese officials.

Structured Jewish life returned to Beijing in 1979 with the founding of Kehillat Beijing, an egalitarian lay-led community serving ex-patriate Jews from all over the world.

Sara Imas, the Shanghai-born daughter of Shanghai's Jewish Club president, Leiwi Imas, became the first Chinese Jewish immigrant to Israel after the two countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1992. Leiwi Imas, who had to leave Germany for Poland in 1939, arrived in Shanghai the same year. He spent his final years in Shanghai until 1962, prior to the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Although Sara Imas's non-Chinese appearance and family background brought her much trouble during the Cultural Revolution when she was accused of being a foreign capitalist and spy, today Sara Imas has returned to Shanghai, working as the Chinese representative of an Israeli diamond company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-07/27/content_463688.htm A Chinese Jew's tale of adversity and triumph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, the Shanghai municipal government has taken the initiative to preserve historical Western architectures that were constructed during Shanghai's colonial past. Many formerly Jewish-owned hotels and private residence have been included in the preservation project. In 1997, the [[Kadoorie]]-residence-turned Shanghai Children's Palace, had their spacious front garden largely removed in order to make room for the city's overpass system under construction.

===21st century===
21st-century China's friendly embrace of the Jewish people on its soil has been one of affectionate sympathy as the modern Han Chinese have developed a favorable view of Jews, admiring them for their contributions to humanity, their ability to survive, the sharing of Chinese values such as family, frugality, hard work and education, and being products of ancient civilizations have been an impetus towards the long and enduring friendship between the Chinese and Jewish peoples.&lt;ref name="zionistcouncil.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khlystov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walgrove"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt; Shared affinities and similar cultural commonalities has not only been an impetus for the close bonds between China and Israel but has also created a symbol of brotherhood between the two communities in the modern era.&lt;ref name="zionistcouncil.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leichman"/&gt;

According to the 2011 census there are 14,048 people of Hungarian ethnicity living in Croatia (or 0.33% of total population).&lt;ref name=Census/&gt; Around two thirds of them (8,249) live in [[Osijek-Baranja County]] in eastern Croatia, especially in the Croatian part of the [[Baranya (region)|Baranya region]] which borders [[Hungary]] to the north.&lt;ref name="2011census1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/e01_01_04/e01_01_04_RH.html|work=Census 2011|title=Population by ethnicity, by towns and municipalities|publisher=[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]]|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also small Hungarian communities in other parts of the country, including areas in [[Bjelovar-Bilogora County]] in central Croatia where 881 people identify themselves as Hungarian.&lt;ref name="2011census1"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Coa Hungary Country History med (1915).svg|thumb|left|150px|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Hungary and Croatia (1915)]]
Hungary and Croatia have a long history dating back to the dynastic crises that followed the death of king [[Dmitar Zvonimir]] in 1089. His widow [[Helen II of Croatia|Helen II]] supported her brother [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] in his claim for the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|kingdom of Croatia]] amidst the political turmoil. Two years later, Ladislaus managed to seize power and proclaim his sovereignty over the Croatian kingdom,&lt;ref name="Britannica Ladislas I"&gt;Ladislas I. (2009). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved June 21, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/327524/Ladislas-I&lt;/ref&gt; however, he and his armies were still unable to gain full control by the time of his death in 1095. It was his nephew [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman I]] who finally defeated the last native Croatian king [[Peter II of Croatia]] at the [[Battle of Gvozd Mountain]], and was then crowned as King of Croatia in capital city of [[Biograd]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]] in 1102.&lt;ref name="Britannica Coloman"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/126006/Coloman]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Hungarian victory, Croatia and Hungary entered into a [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|personal union]] in which certain terms were agreed on. The most significant were that two would remain under Hungarian rule while some separate Croatian institutions were maintained such as the [[Sabor]] (Croatian parliament), the [[Ban (title)|ban]] (viceroy), and retention of Croatian lands and titles.&lt;ref name="Britannica Croatia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Croatia (History)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143561/Croatia/223953/History|encyclopedia=[[Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union lasted until 1918; in that time, many Hungarian military personnel settled in Croatia during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion]], and the borderlands of Hungary and Croatia proper blurred with the ethnic mix.

*[[Ernestinovo]] (422 or 19.28%)
*[[Tordinci]] (371 or 18.26%)
*[[Petlovac]] (330 or 13.72%)
The largest town with a significant Hungarian population is [[Beli Manastir]], with 801 Hungarians (7.96%). 

In addition, 10,231 people identified [[Hungarian language]] as their [[mother tongue]].&lt;ref name="tongue2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/e01_01_08/e01_01_08_RH.html|title=Population by mother tongue, by towns and municipalities|publisher=Croatian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009}}, Hungarian is officially used in two municipalities and four other settlements in Croatia, according to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravosudje.hr/europska-povelja-o-regionalnim-ili-manjinskim-jezi |language=Croatian |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (Croatia)]] |title=Europska povelja o regionalnim ili manjinskim jezicima |date=2011-04-12 |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227001603/http://www.pravosudje.hr/europska-povelja-o-regionalnim-ili-manjinskim-jezi |archivedate=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The two main Hungarian associations in Croatia are the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians of Croatia]] ({{lang-hu|Horvátországi Magyarok Demokratikus Közössége}} or HMDK) and the Union of Hungarian Associations ({{lang-hu|Magyar Egyesületek Szövetsége}} or MESZ).

Hungarians are officially recognized as an autochthonous national minority, and as such, they elect a special representative to the [[Croatian Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1874 | language = Croatian | publisher = Croatian Parliament | title = Pravo pripadnika nacionalnih manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj na zastupljenost u Hrvatskom saboru | work = Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor | accessdate = 2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007]], MESZ member Deneš Šoja was elected as their representative.&lt;ref name="denes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=2066|title=Deneš Šoja|publisher=Croatian Parliament|language=Croatian|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Since 1999, the Hungarian Cultural Society Népkör have organized the "Hungarian Days" festival in [[Osijek]]. In 2000 various Hungarian cultural groups have organised Hungarian music and singing festivals.

The Educational and Cultural Center of Hungarians in Croatia is located in Osijek. In [[Beli Manastir]], the town's public library hosts the Central Library of Hungarians in Croatia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26894">The '''Hurufiyya movement''' ({{lang-ar|حروفية}} ''hurufiyya'', adjective form ''hurufi'' literal meaning "letters" [of the alphabet]) was an aesthetic movement that emerged in the late twentieth century amongst [[Arabian]] and North African artists, who used their understanding of traditional [[Islamic calligraphy]], within the precepts of [[modern art]]. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a Pan-Arab visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the [[Hurufi]], an approach of [[Sufism]] which emerged in the late 14th–early 15th century. Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab art world in the 20th-century. 

==Definition==
The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe an contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement''&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Letrism movement''&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:] ;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the [[Letterist International]] which had an Algerian section founded in [[Chlef]] in 1953 by [[Hadj Mohamed Dahou]]. 

The term, ''hurufiyya'' has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including [[Wijdan Ali]], Nada Shabout and Karen  Dabrowska. An alternative term, ''al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann'' [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80; Shabout, N., "Huroufiyah" in: ''Routledge Encyclopedia Of Modern Art,'' Routledge, 2016,  DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REM176-1; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history and philosophy==
[[File:Amir Khusraw Dihlavi - An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth,'' page from a Sufi manuscript, 13th century. Sufi art served as part of the inspiration for the al-hurufiyya movement.]]
Traditional hurufi art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined calligraphy to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt; Schimmel,  A., ''Calligraphy and Islamic Culture,'' London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  

The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, [https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006 DOI:]; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School'',&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed a distinctive character in which both African motifs and calligraphy were combined, while media such as leather and wood replaced canvas to provide a distinct African style.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Morocco, the movement was accompanied by the replacement of traditional media for oils; artists favoured traditional dyes such as henna, and embraced weaving, jewellery and tattoo as well as including traditional Berber motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, it was generally known as the ''al-hurufiyyah'' movement, while in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that [[Madiha Omar]], who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars have suggested that she was a ''precursor'' to Hurufiyya&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], [https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]],&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:];Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; who initially explored Coptic manuscripts,  a step that led him to experiment with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that by the early 1950s, a number of artists in different countries were experimenting with works based on calligraphy, including the Iraqi painter and sculptor, [[Jamil Hamoudi]] who experimented with the graphic possibilities of using Arabic characters, as early as 1947;&lt;ref&gt;Inati, S.C., ''Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics,'' Humanity Books, 2003, p.76; Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabé,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian painters, Nasser Assar (b. 1928) ([[:fr:Nasser Assar]]) and [[Hossein Zenderoudi]], who won a prize at the 1958 Paris Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:]; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art:&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
: "They deconstruct writing, exploit the letter and turn it into an indexical sign of calligraphy, tradition and cultural heritage. As the sign is purely aesthetic, and only linguistic in its cultural association, it opens hitherto untravelled avenues for interpretation, and attracts different audiences, yet still maintains a link to the respective artist's own culture... Hurufiyya artists do away with the signifying function of language. The characters become pure signs, and temporarily emptied of their referential meaning, they become available for new meanings."  

The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, [[Mahmoud Taha]], who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship,&lt;ref&gt;Asfour, M., "A Window on Contemporary Arab Art," NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and sculptors, such as the Qatari, [[Yousef Ahmad]]&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Yousef Ahdmad," [Biographical Notes], [http://www.animagallery.com/artists/yousef-ahmad/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi sculptors, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])" which published a manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly. '' Vol. 109, No. 3, 2010, pp 555-576, DOI: 10.1215/00382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. &lt;ref name="Dagher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dagher|first1=Charles|last2=Mahmoud|first2=Samir|title=Arabic Hurufiyya: Art and Identity|date=2016|publisher=Skira Editore|location=Milan|isbn=978-8857231518}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither "a movement nor a school." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of hurufiyya===
[[File:نصب أشعار بغداد.jpg|thumb|''[[Ashaar Baghdad (monument)|Ashaar Baghdad]]'' (Baghdad's poetry) by [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. In this fountain, Arabic words taken from a poem by Mustafa Jamal El Din have been squeezed together to form the oval shape in an example of Asbract calligraphy.]]

Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists: &lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''First generation'': The pioneers, who inspired by the independence of their nations, searched for a new aesthetic language that would allow them to express their nationalism. These artists rejected European techniques and media, turning to indigenous media and introducing Arabic calligraphy into their art. For this group of artists, Arabic letters are a central feature of the artwork. First generation artists include: the Jordanian artist, [[Wijdan Ali|Princess Wijdan Ali]], the Sudanese artist, [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]; the Iraqi artists, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Shakkir Hassan Al Sa'id]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]] and [[Jawad Saleem]]; the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] and the Egyptian artist, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926).  

: ''Second generation'': Artists, most of whom live in exile, but reference their traditions, culture and language in their artworks. The artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is typical of this generation.

: ''Third generation'':  Contemporary artists who have absorbed international aesthetics, and who employ Arabic and Persian script occasionally. They deconstruct the letters, and use them in a purely abstract and decorative manner. The work of [[Golnaz Fathi]] and [[Lalla Essaydi]] is representative of the third generation.

==Types of hurufiyya art==
Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of "explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, pp 79-85&lt;/ref&gt; Ali identifies the following, which she describes as ''schools'' within the ''movement'': &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165; It should be noted that Daghir uses a different classification, not canvassed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Pure calligraphy
: Artworks in which calligraphy forms both the background and the foreground. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
; Neoclassical
: Works that adhere to the rules of 13th-century calligraphy. An example of this is the work of [[Khairat Al-Saleh]] (b. 1940) &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dia-Al-Azzawi-Portrait-Picture.jpg|thumb|Artist, Dia-Al-Azzawi, exhibits the style of the Calligraphy Combinations School of Hurufiyya art]]
; Modern classical
: Works that blend pure calligraphy with other motifs, such as repeating geometric patterns. Ahmad Moustaffa (b. 1943) is representative of this style&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165-66&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Calligraffiti]]  
: Artwork, employing script, but which follows no rules and where artists require no formal training. Calligraffiti artists employ their own ordinary handwriting within a modern composition. Artists may reshape letters, or simply invent new letters that reference traditional Arabic scripts. Artists that belong to this school include: Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]]; Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi artist and intellectual. [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167-69&lt;/ref&gt;
; Freeform calligraphy
: Artworks that balance classical styles with calligraffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
; Abstract calligraphy
: Art that deconstructs letters and includes them as a graphic element in an abstract artwork. In this style of art, letters may be legible, illegible or may use pseudo-script. Rafa al-Naisiri (b. 1940) and [[Mahmoud Hammad]] (1923-1988) are notable examples of this style of artist.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Calligraphy Combinations
: Artworks that use any combination of calligraphy styles, often employing marginal calligraphy or unconscious calligraphy. Artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is a representative of this style.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable exponents==

Iraqi painter, [[Madiha Omar]], is recognised as a pioneer of the hurufiyaa art movement, having exhibited a number of hurufist-inspired works in Georgetown in Washington as early as 1949. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing ''Arabic Calligraphy: An Inspiring Element in Abstract Art'' in 1950.&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandria exhibition celebrates 'Hurufiyya' art movement - Visual Art - Arts &amp; Culture - Ahram Online|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/25/253331/Arts--Culture/Visual-Art/Alexandria-exhibition-celebrates-Hurufiyya-art-mov.aspx|website=english.ahram.org.eg|accessdate=18 February 2018|language=en}}; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamil Hamoudi]] was also a pioneer, active from the 1950s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3050">An '''inforg''' is an informationally embodied organism, entity made up of information, that exists in the [[infosphere]]. These informationally embodied organisms are also called natural agents.

==Description==
Inforgs was used by [[Luciano Floridi]] to describe what makes up an infosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Luciano Floridi | year = 1999 | title = Philosophy and Computing: An introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the  word describes organisms that are made up of information rather than "standalone and unique entities". This description of inforgs allows them to exist in the infosphere as natural agents alongside artificial agents. Inforgs can be part of a hybrid agent that is, for example, a family with digital devices such as digital cameras, cell phones, tablets, and laptops.

Norbert Wiener describes organisms as entities defined by patterns of persisting [[Shannon information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Norbert Wiener| year = 1948 | title = Cybernetics: Or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon information, named after Claude Shannon, places information in the physical realm allowing it to be manipulated by the laws of nature and science. Thus, inforgs are composed of matter, energy, and Shannon information. An experiment that supports inforgs and the component of Shannon information is the use of [[DNA]] as a medium for data storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weintraub|first=Karen|title=The newest data-storage device? DNA|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/23/dna-information-storage/1858801/|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encoding DNA, which is considered to be the building blocks of organisms,  to hold binary information reinforces the idea that living organisms are "persisting patterns of Shannon information encoded within an ever-changing flux of matter-energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Terrel Ward Bynum | year = 2010 | title = The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics | chapter = The historical roots of information and computer ethics | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shannon information that is found within an inforg also contains the identity of said organism. For example, A human being's identity is not matter or energy but rather encoded by patterns of Shannon information within his/her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Terrel Ward Bynum | year = 2010 | title = The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics | chapter = The historical roots of information and computer ethics | page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a person's body may change over time, his/her identity persists through time. The manipulation of Shannon information in an inforg is under what is called the [[metaphysics|metaphysical realm]].

'''James C. Dunham''', was a multiple murderer who, on the night of May 26, 1896, killed his wife, her family, and two of that family's servants in [[Campbell, California]].

Using an axe and two [[revolver]]s, Dunham murdered:

*Hattie Wells Dunham (his wife)
*James Wells (her brother)
*Ada Wells McGlincy (her mother)
*Colonel Richard Parran McGlincy (her stepfather)
*two household servants Minnie Schlesser &amp; Robert Briscoe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12403122/murdered_six_persons/|title=Murdered Six Persons|date=10 June 1896|publisher=The Abbeville Press And Banner|page=7|accessdate=16 July 2017|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunham's motives are unknown.  The sole survivors were Dunham's and Hattie's 3-week-old son and a farmhand, George Schaible, who had hidden in the barn during the massacre.

{{nihongo|'''Kankō Ainu'''|観光アイヌ|extra="tourist Ainu"|lead=yes}} is a term used to describe [[Ainu people|Ainu]] who live or portray a traditional (or romanticised pseudo-traditional) indigenous Japanese [[Ainu people|Ainu]] lifestyle in order to cater to the tourist industry.

'''Kapitan Arab''' or '''Kapten Arab''' (Captain of the Arabs; {{lang-nl|Kapitein der Arabieren}}; {{lang-ar-at|الكابتن العرب|al-Kābitin al-'Arab}}) or ''Head of The Arabs'' ({{lang-nl|Hoofd der Arabieren}}; {{lang-ar-at| القائد العرب |al-Qā'id al-'Arab}}) is a position in the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] appointed with the task of leading the ethnic [[Arab-Indonesians]], who usually lived in concentrated clearly defined-living areas (''[[Kampung#Southeast Asia|Kampung Arab]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/190838082/Hadrami-Arabs-in-Present-Day-Indonesia# |title=Hadrami Arabs in Present-day Indonesia: An Indonesia-oriented Group with an Arab Signature |page=24 |first=Frode F. |last=Jacobsen |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2008 |isbn=978-020388-4614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was to provide liaison  between his community and the government, to provide statistical information to The Dutch East Indies government on issues related to Arabs, to disseminate government regulations and decrees, and to ensure the maintenance of law and order.&lt;ref name="awakening"/&gt;

==History==

In [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]], The Arabs, according to [[L.W.C van den Berg|Van den Berg]], settled in an area called [[Pekojan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVpwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Hadramaut+dan+Para+Kapiten+Arab&amp;dq=Hadramaut+dan+Para+Kapiten+Arab |title=Ensiklopedi Jakarta: culture &amp; heritage |page=68 |volume=1 |publisher=Pemerintah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta, Dinas Kebudayaan dan Permuseuman |year=2005 |isbn=978-97986-82506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vandenberg"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehgeAAAAMAAJ |title=Hadramaut dan koloni Arab di Nusantara |first=Lodewijk Willem Christiaan|last=van den Berg|volume=3|publisher=INIS|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pekojan'' is from Indonesian word ''Pe-Koja-an'', which means ''The Koja'',&lt;ref name="saudagar baghdad"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeIoTLPRNbcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=pekojan#v=onepage&amp;q=pekojan&amp;f=false |title=Saudagar Baghdad Dari Betawi |page=29 |first=Alwi |last=Shahab |publisher=Penerbit Republika|year=2004|language=id|isbn=978-97932-10308|accessdate=Jun 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term for Muslim people of [[Gujarat]], India. While ''Koja'' itself is from word [[Khoja]]. Until the end of the 18th century, the area was mostly dominated by  [[Gujarati Muslims|Khoja Gujarati]] settlers until 19th century.&lt;ref name=elissa&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://staff.ui.ac.id/system/files/users/evawani.ellisa/publication/indiaisvspekojanpaper.pdf|title=Pekojan: Between The Disappearance of Muslim Arabs and The Emergence of Chinese Communities |first=Elissa|last=Evawani|date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Van den Berg did the study (1884-1886), there were no more Gujarati. At that time the majority of the settlers were Arabs and a handful of Chinese. Since about the 1970s, the Arabs are the minority and the Chinese turned into majority.&lt;ref name=elissa/&gt; He described Pekojan as a slum and dirty area. Approximately one and half century ago, the Arabs also had moved and lived in the suburbs (now Central Jakarta), such as [[Krukut]] and [[Tanah Abang]] areas.&lt;ref name="para kapiten arab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alwishahab.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/hadramaut-dan-para-kapiten-arab/|title=Hadramaut dan Para Kapiten Arab|accessdate=Jun 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Dutch East Indies colonial had a constitutional law recognized three categories of individuals in Batavia (and then later applied to other places): Europeans (dutch: ''Europeanen''), Foreign Oriental (''Vreemde Oosterlingen''), and natives (''Inlanders''). As more and more immigrants immigrated from [[Hadramaut]], The Dutch government started a law called ''wijkenstelsel'' in 1844 to segregate them from the rest of indigenous people.&lt;ref name=elissa/&gt;  As result, the government required a head of the group, called ''Kapitan Arab,'' to be pointed from among the Arab community as  a point of contact and liaison. The similar position was appointed for [[Kapitan Cina]] to Chinese.  More than half of the Kapitan Arab appointed by the colonial government were non [[Sayyid]] people.  This decision was made to undermine traditional [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] assumption about their social status.&lt;ref name="awakening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhJWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=Kapitein+der+Arabieren#v=onepage&amp;q=Kapitein%20der%20Arabieren&amp;f=false |page=311 |title=Handleiding bij de beoefening der landkunde en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Oost-Indië |first1=Johannes|last1=Jacobus de Hollander |first2=Rutger |last2=Eck |edition=5th |publisher=Broese |year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head sometimes is accompanied  with an assistant called  ''Luitenant van de Kapitein der Arabieren'' or simply ''Liutenant der Arabieren''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEBmAAAAcAAJ|title=Klapper op de Wetboeken en het Staatsblad van Nederlandsch-Indië, benevens op het Bijblad op dat Staatsblad van 1816 tot 1876|last=Albrecht|first=J.E.|publisher=University of Amsterdam|year=1877|isbn=|location=Netherlands|pages=|language=nl|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Kapitein der Arabieren'' pointed by the Dutch East Indies government in Batavia was [[Said Naum]] during period of 1844-1864.&lt;ref&gt;

Umar Mangus was a rich merchant and had property business.  For his service as the Kapitan Arab, Umar was awarded the title ''De Ridder in de Orde van Oranje-Nassau'' (Knight of The [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]).&lt;ref name="hahdah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kampungarabsurabaya.blog.com/2014/04/08/nahdah-renaissance-kaum-hadhrami/ |title=Nahdah: Renaissance Kaum Hadhrami |accessdate=July 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508003905/http://kampungarabsurabaya.blog.com/2014/04/08/nahdah-renaissance-kaum-hadhrami/ |archivedate=May  8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed on December 28, 1902 with Sheikh Ali bin Abdoellah bin Asir as his ''Liutenant der Arabieren''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mrvisser.nl/nedindie/ambtenaren/1925-ambtenaren-gewestelijk-bestuur-van-batavia.html|title=Nederlands-Indië Archief|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=nl|access-date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Umar Mangus was appointed as a Kapitan Arab, most Arabs had decided to choose Sharif Abdullah ibn Husein Alaydrus, a rich merchant, famous for his generosity and had good behavior as well as prominent among the Arabs and the Europeans. Many people think that with his close relationship with Europeans, he would be willing to accept the Arab captaincy. The colonial government constantly urged him to accept the position, but he firmly rejected it. He wasn't alone in refusing, as this refusal had the support of respected Arab elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benmashoor.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/penghormatan-masyarakat-terhadap-arab-sayyid/|title=Penghormatan Masyarakat Terhadap Arab Sayyid|language=id|accessdate=Jun 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje|Snouck Hurgronje]] who observed in 1901, the Dutch colonial government had more difficulty appoint ''Kapitein der Arabieren'' as more and more indies-born Arabs (''[[Muladi#Etymology|Muwallad]]'') born who lacked authority compared to the ''pure-blood'' Hadramis (''[[Wulayti]]'') whose number diminished.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt;

In [[Cirebon]], there was an [[Arab Indonesians|Arab Indonesian]] appointed as a captain in 1845. As in Batavia, the Arab village here was once the abode of the Gujarati or likely of the Bengali too. In 1872 the colony in Indramayu separated from Cirebon to appoint a captain (or head) of Arabs.  In [[Banjarmasin]] in around 1899, the Kapitan Arab was Said Hasan bin Idroes al-Habshi or more known as ''Habib Ujung Murung''.&lt;ref name="awakening"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Hadrami Awakening: Community and Identity in the Netherlands East Indies, 1900–1942 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c45Xvsq2q4UC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Kapitein+der+Arabieren#v=onepage&amp;q=Kapitein%20der%20Arabieren&amp;f=false |page=25 |first=Natalie |last=Mobini-Kesheh |edition=illustrated |publisher=SEAP Publications |year=1999 |ISBN=978-0877-2772-79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kabarbanjarmasin.com/posting/habib-hasan-ujung-murung-sang-kapten-arab.html|title=Habib Hasan Ujung Murung Sang Kapten Arab|accessdate=Jun 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The successor of Said Hasan as the ''Kapitein'' in [[South Kalimantan]] was Alwi bin Abdullah al-Habshi, who later moved to [[Barabai]].

Similarly, in [[Tegal, Central Java|Tegal]], [[Pekalongan]], [[Semarang]], [[Surabaya]], [[Gresik]], [[Pasuruan]], [[Bangil]], [[Lumajang]], [[Besuki]], [[Banyuwangi]], [[Surakarta]], [[Sumenep]], and various places in the archipelago had their own Kapitan Arab. One of the reasons the colonial government did this was to segregate Arabs from the indigenous people.&lt;ref name="para kapiten arab"/&gt; In Pekalongan, one of the Captains was Hasan Saleh Argubi. In [[Bangil]], the Kapitan Arab were Saleh bin Muhammad bin Said Sabaja (1892), Muhammad bin Saleh Sabaja (1920), and Muhammad bin Salim Nabhan (1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kampungarabsurabaya.blog.com/2014/03/20/bangil-kota-sejarah-yang-dilupakan/ |title=Bangil, Terlupakan Dalam Sejarah |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2014 |website=Kampung Arab Surabaya |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403231505/http://kampungarabsurabaya.blog.com/2014/03/20/bangil-kota-sejarah-yang-dilupakan/ |archivedate=April  3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Banyuwangi, some Kapitan Arab who were in positions, among others, was Datuk Sulaiman Bauzir, Datuk Dahnan, Habib Assegaf, and Ahmad Haddad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebanadziway.blogspot.com/2011/02/asal-usul-desa-lateng-kampung-arab.html |title=Asal-usul Desa Lateng Kampung Arab |language=id |accessdate=Jun 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Pasuruan, the Kapitein  der Arabieren was a Sayyid named Alim al-Qadri, which is the grandfather of [[Hamid Algadri]].

In Gresik, the Kapitan Arab in 1930's was Husein bin Muhammad Shahab while Kapitan Arab of Surabaya was Salim bin Awab bin Sungkar, who had large land ({{convert|86500|m2|acre}}) in the City Center of Surabaya, West Ketabang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://jmb.lipi.go.id/index.php/jmb/article/download/230/210|title=Komunitas Arab: Kontinuitas dan Perubahannya di Kota Surabaya 1900-1942|last=Rabani|first=La Ode|publisher=Jurnal Masyarakat dan Budaya|year=2005|isbn=|volume=7|location=Surabaya|pages=124|language=Id|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to two [[Baha'i]] travelers from Iran and India who visited [[Makasar]] in 1885, the Iranian Baha’i Sulayman Khan Tunukabanı, known as Jamal Effendi, and his Indian-Iraqi friend Sayyid Mustafa Rumı, the Kapitein der Arabieren in Makasar at the time was Said Ali Matard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bahai-library.com/pdf/d/devries_jamal_effendi_rumi.pdf |title=Effendi, Jamal  and Sayyid Mustafa Rumi in Celebes: The Context of Early Baha’i Missionary Activity in Indonesia|first=Jelle|last= de Vries|volume=14|work=Baha’i Studies Review|accessdate=September 14, 2014|year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Palembang]], most of the Kapitein der Arabieren, if not all, lived in 13-Ulu subdistrict ("Seberang Ulu or "upstream bank" of the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi river]]).  There is no known records of who was the first Captain, but the last one was Ahmad Al Munawar (d. 1970), better known as ''Ayip Kecik'' (''Little [[Sayyid]]'') or ''Yipcik''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hot.detik.com/read/2009/09/03/114302/1195668/631/2/kampung-kapten-arab-al-munawar-kampung-tua-di-tepian-2-sungai|

{{History of Burma}}

The '''Ava Kingdom''' ({{lang-my|အင်းဝခေတ်}}, {{IPA-my|ʔɪ́ɴwa̰ kʰɪʔ|pron}}) was the dominant kingdom that ruled [[upper Burma]] ([[Myanmar]]) from 1364 to 1555. Founded in 1364, the kingdom was the successor state to the petty kingdoms of [[Myinsaing Kingdom|Myinsaing]], [[Pinya Kingdom|Pinya]] and [[Sagaing Kingdom|Sagaing]] that had ruled central Burma since the collapse of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] in the late 13th century.

Like the small kingdoms that preceded it, Ava was led by [[Bamar people|Bamarised]] [[Shan people|Shan]] kings who claimed descent from the [[Pagan Kingdom|kings of Pagan]].&lt;ref name=mha-84-103&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 84–103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=app-63-75&gt;Phayre 1883: 63–75&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The kingdom was founded by [[Thado Minbya]] in 1364&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|227}} following the collapse of the Sagaing and Pinya Kingdoms due to raids by the [[Shan States]] to the north. In its first years of existence, Ava, which viewed itself as the rightful successor to the Pagan Kingdom, tried to reassemble the former empire by waging constant wars against the [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] in the south, the Shan States in the north and east, and [[Rakhine State]] in the west.&lt;ref name=mha-84-103/&gt;

While it was able to hold [[Taungoo]] and some peripheral Shan States ([[Kalaymyo]], [[Mohnyin]], [[Mogaung]] and [[Hsipaw]]) within its fold at the peak of its power, Ava failed to reconquer the rest. The [[Forty Years' War]] (1385–1424) with Hanthawaddy left Ava exhausted. From the 1420s to early 1480s, Ava regularly faced rebellions in its vassal regions whenever a new king came to power. In the 1480s and 1490s, the [[Prome Kingdom]] in the south and the Shan states under Ava sway in the north broke away, and Taungoo became as powerful as its nominal overlord Ava. In 1510, Taungoo also broke away.&lt;ref name=mha-84-103/&gt;

Ava was under intensified Shan raids for the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1527, the [[Shan States#Confederation of Shan States|Confederation of Shan States]], led by the state of Mohnyin in alliance with Prome, sacked Ava. The Confederation placed nominal kings on the Ava throne and ruled much of Upper Burma. As Prome was in alliance with the Confederation, only the tiny Taungoo in the southeastern corner, east of the Bago Yoma mountain range remained as the last holdout of independent [[Bamar people]].

The Confederation's failure to snuff out Taungoo proved costly. Surrounded by hostile kingdoms, Taungoo took the initiative to consolidate its position, and defeated a much stronger Hanthawaddy in 1534–1541. When Taungoo turned against Prome, the Shans belatedly sent in their armies. Taungoo took Prome in 1542 and [[Bagan]], just below Ava, in 1544.&lt;ref name=app-100-101&gt;Phayre 1883: 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1555, King [[Bayinnaung]] of Taungoo conquered Ava, ending the city's role as the capital of Upper Burma for nearly two centuries.

The '''Kovsh''' is a traditional [[drinking vessel]] or [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]] from [[Russia]].

*On the corner of '''Calle de La Esperanza''' and '''Calle de La Parra''' sits a house where legends say horrifying satanic rites took place in.

*The '''José Caicedo Rojas House''', also known as The Goblin's Mansion, is haunted by a goblin named Baltazar.

*The '''Jose Raimundo Russi House''' is where Manuelito Ferro was murdered in front of, with Russi being charged for the crime. Some neighbors have said they hear the screams of Ferro and the sound of his stabbings.&lt;ref name="elespectador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stella Monsalve"/&gt;
*The '''Juan Montúfar House''' has been a boarding house since colonial times, and is still run by Montúfar descendants. Students who have lived in the house have felt presences, steps in the middle of the night, and temperatures drastically dropping.&lt;ref name="Stella Monsalve"/&gt;	
*'''Las Aguas Cloister''' is a former convent where people claim to hear noises and see shadows in the south-eastern patio, which the nuns used as a burial place.&lt;ref name="capitalinos"/&gt;
*'''Palomar del Príncipe Park''' is haunted by a blonde blue-eyed boy, who used to feed the doves 300 years ago, and who now appears at dawn. A legend says that those who are cruel to the doves will be tormented by the soul of the boy.&lt;ref name="elespectador"/&gt;
*The '''Rosa Florida House''' is haunted by General Sardá, who was loyal to [[Simón Bolívar]], and who manifests himself with the sound of his boots stepping on the sidewalks.&lt;ref name="elespectador"/&gt;
*The '''Calle 100 Bridge''' that crosses over carrera Séptima, where some local cab drivers avoid to pass. Legend says some of them got scared by the ghost of a nun who was killed near to this spot. &lt;ref name="calle100"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publimetro.co/co/bogota/2016/08/23/historia-fantasma-puente-calle-100.html|editor=Publimetro|author=Pamela Lopez|title=La historia del fantasma del puente de la calle 100|year=2016|accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looting by type==

===In armed conflict===
[[File:Spaanse Furie - De plundering van Mechelen door de hertog van Alba in 1572 (Frans Hogenberg).jpg|thumb|The sacking and looting of [[Mechelen]] by the Spanish troops led by the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], 2 October 1572]]

Looting by a victorious army during war has been common practice throughout recorded history. For foot soldiers, it was viewed as a way to supplement their often meagre income&lt;ref name=hsc&gt;Hsi-sheng Chi, ''Warlord politics in China, 1916–1928'', Stanford University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-8047-0894-0}}, str. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the celebration of victory. On higher levels, the proud exhibition of loot was an integral part of the typical [[Roman triumph]], and [[Genghis Khan]] was not unusual in proclaiming that the greatest happiness was "to vanquish your enemies ... to rob them of their wealth".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hoyle Howorth [https://books.google.com/books?id=e4PErdXlLhwC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century: Part 1 the Mongols Proper and the Kalmyks''], Cosimo Inc. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In warfare in ancient times, the spoils of war included the defeated populations, which were often [[enslavement|enslaved]]. The women and children were often absorbed into the victorious country's population.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Thorton, ''African Background in American Colonization'', in ''The Cambridge economic history of the United States'', Stanley L. Engerman, Robert E. Gallman (ed.), Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-39442-2}}, p. 87. "African states waged war to acquire slaves [...] raids that appear to have been more concerned with obtaining loot (including slaves) than other objectives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Bagot Glubb, ''The Empire of the Arabs'', Hodder and Stoughton, 1963, p.283. "...thousand Christian captives formed part of the loot and were subsequently sold as slaves in the markets of Syria".&lt;/ref&gt; In other pre-modern societies, objects made of precious metals were the preferred target of war looting, largely because of their easy portability. In many cases looting was an opportunity to obtain treasures that otherwise would not have been obtainable. Since the 18th century, [[looted art|works of art]] have increasingly become a popular target. In the 1930s and even more so during [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] engaged in large scale and organized [[Nazi plunder|looting of art and property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. R. Kudelski, ''Tajemnice nazistowskiej grabieży polskich zbiorów sztuki'', Warszawa 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2291481.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nazi loot claim 'compelling' | date=October 2, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looting, combined with poor [[military discipline]], has occasionally been an army's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In other cases, for example the [[Wahhabi sack of Karbala]], loot has financed further victories.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne H.

Local civilians can also take advantage of a breakdown of order to loot public and private property, such as took place at the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in the course of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;STEVEN LEE MYERS, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/middleeast/24museum.html Iraq Museum Reopens Six Years After Looting], New York Times, February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' describes widespread looting by [[Moscow]]'s citizens before [[Napoleon]]'s troops enter the city, and by [[Grande Armée|French troops]] elsewhere.

====Prohibited under international law====
In [[armed conflict]], pillage is prohibited by both [[customary international law]] and by [[treaty]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; The prohibition against pillage was recognized in the [[Lieber Code]], Brussels Declaration (1874), and Oxford Manual.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] ([[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|modified in 1954]]) obliges military forces not only to avoid destruction of enemy property, but to provide protection to it.&lt;ref name=hague&gt;Barbara T. Hoffman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvXTcGC5CwQC&amp;pg=PA57 ''Art and Cultural Heritage: Law, Policy, and Practice''], Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 57. {{ISBN|0-521-85764-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8 of the [[Statute of the International Criminal Court]] provides that in international warfare, the "pillaging a town or place, even when taken by assault," is a [[war crime]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; In the aftermath of [[World War II]], a number of war criminals were prosecuted for pillage. Several people have been prosecuted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] for pillage.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt;

The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] of 1949 explicitly prohibits the looting of civilian property during wartime.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gen&gt;E. Lauterpacht, C. J. Greenwood, Marc Weller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5xVSkGtcT5YC&amp;pg=PA154 ''The Kuwait Crisis: Basic Documents''], Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 154. {{ISBN|0-521-46308-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Theoretically, to prevent such looting, unclaimed property is moved to the custody of the [[Custodian of Enemy Property]], to be handled until being returned to its owner.

===Archaeological removals===
{{further information|Grave robbery}}
The term "looting" is also sometimes used to refer to [[antiquities]] being removed from countries by unauthorized people, either domestic people breaking the law seeking monetary gain, or by foreign nations, which are usually more interested in prestige or previously, "scientific discovery". An example of this might be the removal of the contents of Egyptian tombs which were transported to museums in Europe.&lt;ref name="pyramid"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples include the obelisks of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II]], in the (Oriental Museum, [[University of Durham]], United Kingdom), Pharaoh [[Ptolemy IX]], ([[Philae]] Obelisk, in Wimborne, Dorset, United Kingdom). Whether this constitutes "looting" is a debated point, with other parties pointing out that the Europeans were usually given permission of some sort, and that many of the treasures wouldn't have been discovered at all if the Europeans hadn't funded and organized the expeditions or digs that located them. Many of these antiquities have already been returned to their country of origin voluntarily.

===Looting of industry===
In the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Soviet forces systematically plundered the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of Germany, including the [[Recovered Territories]] which were to be transferred to Poland. They sent valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and whole factories to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321165047/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html |title=MIĘDZY MODERNIZACJĄ A MARNOTRAWSTWEM |archivedate=2005-03-21 |publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]] |language=Polish }} See also [http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm other copy online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426011453/http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm |date=2007-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-Ś"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/4/biuletyn4_51.html|title=ARMIA CZERWONA NA DOLNYM ŚLĄSKU|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321233124/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/4/biuletyn4_51.html|archivedate=2005-03-21|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures against looting following disasters==
[[File:053 French Foreign Legion.JPG|thumb|[[Military of Côte d'Ivoire|FAFN]] soldier caught by French Foreign Legion troops.]]

During a disaster, police and military are sometimes unable to prevent looting when they are overwhelmed by humanitarian or combat concerns, or cannot be summoned due to damaged communications infrastructure. Especially during natural disasters, some people find themselves forced to take what is not theirs in order to survive. How to respond to this, and where the line between unnecessary "looting" and necessary "scavenging" lies, is often a dilemma for governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/136582.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Indonesian food minister tolerates looting | date=July 21, 1998 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, looting may be tolerated or even encouraged by governments for political or other reasons.

On 7 October 1900 he officially reports the condition of the Palace as he first encountered it. One of Du Boulay's main duties was to prevent further looting. An extensive catalogue of items in the palace was formally agreed with Shih Hsu, President of the Board of Ceremonies and Comptroller of the Imperial household when the Palace was handed back on 14 September 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Du Boulay, F.R.H. |first = |year = 2011 |title = Servants of Empire: An Imperial Memoir of a British Family |publisher = I.B Tauris | location = London; New York | url = | isbn = 978-1-84885-571-7| ref = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] engaged in looting, particularly by Nazi military units known as the [[Kunstschutz]] ("Art Protection"). The [[Soviet Army]] also operated [[World War II looting of Poland|official trophy brigades]] to loot  Germany and the Eastern European countries occupied by Germany (such as Poland). In Asia, the [[Empire of Japan]], through the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], also engaged in massive and systematic looting of valuables.

During the looting, many hospitals were stripped of nearly all supplies. However, upon investigation many of the looting claims were in fact exaggerated, most notably the Iraqi National Museum in which many curators had stored important artifacts in the vaults of Iraq's central bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/iraq/update.shtml|title=Penn Museum – University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology|work=upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gillray - Sir Richard Worse-than-sly, exposing his wife's bottom; - o fye!.jpg|thumb|[[James Gillray]] cartoon - "Sir Richard Worse-than-sly, exposing his wife's bottom; - o fye!"]] 
'''Maurice George Bisset''' (1757–1821) is famous for his involvement in the highly scandalous court case in Britain involving [[Seymour Dorothy Fleming]] and [[Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet]]. He had an affair with Seymour Worsley during her marriage to Richard, and they had a child together (Jane Seymour Worsley), whom Richard claimed to be his own to avoid scandal.

== Life ==
Maurice George Bisset was born in 1757 to Rev. Alexander Bisset. He was a captain in the South Hampshire [[Militia (Great Britain)|militia]]. Bisset had been Worsley's close friend and neighbour at [[Knighton Gorges]] on the Isle of Wight. He fathered a child by Seymour in August 1781, and in November 1781 they ran away together so Seymour could escape her failing marriage with Richard. However, they were discovered. In February 1782, Worsley brought a [[criminal conversation]] case for £20,000 (2015: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1782|2015|r=-4}}}}) against Bisset. Seymour was rumoured to have 27 lovers, and turned to case against Richard was it was made obvious he consented and even encouraged the relationship between Bisset and Seymour. This testimony destroyed Worsley's suit and the jury awarded him only one [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] (2015: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.05|1782|2015|r=2}}}}) in damages.

However, Seymour could not get a divorce from Richard, only a separation, meaning she could not remarry until he died. Because of this, Bisset eventually left Seymour, and went on to marry Harriat Mordaunt in 1787. They had at least two children together, including a daughter named Jane Harriot Fenwick. He died in 1821, aged around 64.

====[[Alaouite|Alaouite dynasty]]====
The Alaouite dynasty ({{lang-ar| سلالة العلويين الفيلاليين}}, Sulālat al-ʿAlawiyyīn al-Fīlālīyn) is the current royal family of Morocco. The name comes from ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, whose descendant, [[Sharif ibn Ali]], became prince of [[Tafilalt]] in 1631. His son [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Mulay Al-Rashid]] (1664–1672) is credited with uniting and pacifying the country during a turbulent period of Moroccan history. The Alaouite family claim descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] through his daughter [[Fatimah|Fāṭimah az-Zahrah]] and her husband ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib.

== Traditions ==
{{main article|Arab culture}}

===Morocco===
Moroccan women traditionally wear copious amounts of jewelry on their neck, arms, head and ears. Preferably the jewelry should be made from pure gold as this signifies that the family is economically well-off. The jewelry tends to be decorated with different jewels like [[ruby|rubies]], [[olivine]]s, [[Andalucian]] beads, [[pearls]] and [[diamonds]]. The olivines and the pearls are traditionally used in most Maghrebi jewelry. The olivine represents female beauty, and was historically associated with the pre-Islamic goddesses of the Arabian pantheon. The pearls used in the jewelry represent wealth and fortune.

====Weddings====
Brides in Morocco adorn themselves in extensive amounts of jewelry, the amount of jewelry depends on the economic status of the family. Different regions in Morocco have different types of traditional jewelry. Brides in the region of [[Tanger]]-[[Tetouan]] add pearls to their traditional jewelry, whereas brides in the region of [[Fes]] add pheridot jewels and gold. In the [[Sahara]], gold and coloured beads are added to the outfit. Families that can't afford to buy jewelry rent it for the occasion.

The headdresses used in the ceremony also tend to differ depending on the region. The northern region of Morocco, ([[Tanger]]-[[Tetouan]]), use a striped and glittery fabric to cover the bride's head. A headpiece in either silver or gold (depending on the region) is placed over the fabrics and is sometimes decorated with jewels. In the central region, Fes-Meknes, a decorated dark green and golden fabric is used, over it a golden headpiece is placed, decorated with dark green pheridot jewels and pearls hanging down over the face. In the southern region, Western Sahara, the women wear a headpiece decorated with gold pieces and coloured beads that differ from tribe to tribe. The bride's head is covered with a black fabric.

* [[Azwafit]], a tribe of Bedouin [[Arab]] origin, part of the greater Tekna confederation. Historically the tribe would escort and protect caravans for the payment of a fee known as "Ztata" or "Zfata", whence the name Azwafit. Because they became part of a bigger Berber tribe, the Arab sub-tribes are partially Berberised and speak Berber today. The writer La Chapelle noted that Azwafits counted the following five branches: Ait Ahmed Ou Ali, Ahl Hayin, Mhamd Ait Ait El Khennous, Ait Messaoud Ait Boukko and Ida Ou Louggan.&lt;ref&gt;Azwafit.

'''Population without double counting''' is an English translation of the French phrase ''Population sans doubles comptes''.

In [[France]], for the purposes of the [[census]], the [[INSEE]] has defined several population indicators that allow people who live in more than one place to be counted in each place, to study and keep count of population movement. So each commune in France does not have only one figure for the population, but several; for example students may be counted both where they study and where they live when not studying. A parallel may be drawn to English laws that allow students to register and vote in local elections in more than one place.

== How it is measured ==
The '''population figures of France''' depend on the definition of "French". [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]], the French national statistics bureau has two definitions:
* All of the ''65,585,857'' people (as of 1 January 2013) who reside in France, including 33,817,227 women and 31,768,630 men which is 235,676 more people than January 1, 2012.  This is the definition used most frequently, especially by [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]] for censuses that count all people residing in France, regardless of their nationality.  ''French'' is the demonym of France, that is to say that people who live in France are called French.  The census of people residing in France, regardless of nationality, is provided by [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]] under the vocabulary Total population of France. As of &lt;abbr&gt;1&lt;/abbr&gt; January 2008, the population of France was 63 753 140 inhabitants residing in [[Metropolitan France|Mainland France]], [[Réunion]], [[Mayotte]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[French Guiana]].
* All of the ''63,379,349'' people as of January 1, 2013 of French nationality (i.e French Passport Holders), whether they live in France or abroad.  They are the citizens of the French Republic "without distinction of origin, race, or religion".  The [[Civil Code of France|Civil Code]] defines French nationality , the conditions for obtaining it and the rights and duties inherent to it.  The number of French (in the sense of "persons having French nationality") is estimated on January 1, 2013 to be 65,585,857 inhabitants minus 3,817,562 foreigners, plus 1,611,054 expatriate French nationals which gives the total number of French Nationals to be 63,379,349.

==Statistical view==

The figures given by [[INSEE]] for a particular commune are :
; Population municipale : a count of the people who live in a house, flat etc. in the commune
; Population comptée à part : those living in a collective or temporary manner (prisoners, soldiers, hospital patients, nuns, monks, students)
; Population totale : the sum of ''population municipale'' and ''population comptée à part''
; Doubles comptes : a sub-division of ''population comptée à part'', comprising those who have a second residence in another commune and are already counted in that commune's ''population municipale''
; Population sans doubles comptes : the ''population totale'' minus the ''doubles comptes''&lt;ref name=R2151&gt;{{citation
|url=http://www.easydroit.fr/codes-et-lois/TITRE-V-POPULATION-DE-LA-COMMUNE-R-du-Code-general-des-collectivites-territoriales/S45094/
|chapter=Population de la Commune
|title=Code géneral des collectives territoriales
|accessdate=2009-04-14
|language=French
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''population sans doubles comptes'' is therefore always no smaller than the ''population municipale'' and no larger than the ''population totale''. 

To evaluate the population properly, one should use the ''population sans doubles comptes''.

Since 1999, places with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants have had a census every five years, with one-fifth of the places each year being subject to census.

Since 2004, places with 10,000 inhabitants or more have an annual census of a sample 8% of the population. This is carried out in January and February. A census collector leaves a questionnaire and collects it at a later date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009|reason=how is the sample decided? e.g. at random}} Since this time, ''population municipale'' and ''population sans doubles comptes'' have had the same meaning.

== Legal aspects ==
Census results are official by law.

The '''population totale''' is used when applying rules and regulations to budget and finance, in particular in section R2151-2 of the Code of Territorial Collectives.&lt;ref name=R2151/&gt;
But the '''population municipale''' determines the size of a council and the scrutiny of municipal elections, R2151-3.&lt;ref name=R2151/&gt;

'''Pratibha Mahila Sahakari Bank''' (Pratibha Women Cooperative Bank) was a cooperative bank based in [[Jalgaon]], [[Maharashtra]], India. It was founded in 1973 by [[Pratibha Patil]], who later became [[President of India]], with the objective of empowering women.

Patil was a [[chairperson]] of the bank and also one of its directors, along with many of her relatives.&lt;ref name="kidwai" /&gt; She is one of 34 respondents in an ongoing case before the [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] bench of the [[Bombay High Court]] regarding alleged mismanagement of the bank and misappropriation of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Frontline |title=Rough ride |first=Venkitesh |last=Ramakrishnan |date=13 July 2007 |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2413/stories/20070713005213300.htm |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) revoked the licence of the bank in 2003 after it was found out that the bank had engaged in various irregularities, including illegally waiving interest on loans given to many of Patil's family members.

== Inquiries and closure ==
The bank was declared "weak" by the RBI in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Sarin, Ritu (24 June 2007). [http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/pratibha-bank-waived-loans-for-kin-before-rbi-shut-it-down--------/160431/0 "Pratibha bank waived loans for kin before RBI shut it down"]. ''[[The Indian Express]]''. Retrieved 12 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; An inquiry under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act was ordered in July 2001 and reported that the bank had incurred losses of Rs 1.35 [[crore]]. This led to the resignations of the chairperson and eight directors.{{cn|date=January 2016}} In April 2002, the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] asked the RBI to inquire into allegations of fund irregularities after receiving a number of complaints from the Cooperative Bank Employees Union and small depositors of the bank.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

In February 2003, the RBI revoked the bank's licence due to concerns relating to serious financial irregularities. Among other points, the RBI noted that the bank's loan policy was suspect and that members of Patil's family, including brothers and nephews, had received favourable treatment regarding loans. Allegations listed by the RBI include a faulty loan policy of the bank and loan interest waivers given to Patil's relatives. It said that there was no-one on the board with knowledge of either management generally or banking in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More skeletons in Patil's closet |date=25 June 2007 |url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/politics/pratibha-rbi-268079.html |work=Ibnlive.com |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RBI determined that six of the ten largest loan defaulters were connected to Patil's family,&lt;ref name="ie"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kulkarni |first=Dhaval |date=29 June 2007 |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/203367.html |title='Tai may become President, what about us who have been cheated?' |work=The Indian Express |accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the paid-up [[share capital]] was negative and that its gross [[non-performing asset]]s amounted to Rs 391.20 lakh.&lt;ref name="indiatoday" /&gt;

== Post-closure events ==
Many depositors who had been attracted to the bank because of the involvement of Patil lost much of their savings, although the first Rs 1 [[lakh]] of their funds was protected by [[deposit insurance]]. At the time of Patil's nomination for the office of President of India, some of these people, who had still not received the balance of their deposits, alleged that the bank had become a "family fiefdom". Patil's spokespeople said that she had had no involvement in the granting of loans during her period as chairperson.&lt;ref name="ie" /&gt; They said that she had been chairperson for only slightly over a month and that the RBI report made no mention of her.&lt;ref name="kidwai"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sonia: A Biography |first=Rasheed |last=Kidwai |edition=Revised |publisher=Penguin Books India |year=2011 |page=169 |isbn=978-0-14341-686-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CobDtBQVGgC&amp;lpg=PA169 |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A High Court writ petition, filed by the banks' depositors and former employees in 2007 at the time of Patil's nomination for president, alleged that the bank collected Rs 4,556 from its employees' wages for victims of the [[Kargil War]] but failed to deposit the amount in the national fund. Other claims included that Patil's brother, Dilip, had misused the bank's telephone service and the bank ignored its remit of primarily loaning to women in order to provide loans for Patils's male relatives. Spokespeople from Patil's political party, the [[Indian National Congress]], denied any involvement by her in these matters, saying that the bank operated satisfactorily until 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Hindu |date=3 July 2007 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pil-against-pratibha-candidature/article1865742.ece |title=PIL against Pratibha candidature |accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Ibnlive.com |title=Pratibha's kin default on loans |date=28 June 2007 |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/070627/211/6hgap.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630084606/http://in.news.yahoo.com/070627/211/6hgap.html |archivedate=30 June 2007 |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some local INC members in Jalgaon, however, disagreed with the official line, as did the employees' union. They claimed that Patil had facilitated unsecured loans to her family and arranged waivers of interest despite the poor financial state of the bank after 1995. In total, they said, the familial loans that were defaulted amounted to nearly Rs. 225 lakh.&lt;ref name="indiatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title=Embarrassing Choice |first1=Prerana |last1=Thakurdesai |first2=Priya |last2=Sahgal |date=9 July 2007 |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/patil-the-outstanding-choice-for-presidentship/1/155553.html |work=India Today |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Rajesh Chakrabarti, a faculty member at the [[Indian School of Business]], wrote that the irregularities at Pratibha Mahila Sahakari Bank, along with some other notable problems among [[Urban Co-operative Bank]]s (UCBs), "contributed significantly in eroding the brand value of UCBs" in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rajesh |last=Chakrabarti |work=Forbes India |url=http://forbesindia.com/printcontent/28382 |date=13 September 2011 |title=The Role of Urban Cooperative Banks in Financial Inclusion |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pular''' is a [[Fula language]] spoken primarily by the [[Fula people]] of [[Fouta Djallon]], [[Guinea]]. It is also spoken in parts of [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Senegal]]. There are a small number of speakers in [[Mali]]. Pular is spoken by 2.5 million Guineans, about 28% of the national population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ethnologue.org|title=Ethnologue report for Guinea|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=gn|publisher=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Pular the most widely spoken [[indigenous language]] in the country. Substantial numbers of Pular speakers have migrated to other countries in [[West Africa]], notably [[Senegal]].

Pular is not to be confused with [[Pulaar language|Pulaar]], another Fula language spoken natively in Guinea, Senegal, [[Mauritania]], and western Mali (including the [[Futa Tooro]] region).

Pular is written in the [[Ajami script]] and the [[Latin script]].

==Linguistic features==

{{main|Fula language}}

There are some particularities to this version of Fula, including:
*Use of plural form for politeness (such as in German or French, unlike other varieties of Fula)
*A number of separate verbal roots for politeness (these may exist only in Pular)
*There is no initial [[Consonant mutation#Fula|consonant mutation]] from singular to plural verb forms as is the case in other varieties of Fula (there is in nominal forms, however)
*In addition to the more standard long-form pronouns of Fula there are alternate forms in Pular (= hi(l) + pronoun). The table below summarizes these (question marks where the info is not complete)&lt;!--someone needs to verify this - it is from imperfect memory--&gt;:

{| class="wikitable"

|}

==Writing==

{{main|Fula alphabets}}

Like other varieties of the [[Fula language]], Pular was written before colonization in an Arabic-based orthography called "Ajami." Today, while Ajami remains prevalent in rural areas of Fouta Djallon, but Pular is mainly written in a Latin-based orthography, the so-called UNESCO orthography. Pular Latin orthography is basically the same as that used for Fula languages throughout West Africa.

Up until the mid-1980s, Pular in Guinea was written with the [[Guinean languages alphabet]] that differed from that used in other countries.

'''Raghuvanshi''' (or '''Raghuwanshi''') is an Indian dynasty.  Raghuvanshi is believed to be a lineage of kings tracing its ancestry to [[Surya]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Ancient India: From 7300 BC to 4250 BC By J.P. Mittal page 101 onwards&lt;/ref&gt; Raghuvanshi kings like [[King Mandhata|Mandhata]], [[Harishchandra]], [[Sagara (Vedic king)|Sagara]], [[Bhagiratha]], [[Dilīpa]], [[Raghu]], [[Aja (Hindu mythology)|Aja]], [[Dasaratha]] and [[Rama]].

[[Kalidasa]]'s work, ''Raghuvansh'' narrates the epic of the Raghuvanshi in 19 sargas ([[canto]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Raghuvaṃśa of Kālidāsa - Edited with extracts &amp; notes etc by Narayan Ram Acharya Kavyatirtha, Chaukhambha Publishers, Varanasi, 2nd ed (2002), Appendix 2&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

{{History of Nepal}}
'''Shah dynasty''' ({{lang-ne|[[:ne:शाह वंश|शाह वंश]]}}) was the ruling [[Chaubisi rajya|Chaubise]] [[Thakuri]] dynasty from the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] from 1559 to 1768 and later the unified [[Kingdom of Nepal]] from 1768 to 28 May 2008. Shah dynasty traces their historical ancestor to King of Kaski, [[Kulamandan Khan]], whose grandson [[Dravya Shah]] captured the throne of Gorkha from [[Khadka]] kings with the help of accomplices from six resident clans of Gorkha to become the King of Gorkha.
==Origins==
The Shah descendants claimed to be of [[Rajput]] origin.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl J. Schmidt|title=An Atlas and Survey of South Asian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqdzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|date=20 May 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47681-8|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are ranked as [[Thakuri]]s.&lt;ref name="Vir1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dharam Vir|title=Education and Polity in Nepal: An Asian Experiment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEHODCDK-8kC&amp;pg=PA56|year=1988|publisher=Northern Book Centre|isbn=978-81-85119-39-7|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coronation of Dravya Shah==
[[File:Battle of Ligligkot.jpg|thumb|Battle of Ligligkot, the battle ensured the Dravya Shah as King of Gorkha]]
[[Dravya Shah]] was the youngest son of [[Yasho Brahma Shah]], [[Raja]] (King) of Lamjung and grandson of [[Kulamandan Khan]], [[Raja]] (King) of Kaski.{{sfn|Wright|1877|p=278}} He became the king of [[Gorkha]] with the help of accomplices. He ascended the throne of Gorkha on 1559 A.D. 19th century writer Daniel Wright describes the coronation of Dravya Shah as:
{{Quote|text=On Wednesday the 8th of [[Bhadra (month)|Bhadon]] Badi, [[Saka Era|Saka]] 1481 (A.D. 1559) [[Rohini (nakshatra)|Rohini Nakshatra]] (i.e. the moon in the Rohini mansion) being an auspicious day, Drabya Shah aided by Bhagirath Panth, [[Ganesh Pandey|Ganesa Pande]], Gangaram Rana, Busal Arjyal, Khanal Bohra and Murli Khawas of Gorkha, concealed himself in a hut. Ganesa Pande had collected all the people of who wore the brahmanical thread such as the [[Thapa]]s, Busals, Ranas and Maski Ranas of the Magar tribe, they went by the Dahya Gauda route and the Durbar. Drabya Shah killed the [[Khadka]] [[Raja]]{{refn|group=note|[[Khadka]] [[Raja]] belonged to [[Khas]] tribe.{{sfn|Wright|1877|p=278}}}} his own hand, with a sword, during the battle ensued. At the same auspicious moment Drabya took his seat on the [[throne|gaddi]], amidst the clash music.|source=History of Nepaul{{sfn|Wright|1877|p=278}}}}

Previously, the local Ghale people had chosen their king from the winners of an annual running race. Dravya Shah was not a physically robust man but he tricked his way to the win. He was backed by the Bhattarai, Aryal, Adhikari, Pant and Acharya clans who were [[Brahmin]]. By 1570, when Dravya Shah died, the running race was but a memory among the people. Dravya Shah used the army of the [[Magar people|Magar]] (an ancient tribe of [[Nepal]]) to invade neighboring states and his successors continued this aggression to increase the territory belonging to Gorkha. ''Kaji'' Ganesh Pande was his first minister of Gorkha.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Absolute monarchy (1768–1846) ==
[[File:Prithvi Narayan Shah.jpg|thumb|King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the last king of [[Gorkha Kingdom]] (1743-1768) and the first Shah king of [[Nepal]] (1768-1775)]]
In 1743, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] became the ruler of Gorkha. He declared war with other principalities, defeating them one by one. In September 1768, he established the [[Unification of Nepal|unified kingdom of Gorkha]]. He became the first [[List of monarchs of Nepal|king of large Gorkha Kingdom]]. He, his sons and their successors continued fighting and defeating other kingdoms and enlarging the kingdom of Gorkha. In 1814, the [[Anglo–Nepalese War]] between [[Kingdom of Gorkha|Gorkha]] and the [[East India Company]] began. By 1815, the Shah king had been thoroughly defeated. By 1816, Gorkha had lost one-third of its territory. The Shah kings continued to rule as an absolute monarch until 1946 when the political order changed from [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]].

== Hereditary prime ministers (1846–1951) ==

In 1846, the [[Rana dynasty]] gained power in Nepal. The Ranas became prime ministers and reduced the King's status to a figurehead position. The Ranas ruled Nepal as hereditary prime ministers though in the name of the figurehead king. In 1950, the Shah king [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] was forced into exile in India. He and his family, including the crown prince [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]], were saved. After India became a [[secular state]] in 1950, and the remaining rajas retired, Nepal was the only remaining [[Hinduism|Hindu]] kingdom. In 1951, with the help of India, a popular politician common man [[Matrika Prasad Koirala]] became the prime minister of Nepal. Tribhuvan returned to Kathmandu. The Shah dynasty regained control and the prime minister, [[Mohan Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]], resigned. [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] ruled until 1955 and King [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]] ruled until 1972. Mahendra's son, [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], became king.

== Constitutional monarchy (1990–2008) ==
[[File:Birendra Bir Bikram Shah.jpg|thumb|King [[Birendra Bir Bikram Shah]]; the first constitutional monarch of Nepal]]
In 1990, under King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], Nepal became a [[constitutional monarchy]]. King Birendra believed in cooperation between the absolute power of the monarchy and democratic governance. His brother, [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] and his wife [[Aishwarya of Nepal|Queen Aishwarya]] staunchly opposed this.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Murder of the royal family ===
On 1 June 2001, a number of members of the Shah dynasty were [[Nepalese royal massacre|murdered in the royal palace]]. A High Commission report concluded that the royal family was slaughtered by Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]]. This remains controversial.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Among the dead were the Crown Prince's father, King Birendra and his brother, [[Prince Nirajan of Nepal|Prince Nirajan]]. After the attack, Dipendra was in a coma and was declared king for a short time. He died a few days later. [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev]], Dipendra's uncle, took the throne. In February 2005, he dismissed the parliament in order to govern in his own right.

== Abolition of the Shah monarchy ==
On 24 December 2007, the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly]] met. It was decided by majority vote that the monarchy would be abolished in 2008 after the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|Constituent Assembly election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7158670.stm "Nepalese monarchy to be abolished."] BBC 24 December 2007 Accessed 25 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2008, the Assembly declared Nepal a Federal Democratic Republic and the monarchy was abolished, removing the Shah dynasty from power. Kul Bahadur Gurung said of the 601 member assembly, 560 voted in favour, 4 were against and 37 were absent or abstained.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} After this Assembly agreement involving the [[Nepali Congress]], the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist)]] and the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], Gyanendra stepped down.

Gyanendra vacated his palace in [[Kathmandu]] which later became a museum. Until they could find permanent accommodation, the royal couple were offered residence as commoners at the Nagarjuna Palace, a former royal summer residence. The Nagarjuna palace lies in forested hills about eight kilometres (five miles) northwest of Kathmandu.

'''Siberian Tatars''' ({{Lang-sty| Сыбырлар, сыбыртар}}), the [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia |indigenous]] [[Turkic]] population of the forests and steppes of South [[Siberia]], originate in areas stretching from somewhat east of the [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Yenisei River]] in [[Russia]]. The Siberian Tatars call themselves ''Yerle Qalyq'' ("older inhabitants"), to distinguish themselves from more recent [[Volga Tatars |Volga Tatar]] immigrants to the region.&lt;ref name="Alexandre Bennigsen pages 231"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Alexandre |last1= Bennigsen |first2= S.

The word "Tatar" or "Tadar" is also used as a self-designation by some closely related Siberian ethnic groups, namely the [[Chulyms |Chulym]], [[Shors |Shor]], [[Teleut]] and [[Khakas people]]s.

The [[Russian Census (2002) | 2002 census]] counted 500,000&amp;nbsp;Tatars in Siberia - only 9,611 of them indigenous Siberian Tatars. At least 400,000 are ethnic [[Volga Tatars]], who settled in Siberia during periods of colonisation.&lt;ref name="Siberian Tatars"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The Volga Tatars are an ethnic group indigenous to the [[Volga-Ural region]] of [[European Russia]].

{{As of | 2018}} the Siberian Tatars do not yet have public education available in [[Siberian Tatar language |their own language]]. Lessons in the local schools are taught only in the [[Russian language |Russian]] and [[Volga Tatar language|Volga Tatar]] languages; neither language is indigenous to Siberia - ethnic Russian and Volga Tatar immigrants introduced both over two centuries ago.

Siberian Tatars historically lived in the vast territory stretching from around the [[Yenisei river]] all the way to the area lying somewhat east of the [[Ural mountains]].

According to the ambassadors of the [[Siberian Khanate]] ruler [[Yediger Khan]], who visited Moscow in 1555, the population of "the black people," not counting the aristocracy, was 30,700. In a decree concerning tribute issued by [[Ivan the Terrible]], the population was given as 40,000.

According to the results of the 1897 All-Russia Census, there were 56,957&amp;nbsp;Siberian Tatars in Tobolsk guberniya. This was the last accurate information about this population. In later censuses, [[Tatar]] immigrants from the other regions of Russia were also recorded under the classification of Tatar. The Siberian Tatars tried to avoid the census as much as possible, as they believed that it was an attempt to force them to pay the [[Yasak]] (tribute).&lt;ref name ="Val"&gt;{{cite book |last=Valeev |first=F.T. |title=Siberian Tatars |location=Kazan |year=1993 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siberian Khanate map English revised.svg|thumb|right|The Siberian Khanate (Khanate of Sibir)]]
Their population in the territory of the current [[Tyumen Oblast]] in 1926 was recorded as 70,000; in 1959 as 72,306; in 1970 as 102,859; 136,749 in 1979; 227,423 in 1989; and 242,325 in 2002. According to the results of the 2002 [[Russian Census (2002)|Russian Census]], there were 385,949 [[Tatars]] living in the oblasts discussed above. (Their territory roughly corresponds to the historical territory of the [[Siberian Khanate]]). Of these Tatars only 9,289 identified as Siberian Tatars.

[[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian Census]] recorded a total of 9,611 Siberian Tatars in Russia. Some publications estimated their number in the range of 190,000-210,000.&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;[http://www.nsu.ru/ip/s_tatars.php ''Siberian Tatars''. Historical reference (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Such significant discrepancy is explained by the fact that the immigrants from the other ethnic groups who are also called [[Tatar]] by the Russians were also included in the figure, though most were Volga Tatars.&lt;ref name="Siberian Tatars"/&gt;

== Origin and ethnogenesis ==

The term Siberian Tatar covers three autochthonous groups, all [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s of the [[Hanafi]] madhab, found in southern Siberia. They are remnants of the [[Khanate of Sibir]], which was conquered by [[Russia]] in 1582. Geographically, the Siberian Tatars are divided into three main groups, each speaking their own dialect.&lt;ref name="Alexandre Bennigsen pages 231"/&gt; Although the [[Siberian Tatar language]] has been sometimes considered a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar]], detailed linguistic study demonstrates that Siberian Tatar idioms are quite remote from Volga Tatar by origin. Siberian Tatars' ancestry was partly from [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] peoples, but their main ancestors are [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyedic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|publisher=G.K. Hall|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8161-1808 -3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHIYAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;pgis=1|accessdate=2008-04-22|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ket people|Ket]], and [[Ugric peoples|Ugric]] tribes.

==Siberian Tatar language==

[[Siberian Tatar language]] is, due to the Kipchakization processes during the Middle Ages, many times classified as belonging to the Kypchak–Nogay group of the [[Kypchak languages]].&lt;ref name ="Tum"&gt;Tumasheva D.G.. Dialects of the Siberian Tatar language: experience of the comparative research. Kazan, 1977 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately as many elements that could be classified in the [[:ru:Горно-алтайские языки|Upper Altaian]] language group. 

Beginning in the 12th century, the Siberian Tatar language received some [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] influences. Those Siberian Tatars who are living in ethnically mixed villages where, in the periods after Russian colonization, more numerous Volga Tatars settled, have also been influenced by the Kypchak-Bulgar language.

Siberian Tatar language has different dialects.&lt;ref name ="Tum"/&gt; Since the penetration of [[Islam]] until the 1920s after the Russian Revolution, Siberian Tatars, like all [[Muslim]] nations, were using an alphabet that had been based on [[Arabic script]]. In 1928 they adopted an alphabet based on [[Latin script]], and in 1939 one based on the [[Cyrillic script]]. Until 2014, the written language for Siberian Tatars was Tatar, a version based on the grammar rules of Volga Tatars.
 
In the 21st century, work began on the rationalizing of the Siberian Tatar language. Teams have conducted scientific research in the field of literary language norms of the indigenous population of Siberia. They have published the "Русско-сибирскотатарский словарь = Урысца-сыбырца сүслек" (2010) (''Russian-Siberian Tatar Dictionary''), and "Грамматика современного сибирскотатарского языка" (2014)(''The Grammar of Modern Siberian Tatar Language''). International Organization for Standardization ISO 639-3 PA with its headquarters in Washington, awarded in 2013, the Siberian Tatar language classification code 'sty' in New Language Code Element in ISO 639-3.
The first person who seriously researched Siberian Tatar language was [[Gabdulkhay Akhatov]], a Soviet [[Volga Tatars|Volga Tatar]] linguist and an organizer of science.

== Groups ==

=== Tobol-Irtysh Tatars===

{{Main article|Tobol-Irtysh Tatars}}

The Tobol-Irtysh Tatars group is the most numerous out of all 3 groups of Siberian Tatars. They live in the [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]], [[Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]] and [[Omsk Oblast|Omsk]] Oblasts.

The sub-groups are: [[Zabolotnie (Yaskolbinsk) Tatars|Zabolotnie (Yaskolbinsk)]], [[Tobol (sub-group)|Tobol]], [[Kurdak-Sargat]], [[Tara (sub-group)|Tara]], [[Tyumen-Turin]].

=== Baraba Tatars ===

{{Main article|Baraba Tatars}}

Their self-designation is Baraba, and they are found mainly in the steppe of Baraba, in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]]. Their population is around 8,000.

The sub-groups are: [[Baraba-Turazh]], [[Lyubey-Tunus]], [[Terenin-Choy]].

===Tomsk Tatars===
The Tomsk Tatars are indigenous population of [[Tomsk Oblast|Tomsk]], [[Kemerovo Oblast|Kemerovo]] and to some extent Novosibirsk Oblasts.

The sub-groups are: [[Kalmak (sub-group)|Kalmak]], [[Chats (subgroup)|Chat]], [[Eushta]].

== Siberian Bukharans ==

{{main article|Siberian Bukharans}}

The Bukhalyks, literally "those from the city of [[Bukhara]]" are descendents of 15th- and 16th-century fur merchant colonies from [[Central Asia]]. These settlers have now merged entirely with Siberian Tatars.

'''Social science''' is a category of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]], concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. Social science as a whole has many branches, each of which is considered a social science. The social sciences include, but are not limited to: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original "science of society", established in the 19th century. For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: [[Outline of social science]].

[[Positivism|Positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

==History==
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
The history of the social sciences begins in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] after 1650,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|last=Kuper|first=Adam|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415108294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw a revolution within [[natural philosophy]], changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific". Social sciences came forth from the [[moral philosophy]] of the time and were influenced by the [[Age of Revolution]]s, such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; The ''social sciences'' developed from the [[science]]s ([[experimental science|experimental]] and [[applied science|applied]]), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the [[social improvement]] of a [[community|group of interacting entities]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peck1897"/&gt;

The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the [[Encyclopédie|grand encyclopedia of Diderot]], with articles from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The modern period saw "''social science''" first used as a distinct conceptual field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth |year=1824 |author=[[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775–1833)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science was influenced by [[positivism]],&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation was avoided. [[Auguste Comte]] used the term "''science sociale''" to describe the field, taken from the ideas of [[Charles Fourier]]; Comte also referred to the field as ''social physics''.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Comte, the ''social physics'' field was similar to that of [[natural sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this period, there were five paths of development that sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte on other fields.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; One route that was taken was the rise of [[social research]]. Large [[statistical survey]]s were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by [[Émile Durkheim]], studying "social facts", and [[Vilfredo Pareto]], opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which [[social phenomena]] were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as [[Max Weber]]. The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a [[hard science]]. The last path was the [[correlation]] of knowledge and [[Value (ethics)|social values]]; the [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] sociology of [[Max Weber]] firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.

Around the start of the 20th century, [[Enlightenment philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in [[methodology]]. The [[interdisciplinary]] and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vessuri | first1 = H. | doi = 10.1177/0011392102050001010 | title = Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century | journal = Current Sociology | volume = 50 | pages = 135–150 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of [[medicine]], [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative methods]] are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.

In the contemporary period, [[Karl Popper]] and [[Talcott Parsons]] influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see [[consilience]]. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometime distinct in approach toward, the field.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;

The term "social science" may refer either to the specific ''sciences of society'' established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of "noble science" and [[arts]]. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: [[jurisprudence]] and amendment of the [[law]], [[education]], [[health]], [[economy]] and [[trade]], and [[art]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897" /&gt;

Around the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of [[economics]] in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;

The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the [[academic journal]]s in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology|Outline of anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of man", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences, [[humanities]], and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The ''natural sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], [[Physical Anthropology|physical]] or [[Physical Anthropology|biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (ἄνθρωπος) in [[Ancient Greek]] means "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences."

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist" to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication studies===
{{Main|Communication studies|History of communication studies}}
Communication studies deals with processes of human [[communication]], commonly defined as the sharing of [[symbols]] to create [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face [[conversation]] to mass media outlets such as [[television broadcasting]]. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts. Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities, including "communication", "communication studies", "speech communication", "rhetorical studies", "communication science", "[[media studies]]", "communication arts", "[[mass communication]]", "[[media ecology]]", and "communication and media science".

Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline often overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy, among others. From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). The field applies to outside disciplines as well, including engineering, architecture, mathematics, and information science.

===Economics===
{{Main|Economics|Outline of economics}}
[[Economics]] is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109547?query=Economics&amp;ct= economics – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "economics" is from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶκος}} ''oikos'', "family, household, estate", and νόμος ''nomos'', "custom, law", and hence means "household management" or "management of the state". An [[economist]] is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a [[academic degree|degree]] in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by [[Lionel Robbins]] in 1932, is "the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no [[economic problem]]. Briefer yet is "the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants" and "the study of the financial aspects of human behavior".

Economics has two broad branches: [[microeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and [[macroeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from [[normative economics]], which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve [[Subjectivity|subjective]] value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the [[physiocrats|physiocratic school]]. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as [[public choice theory|politics]], [[law]], [[Experimental economics|psychology]], [[Economic history|history]], [[religion]], marriage and family life, and other social interactions.
This paradigm crucially assumes (1) that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and (2) that "economic value" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions. Rival [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] schools of thought, such as [[institutional economics]], [[green economics]], [[Marxist economics]], and [[economic sociology]], make other grounding assumptions. For example, Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of [[exchange value]], of which human labour is the source.

The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker|Becker, Gary S.]] (1976). ''The Economic Approach to Human Behavior''.

===Education===
{{Main|Education|Outline of education}}
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of world's oldest university, the [[University of Bologna]], in Italy]]
Education [[List of education topics|encompasses]] teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgement and well-developed wisdom. Education has as one of its fundamental aspects the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see [[socialization]]). To educate means 'to draw out', from the [[Latin]] ''educare'', or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents. It is an application of [[pedagogy]], a body of theoretical and applied research relating to teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachersmind.com/education.htm An overview of education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The education of an individual human begins at birth and continues throughout life. (Some believe that education begins even before birth, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.) For some, the struggles and triumphs of daily [[personal life|life]] provide far more instruction than does formal schooling (thus [[Mark Twain]]'s admonition to "never let school interfere with your education"). Family members may have a profound educational effect&amp;nbsp;— often more profound than they realize&amp;nbsp;— though family teaching may function very informally.

===Geography===
{{Main|Geography|Outline of geography}}
[[File:Physical world.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Earth]]
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. This may involve [[cultural geography]], [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[Health geography|health]], [[Military geography|military operations]], and [[Urban geography|cities]]. The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, [[Oceanography|oceans]], water and [[landforms]] are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="What is geography?"/&gt; [[Physical geography]] examines phenomena related to the [[Geodesy|measurement of earth]]. As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is [[environmental geography]]. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt; Other [[Geography#Branches|branches of geography]] include [[social geography]], [[regional geography]], and [[geomatics]].

Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of [[mapmaking]] and finding ways to precisely [[Map projection|project]] the surface of the earth. In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences. [[Historical geography]] is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.

Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to [[Geographic Information Science|GISc]], that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment. The fields of [[urban planning]], [[regional science]], and [[planetology]] are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as [[Geographic Information Systems|GIS]], [[remote sensing]], [[aerial photography]], [[statistics]], and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS).

===History===
{{Main|History|Outline of history}}

History is the continuous, systematic narrative and research into past human events as interpreted through historiographical paradigms or theories.

History has a base in both the social sciences and the humanities. In the United States the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] includes history in its definition of [[humanities]] (as it does for applied linguistics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About NEH |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |url=http://www.neh.gov/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] classifies history as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/researchdoc/summary.html Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States: Continuity and Change]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. The [[Social Science History Association]], formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
{{Main|Law|Outline of law}}
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in London]]
The social science of law, [[jurisprudence]], in common parlance, means a rule that (unlike a rule of [[ethics]]) is capable of enforcement through institutions.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt; However, many laws are based on [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"/&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"/&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"/&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"/&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''lex''.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
{{Main|Linguistics|Outline of linguistics}}
[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], recognized as the father of modern [[linguistics]]]]
Linguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language. The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as [[syntax]] (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), [[semantics]] (the study of meaning), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the study of the structure of words), [[phonetics]] (the study of speech sounds) and [[phonology]] (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like [[evolutionary linguistics]] (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and [[psycholinguistics]] (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions.

The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it—partly owing to the influence of [[Noam Chomsky]]—aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language. However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, [[Creole language|creole]] studies, [[discourse analysis]], social interactional linguistics, and [[sociolinguistics]] explore language in its social context. Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and [[statistics]] in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis. While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like [[acoustic phonetics]] and [[neurolinguistics]], draw on the natural sciences. Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Ferdinand Saussure]] is considered the father of modern linguistics.

===Political science===
{{Main|Political science|Outline of political science|Politics}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]] asserted that man is a political animal in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, Alan (2002). Introduction to Political Thinkers. Boston, Massachusetts: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Political science]] is an academic and research discipline that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of [[political system]]s and political behaviour. Fields and subfields of political science include [[political economy]], [[political philosophy|political theory and philosophy]], [[civics]] and [[comparative politics]], theory of [[direct democracy]], apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, [[international relations]], [[foreign policy]], [[international law]], politics, [[public administration]], administrative behaviour, public law, judicial behaviour, and [[Policy|public policy]]. Political science also studies [[power in international relations]] and the theory of [[great powers]] and [[superpower]]s.

Political science is methodologically diverse, although recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the use of the scientific method,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-1403934222|title = Rational Choice|last1 = Hindmoor|first1 = Andrew|date = 2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the proliferation of formal-deductive model building and quantitative hypothesis testing. Approaches to the discipline include [[rational choice]], classical political philosophy, [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivism]], [[structuralism]], and [[behavioralism|behaviouralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], pluralism, and [[Institutionalism in political parties|institutionalism]]. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents, interviews, and official records, as well as secondary sources such as [[scholarly article]]s are used in building and testing theories. Empirical methods include [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]] [[econometrics|or econometrics]], [[case studies]], experiments, and model building. [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] is credited with coining the phrase "political science" while teaching history at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology|Outline of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] was the founder of [[experimental psychology]].]]
[[Psychology]] is an academic and applied field involving the study of behaviour and mental processes. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental illness]]. The word ''psychology'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ψυχή ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' ("soul", "mind") and ''[[-logy|logy]]'' ("study").

Psychology differs from [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]] in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the [[mental function]] and overt behaviour of individuals, while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation-specific human behaviour. In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields. Psychology differs from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of [[neuropsychology]] combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced.
Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology, which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology. In reality, psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, [[educational psychology]], industrial-organizational psychology, [[mathematical psychology]], neuropsychology, and quantitative analysis of behaviour.

Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block. Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences. For example, biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application (as is clinical [[medicine]]), social and occupational psychology are, generally speaking, purely social sciences, whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely. In British universities, emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and/or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred: B.Psy. indicates a balance between natural and social sciences, B.Sc. indicates a strong (or entire) scientific concentration, whereas a B.A. underlines a majority of social science credits. This is not always necessarily the case however, and in many UK institutions students studying the B.Psy, B.Sc, and B.A. follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance, a heavy science basis, or heavy social science basis to their degree. If they applied to read the B.A. for example, but specialized in heavily science-based modules, then they will still generally be awarded the B.A.

===Sociology===
{{Main|Sociology|Outline of sociology}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|[[Émile Durkheim]] is considered one of the founding fathers of sociology.]]
[[Sociology]] is the systematic study of society, individuals' relationship to their societies, the consequences of difference, and other aspects of human [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 218|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the word comes from the suffix "-logy", which means "study of", derived from [[Ancient Greek]], and the stem "soci-", which is from the [[Latin]] word ''socius'', meaning "companion", or society in general.

[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) coined the term, Sociology, as a way to apply natural science principles and techniques to the social world in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm. He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''The Course in Positive Philosophy'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1844). Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning. Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian [[positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]]; Marxist [[historical materialism]] and [[conflict theory]]; and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] analysis. American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with [[pragmatism]] and [[social psychology]]. In the 1920s, the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed [[symbolic interactionism]]. Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the [[Frankfurt School]] pioneered the idea of [[critical theory]], an interdisciplinary form of [[Marxist sociology]] drawing upon thinkers as diverse as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II, influencing [[literary criticism]] and the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] establishment of [[cultural studies]].

Sociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and a perceived process of enveloping [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-7456-0830-2|0-7456-0830-2]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field generally concerns the [[social rule]]s and processes that bind and separate people not only as [[individual]]s, but as members of [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[Group (sociology)|groups]], [[Community|communities]] and [[social institution|institutions]], and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life. The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short [[Social relation|contacts]] between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of [[globalization|global social processes]]. In the terms of [[Sociology|sociologists]] [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], social scientists seek an understanding of the ''[[Social Construction of Reality]]''. Most sociologists work in one or more [[Subfields of sociology|subfields]]. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, [[social stratification]] studies inequality and class structure; [[demography]] studies changes in a population size or type; [[criminology]] examines criminal behaviour and deviance; and [[political sociology]] studies the interaction between society and state.

Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of enquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt; Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, collect both quantitative and qualitative data, draw upon empirical techniques, and engage [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common modern methods include [[case studies]], [[historiography|historical research]], [[interviewing]], [[participant observation]], [[social network analysis]], [[statistical survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]], and model building, among other approaches. Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for purposes beyond the academy. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy, through subdisciplinary areas such as [[evaluation research]], methodological assessment, and [[public sociology]].

In the early 1970s, women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies, analysis, and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780300064971|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, feminist sociologists challenged the discipline's [[androcentrism]] at the American Sociological Association's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socwomen.org/sws-activism/|title=The Founding of SWS|last=Laube|first=Heather|last2=Hess|first2=Bess B.|date=2001|website=Sociologists for Women in Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society, and, eventually, a new sociology journal, [[Gender &amp; Society]]. Today, the [[sociology of gender]] is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline.

New sociological sub-fields continue to appear&amp;nbsp;— such as [[community studies]], [[computational sociology]], [[environmental sociology]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[actor-network theory]], gender studies, and a growing list, many of which are [[List of academic disciplines|cross-disciplinary]] in nature.

==Methodology==

===Social research===
{{Main|Social research}}
The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while some scholars pinpoint the origin of [[demography]] to 1663 with the publication of [[John Graunt]]'s ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400906 ''The Founder of Statistics''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Social research began most intentionally, however, with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]] in the 19th century.

In contemporary usage, "social research" is a relatively autonomous term, encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods. Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena; from [[census]] survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as [[political science]], [[media studies]], and [[marketing]] and [[market research]].

Social research methods may be divided into two broad schools:
* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims.
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.

Social scientists will commonly combine quantitative and qualitative approaches as part of a multi-strategy design. Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used. It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis, focusing on the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A [[mathematical model]] uses mathematical language to describe a system. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' (also modeling). Eykhoff (1974) defined a ''mathematical model'' as 'a representation of the essential aspects of an existing [[system]] (or a system to be constructed) that presents knowledge of that system in usable form'.&lt;ref&gt;Eykhoff, Pieter ''System Identification: Parameter and State Estimation'', Wiley &amp; Sons, (1974). {{ISBN|0-471-24980-7}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-471-24980-7|0-471-24980-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].

These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. The [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. The concept of an ''integrated whole'' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. A [[dynamical system]] modeled as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[formal system|formalization]] has a fixed "rule" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]]. Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers. The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state. The rule is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]]: for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.

Social sciences are criticized for neglecting the moral element of human behavior. Economists tend to focus on self-interest. Clinical psychologists—on the effects of early socialization. Anthropologists tend to assume moral relativism. Sociologists often blame the System for immoral behavior. Socio-biologists tend to assume limited choice behavior. All this, critics hold, contrasts with the fact that life is a constant wrestle between people's moral commitments and urges that pull them to violate these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Etzioni. 2017. "The Moral Wrestler: Ignored by Maslow." Society, Volume 54, Issue 6, pp 512–519&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Main|Social theory}}
Other social scientists emphasize the subjective nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Critical theory]] is the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across social sciences and humanities disciplines.
* [[Dialectical materialism]] is the philosophy of Karl Marx, which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach.
* [[Feminist theory]] is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical discourse; it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality.
* [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theories]], such as [[Proletarian revolution|revolutionary theory]] and [[Class conflict|class theory]], cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists.
* [[Phronetic social science]] is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power, based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis.
* [[Post-colonialism|Post-colonial theory]] is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism.
* [[Postmodernism]] refers to a point of departure for works of literature, drama, architecture, cinema, and design, as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history, law, culture and religion in the late 20th century.
* [[Rational choice theory]] is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour.
* [[Social constructionism]] considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts.
* [[Structuralism]] is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field (for instance, mythology) as a complex system of interrelated parts.
* [[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological paradigm that addresses what social functions various elements of the social system perform in regard to the entire system.

Other fringe social scientists delve in alternative nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Anti-intellectualism|Intellectual critical-ism]] describes a sentiment of critique towards, or evaluation of, intellectuals and intellectual pursuits.
* [[Antiscience|Scientific criticalism]] is a position critical of science and the scientific method.

== Education and degrees ==
Most universities offer degrees in social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson's (Firm&amp;nbsp;: 2006– ). (2007). Peterson's graduate programs in the humanities, arts, &amp; social sciences, 2007. Lawrenceville, New Jersey: Peterson's.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bachelor of Social Science]] is a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular. It is often more flexible and in-depth than other degrees that include social science subjects.{{efn|A [[Bachelor of Social Science]] degree can be earned at the [[University of Adelaide]], [[University of Waikato]] ([[Hamilton, New Zealand]]), [[University of Sydney]], [[University of New South Wales]], [[University of Hong Kong]], [[University of Manchester]], [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]], [[National University of Malaysia]] and [[University of Queensland]].}}

In the United States, a university may offer a student who studies a social sciences field a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, particularly if the field is within one of the traditional [[liberal arts]] such as history, or a BSc: Bachelor of Science degree such as those given by the London School of Economics, as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of [[science]] (the other being the [[natural sciences]]). In addition, some institutions have degrees for a particular social science, such as the [[Bachelor of Economics]] degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11752">'''Sámi schools''', which were referred to as ''Nomad schools'' or ''Lapp schools'' before 1977, are a type of [[school]] in [[Sweden]] that runs parallel to the standard [[primary education|primary school system]]. Sámi schools are part of the Swedish [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system, and as such are governed by the same curriculum that primary schools are. Sámi schools are state-owned educational institutions that are open to all children whose parents claim to be [[Sámi]]. Each school has its own dormitory that many students live in for large parts of the [[academic year]] due to the long distances in the [[Norrland|north of Sweden]].

Teaching took place in both [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Sámi languages|Sámi]], which was also taught separately. The Sámi schools have a small number of students. The schools are located in [[Karesuando]], [[Lannavaara]], [[Kiruna]], [[Gällivare]] and [[Jokkmokk]] in [[Norrbotten County]] and in [[Tärnaby]] in [[Västerbotten County]]. Grades 1-6 are taught everywhere but Gällivare, where only grades 7-9 are taught. Some municipalities in Lapland do not have their own Sámi school, so they have integrated Sámi teaching at the primary school level and native-language education in Sámi when it can be arranged. The [[Sami Education Board]] ({{lang-sv|Sameskolstyrelsen}}) in Jokkmokk has been responsible for the Sámi schools since 1981. Board members, who are Sámi themselves, are appointed by the [[Sami Parliament of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Authority |url= http://www.sameskolstyrelsen.se/english/the-authority |year= 2009 |work= |publisher= The Sami Education Board |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ordinance on nomad schools was passed in Sweden in 1913. This type of school ran parallel to the primary school form prevalent at the time called ''[[Education in Sweden|folkskola]]''. While the number of days in the academic year was the same as for the ''folkskola'', the academic year itself was adapted to conform to the everyday life that the Sámi led at the time. During the 1940s and 1950s, the school ''[[goahti]]'' that were in use were replaced with a western-style dormitory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Skolkåtornas historia |trans-title=The history of school ''goahti'' |url= http://www.kaitumalven.nu/skolkatorhist.html |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=28 July 2009 | language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the 1950s, nomad schools could either be mobile or be in a fixed location. After that decade, however, the mobile versions were discontinued.

==History==
===Sámi boys sent to Uppsala===
The latter six had been sent to the bailiff in [[Tornio]] to be transported over the water. The other ten were to be accompanied by Hjort himself, but one fell ill and had to be left behind. So there were only nine boys left that Daniel Thordsson Hjort led. When they arrived in [[Gnarp]] in [[Hälsingland]], however, the two oldest boys ran away while a violent storm raged. Hjort had the entire parish out looking for them, but they were not able to find the two boys. The remaining seven boys were delivered to the bailiff in [[Gävle]], where they were given Western-style clothing and shoes before they were finally settled in Uppsala. It would be Christoffer von Warnstedt, governor of [[Uppsala Castle]], who would be ultimately responsible for their upkeep.

No one knows how the seven Sámi boys at Uppsala fared. According to an announcement from 1612, however, it transpired that the students received no compensation for their studies during the three years there were at Uppsala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Om Lappland and lapparne, företrädesvis de svenske. |series=Ethnografiska studier |last=von Düben |first=Gustaf |editor=Jan Garnert |origyear=1873 |year=1977 |pages=426–427|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiklund ABC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiklund |first=K.B. |title=ABC-bok på lapska, med en efterskrift om de svenska lapparnas skolundervisning i äldsta tid |url=http://194.117.188.220/djvu/9210a_bok_249/index.html |year=1922 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529141308/http://194.117.188.220/djvu/9210a_bok_249/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Piteå Lapp school===
In 1617, [[Nicolaus Andreæ]], the vicar in [[Piteå]], offered to found a school for the Sámi. This idea was supported by King [[Gustav II Adolf]]. Andreæ was from a [[Birkarls|birkarl family]] and knew some Sámi. Each year, six boys would be educated at the newly founded Lapp school in the hopes that some of them would eventually become priests and start working with the mission in [[Lappmarken]]. In 1619, Andreæ published a liturgy book and primer in Sámi&lt;!--which Sámi?--&gt;; these were the first books to be published in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Härnösands stifts herdaminne |url= http://www.solace.se/~blasta/herdamin/index.htm |last=Bygdén|first=Leonard|chapter=Piteå landsförsamling  |year=1923–1926|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Andreæ died in 1628, the school only had three students, who stayed on to be taught by his successor, Johannes Hossius. In 1632, they transferred to the newly founded [[Skyttean school]] in Lycksele.&lt;ref name="Wiklund ABC" /&gt;

===The Skyttean school in Lycksele===
After Andreæ's death, no other priest was available who knew Sámi. As the priests lived on the coast and only made the trip up to [[Lappmarken]] a couple of times a year, they had to preach to the masses through an interpreter. 

The dean in [[Umeå]], [[Olaus Petri Niurenius]], saw that this was a problem and discussed the matter with person councillor ({{lang-sv|riksrådet}}) [[Johan Skytte]]. This resulted in a new Lapp school, the [[Skyttean school]], being set up in [[Lycksele]] with Johan Skytte providing backing for it. The school seemed to be open already in February 1632 with two former students from the Lapp school in Piteå having joined its staff as teachers. In April, Niurenius announced that the school had eleven students. One of the main objectives was to supply academically gifted boys for the seminary, so that they could then return to work amongst their own people. In 1633, the post of Sámi catechist was established at the Skyttean school. This resulted in the majority of teaching taking place in Swedish&lt;!--Swedish or Sámi?--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Om Umeå lappmarks svenska kolonisation |trans-title=The Swedish Colonization of Umeå Lappmark |last=Göthe |first=Gustaf |year=1929 |pages=76–79|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyksälie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oscarsson |first=Erik-Oscar |title=Lyksälie |chapter= Skytteanska skolan|trans-chapter=The Skyttean School|series=Acta Bothniensia Occidentalis |year=2006 |publisher=Lycksele kommun and Västerbottens läns hembygdsförbund|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first student from the Skyttean school that was actually ordained as a priest was [[Olaus Stephani Graan]], who became head of his old school in 1657. He wrote two books that would go on to have a major impact on the school’s program: ''Cathechetiska frågor, tryckte 1688 until Lapparnes undervisning'', as well as an updated edition of the ''Manuale Lapponicum'', containing [[Psalms]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] from the [[Old Testament]]&lt;!--, ###Jesu lidande historia--&gt;, a [[Catechism]], a [[psalter]], and a [[lectionary]] – all in Sámi.&lt;ref name="Lyksälie" /&gt;

====Sámi students at Uppsala====
By 1725, a total of 14 students with a Sámi background had enrolled at the [[University of Uppsala]]. The majority of these students came from the Skyttean school in Lycksele, but some of them also had ties leading back to Andreæ in Piteå. The 14 students and the year each one enrolled at the university are as follows:&lt;ref name= "Wiklund ABC" /&gt;

*1633: Andreas Petri Lappo (pastor in Arvidsjaur 1640–1649. After that, he became priest at the mine at [[Nasa Mountain|Nasafjäll]], and then finally in [[Jokkmokk]].)
*1635: Paulus Matthiae Lappo
*1636: Jacobus Matthiae Lappo Gråtreschensis (very likely the brother of Paulus Matthiae Lappo; attended school in Piteå and went on to become the head of the Skyttean school)
*1660: Nicholaus Haquini Vindelius Lapponius
*1662: Hindrichus Svenonius Lyckselius (became the first assistant vicar in [[Sorsele]])
*1662: Nicholaus Olai Vindelius Lappo
*1672: [[Olaus Sirma|Olaus Matthiae Lappo Sirma]] (did not attend the Skyttean school; attended a primary school in Torneå; became a priest in [[Karesuando]])
*1674: Nicolaus Andreae Lundius Lappo (son of Andreas Petri)
*1676: Nicolaus Jonae Spolander Lappo
*1688: Laurentius Rangius Lappo (successor to Henrik Svenonius in Sorsele)
*1706: Sivardus Granbergh
*1710: Kenicius Granlund Lappo
*1720: Zimeon Zachariae Granmark Lappo
*1722: Petrus Thurenius

At the same time, there were Sámi students at other [[higher education|institutes of higher education]] such as [[Gymnasium (school)|Härnösands gymnasium]], which is, for example, where Olaus Stephani Graan studied.

===Additional Lapp schools established===
The royal decree of 1723 "Lappländarnes flitigare undervisning i kristendomen and skolars inrättande där i orten" stated that Lapp schools were to be established at each and every one of the seven main churches in Lappland. This resulted in schools being set up at Jokkmokk and Åsele in 1732, Arjeplog in 1743, Jukkasjärvi in 1744, Föllinge in 1748, Gällivare in 1756 and Enontekiö in 1813. As with the Skyttean school, which still existed, these were small schools that usually had six pupils whom the Crown provided upkeep for. The idea was that after two years in the Lapp school students would be able to start teaching other children back home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Norrländsk uppslagsbok]] |volume= 4 |chapter= Samer (skola och undervisning) |trans-chapter=The Sámi (school and education) |year=1996 |publisher=Norrlands Universitetsförlag |location=Umeå}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new decree changed the character of the Lapp schools. The new schools lacked the academic emphasis that the Skyttean school had had. Instead, these schools were two-year boarding schools at the primary level where schoolchildren were taught reading and Christianity.

These schools existed until 1820. During the last year of their existence, Åsele, Lycksele, Arjeplog, Jokkmokk and Gällivare had a ”full school”, i.e., six students and Jukkasjärvi and Karesuando had ”half” schools with three students each. As the number of pupils in the Lapp schools was so limited, [[catechist]]s were used to supplement their education. Any Sámi whose children were not attending the school, but were otherwise interested, could request a catechist from their [[pastor]]. The catechist taught the family's children at home and could even spend an entire winter with one family.

The Lapp schools in Åsele, Arjeplog, Jukkasjärvi and Karesuando were closed in 1820, replaced by a new, mobile form of teaching. By this point in time, catechists were responsible for teaching the entire curriculum to an entire [[siida]] or some other larger group of Sámi.&lt;ref name="Wiklund ABC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laestadius"&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal för första året av hans tjänstgöring såsom missionär i Lappmarken: förra delen|last=Læstadius  |first=Petrus |origyear= 1831|year=1928 |pages=195–227|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Marshals Service 15 Most Wanted Fugitives''' Program was established in 1983 in an effort to prioritize the investigation and apprehension of high-profile offenders who are considered to be some of the country’s most dangerous [[fugitive]]s. They tend to be career criminals with histories of violence or whose instant offenses pose a significant threat to public safety.

Current and past fugitives in this program include [[murderer]]s, [[sex offender]]s, major [[drug lord]]s, [[organized crime]] figures, and individuals wanted for high-profile [[White-collar crime|financial crimes]]. The list is similar, but not identical, to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list. Like the FBI list, the [[United States Marshals Service|USMS]] list is commonly posted in public places such as [[post office]]s. The motto for U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted Fugitive is "The Hunt is On".

'''Underinsured''' refers to various degrees of being [[insured]] for some real risks and [[uninsured]] for others, at the same time.

==Health care==
[[Johns Hopkins University]] professor [[Vicente Navarro]] stated in 2003, "the problem does not end here, with the [[uninsured]]. An even larger problem is the underinsured" and "The most credible estimate of the number of people in the United States who have died because of lack of medical care was provided by a study carried out by [[Harvard Medical School]] Professors Himmelstein and Woolhandler (''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' 336, no. 11, 1997). They concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care—three times the number of people who died of [[AIDS]]."&lt;ref name="Navarro"&gt;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0903navarro.htm The Inhuman State of U.S. Health Care], ''Monthly Review'', Vicente Navarro, September 2003. Retrieved 2009-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auto insurance==

In the [[auto insurance]] industry, [[underinsured motorist coverage]] is designed to protect motorists in the event that they have an accident with an at-fault underinsured motorist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.azinsuranceteam.com/should-i-invest-in-uninsured-and-underinsured-motorist-coverage-.html "Should I Invest In Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage?"], ''AZ Insurance Team''.

A '''vacancy chain''' is a [[social structure]] through which resources are distributed to [[consumer]]s. In a vacancy chain, a new resource unit that arrives into a population is taken by the first individual in line, who then leaves his/her old unit behind, this old unit is taken by a second individual, leaving his/her old unit behind, and so forth.&lt;ref name="Pinfield"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Pinfield | first = Lawrence | authorlink = | title = The Operation of Internal Labor Markets | publisher = Plenum Press | year = 1995 | location = New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-306-45046-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Vacancy chains are started when an initial vacancy enters a population, such as when a new house is built, a new car is manufactured, or a new job is created. It can also begin when an existing unit is vacated by someone leaving the system under consideration, such as an employee retiring, or a home owner goes to a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name="chase"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chase | first = Ivan D. | authorlink = | title = Vacancy Chains | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 133–154 | publisher = | location = | year = 1991 | url = | doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.001025| id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually a chain will come to an end, usually with a new entrant into the system or when the last unit in a chain is abandoned, merged, or destroyed. This can involve a new employee recruit or a housing unit on the market for the first time, or when a house in the chain is torn down, left empty, or the duties of a vacant job are distributed among other employees. A vacancy chain is simply the sequence of moves that a vacancy makes from initial entry into a system to final termination. The distribution of material resources and social positions through vacancy chain processes requires that the things distributed possess a number of abstract qualities. These qualities include that the resource units in question are reusable, discrete, identifiable, and utilized by one individual or social group at a time.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

Further, in vacancy chain mobility systems, a unit must be vacant before it can be taken by a new occupant; individuals must need or want new and usually bigger or better units from time to time; vacant units must be scarce (the number is small compared to the number of individuals who want them); and most individuals in a group already must have units so they can leave one behind when they move to a new one.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

In order to trace a vacancy chain, a researcher notes a vacancy coming into a system and then follows this vacancy as it moves to a number of resource units in turn and then finally leaves the system. Since vacancy chains in humans often take considerable periods of time, on the order of months, to move from beginning to end and because the chains often involve people widely scattered geographically, researchers usually trace the chains by reconstructing them from organizational records or from series of linked interviews.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

The length of a vacancy chain is the number of moves a vacancy makes after its entrance into a system, and this includes the terminal move to the absorbing state. Longer chains and more costly resource units generate greater benefits,while shorter chains and less costly units generate smaller benefits, for the individuals and institutions involved. Vacancy chains have patterned effects upon other individuals and, in the human case, institutions connected to the primary individuals actually getting resources in the chains.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

==Effects==
Usually when a vacancy occurs the bulk of the people who fill the position(s) come from the inside the internal [[labor market]] rather than hiring someone new. The individuals being moved and or promoted to a new job/position often gain a higher salary of more benefits which has an important impact on the organization.&lt;ref name="Persky"&gt;{{cite paper | first = Felsenstein | last =  Daniel  | author = | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Persky |author3=Virginia Carlson  | title = Job Vacancy Chains in Metropolitan Labor Markets  | version = | publisher = European [[Regional Science Association]] | year = 2002 | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals affected by vacancy chains starting in an organization usually are upwardly mobile in small to moderate jumps in status or laterally mobile within their same status; they rarely experience downward mobility. In systems in which they operate, vacancy chains have a strong influence upon organizational demographics. Such factors as length of service distributions for individuals within the organization, rates of advancement within the system, the age distribution of individuals within particular strata, cohort effects for mobility within the system, and waiting times for advancement. Several researchers  have used vacancy chain studies to investigate equal opportunity of access by different groups to mobility opportunities.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

The number and initial strata of the vacancy chains created influence the career possibilities of the individuals in the internal labor market and those about to enter. The more chains initiated at higher levels, the more mobility opportunities for individuals throughout the system, as the chains move downward, and the greater the speed with which individuals advance to high status or large units and positions. On the other hand, if chains are mostly initiated at lower levels, individuals already in high status positions will see their careers plateau while only those at lower levels will move comparatively quickly before they reach a career bottleneck caused by the lack of opportunities at higher levels.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

==In other species==

Synchronous and asynchronous vacancy chains have been found to occur amongst both terrestrial and marine populations of [[hermit crab]]s.&lt;ref name="Randi"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Randi D. | last = Rotjan | first2 = Jeffrey R. | last2 = Chabot | first3 = Sara M. | last3 = Lewis|date=2010|title=Social context of shell acquisition in Coenobita clypeatus hermit crabs|journal=Behav. Ecol.|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=21 | issue=3|pages=639–646|issn=1465-7279|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/3/639.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crabs live in shells left behind by other species but need to move into a new, larger, shell as they grow. When a vacant shell becomes available, the crabs may slowly form a chain, ranging from the largest to the smallest crab until one arrives that is just the right size for the shell. Once the "[[Goldilocks]]" crab claims the new shell leaving its old shell vacant, the crabs then all rapidly exchange shells, in sequence, until they all have a larger shell, allowing them to grow without restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vacancy-hermit-crab-social-networks/|title=On a Tiny Caribbean Island, Hermit Crabs Form Sophisticated Social Networks|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|date=5 June 2012|work=Scientific American|publisher=Scientific American,|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior makes Hermit crabs an ideal animal model for testing predictions of vacancy chain theory.  Similar shelter-based vacancy chains are likely to take place in many animal groups that use discrete, reusable resources that are limited to occupancy by a single individual or group at a time; some other examples include [[Sea anemone|anemone-dwelling]] [[clownfish]], and [[Bird nest#Cavity|cavity-nesting]] birds.&lt;ref name="Randi"/&gt;

'''Volunteer Management''' is also known as volunteer engagement, volunteer coordination, volunteer administration and refers to “the systematic and logical process of working with and through [[Volunteering|volunteers]] to achieve an organisation’s objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Curley, Lynch and Jackson, The Complete Volunteer Management Handbook 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Volunteer Management became an occupation during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the long-term volunteer was the prevalent type of volunteer, at least in the non-profit organisations. At that time, people volunteered as an alternative to work. When the field’s founders began to try to get volunteer management recognised as a profession, they adopted a lot of standard workplace practices, such as written job descriptions and interviews, to determine the volunteer’s suitability for a role. People who volunteered as an alternative to work found that these practices gave their efforts a bit more status, and they responded positively.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Curley, Lynch and Jackson, The Complete Volunteer Management Handbook 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Models of Volunteer Management have evolved to meet the changing needs of societies around the world as well as to meet modern needs.&lt;ref&gt;Connors, T. (2012). Volunteer Models and Management. In The volunteer management handbook leadership strategies for success (2nd ed., Vol. 1, pp. 2–30). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Volunteer Management is professionalizing. Many localities have professional associations (AVAs) and international certifications are available (ex. http://cvacert.org/).

==Volunteer Manager Roles==

Volunteer managers typically motivate, lead and supervise volunteers at non-profit organisations as well as for governmental organisations and large-scale events like the Olympics. The role of a volunteer manager usually ranges from the operational and administrative tasks such as attendance taking to the policy-making tasks like defining volunteer job roles and recruiting and managing volunteers. Many volunteer managers also take on other roles such as being the [[fundraising|fundraising manager]] for their organisations.

==Online Volunteer Managers==

As the online volunteering modality becomes more popular, managers that collaborate with volunteers remotely via the Internet are on the rise.  They coordinate their volunteer teams via email, instant messages or collaborative software. The United Nations Online Volunteering service &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/blog-posts UNV Online Volunteering service] blog (English version)&lt;/ref&gt; keeps a blog where best practices in online volunteer management are featured.

==Organisational Heritage==
 
Aiding volunteer management, managers have been encouraged to harness the inherent strengths of their organisation. Using an organisation's brand heritage represents one such approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curran|first=Ross|last2=Taheri|first2=Babak|last3=MacIntosh|first3=Robert|last4=O’Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2016-02-23|title=Nonprofit Brand Heritage|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0899764016633532|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1234–1257|doi=10.1177/0899764016633532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand heritage can enhance the engagement and subsequent satisfaction volunteers have with the way in which they are managed. Consequently, managers are called upon to first protect their volunteer organisation's brand heritage, and to utilize it as a volunteer management tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin D|date=April 2017|title=A modern day panopticon: Using power and control theory to manage volunteer tourists in Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221197361730003X|journal=Tourism Management Perspectives|volume=22|pages=34–43|doi=10.1016/j.tmp.2017.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems==

Several experts have various stages and models for a volunteer management system but they tend to have several common features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.nvpc.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/download-manager-files/Chapter0.pdf Doing Good Well]. (2012). Retrieved 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, S., &amp; Kahn, J. (1996). From the top down: The executive role in volunteer program success (Rev. ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Energize.&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer management usually involves planning for the role that volunteers would fill, recruiting and screening the volunteers as well as supervising and motivating the volunteers under their charge. Many volunteer management practices resemble [[human resource management|human resource management practices]], with some [[nonprofits]] and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] including volunteer management under the human resources department.

However, in research conducted at the University of Newcastle, Australia in 2015 which interviewed volunteer managers about their roles identified that there are significant differences between volunteer management and human resource management suggesting this profession requires a different skills set.
