The '''al-Nabi Mosque''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد النبی قزوین}} – ''Masjed al-Nabi'', also known as: {{lang-fa|مسجد سلطانى}} – '''Masjed-e Soltani''') is a famous mosque in [[Qazvīn]]. The mosque has an area of about 14,000 m²,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.mehrnews.com/news/50344/Al-Nabi-Mosque-in-Qazvin|title=Al-Nabi Mosque in Qazvin|date=2012-03-05|work=Mehr News Agency|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bears inscriptions indicating that [[Fath Ali Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]] was the founder of the mosque. Other sources however indicate that the mosque has been in existence since the [[Safavid]] period. It is now believed that the architect of the structure was ''Ustad Mirza Shirazi'' with the date of construction being 1787. This glorious mosque also known as Masjed Nabi, Masjed Soltani or Masjed Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://persiaport.com/en/attractions/al-nabi-mosque-of-qazvin|title=Al-Nabi Mosque of Qazvin|last=PersiaPort|website=PersiaPort|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
Its double layered dome measures 15m in inner-diameter, with the top of the inner layer positioned at 20.83m above ground level, while the external apex is 23.25m high. 

There was formerly an elevated [[minaret]] flanking the dome, of which the French explorer [[Madame Jane Dieulafoy]] had written. The mosque has four [[iwan]]s in its courtyard.

The portal contains an inscription in [[nastaliq]] calligraphy dated 1787 CE. Similar to [[Jame' Atiq Mosque of Qazvin|Qazvin's Masjed e Jame (Congregation Mosque)]], this mosque has a [[shabestan]] that is now used as a library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2961">'''Amphitheatre Auditorium''' or just the '''Auditorium''' was a theatre building in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], United States at the corner of 4th and Hill Streets. Upon its completion in 1889, the large wooden structure boasted the second largest stage in the United States. The New York Opera House was the largest stage at the time.

==History==
The Louisville theater was built with materials from the nearby dismantled remains of the [[Southern Exposition]] building, which was located just a block away. It contained over 2,000 electric lights, could seat 3,072, and had a stage was 90 feet across and 60 feet deep. The theater opened on September 23, 1889.&lt;ref name="theater"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Louisville'' (John E. Kleber) pages 31-32 {{ISBN|0-8131-2100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was operated by [[philanthropist]] William Norton, Jr., who went by the name Daniel Quilp, a villain in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.&lt;ref name="theater"/&gt; He promoted the auditorium with the phrase "Only for great attractions". Norton also used the theatre as a place for the poor to collect handouts once a week. Upon his death he willed that his theatre workers receive three months' salary. He also gave 900,000 dollars of his estate to the Louisville Baptists' Orphans' Home.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

On March 6, 1890, the highly acclaimed opera singer [[Adelina Patti]] gave her first performance of a three-day stop in Louisville during a six-city tour in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''The Atlanta Constitution'' February 7, 1890 page 5 Patti in Louisville&lt;/ref&gt; The theater began having significant success following her performance. The summer season was the most productive.

Many of the day's great actors and political figures performed there, including [[Edwin Booth]], [[Lawrence Barrett]], [[John Philip Sousa]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Booker T. Washington]].&lt;ref name="theater"/&gt; The theater was part of a large entertainment complex that included a bike riding park, a man-made lagoon, a promenade, and a ten-thousand-seat outdoor amphitheatre used for fireworks shows, including ''The Last Days of Pompei'' and ''Americus''.

After Norton's death in 1903, no buyers could be found for the Auditorium or surrounding attractions. The last event, the ''Children's Floral Ball'', was held on April 30, 1904. Later, the site was purchased for $900 and razed on May 5, 1905, only 16 years after its completion.&lt;ref name="theater"/&gt;

'''André Antoine''' (31 January 1858{{snd}}23 October 1943) was a [[French actor]], [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]], [[film director]], author, and critic who is considered the father of modern [[mise en scène]] in France.

==Biography==
'''André Antoine''' was a clerk at the Paris Gas Utility and worked in the Archer Theatre when he asked to produce a dramatization of a novel by [[Émile Zola]]. The amateur group refused it, so he decided to create his own theatre to realize his vision of the proper development of dramatic art.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Image:Theatre Libre plaque Andre Antoine.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Plaque dedicated to the Théâtre Libre, its actor-director André Antoine, and its performers in [[Montmartre]], Paris]]
Antoine founded the [[Théâtre Libre]] in [[Paris]] in 1887. This was a ''théâtre d'essai'', a workshop theatre, where plays were produced whether they would perform at the box office or not. It was also a stage for new writing whose subject matter or form had been rejected in other theatres. Over a seven-year period, until 1894, the Théâtre Libre staged some 111 plays. His work had enormous influence on the French stage,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} as well as on similar companies elsewhere in Europe, such as the [[Independent Theatre Society]] in [[London]] and the Freie Buhne in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitter and Shevtsova (2005, 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:André Antoine-Théâtre Antoine-1903.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Theatrical tour poster, 1903]]
[[Image:Theatre-Antoine.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Le Théâtre Antoine, boulevard de Strasbourg, Paris]]
Antoine opposed the traditional teachings of the [[Paris Conservatory]], and focused on a more naturalistic style of acting and staging. In particular, Théâtre Libre productions were inspired by the [[Meiningen Ensemble]] of Germany. They performed works by Zola, [[Henry Becque|Becque]], [[Brieux]], and plays by contemporary German, Scandinavian, and Russian naturalists.  In 1894, Antoine was forced to relinquish the theater due to financial failure, but he went on to form [[Théâtre Antoine]], which followed the traditions established by Théâtre Libre until its demise 10 years later.

The work of the Theatre Libre was said to embrace both Realism and Naturalism. In theatre, Realism is generally thought to be a 19th-century movement which uses dramatic and stylistic conventions to bring authenticity and 'real life' to performances and drama texts while Naturalism is commonly seen as an extension to this where an attempt is made to create a perfect illusion of reality. Naturalism is often said to be driven by Darwinism and its view of humans as behavioral creatures shaped by heredity and environment. Antoine believed that our environment determines our character and he would often start rehearsals by creating the set, settings or environment which would then allow his actors to explore their characters and their behaviors with greater authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley (1995, 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Often he would only hire untrained actors (a practice still common with young film makers) since he believed that the professional actors of his time could not realistically portray real people.

Antoine's Theatre Libre dedicated itself more specifically to the Quart d'heure or short, simple, free, episodic, one act play performances. he concentrated on script development but advocated naturalistic, behavioral acting dependent on the interaction of actors and helping acting to find their psychological motivations. Discussions on matters of interpretation and setting were a normal part of rehearsals with actors.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley (1995, 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine believed each play had its unique mood or atmosphere and he hardly ever reused sets and settings. He also literally believed in the notion of removing the fourth wall. With some plays he would rehearse in the space with four walls around the action, natural set and actors and then decide which fourth wall to remove and thus deciding which side or perspective to place the audience on. Plays performed at the Théâtre Libre were often "thin on plot, dense in social and psychological implication" (Chothia, Andre Antoine). Productions rejected formal acting styles that were prevalent at the time and they built the "[[fourth wall]]."  Despite being proponents of naturalism, they still adhered to some ideas of "playing for the audience" – there is no evidence{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} that Antoine ever set any chairs facing away from the audience, and the actors still had to make sure that their voices could be heard to the back of the house—so, in a way, their "naturalism" was really just a higher level of illusion than theatre had been up to that point.

In 1894, Antoine gave up the direction of his own theatre, and became connected with the Gymnase, and two years later, with the Odéon theatres.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antoine, André|volume=2|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily indebted, he left the Odéon in 1914 and turned to the [[Film|cinema]]. Meanwhile, he stayed a short period in Istanbul in order to found The Istanbul City Theater. Once World War I started he returned to Paris. Between 1915 and 1922, he directed several films under auspices of the ''Société cinématographique des auteurs et gens de lettres'' ("Film Society of Authors and Men of Letters") of [[Pierre Decourcelle]], adapting literary or dramatic works, such as ''La Terre'' ("Earth"), ''Les Frères corses'' ("The Corsican Brothers") and ''Quatre-vingt-treize'' ("Ninety-three"). He applied the principles of naturalism to film, giving importance to the scenery, natural elements that actually determine the behavior of the protagonists, and by using non-professional actors who were not tied up in the old forms of theater. For Jean Tulard, his literary reputation and is involved in "giving the film its sense of nobility". Influencing film makers like Mercanton, Capellans Hervil and he is "the true father of neorealism".

Antoine concluded his career as a theatre and [[film critic]] beginning in 1919. For twenty years, his commentary was published by ''L'Information'', and more sporadically in ''Le Journal, Comœdia'', and ''Le Monde illustré''. Two volumes of memoirs were published in 1928, and appeared in the journal ''Théâtre'' from 1932 to 1933.

'''Aphrodite''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Alexandra Tydings]] in ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' and ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]''.

==Overview==
[[Aphrodite]] is the [[Goddess]] of [[Romance (love)|Love]] on both ''Xena'' and ''Hercules''. Aphrodite inspires [[love]] and [[lust|passionate desire]] in humankind while her brother [[Ares (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|Ares]], her [[antithesis]], promotes [[war]]fare and conflict. Despite this conflict of values, Ares and Aphrodite are siblings and allies. Aphrodite is portrayed as a modern-day [[Greek Goddess]], with somewhat of a [[dumb blonde]] and usually vain persona. She is essentially good-natured and helpful; she is close friends with Gabrielle because of that. Nearly all of Aphrodite's attire resembles [[lingerie]], and she is nearly always barefoot. She romances [[Hephaestus]], but unlike the myths, their relationship is essentially a happy one.

==Character development==
As in the myth of her birth, Aphrodite first appears [[Aphrodite#Birth.2C rising from the sea|rising out of the sea in a giant seashell]]. As a joke, she then uses the seashell to go [[windsurfing]].

Before her marriage to Hephaestus she is portrayed as being a bit promiscuous; she steals a boyfriend away from Hera and because of that Hera places a curse on her son [[Cupid]].&lt;ref name="greeneyed"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Green-Eyed Monster|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1996-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cupid falls in love with a girl named [[Eros and Psyche|Psyche]], who is said to be more beautiful than Aphrodite, which makes her extremely jealous. Out of jealousy, Aphrodite tries to shoot a love arrow at Psyche, but Cupid tries to stop her.&lt;ref name="greeneyed"/&gt; This only makes things worse when [[Hercules]] is accidentally hit and falls in love with Psyche. Thanks to Hera's curse, Cupid literally turns into a green-eyed monster with jealousy at the thought of losing Psyche. The curse is eventually lifted when the truth comes, after he confesses his love for Psyche and she marries him. Aphrodite gives Psyche [[Ambrosia]] to make her a [[goddess]] to make amends, since she is the one who started the mess. Although she soon realizes she is now a mother-in-law, which does not make her very happy.&lt;ref name="greeneyed"/&gt; She becomes a grandmother later on when Psyche and Cupid have a son, Bliss.&lt;ref name="comedy"&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Comedy of Eros|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1997-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''Hercules'', Aphrodite is usually the comic relief or the viewers' window into the politics of [[Mount Olympus]]. Though she is originally introduced as a scheming goddess, devious and almost as uncaring as Ares, she quickly evolves into a more benevolent fun-loving character, though still prone to mood-swings. She is also the only member of his Olympian family Hercules seems to have any sort of close relationship with (in one episode he refers to her as his favorite little sister, and is somewhat close to her son Cupid who refers to him as "Uncle Herc"), despite the trouble he seems to cause him.

Aphrodite determines to break up a royal family marriage that will end a war, only because the newly allied kingdoms plan to destroy her temples. As her son Cupid explains to Gabrielle, "When the Goddess of Love decides to do something petty and spiteful, she can be a tad difficult to reason with."&lt;ref name="bell tolls"&gt;{{cite episode|title=For Him the Bell Tolls|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1997-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later develops a friendship with Gabrielle and tries to save her during the [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] of the Olympian Gods.

Aphrodite becomes one of the survivors of the Twilight of the Olympian Gods, organized by Xena when the gods, under [[Athena]]'s flag, join together to kill [[Eve (Xena)|Eve]].&lt;ref name="Motherhood"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Motherhood|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aphrodite remains unconvinced that Eve will willingly destroy the gods, to the point where she sneaks Xena and Gabrielle into Olympus itself. After the Twilight of the Gods, Aphrodite becomes mentally unbalanced due to Ares losing his powers; Love must be balanced by War.&lt;ref name="god you know"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The God You Know|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her powers are stolen by [[Caligula]], whom Xena tricks into killing himself.&lt;ref name="god you know"/&gt; This makes matters worse, since love is now gone from the world altogether. Xena restores the powers of both Aphrodite and Ares using [[Golden apple#Norse mythology|golden apples]] she stole from the [[List of Hercules and Xena characters#Norse Gods|Norse Gods]], thereby restoring balance to the universe.&lt;ref name="you are there"&gt;{{cite episode|title=You Are There|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apollo Theatre''' is a [[listed building|Grade II listed]] [[West End theatre]], on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] in the [[City of Westminster]], in central [[London]].&lt;ref name=listing&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=427104 English Heritage listing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022153102/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=427104 |date=22 October 2012 }} accessed 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by the architect [[Lewin Sharp]] for owner [[Henry Lowenfeld]],&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; it became the fourth legitimate theatre to be constructed on the street when it opened its doors on 21 February 1901,&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; with the American [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] ''The Belle of Bohemia''.&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt;

==History==

===Construction===
[[Henry Lowenfeld]] had bought land on the newly created [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] at the turn of the 20th century—next door to the [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric Theatre]], which opened in 1888—and as a consequence the Apollo is one of the few theatres in London to be [[freehold (law)|freehold]].&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt;

The only complete theatre design of architect Lewin Sharp,&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt; the Apollo was specifically designed for [[musical theatre]] and named after the Greek god of the arts and leader of the muses.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; It was constructed by builder Walter Wallis of plain [[London stock brick|London brick]] in keeping with the neighbouring streets; the front piece is in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] with a sculpted stone fascia by T. Simpson. The structure encloses a four-level auditorium, with three cantilevered balconies and a first-floor central loggia, decorated in the [[Louis XIV Style]] by [[Hubert van Hooydonk]]. In keeping with then European style, each level has its own foyer and promenade.&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt;

Owing to the death of [[Queen Victoria]] the previous month, it became the first London theatre to be completed in the [[Edwardian period]].&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; The capacity on the opening night, 21 February 1901,&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10529373/Apollo-Theatre-history.html| title=Apollo Theatre: history| publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]| work=telegraph.co.uk| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 893, with a [[proscenium]] of {{convert|9.14|m}} wide and {{convert|8.89|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=ALloyd&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/ApolloTheatre.htm| title=Apollo Theatre| publisher=Arthur Lloyd| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity today is 775 seats,&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; with the balcony on the 3rd tier considered the steepest in London.&lt;ref name=TITheatre&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thisistheatre.com/londontheatre/apollotheatre.html| title=Apollo Theatre, Shaftsbury Ave, London| publisher=ThisIsTheatre.com| date=22 April 2014| accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stand/&gt;

===Operations===
Owing to a relatively unsuccessful opening, impresario [[Tom B. Davis]] took a lease on the building, and hence management of operations, from 1902.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; The theatre was renovated by [[Ernest Schaufelberg]] in 1932, with a private foyer and [[Antechamber|anteroom]] installed to the Royal Box.&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt; [[Prince Littler]] took control of the theatre in 1944.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt;

[[Stoll Moss Group]] purchased the theatre in 1975,&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; selling it to [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s [[Really Useful Group]] and [[Bridgepoint Capital]] in 2000. [[Nica Burns]] and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the theatre and several others in 2005,&lt;ref name="stand"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/the-history-of-the-london-apollo-9017564.html | title=The history of the London Apollo | publisher=[[London Evening Standard|London Standard]] | work=standard.co.uk | date=20 December 2013 | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating [[Nimax Theatres]], which still owns the theatre.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimaxtheatres.com/apollo-theatre/|title=Apollo Theatre|publisher=[[Nimax Theatres]]|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 ceiling collapse ===
On 19 December 2013, at about 20:15 GMT,&lt;ref name=BBC25458009&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25458009| title=Apollo Theatre balcony collapses| work=[[BBC News]]| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{convert|10|m2}} of the auditorium's ornate plasterwork ceiling collapsed around 40 minutes into a performance of ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (play)|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]''.&lt;ref name=BBC25459567&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25459567| title=Apollo Theatre: Ceiling collapse injures 76 people| work=[[BBC News]]| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sky&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.sky.com/story/1185016/apollo-theatre-collapse-causes-injuries| title=Apollo Theatre Collapse Causes Injuries| publisher=[[Sky News]]| work=news.sky.com| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought down a lighting rig and a section of balcony, thereby trapping two people and injuring around 88, including seven seriously. There were 720 people in the audience at the time. The incident was preceded by heavy rain.&lt;ref name=BBC25458009/&gt;

The [[emergency services]] responded with 25 ambulance crews, an air ambulance rapid response team, 8 fire engines with more than 50 firefighters, and the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref name=BBC25459567/&gt; Casualties were taken to the [[foyer]]s of the adjacent [[Gielgud Theatre|Gielgud]] and [[Queen's Theatre|Queen's]] theatres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/12-2013/roof-collapses-at-west-ends-apollo-theatre-serious_33042.html?cid=homepage_news| title='Roof collapses' at West End's Apollo Theatre, serious injuries reported| publisher=Whats On Stage| work=whatsonstage.com| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the emergency services could [[triage]]. The [[London Ambulance Service]] later stated that they had treated 76 injured people, with 58 taken to four London hospitals, some on commandeered buses.&lt;ref name=BBC25459567/&gt; [[Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust]] said 34 adults and 5 children were subsequently treated in accident and emergency at [[St Thomas' Hospital]].&lt;ref name=BBC25459567/&gt;

The venue reopened on 26 March 2014, with an adaptation of [[Let the Right One In (novel)|''Let the Right One In'']] produced by the [[National Theatre of Scotland]]. The owners were able to reopen the theatre by sealing the fourth level and balcony with a temporary floor, which allowed investigators to continue their work in determining the cause of the collapse.&lt;ref name=reopen&gt;{{cite news| title=Apollo Theatre to reopen after ceiling collapse| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10659795/Apollo-Theatre-to-reopen-after-ceiling-collapse.html| date=25 February 2014| work=The Telegraph| accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
[[Image:Veronique1a.jpg|left|thumb|Souvenir of 300th performance of ''[[Véronique (operetta)|Véronique]]'' at the theatre in 1905]]
The opening caused a public uproar, with a selected audience for the first performance, on Thursday 21 February 1901, and the first public performance scheduled for 22 February.&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' refused to review the private opening, instead waiting until the first public production on the following day.&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; The opening production was the American [[musical comedy]] ''The Belle of Bohemia'',&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt; which survived for 72 performances—17 more than it had accomplished when produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; The production was followed by [[John Martin-Harvey]]'s season, including ''A Cigarette Maker's Romance'' and ''The Only Way'', an adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt;

[[George Edwardes]] produced a series of successful [[Edwardian musical comedies]], including ''Kitty Grey'' (1901), ''Three Little Maids'' and ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1902). An English version of [[André Messager]]'s light opera ''[[Véronique (operetta)|Véronique]]'' became a hit in 1904, starring with [[Ruth Vincent]], who also starred in [[Edward German]]'s ''[[Tom Jones (Edward German)|Tom Jones]]'' in 1907 in which [[Cicely Courtneidge]] made her London debut.&lt;ref name="LondonEncyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Weinreb| editor1-first=Ben| editor2-last=Hibbert| editor2-first=Christopher| title=The London Encyclopaedia| year=1983| publisher=Macmillan| page=22| url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-London-Encyclopaedia-Ben-Weinreb/dp/0333576888#reader_0333576888| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1908 and 1912 the theatre hosted [[H.

After this it staged a variety of works, including seasons of plays by [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]] in 1913, 1914 and 1924, and [[Harold Brighouse]]'s ''[[Hobson's Choice (play)|Hobson's Choice]]'' in 1916.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; ''Inside the Lines'' by [[Earl Derr Biggers]] ran for 421 performances in 1917.&lt;ref name=LondonEncyclopaedia/&gt; Gilbert Dayle's ''What Would a Gentleman Do?'' played in 1918 &lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt; and ''Tilly of Bloomsbury'' by [[Ian Hay]] was the success in 1919.&lt;ref name=LondonEncyclopaedia/&gt;

[[George Grossmith, Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]] managed the theatre from 1920 to 1923, presenting a series of plays and revivals, including ''Such a Nice Young Man'' by [[H.F. Maltby]] (1920) and the stage version of [[George Du Maurier]]'s novel ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' (1922). They had produced ''The Only Girl'' here in 1916 and ''Tilly of Bloomsbury'' in 1919.

Control of the theatre transferred to [[Prince Littler]] in 1944. [[John Clements (actor)|John Clements]] and [[Kay Hammond]] starred that year in a revival of [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Private Lives]]'', and [[Margaret Rutherford]] starred in ''[[The Happiest Days of Your Life]]'' in 1948, followed by [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Lewis Casson]] in ''Treasure Hunt'', directed by [[John Gielgud]] in 1949. After this, ''Seagulls Over Sorrento'' ran for over three years beginning in 1950. The theatre's longest run was the comedy ''[[Boeing-Boeing (play)|Boeing-Boeing]]'', starring [[Patrick Cargill]] and [[David Tomlinson]], which opened in 1962 and transferred to the [[Duchess Theatre]] in 1965. In 1968 Gielgud starred in [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Forty Years On (play)|Forty Years On]]'', and in 1969 he returned in [[David Storey]]'s ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'', with [[Ralph Richardson]].

An '''artist''' is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the [[arts]], or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician|musicians]] and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
# A person who creates art.
# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin "ars" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "[[technician]]", "entertainer" and "[[artisan]]", "[[fine arts|fine art]]" and "[[applied art]]", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History |url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519 |website=www.contempaesthetics.org |accessdate=2015-07-23 |date=21 December 2008 |publisher= |authorlink= |first=David |last=Clowney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting—widening—programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=concept of artist |url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and employment ==
The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] classifies many visual artists as either ''craft artists'' or ''fine artists''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/craft-and-fine-artists.htm|title=Craft and Fine Artists|last=|first=|date=17 December 2015|website=|series=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21|edition=2016–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as [[book illustration]]s or [[medical illustration]]s), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.

The main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts.  Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.

The number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About half of US artists are self-employed.  Others work in a variety of industries.  For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.

In the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as [[graphic designer]]s, [[multimedia artist]]s, [[animator]]s, and [[fashion designers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples of art and artists ==

Please resist the temptation to add your favorite artist or artform to this list. It is intended to illustrate the breadth of the concept, not to list every possible artform and movement. It should contain only the most significant directions and mention one artist who may be considered iconic in this domain. For all practical purposes it appears to be complete.

The '''Austrian Association of Women Artists''' (German: Vereinigung bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs; VBKÖ)&lt;ref name="VBKO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbkoe.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/VBKOE_BESTANDSVERZEICHNIS.pdf|title=VBKO|publisher=VBKO|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1910. The VBKÖ is located at Maysedergasse 2/4, [[Vienna]] 1010, its founding headquarters.  The association supports improvements to the economic and educational conditions of female artists, as well as promoting the artists themselves.

&lt;!-- ACTUALLY, THIS ENTIRE SECTION SEEMS TO BE A LATER ADDITION AND IS FULL OF MEANINGLESS JARGON, BEGINNING WITH THE HEADING ==Complexities and contradictions==
Organizations like this demonstrate the complexities and contradictions of contemporary [[feminist history|feminist]]-writing. It showcases the attachment of an artistic woman's movement and the history of collaboration with the Nazi regime.

(THIS PART SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN WITH HEAVY AFFECTION OR BIAS. PLEASE CHECK AND DECIDE WHETHER TO KEEP IT. 
This is where the emancipatory history of an artistic women’s movement, dating back to the days of imperialism and which still has yet to be inscribed into official art history, meets the history of the collaboration with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime. Through knowledge of the gaps – resulting from historical and internal fractures in the association’s own history – history-writing and research, in regard to National Socialism and the association’s class-specific and colonial entanglements, are more easily forgotten.)

One challenge that the VBKÖ faces is to continue building structures and initiating processes for continual analysis of historical narratives anew, keeping processes of reflection active and making that knowledge public and discursive. Today, the VBKÖ exists as a space for fostering contemporary feminist artistic agendas, offering a space for experiments and promoting political and activist work, in order to establish a new and vital connection between historical debates and contemporary ['''queer(soft)'''], feminist art production. 
--&gt;

==Historical Beginnings==

Founded in 1910, VBKÖ's first president was Baronin Olga Brand-Krieghammer who oversaw the association's first six years. Broadly, the mission of VBKÖ was to make more female artists visible, though in order to achieve this, other economic, educational and health concerns required betterment as well. A program of exhibitions began from VBKÖ's inception, and these shows laid the foundations for future feminist discourse.

:“As far as mode as well as completeness are concerned, a similar [[exhibition]] to this one had so far not been organized on the continent. The fundamental idea of this exhibition is: to give the public an overview about what women have been and are able to create in the [[fine arts]], and to give new motivations to the artists”.
:&lt;small&gt;(Introduction to the first catalogue of the first exhibition of the VBKÖ: “The Art of the Woman”, held from November until December 1910, Print 1, Archive of the VBKÖ.). 
&lt;/small&gt;

[[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Tina Blau]], [[Marie Egner]], [[Helene Funke]] and [[Olga Wisinger-Florian]] were all connected to the VBKÖ, some as active members, while others were invited to exhibit. VBKÖ rented its own studio and exhibition space, allowing artists to work outside of the established art world. The VBKÖ is one of many Euro-American organizations that support women [[artist]]s and other examples include the [[Society of Women Artists|Society of Female Artists]] London, founded in 1855; the Vereinigung der Berliner Künstlerinnen und Kunstfreunde, Berlin founded in 1867; the Société de l’Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs (Society of the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors), Paris, founded in 1881; and the [[National Association of Women Artists]], United States, founded in 1889.

== take! make! activate! VBKÖ-Archiv ==

The take! make! activate! VBKÖ-Archiv contains significant material, files, and collections from 1910 to 2005. The archive, developed by the women artists, has grown since its creation. The inventory list of the archive (compiled by Sabine Harik, Ph.D.) was released in 2006, expanded by the ''Findbuch zur Vereinigung bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs'' (Ed.: VBKÖ, Rudolfine Lackner) as well as the [http://www.vbkoe.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/VBKOE_BESTANDSVERZEICHNIS.pdf DOWNLOAD], for the purpose of independent preparatory research. The archive is accessible by appointment.{{clarify|date=July 2014}}

The '''Baum School of Art''' is a non-profit community art school located in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]].

In 2016–2017, the school had a total enrollment of 3,346 students, 1,921 of which were children and teens, and 1,425 of which were adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  | first =  | title = The Baum School of Art, 2007–2008 Annual Report | publisher = The Baum School of Art | year = 2008}} Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; 178 classes were offered for children and teens,&lt;ref&gt;''2007–2008 Annual Report'', Page 4&lt;/ref&gt; and 168 for adult students.&lt;ref&gt;''2007–2008 Annual Report'', Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was established in the summer of 1926, when artist [[Walter Emerson Baum]] was recruited by Blanche Lucas to provide art instruction to art teachers of the [[Allentown School District]].  Feedback was so positive that Baum was asked to return again and again.  The classes became known as "The Baum School."

==Circulating Picture Club==
Originally established in 1933 by Walter Emerson Baum, the Circulating Picture Club provides paintings for subscribers including banks, professional and business offices, government offices, and educational institutions.  The Circulating Picture Club has over 586 pictures in circulation by artists including Walter Emerson Baum, [[John E. Berninger]], Mel Stark, Ann Yost Whitesell and others.&lt;ref&gt;''2007–2008 Annual Report'', Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">The '''Belizean Writers and Poets Society''' is a literary organization established in 2005 to promote [[Belize]]an writing and poetry.

==Formation==
The organization was registered in August 2005 as the '''Belizean Poets Society''' and formally launched by six individuals in [[Belize City]] on September 8, 2005.

The founding members were [[Adele Ramos]] of ''[[Amandala]]'', Ansel West, Margaret Arana, Police Supt. [[Edward Broaster]], [[Erwin X (Jones)]] and Orson Elrington.

Its stated mission was "to enhance and harness poetic skills among Belizean poets, foster the development of the art of poetry, and promote its appreciation among Belizeans."

== Reorganization ==
The Poets Society in 2008 reorganized itself to include writers of all persuasions, and is now the Belizean Writers and Poets Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poets Society expands to include writers|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/5349|accessdate=27 June 2014|work=News 5|publisher=Great Belize Productions Ltd.|location=Belize|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Society holds an annual Poets Competition coinciding with Belize's [[September Celebrations]], as well as smaller gatherings and exhibitions.

Society members such as Ramos, Erwin, [[Kalilah Enriquez]] and Edward Broaster are all published authors of poetry and other media and are routinely called on to present works at important ceremonies.

'''Bess Meredyth''' (February 12, 1890 – July 13, 1969) was a screenwriter and [[silent film]] actress. The wife of film director [[Michael Curtiz]], Meredyth wrote ''[[The Affairs of Cellini]]'' (1934) and adapted ''[[The Unsuspected]]'' (1947). She was one of the 36 founders of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].

==Early life==
Meredyth began her involvement in performing and writing from an early age. Her father was the manager at a local theatre, and she studied piano throughout her childhood. After encouragement from her English teacher, Meredyth also pursued fiction writing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Without Lying Down|last=Beauchamp|first=Cari|publisher=Scribner|year=1997|isbn=0684802139|location=New York|pages=42, 154–55, 306, 357, 375|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 13, she approached the local newspaper editor about writing a fiction column. Each story she wrote for the paper earned her a dollar, making this her first paid work as a writer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Meredyth began her career in show business in [[vaudeville]] as a comedian. She most often sang or performed monologues while accompanying herself on the piano, a form she referred to as a "pianologue." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Screenwriters, An International Guide|last=Lucas|first=Victoria|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=9781137312372|location=|pages=824–827|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
Meredyth began her screen career as an extra at [[D. W. Griffith|D.W. Griffith]]'s [[Biograph Company|Biograph]] Studios in [[New York City|New York]], before moving to Los Angeles in 1911.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers- Writers and Production Artists|last=Clark|first=Virginia M.|publisher=St. James Press|year=1997|isbn=1558623027|location=Detroit|pages=566–567|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meredyth worked as an actress for five years, supplanting her income with screenwriting. While most of this work was as an extra, her most prominent role was the titular character in the 4-reel ''Bess the Detectress'' (1914) serials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Relationship With Wilfred Lucas==
Meredyth met Wilfred Lucas in 1911 when he encouraged her to pursue screen acting.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The year after, the two worked together on the film ''[[A Sailor's Heart]]'' (1913)'','' the first of many artistic collaborations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were eventually given their production unit at [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], in which they produced the 30-reel long ''[[The Trey o' Hearts|Trey of Hearts]]'' (1914) serials.

Meredyth and Lucas had one child together, television writer [[John Meredyth Lucas]] (1919-2002).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They divorced in 1927, following her return from supervising ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben Hur]]'' (1925)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Work with Snowy Baker==
In 1918, Meredyth and Lucas traveled to Australia to work with  Australian sportsman [[Snowy Baker]]. They made three films together, ''[[The Man from Kangaroo]]'' (1920), ''[[The Jackeroo of Coolabong]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Shadow of Lightning Ridge]]'' (1921), the first two of which Meredyth co-directed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was arguably the first professional screenwriter to work in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vagg, 'A Brief History of Australian Screenwriting'. Lumina Issue 7, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Michael Curtiz==
Meredyth and director [[Michael Curtiz]] met soon after his arrival in the United States, while both were working at [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] Studios.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were married in 1929 and unsuccessfully attempted to start a production unit at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] studios in 1946.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Though often uncredited, Meredyth contributed to several of Curtiz's projects. Most notably, Curtiz reportedly called Meredyth for input several times a day while working on his most successful film, ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942). 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Round Up The Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca- Bogart, Bergman, and World War II|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|publisher=Hyperion|year=1992|isbn=1562829416|location=New York|pages=122–123|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meredyth and Curtiz separated twice; once in 1941, and again in 1960. However, they remained in contact after this separation,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and Curtiz included Meredyth in his will upon his death in 1962.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Casablanca Man|last=Robertson|first=James C.|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=0415068045|location=New York|pages=98, 138–139,|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Throughout her time at MGM studios, Meredyth had mainly worked under [[Irving Thalberg]]. Upon his death in 1936, the new MGM executives dropped Meredyth's contract.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rather than re-entering as a "junior writer," as the new executives offered, Meredyth decided to retire from professional screenwriting. Despite this announcement, she has three credits after her alleged retirement,'' [[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940), ''[[That Night in Rio]]'' (1941), and ''[[The Unsuspected]]'' (1947).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Decima''' was one of the three [[Parcae]], or often known in English as the [[Moirae|Fates]]. [[Nona (deity)|Nona]] and Decima were responsible for birth, while [[Morta]] was charged with overseeing death. They distributed to mankind all the good and bad things in life, and even [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] had to bend to their will.

{{Missing information|the history of the subject. In particular, nothing is said about dream sequences in literature, and only one sentence addresses anything other than film|date=September 2016}}
A '''dream sequence''' is a technique used in [[storytelling]], particularly in television and film, to set apart a brief interlude from the main story. The interlude may consist of a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], a [[flashforward]], a [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]], a [[dream]], or some other element.

==Purposes==
Commonly, dream sequences appear in many films to shed light on the psychical process of the dreaming character or give the audience a glimpse into the character's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Montgomery |first= Mark |date=December 2010 |title= Dreaming Up Dream Sequences |journal= Videomaker |pages= 57–59 |url = http://www.videomaker.com/article/14611/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', the purpose of Pee-wee's dreams is to inform the audience of his anxieties and fears after losing his bike.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Other times major action takes place in dreams, allowing the filmmaker to explore infinite possibilities, as [[Michel Gondry]] demonstrates in ''[[The Science of Sleep]]''. Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] points out in the book ''The Committee of Sleep'' that, while the main content of dream sequences is determined by the film's overall plot, visual details often reflect the individual dream experience of the screenwriter or director. For Hitchcock's ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', [[Salvador Dalí]] designed sharply angled sets inspired by his own dream space. [[Ingmar Bergman]] lit dream sequences in several films with a harsh glare of light which he says reflects his own nightmares (though most people's have dim light), and [[Orson Welles]] designed a scene of [[The Trial (1962 film)|''The Trial'']] to reflect the manner in which architecture constantly changed in his dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Barrett |first1= Deidre | authorlink1 = Deirdre Barrett |title= The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use Dreams for Creative Problem-Solving—and How You Can Too |chapter= Chapter 2: Dreams that Money Can Buy |year= 2010 |origyear= 2001 |publisher= Oneiroi Press| isbn=0982869509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films normally present dreams as a visually accessible or objectively observed space, a discrete environment in which characters exist and interact as they do in the world rather than restricting themselves to the subjective point of view a dream is normally experienced from in real life.&lt;ref name="altworlds"&gt;{{cite book |title= Alternative Worlds in Hollywood Cinema |last= Walters |first= James |chapter= Chapter 2 |year= 2008 |publisher= Intellect Books |location= Chicago |isbn= 1841502022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way films succeed in presenting a coherent dreamed world alongside the [[Diegesis#In film|diegetic reality]] of the film. Via transition from one to the next, a film establishes not only the boundaries but resonances between the two worlds. These resonances can reveal a character's subjective observations or desires without breaking away from the objective viewpoint of the narrator, camera, or director with which some theorist, such as [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]], believe the viewer identifies.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Metz |first1= Christian |authorlink1= Christian Metz (critic) |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= Leo |editor1-last= Braudy | editor2-first = Marshall | editor2-last = Cohen  |title= Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings |edition= 6th |year= 1999  |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 0195105982  |pages= 800–808 |chapter= Identification, Mirror (from ''The Imaginary Signifier'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] explain past plot elements as a dream sequence in order to maintain a plausible [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in continuing fiction, such as a television series. Such was the case with ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', which had killed off [[Bobby Ewing]], one of the more popular characters on the show; when the show's writers decided to bring Bobby back to the show, the [[Dallas (season 10)|tenth-season]] premiere "Return to Camelot" revealed that the events between Bobby's death and the end of season nine were all part of a nightmare his wife was having.

==Techniques==
Audio or visual elements, such as distinctive music or coloration, are frequently used to signify the beginning and end of a dream sequence in film. It has also become commonplace to distinguish a dream sequence from the rest of the film by showing a shot of a person in bed sleeping or about to go to sleep. Other films show a dream sequence followed by a character waking up in their own bed, such as the dream sequence [[George Gershwin]] composed for his film score to ''[[Delicious (film)|Delicious]]''. In classic Hollywood, the wavy [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] was the standard way to transition between reality and a dream; there would be a close-up of the character having the dream, which would begin shimmering as we crossed over from reality to fantasy.&lt;ref name="transitions"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Morton |first= Ray |date=September–October 2011 |title= Transitions |journal= Script |volume= 17 |issue= 5 |pages=68–70 |issn= 1092-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common contemporary transitions into a fantasy is to zoom in on a character's face and then spin around to the back of that character to reveal that he/she is now standing in an alternate reality.&lt;ref name="transitions"/&gt; Perhaps the most common technique today is the post-reveal in which a character is shown in an awkward or unusual situation, the scene builds to an even more absurd or unusual situation, and then suddenly there is a cut to the character waking up,&lt;ref name="transitions"/&gt;  as exemplified by the opening sequence of ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'' where a [[pep rally]] with irreverent routines builds into an abnormal moment where a character is revealed topless; she then wakes up to the viewers' realization that she had been dreaming.

This is akin to the technique wherein a dream sequence is a [[plot device]] in which an entire story has been revealed to be a dream. As opposed to a segment of an otherwise real scenario, in these cases it is revealed that everything depicted was unreal. Often this is used to explain away otherwise inexplicable events. Because it has been done in many occasions to resolve a storyline that seemed out of place or unexpected, it is often considered weak storytelling; a particularly referenced example of this is the TV show ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed after the fact to have been a dream. Furthermore, in-jokes are often made in writing (particularly television scripts) that refer to the disappointment a viewer might feel in finding out everything they have watched was a dream. For example, entire sequences of the ''[[Family Guy]]'' two-part episode [[Stewie Kills Lois and Lois Kills Stewie|"Stewie Kills Lois" and "Lois Kills Stewie"]] are revealed to have taken place within a virtual reality simulation, upon which a character asks whether a potential viewer could be angry that they have effectively watched a dream sequence, but this technique can also be effective and its use lauded when the status of dream or reality is left more ambiguous as it was in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="dreamvision"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rabin |first= Staton |date=July–August 2011 |title= Dream, Vision or Fantasy? |journal= Script |volume= 17 |issue= 4 |pages=66–68 |issn= 1092-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[camera angle]]s and movements used to depict dream sequences enable this kind of play and confusion between the diegetic reality and the dreamed world by presenting the dream world as a visually accessible space in which the character moves around the same as he does in the diegetic reality, as opposed to restricting themselves cinematographically to a [[subjective viewpoint]] even though dreams are generally understood to be experienced by the dreamer from their own subjective point of view.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; This point is made salient by the films which choose to employ first-person camera angles such as ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' (1995) when it depicts recorded memories experienced via the "SQUID" recorder, the first-person sequence of ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (2005), the beginning of ''[[Enter the Void]]'' (2010), and others, and how radically these moments stand out against normal cinematography even when the subject matter is something as subjective as a dream. Many have cited the general impracticality and unattractiveness of sustained first-person perspective in film as a reason for its absence from filmed dream sequences.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:LifeOfAnAmericanFiremanqq01 12 56qq00013.jpg|thumb|A dream sequence in ''Life of an American Fireman'' (1903)]]
The dream sequence that Atossa narrates near the beginning of [[Aeschylus]]' Athenian tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' (472 BCE) may be the first in the history of European theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Taxidou |first1= Olga |title= Tragedy, Modernity and Mourning |year= 2004 |month= |origyear= |publisher= [[Edinburgh University Press]] |location= [[Edinburgh]] |isbn= 0748619879 |page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first dream sequence in a film is more contested.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Film critic [[Bob Mondello]] claims that the first famous movie with a dream sequence was [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'' (1924).&lt;ref name="dreamvision"/&gt; Predating this, Leslie Halpern claims that the earliest dream sequence was in [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]]'s ''[[Life of an American Fireman]]'' (1903).&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Earlier than either of these, James Walters points out [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|G.A. Smith]]'s use of a dream sequence in ''[[Let Me Dream Again]]'' (1900), but is careful to note the precariousness of claiming any film the first to feature dream sequence given the rapid transnational development of cinema in its early years and that so many films from the period have been lost.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

Walters traces the dream sequence technique of revealing one thing to be another (revealing what the audience thought was a dream to actually be reality), back to [[magic lantern (projector)|magic lantern]] shows features "slipping" or "slipper" slides in which; some lantern slides for examples would feature two sheets of glass with different images painted on each, say a cocoon and a butterfly. The first sheet would be projected and then the second sheet slid on top of it to reveal a change, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Dream sequences became very popular in the early period of film following this change of phase format.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Alongside this technique, a dream sequence which is introduced by a character falling asleep and then entering the dream sequence also became popular via such films as [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]]'s ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'' (1906).&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; What is important to note is these films created a model for dream sequences in which a character's inner thoughts are not represented subjectively (from the character's point of view), but from an objective camera angle that gives the audience the impression less of a character having a dream than of being transported alongside the character into a dreamed world in which the character's actions are captured by the camera in the same way they are the films' real fictional worlds.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

The '''Europa Philharmonie''' is a European [[symphony orchestra]] made up of musicians from European Union countries as well as musicians from all over the world who have made Europe their home. Since 2009, the orchestra has been based in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]], and is supported by the association Friends of Europa Philharmonie. The founder and principal conductor is [[Reinhard Seehafer]].

== History ==
The idea for a European orchestra came from general director Professor Wolf-Dieter Ludwig and the principal conductor, Reinhard Seehafer, after the borders in Europe had fallen away, and later under the name of Europa Philharmonie, was substantiated through the work with the artistic director Ferry Tomaszyk at worldwide guest performances as ambassadors of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. The orchestra's debut took place in 1996 with live television coverage across Europe with [[3sat]], performing [[Gustav Mahler]]'s "[[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Resurrection]]" in St. Peters's Church, [[Görlitz]] under the direction of principal conductor Reinhard Seehafer, with cooperation from the foundation [[Krzyżowa, Świdnica County|Kreisau/Krzyzowa]].

Europa Philharmonie stands for a tolerant and unified Europe, which is a view also reflected in the patronage of the German and Polish state presidents, and the president of the German Federal Parliament, as well as the work of the board of trustees "Indivisible Europe" of which Professor [[Kurt Masur]], the late [[Lea Rabin]], [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] and Prof.
Dr. Dieter Stolte are members.

From 1998 to 2007, the orchestra was based in Schloss Hundisburg (Hundisburg Castle) in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], which is one of the most important baroque castles in northern Germany.

==Worldwide Concert Activity==
* In honour of the 30th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of [[China]] in 2002, Europa Philharmonie gave guest performances in [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]] and five other cities in China.
* In 2004, the orchestra was the first classical symphony orchestra in the world to perform in [[Sana'a]], the capital city of Yemen, at the opening concert for "Sana'a - Cultural Capital of the Arab World", which was attended by its patron, the former President of the [[Bundestag]], [[Wolfgang Thierse]], and the Yemen Minister for Culture and Tourism, Khalid Al-Rewaishan. In addition to the invited guests, an audience of 5.000 experienced this spectacular concert with the city of Sana'a as a backdrop. The concert was also televised across the entire Arabian world. This tour also took the orchestra to [[Abu-Dhabi]], [[Ajman]] and [[Oman]], where the orchestra performed traditional New Year's concerts.
* Gala Concert "Welcome to Europe" in 2004, televised live, in the capital city of [[Cyprus]], [[Nicosia]], in honour of [[2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union#Cyprus|Cyprus' upcoming entry into the EU]].
* In 2005, the orchestra undertook a concert tour as ambassadors for the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in honour of the 60th anniversary of the end of the 2nd world war from [[Kefalonia]] to Athens and [[Crete]], all places where massacres took place.
* "Christmas Gala" 2005 in [[Antalya]], [[Turkey]], where the orchestra was awarded a prize for their work in intercultural understanding.

==Current projects==
* ''Education and Music'' for apprentice under the patronage of Prof. Dr. Claus Hipp
* ''Europe needs young people'' for school students in Germany, Switzerland and France
* ''Cultural Sustainability for Future Generations'' with projects to do with climate change and the protection of the environment

[[File:Frank-desprez.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Desprez in 1913]]
'''Frank Desprez''' (9 February 1853 &amp;ndash; 25 November 1916) was an English playwright, essayist, and poet. He wrote more than twenty pieces for the theatre, as well as numerous shorter works, including his famous poem, ''Lasca''.

==Life and career==
Desprez was born in [[Bristol]], England, the eldest of the eleven children of Charles Desprez, a jeweller and silversmith. The family was of French descent. He was educated at Cosham School, [[Wiltshire]] and spent three years in his teens in the U.S. State of Texas. In 1883, Desprez married Jessie Louisa Potter Macqueen. They had a son and two daughters.

===Librettist and assistant to Richard D'Oyly Carte===
Desprez returned to Britain in 1875. His first piece written for the theatre shortly thereafter was an adaptation of ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]''.  When this piece went on the road in 1876, he also wrote a companion piece for it called ''Happy Hampstead'', which was set to music by the theatrical agent and composer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].  Desprez became a close friend of Carte's and worked with him for many years as Carte's secretary.

At the same time Desprez wrote the texts for ten short works for D'Oyly Carte, most of which accompanied the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas on the bills at the [[Opera Comique]] and later the [[Savoy Theatre]]. These pieces had long runs in tandem with, and sometimes beyond, the runs of the principal pieces, and they were usually played on tour throughout Britain as companion pieces, benefit pieces and short-programme items. Working with composers such as [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Edward Solomon]], Desprez became perhaps the most popular librettist of one-act operas in Britain.

[[File:Bee-bee l.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', 1891]]
Desprez's most frequently played work was his 1879 two-act [[musical theatre|musical play]], ''[[Tita in Thibet]]'', which was later played in the British provinces by the Majilton company more than a thousand times.  It was written as a vehicle for the music hall star [[Kate Santley]].  W. H. Seymour, who would become the stage manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] for 20 years, also played in the piece.  The story concerns an unusual marriage custom purportedly to be found "in out of the way parts of the world" such as Tibet.  The customs of the country permit every wife to have four husbands.  The reviewer from ''The Era'' did not find the piece "refined" enough for his taste.

Desprez's best work as a lyricist was ''[[The Nautch Girl]], or, The Rajah of Chutneypore'', which played at the Savoy Theatre in 1891-92.

===Poet, essayist, journalist, and editor===
Desprez' best-known work, however, is a poem, ''Lasca'', about a Mexican girl and her cowboy sweetheart caught in a cattle stampede "in Texas down by the Rio Grande." The ballad-like poem, first published in a London magazine in 1882, has often been reprinted, usually with deletions and changes, and recited in many parts of the English-speaking world. Between 1873 and 1882 at least four other of Desprez's poems had been published, two of which are about Texas.

In 1884, Desprez began writing for ''The Era'', London's foremost theatre paper, and he became its editor in 1893, a position he held until illness forced him to retire in 1913. Desprez also wrote dozens of essays on travel, art, music, and famous personalities that were published in English periodicals, most of them between 1905 and 1914.

Desprez died in London at the age of 63.

'''Gilding''' is any decorative technique for applying a very thin coating of gold to solid surfaces such as metal (much the most common), wood, [[porcelain]], or stone. A gilded object is also described as "gilt". Where metal is gilded, it was traditionally [[silver]] in the West, to make [[silver-gilt]] (or ''[[vermeil]]'') objects, but [[gilt-bronze]] is commonly used in China, and also called [[ormolu]] if it is Western.  Methods of gilding include hand application and gluing, typically of [[gold leaf]], chemical gilding, and [[electroplating]], the last also called [[gold plating]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Annie (1996) ''Decorative Gilding'', Collins &amp; Brown, {{ISBN|978-0-89577-879-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Parcel-gilt''' (partial gilt) objects are only gilded over part of their surfaces. This may mean that all of the inside, and none of the outside, of a [[chalice]] or similar vessel is gilded, or that patterns or images are made up by using a combination of gilt and ungilted areas.

Gilding gives an object a gold appearance at a fraction of the cost of creating a solid gold object. In addition, a solid gold piece would often be too soft or too heavy for practical use. A gilt surface also does not tarnish as silver does.

==Origins and spread==
[[Image:Vajrasattva Tibet.jpg|thumb|A gilded Tibetan [[Vajrasattva]]]]
[[Herodotus]] mentions that the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]s gilded wood and metals, and many such objects have been excavated. Certain Ancient Greek statues of great prestige were [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine]], i.e., made of gold (for the clothing) and [[ivory]] (for the flesh); these however, were constructed with sheets of gold over a timber framework, not gilded. Extensive ornamental gilding was also used in the ceiling coffers of the [[Propylaea]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] informs us that the first gilding seen at [[Rome]] was after the destruction of [[Carthage]], under the censorship of [[Lucius Mummius]], when the Romans began to gild the ceilings of their temples and palaces, the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]] being the first place on which this process was used. But he adds that luxury advanced on them so rapidly that in very little time you might see all, even private and poor people, gild the walls, vaults, and other parts of their dwellings. Owing to the comparative thickness of the gold leaf used in ancient gilding, the traces of it that remain are remarkably brilliant and solid. Fire-gilding of metal goes back at least to the 4th century BC, and was known to Pliny (33,20,64–5), [[Vitruvius]] (8,8,4) and in the Early Mediaeval period to Theophilus (De Diversis Artibus Book III).

In Europe, silver-gilt has always been more common than gilt-bronze, but in China the opposite has been the case. The ancient Chinese also developed the gilding of [[porcelain]], which was later taken up by the French and other European potters.

==Processes==
Modern gilding is applied to numerous and diverse surfaces and by various processes; those used in modern technology are described in [[gold plating]]. More traditional techniques still form an important part of [[Picture frame|framemaking]] and are sometimes still employed in general [[woodworking]], [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]]-work, decorative painting and [[interior decoration]], [[bookbinding]], and ornamental [[leather]] work, and in the decoration of [[pottery]], porcelain, and [[glass]].

===Mechanical gilding===
[[File:Gilding Rock Cen Prometheus jeh.jpg|thumb|right|Regilding the statue ''[[Prometheus (Manship)|Prometheus]]'']]
[[File:Old book with gilded page edges.JPG|thumb|Gilded page edges on a book.]]
Mechanical gilding includes all the operations in which gold leaf is prepared, and the processes to mechanically attach the gold onto surfaces. The techniques include [[burnishing (metal)|burnishing]], water gilding and oil-gilding used by wood carvers and gilders; and the gilding operations of the house decorator, sign painter, [[bookbinder]], the paper stainer and several others.

Polished iron, steel and other metals are gilded mechanically by applying gold leaf to the metallic surface at a temperature just under red-hot, pressing the leaf on with a burnisher, then reheating when additional leaf may be laid on. The process is completed by cold burnishing.

"Overlaying" or folding or hammering on gold foil or gold leaf is the simplest and most ancient method, and is mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] (Bk vi, 232)&lt;ref&gt;"And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders" from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136;query=card%3D%2368;layout=;loc=6.162 this translation]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Old Testament]]. The ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]'' of about 2600–2400 BCE from [[Ur]] uses this technique on wood, with a thin layer of [[bitumen]] underneath to help adhesion.

The next advances involved two simple processes. The first involves gold leaf, which is gold that is hammered or cut into very thin sheets. Gold leaf is often thinner than standard paper today, and when held to the light is semi-transparent. In ancient times it was typically about ten times thicker than today, and perhaps half that in the [[Middle Ages]].

If gilding on canvas or on wood, the surface was often first coated with [[gesso]]. "Gesso" is a substance made of finely ground [[gypsum]] or chalk mixed with glue. Once the coating of gesso had been applied, allowed to dry, and smoothed, it was re-wet with a [[sizing]] made of [[rabbit-skin glue]] and water ("water gilding", which allows the surface to be subsequently burnished to a mirror-like finish) or boiled [[linseed oil]] mixed with [[litharge]] ("oil gilding", which does not) and the gold leaf was layered on and left to dry. Those gilding on canvas and parchment also sometimes employed stiffly-beaten egg whites ("glair"), [[Gum (botany)|gum]], and/or [[Armenian bole]] as sizing, though egg whites and gum both become brittle over time, causing the gold leaf to crack and detach, and so honey was sometimes added to make them more flexible.

Other gilding processes involved using the gold as pigment in paint: the artist ground the gold into a fine powder and mixed it with a binder. Then the gold was applied in the same way as with any paint. Sometimes, after either gold-leafing or gold-painting, the artist would heat the piece enough to melt the gold slightly, ensuring an even coat. These techniques remained the only alternatives for materials like wood, leather, the vellum pages of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and gilt-edged stock.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

===Chemical gilding===
[[File:Johann Jacob Kirstein 001.JPG|thumb|Silver gilt ''toilette'' set by Johann Jacob Kirstein (1733–1816) in the [[Musée des Arts décoratifs, Strasbourg]]]]
Chemical gilding embraces those processes in which the gold is at some stage of chemical combination. These include:

====Cold gilding====
In this process the gold is obtained in a state of extremely fine division, and applied by mechanical means. Cold gilding on silver is performed by a solution of gold in [[aqua regia]], applied by dipping a linen rag into the solution, burning it, and rubbing the black and heavy ashes on the silver with the finger or a piece of leather or cork.

====Wet gilding====
''Wet gilding'' is effected by means of a dilute solution of [[gold(III) chloride]] in aqua regia with twice its quantity of [[diethyl ether|ether]]. The liquids are agitated and allowed to rest, to allow the ether to separate and float on the surface of the acid. The whole mixture is then poured into a separating funnel with a small aperture, and allowed to rest for some time, when the acid is run off from below and the gold dissolved in ether separated. The ether will be found to have taken up all the gold from the acid, and may be used for gilding iron or steel, for which purpose the metal is polished with fine emery and [[spirits of wine]]. The ether is then applied with a small brush, and as it evaporates it deposits the gold, which can now be heated and polished. For small delicate figures, a pen or a fine brush may be used for laying on the ether solution. The gold(III) chloride can also be dissolved in water in [[Electroplating#Electroless deposition|electroless plating]] wherein the gold is slowly reduced out of solution onto the surface to be gilded. When this technique is used on the second surface of glass and backed with silver, it is known as "[[Angel gilding]]".

====Fire-gilding====
''Fire-gilding'' or ''Wash-gilding'' is a process by which an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] of gold is applied to metallic surfaces, the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] being subsequently [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatilized]], leaving a film of gold or an amalgam containing 13 to 16% mercury. In the preparation of the amalgam, the gold must first be reduced to thin plates or grains, which are heated red-hot, and thrown into previously heated mercury, until it begins to smoke. When the mixture is stirred with an iron rod, the gold is totally absorbed. The proportion of mercury to gold is generally six or eight to one. When the amalgam is cold, it is squeezed through [[chamois leather]] to separate the superfluous mercury; the gold, with about twice its weight of mercury, remains behind, forming a yellowish silvery mass with the consistency of butter.

When the metal to be gilded is wrought or chased, it ought to be covered with mercury before the amalgam is applied, that this may be more easily spread; but when the surface of the metal is plain, the amalgam may be applied to it directly. When no such preparation is applied, the surface to be gilded is simply bitten and cleaned with [[nitric acid]]. A deposit of mercury is obtained on a metallic surface by means of quicksilver water, a solution of [[mercury(II) nitrate]], the nitric acid attacking the metal to which it is applied, and thus leaving a film of free metallic mercury.

The amalgam being equally spread over the prepared surface of the metal, the mercury is then [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimed]] by a heat just sufficient for that purpose; for, if it is too great, part of the gold may be driven off, or it may run together and leave some of the surface of the metal bare. When the mercury has evaporated, which is known by the surface having entirely become of a dull yellow color, the metal must undergo other operations, by which the fine gold color is given to it. First, the gilded surface is rubbed with a scratch brush of [[brass]] wire, until its surface is smooth.

It is then covered with ''gilding wax'', and again exposed to fire until the wax is burnt off. Gilding wax is composed of [[beeswax]] mixed with some of the following substances: [[red ochre]], [[verdigris]], copper scales, [[alum]], [[vitriol]], and [[borax]]. By this operation the color of the gilding is heightened, and the effect seems to be produced by a perfect dissipation of some mercury remaining after the former operation. The gilt surface is then covered over with [[potassium nitrate]], alum or other salts, ground together, and mixed into a [[paste (rheology)|paste]] with water or weak [[ammonia]]. The piece of metal thus covered is exposed to heat, and then [[quenching|quenched]] in water.

By this method, its color is further improved and brought nearer to that of gold, probably by removing any particles of copper that may have been on the gilt surface. This process, when skillfully carried out, produces gilding of great solidity and beauty, but owing to the exposure of the workmen to mercurial fumes, it is very unhealthy. There is also much loss of mercury to the atmosphere, which brings extremely serious environmental concerns as well.

This method of gilding metallic objects was formerly widespread, but fell into disuse as the dangers of [[mercury toxicity]] became known. Since fire-gilding requires that the mercury be volatilized to drive off the mercury and leave the gold behind on the surface, it is extremely dangerous. Breathing the fumes generated by this process can quickly result in serious health problems, such as [[neurology|neurological damage]] and [[endocrinology|endocrine disorders]], since inhalation is a very efficient route for mercuric compounds to enter the body. This process has generally been supplanted by the electroplating of gold over a [[nickel]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]], which is more economical and less dangerous.

====Depletion gilding====
{{Main|Depletion gilding}}
In depletion gilding, a subtractive process discovered in [[Pre-columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], articles are fabricated by various techniques from an alloy of copper and gold, named [[tumbaga]] by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards]]. The surface is etched with acids, resulting in a surface of porous gold. The porous surface is then [[Burnishing (metal)|burnished]] down, resulting in a shiny gold surface. The results fooled the [[conquistadors]] into thinking they had massive quantities of pure gold. The results startled modern [[archaeology|archaeologists]], because at first the pieces resemble electroplated articles. [[Keum-boo]] is a special [[Koreans|Korean]] technique of silver-gilding, using [[depletion gilding]].

===Ceramics===

The gilding of decorative [[ceramic art|ceramics]] has been undertaken for centuries, with the permanence and brightness of gold appealing to designers. Both porcelain and [[earthenware]] are commonly decorated with gold, and in the late 1970s it was reported that 5 tonnes of gold were used annually for the decoration of these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF03215112|title=Gold in the pottery industry|journal=Gold Bulletin|volume=12|issue=3|pages=116|year=1979|last1=Hunt|first1=L.

The most important factors affecting coating quality are the composition of applied gold, the state of the surface before application, the thickness of the layer and the firing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00676649|title=Improving gold decorating techniques|journal=Glass and Ceramics|volume=48|issue=11|pages=535|year=1991|last1=Gerasimova|first1=L. V.|last2=Ivanova|first2=V. M.|last3=Peskova|first3=E. Yu.|last4=Druzhinin|first4=E. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of different forms and compositions are available to apply gold to ceramic, and these include:&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, A.and Murfin, D. (1994) ''Dictionary Of Ceramics''. The Institute Of Minerals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF03180905|title=Liquid gold and other components used in decoration of glazed porcelain and glass articles|journal=Glass and Ceramics|volume=55|issue=3–4|pages=98|year=1998|last1=Rovinskaya|first1=N. V.|last2=Lapitskaya|first2=E. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Acid-etched gilding – developed in 1860s at [[Mintons]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], and patented in 1863. The glazed surface, usually a narrow border, is [[transfer printing|transfer printed]] with a wax-like resist, after which the glaze is etched with dilute [[hydrofluoric acid]] prior to application of the gold, after which the design's raised elements are selectively burnished to give a bright and matte surface; the process demands great skill and is used for the decoration only of ware of the highest class.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Hayward (ed.) (1960) ''The Connoisseur’s Handbook of Antique Collecting''. Galahad Books, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bright Gold or Liquid Gold is a solution of gold sulphoresinate together with other metal resinates and a bismuth-based flux. It is particularly bright when drawn from the decorating kiln and so needs little further processing. This form of gilding was invented or at least improved by [[Heinrich Roessler]]. Rhodium compounds are used to improve the binding to the substrate.
*Burnish Gold or Best Gold is applied to the ware as a suspension of gold powder in essential oils mixed with lead borosilicate or a bismuth-based flux. This type of gold decoration is dull as taken from the kiln and requires burnishing, usually with agate, to bring out the colour. As the name suggests it is considered the highest quality of gold decoration. One [[solvent]]-free burnish gold composition was reported to consist of 10 to 40% gold powder, 2 to 20% [[polyvinylpyrrolidone]], 3 to 30% an aqueous acrylate resin and 5 to 50% water.&lt;ref&gt;"Burnish Gold Decorating Composition."

'''Ginny Field''' is a fictional character in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]], portrayed by [[Amy Steel]]. Introduced in [[Steve Miner]]'s sequel ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'' in 1981, Ginny is an aspiring [[Psychologist|child psychologist]] who is hired as an assistant to [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Paul Holt|Paul Holt]] at the Packanack Lodge, a site Paul plans to transform into a counselor training center which is located near the infamous Camp Crystal Lake. Ginny, who believes that the legend of [[Jason Voorhees]] is more than a myth, soon encounters the vengeful killer and realizes that she must delve into his psyche if she wants to survive.

Originally in ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' (1982), Ginny's role in the film was supposed to be similar to [[Laurie Strode]]'s in ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981) with Ginny being pursued in a mental asylum by Voorhees just like [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] stalked Strode in the hospital. However, Steel feared being typecast and ultimately turned down the offer to reprise her role. She subsequently appears in ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' (1984) through archive footage.

She also appears in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' expanded universe]], appearing in the novelizations and merchandise based on the films. Some scholars regard Ginny as an example of the "[[final girl]]" archetype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3800027|title=They Survived It All, But What Do These Iconic Final Girls Of Horror Look Like Now ?|last=Rayner|first=Karly|date=February 26, 2016|website=Moviepilot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301100628/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3800027|archive-date=2016-03-01|dead-url=yes|access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===In film===
In ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', Ginny is an aspiring child psychologist who is [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Paul Holt|Paul Holt]]'s girlfriend, she arrives at Crystal Lake late for training. At the campfire that night, Paul tells the camp counselors the legend of Jason Voorhees and the disappearance of [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice]] which occurred months after Jason allegedly witnessed his mother being beheaded, to scare the other counselors from entering Camp Crystal Lake. Later on, Paul offers them a trip to the next town, but only Ginny and Ted accept his offer. At a bar, Ginny admits that she takes the legend of "Camp Blood" seriously. She feels sympathetic towards [[Jason Voorhees]], because of his traumatic childhood and she believes the legends of him witnessing [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice]] beheading his [[Pamela Voorhees|mother]]. Meanwhile, [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]] begins to murder all of the counselors. When Ginny and Paul return, she believes that something is wrong. Ginny is soon forced to fight for her life. After Jason knocks Paul out, Ginny becomes his new target. After an evading Jason numerous times and fighting back, Ginny stumbles across Jason's shack in the woods, and finds a shrine for Pamela Voorhees. She puts on an old sweater, belonging to Pamela, in effort to convince Jason Voorhees that she is his mother. Jason believes her, and she manages to calm him down before he notices his mother's head behind Ginny. He then slices open Ginny's leg just as Paul comes in. As Jason prepares to kill Paul, Ginny comes up behind Jason and drives a machete into his shoulder. In the end of the film, Ginny is seen being carried away in a stretcher, crying out for Paul, whose fate is unknown.

''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' picks up directly after the second film, with Ginny Field shown being pulled away on a stretcher during a news report detailing the ordeal she survived. Originally, Ginny was set to return as a main character in ''[[Friday the 13th Part III|Part III]]'' but [[Amy Steel]] feared being typecast and officially decided to not return when her agent of the time convinced her to decline the offer. Her role in the film would have been similar to [[Laurie Strode]]'s in ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981). According to Kelly Konda, "Director Steve Miner and Martin Kitrosser, the script supervisor for Parts 1 and 2 and co-writer of Part 3, wanted Ginny to go to a mental institution as a result of her trauma after Part 2.  Jason would eventually arrive to settle his vendetta against her, killing any guards, doctors, or patients that got in his way." However, producers soon became skeptical of the idea and eventually abandoned it when Steel officially declined to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2014/02/14/13-things-you-may-not-know-about-friday-the-13th-part-3/|title=13 Things You May Not Know About Friday the 13th Part 3|last=|first=|date=|website=We Minored In Film|publisher=|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked why she didn't reprise her role as the lead character in ''Part III'', Steel confirmed her fear of being typecast and her subsequent regret of declining the offer to return, stating:
:"When I finished filming ''Part 2'', I was trashed. I was exhausted. But that’s not why I didn’t do ''Part 3''. I wanted to be taken seriously as an actress. At the time there was still a stigma associated with horror movies. Jamie Lee Curtis changed that . . . but the roles were limited. It was mostly about screaming. I regret not doing the third film. It’s one of my biggest regrets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-line-up.com/friday-the-13th-part-2-amy-steel-interview/|title=The Girl That Got Away from Jason: An Interview with Amy Steel from Friday the 13th Part 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
Ginny appears in ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' (1984) through archive footage which is currently the last ''Friday the 13th'' film that she Ginny appears in.

===In literature===
Ginny makes her first literary appearance in the novelization of ''Friday the 13th Part 3'' (1982), which states that she is in "serious condition" and is suffering from "severe hysterical shock: because of her battle with Jason Voorhees. She subsequently appears as the lead protagonist in ''Friday the 13th Part II: A Novel'', a novelization of the 1981 film ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', which was released seven years after the film premiered in February 1988. The novel was written by Simon Hawke and based on Ron Kurz's screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friday the 13th Part II: A Novel|last=Hawke|first=Simon|publisher=New American Library|year=1988|isbn=0-451-15337-5|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aftermath of her encounter with Jason is once again referenced in the novel ''Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs'', which states that her claims of finding Jason's shack in the woods went ignored, due to the authorities doubting her sanity.

===In merchandise===
In 2014, Fright-Rags released ''Ginny's Revenge'', a Horror T-shirt with Ginny being the main part of the design. It received a limited release with only 300 shirts being sold. The cost of the shirts were $27 with sizes ranging from S-5X, Girls S-2X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2014/09/fright-rags-releases-ginnys-revenge.html|title=Fright-Rags Releases 'Ginny's Revenge' Part 2 Themed T-Shirt|last=Parker|first=Jason|date=September 15, 2014|website=Friday the 13th The Franchise|publisher=|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Ginny was featured on the design of another Fright-Rags T-shirt entitled ''Victims and Survivors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2017/01/11/motel-hell-the-friday-the-13th-victims-alfred-hitchcock-get-their-due-in-new-fright-rags-line/|title=MOTEL HELL, The FRIDAY THE 13TH Victims &amp; Alfred Hitchcock Get Their Due In New FRIGHT-RAGS Line!|last=Galluzzo|first=Rob|date=January 11, 2017|website=blumhouse.com|publisher=|access-date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In video games===
In ''[[Friday the 13th: The Game]]'' (2017), Ginny is referenced in the Virtual Cabin 2.0 mode. When viewing the statue of Jason's design from ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', his biography states, "Only the aspiring child psychologist, Ginny Field, is able to outsmart and eventually "defeat" Jason. She puts on Pamela's sweater to trigger Jason, and then buries a machete deep into his shoulder..." She is also referenced in the biography for Jason's design from ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' which states that Jason barely survived his encounter with Ginny.

==Development==
In an interview, Amy Steel discussed her audition for the film, stating:
:"At the time of [making the film], it was before the genre really picked up so I didn’t give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another audition because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from a lot of the people working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and you see a lot of that when I’m on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences. I wanted her to have some power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/16108/dread-central-s-final-girls-amy-steel/|work=Dread Central|author=Wixson, Heather|date=March 5, 2010|accessdate=October 15, 2016|title=Dread Central’s Final Girls: Amy Steel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
While discussing the character, Steel described the parallels between herself and Ginny and praised the character's intelligence and strength, noting:

:"I think I got lucky with the role of Ginny, on a couple of fronts. She's pretty much who I am. It wasn't really much of a stretch. We have the same energy, so you could say I was typecast. But the hard part is really owning who we are as women, all the strength, faith, and calm ... at the same time." 
:
She then said she liked the character because she wasn't a "total bimbo" and that she was "smart and confident and you knew she had something driving her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Welcome to Our Nightmares: Behind the Scene with Today's Horror Actors|last=Norman|first=Jason|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=0786479868|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In ''The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film'', [[Barry Keith Grant]] stated that, "Ginny temporarily adopts Mrs. Voorhees's authoritarian role to survive. Although circumstances necessitate this, she clearly uses her enemy's strategy to become a phallic mother herself. This posture really questions the positive image of the Final Girl." He then called her "not victorious" when she called out for her boyfriend at the end of the film saying that it was done in a "non-independent manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film|last=Grant|first=Barry|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=0292772459|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Kenneth Muir references Ginny in ''Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1'', saying "Amy Steel is introduced as Ginny, our final girl and heroine, and the only person who seems to have an inkling of the nearby danger. She's more resourceful than Alice and nearly upstages even Laurie Strode during the film's tense finale, wherein she brazenly dresses up as Jason's dead mother and starts barking orders at the confused serial killer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=MacFarland|year=2012|isbn=0786455012|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle'', Richard Nowell said "The shift in characterization of the female leads was also trumpeted during Ginny's self-confident entrance (Amy Steel) in ''Friday the 13th Part II''. Where the makers of its predecessor introduced Alice as she prepared cabins while dressed in denim jeans and a shapeless lumberjack shirt, the sequel's conventionally attractive lead is established immediately as combining masculine traits with feminine attributes. Ginny exits a battered VW bug in a flowing fuchsia skirt and a low-cut t-shirt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle|last=Nowell|first=Richard|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=2010|isbn=1441188509|location=|pages=210|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Horror and the Horror Film'', Bruce F. Kawin states that "The heroine and survivor, Ginny (Amy Steel), is not a virgin, though she is having her period and may gain from that some blood power against Jason. Ginny is majoring in Child Psychology, which lets her deal with Jason (who, she deduces, has the mind of child fixated on the mother he saw killed because she loved him) when she pretends to be his mother. She survives partly because she takes children's emotions seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror and the Horror Film|last=Kawin|first=Bruce|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2012|isbn=0857284509|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' ranked Ginny 16th on their list of ''The 25 Most Badass Horror Movie Heroines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/10/25-most-badass-horror-movie-heroines/|title=The 25 Most Badass Horror Movie Heroines|last=|first=|date=|website=Complex|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' ranked Ginny 17th on their list of ''The 20 Best "Final Girls" in Horror Movie History'', calling her "a realistic girl of her time period who, at the same time, has the guts and resolve to face off against Jason (sans hockey mask, which he didn’t get until the third film) and come out on top."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/the-20-best-final-girls-in-horror-movie-history.html|title=The 20 Best "Final Girls" in Horror Movie History|last=Vorel|first=Jim|date=|website=Paste|publisher=|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Manningham''' (died 1622) was an English lawyer and diarist, a contemporary source for [[Elizabethan era]] and [[Jacobean era]] life and the London dramatic world, including [[William Shakespeare]].

==Life==

He was son of Robert Manningham of [[Fen Drayton]], [[Cambridgeshire]], by his wife Joan, daughter of John Fisher of [[Bledlow]], [[Buckinghamshire]].

He matriculated at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] around 1592, and graduated B.A. in 1596.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|MNNN592J|Manningham, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 1598 he entered as a student in the [[Middle Temple]], and on 7 June 1605 he was called to the degree of an utter barrister.

A fellow-student, Edward, son of William Curll and brother of [[Walter Curll]], obtained for him the post of auditor of the court of wards. He was also befriended by a distant relative, Richard Manningham, who, born at [[St Albans]] in 1539, made a fortune in London as a mercer, and in his old age retired to [[Bradbourne]], near [[Maidstone]]. Richard Manningham died on 25 April 1611, and was buried in [[East Malling]] Church, where John Manningham erected a monument to his memory. To John, his sole executor, Richard left his house and lands in [[Kent]].

==Diary==

Manningham wrote a diary, preserved among the [[Harleian Manuscripts]], and first printed by the [[Camden Society]] in 1868, under the editorship of [[John Bruce (antiquary)|John Bruce]]. It covers the period from January 1602 to April 1603; at the time the writer was a student in the Middle Temple. The work is a medley of anecdotes of London life, political rumours, accounts of sermons, and memoranda of journeys. The gossip respecting Queen Elizabeth's illness and death and the accession of James I is set down in detail, and Manningham often supplies comments on the character of the chief lawyers and preachers of the day. He also gives an account of the performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' on 2 February 1602 in the Middle Temple Hall. [[John Payne Collier]]&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Annals of the Stage'', 1831, i. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; first called attention to Manningham's work. The anecdote of Shakespeare's triumph over [[Richard Burbage]] in the pursuit of the favors of a lady of doubtful virtue ("William the Conqueror was before Richard III") comes from his diary entry dated March 13, 1602.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3345890/Diaries-reveal-Shakespeare-posed-rival-actor-entertain-fan.html ''Daily Mail'', December 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Thomas Bodley]], [[John Stow]], and [[Sir Thomas Overbury]] are also occasionally mentioned by Manningham.

==Family==
Manningham married, about 1607, Ann, sister of his friend Curll. By her he had three sons, Richard (born 1608), John (born 1616), and Walter, and three daughters, Susannah, Ann, and Elizabeth. Walter Curll, by his will of 15 March 1646–7, left legacies to his sister Mrs. Manningham and her son and his godson Walter. She was dead before 1656, when her eldest son Richard sold the property at Bradbourne to [[Sir Thomas Twisden, 1st Baronet|Thomas Twysden]], serjeant-at-law.

'''LOOP''' is an annual meeting point in [[Barcelona]] for [[video art]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The platform takes the form of a festival, a fair and a conferences. The LOOP Festival present works of 800 artists to 200000 visitors in 100 locations, from museums to restaurants and shops across Barcelona, over two weeks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The 44 galleries invited by the Committee for the LOOP Fair present recent works of emerging and well-known artists to 4000 professionals, journalists, curators and collectors. This selection is completed with presentations of magazines and distribution companies.

LOOP has the support of the Government of Catalunya, the Spanish Ministry of Culture as well as other institutional and corporate sponsors.

==History==
'''2003'''
{{advert|date=January 2014}}
LOOP was created by the Barcelona Art Association in 2003 as a platform for active dissemination, discussion and creation of audiovisual art. Together with its network of professionals, they wanted to contemplate video art as a way of removing the boundaries between art and society. LOOP emerged from the transformation of the New Art fair, which for seven editions had filled the rooms of a hotel. The LOOP Fair was held from November 27 to 30 at Hotel Barceló Sants in Barcelona.

'''2004'''
[[Image:Hotelbar.jpg|thumb|Hotel Catalonia Ramblas]]
From November 18 to 21, 50 rooms on the first floor of the Hotel Barceló Sants were once again occupied by 50 galleries presenting video art. There was also an area of 900m2 in which institutions and museums could present their collections of video art. Magazines and publications specialized in contemporary art also occupied the Fair LOOP. To encourage collectors, LOOP'04 created a program of video art patronage, formed by a group of institutions and enterprises engaged in the acquisition of works presented at the fair. At the same time, arts centers, galleries and other spaces in Barcelona presented videos through the Off LOOP festival. A series of conferences in the media library of CaixaForum and a course organized by the Friends of the Museums of Catalunya were also scheduled.

'''2005'''
[[Image:Ruedadeprensa.jpg|thumb|Press conference at the MACBA]]
The LOOP Festival returned from November 7 to 20 with more than 350 participating artists presenting their video art works along 8 main routes: Route El Raval, Route Eixample, Route Calle Montcada, Route Montjuïc, Route Gràcia, Route Born/Ciutat Vella, Route Playa and Route Nau Ivanow. The Video London exhibition, with more than 150 participants, included the panorama of contemporary video art by young artists who study, work or exhibit in London. The LOOP Fair was held from November 10 to 13. The 52 invited galleries from different countries presented recent works at the Hotel Barceló Sants.

'''2006'''

The fourth edition of the LOOP Fair, from May 19 to 21, offered international premieres in the rooms of Hotel Pulitzer. In addition, a parallel space, called Video Zone, presented the collections of video art distributors as well as a sample of contemporary art magazines. Also, the fair hosted video feedback, three days of presentations by collectors, panel discussions, lectures and workshops on key issues and practical matters in the field of video art. From May 10 to 21 the festival of LOOP'06 was held.

'''2007'''

In its fifth edition, from May 23 to June 3, 180,000 visitors saw works from over 800 artists in 108 spaces, from institutions like the CCCB and the MACBA to restaurants and shops, presenting 66 curated programs, 20 universities and 20 international festivals.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}'''Laura Harding''' is an architectural practitioner and critic based in Sydney. Harding works across architecture and [[urban design]], with a particular focus on the public realm. She is also an architectural critic and an active participant in the public culture of architecture. Harding regularly contributes to architectural education as a visiting critic at the [[University of New South Wales]] and the [[University of Sydney]]. From 2006 to 2012 she taught with [[Glenn Murcutt]] in the third year design program at the University of New South Wales.

==Biography==

Harding was born in Sydney in 1975. She studied architecture at the [[University of Sydney]], graduating with a Bachelor of Science (Architecture) in 1995 and a Bachelor of Architecture in 1998. She has worked at the Sydney-based practice Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects for eighteen years, having joined the practice in 1996 as a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hillthalis.com.au/index.php?id=35|title = Hill Thalis|date = |accessdate = |website = Hill Thalis Architecture and Urban Projects|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Harding began writing architectural criticism in 2004, first for ''[[Architecture Australia]]'', the journal of record of Australian architecture, and subsequently for a range of professional publications and mainstream media outlets. She was appointed a contributing editor to ''Architecture Australia'' in 2005, a position she continues to hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://architectureau.com/contributors/Harding-Laura/|title = Laura Harding|date = |accessdate = 8 March 2015|website = ArchitectureAU|publisher = Architecture Media|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding has had criticism published in [[The Guardian]] and is a regular contributor to [[The Saturday Paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/contributor/laura-harding#.VPu7qGTLdZE|title = Contributor's page, The Saturday Paper|date = |accessdate = |website = The Saturday Paper|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-harding|title = Contributor's page, The Guardian|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding was guest editor, alongside Philip Thalis, of a special issue of ''[[Architecture Australia]]'' on Urban Housing (''Architecture Australia'' (May 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://architectureau.com/tags/2014-aa-urban-housing-dossier/|title = Urban Housing Dossier|last = Laura Harding|first = Philip Thalis|date = May 2014|journal = Architecture Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural work==

Harding's project work crosses architecture and urban design, with a particular focus on multi-residential and urban projects. Her work includes the award-winning project Substation No. 175, which converted a remnant substation building in Surry Hills into a 'tiny urban tower'. This intensified the use of the tiny site and aimed to show that "no lot need be too small to be used effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://naomistead.com/?p=201|title = Substation No 175, Surry Hills|last = Stead|first = Naomi|date = June 2005|journal = Architectural Review Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding was project urban designer on the winning entry in the international design competition for East Darling Harbour ([[Barangaroo, New South Wales|Barangaroo]]) by Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects, Paul Berkemeier Architects and Jane Irwin Landscape Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/competition-9/|title = East Darling Harbour|last = Mossop|first = Elizabeth|date = July 2006|journal = Architecture Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed a new urban street pattern, waterfront park and urban grain for the Millers Point wharves. The scheme did not go ahead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7734">[[File:Lienzo de Quauhquechollan.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the ''Lienzo de Quauhquechollan'' after its restoration, in 2009.]]
[[File:081128 canak arbol de manitas.JPG|thumb|Canak, or hands tree Chiranthodendron pentadactylon. Its leaves are used in certain tamales. It has medicinal properties. It is mentioned on the ''Lienzo de Quauhquechollan''.]]
The '''Lienzo de Quauhquechollan''' ("Quauhquechollan Cloth") is a 16th-century  ''[[lienzo]]'' (cloth painting) of the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], a group of indigenous peoples of Mexico. It is one of two surviving Nahua pictorial records recounting the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]]&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p94"&gt;Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the earliest surviving maps of what is now Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p4"/&gt;

The cloth was probably painted in [[Ciudad Vieja]], in the modern [[Guatemala]]n [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Sacatepéquez Department|Sacatepéquez]], by Nahua allies of the Spanish from the city of [[Huaquechula|Quauhquechollan]] (now known as San Martín Huaquechula).&lt;ref&gt;Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p.94. Asselbergs 2002, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; These allies had assisted [[conquistador]] [[Jorge de Alvarado]] in his campaign of 1527 to 1529.&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p94"/&gt; The Quauhquechollan allies settled in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]] and the cloth records their participation in the Spanish conquest of Mexico and Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p1"&gt;Asselbergs 2002, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The original is currently in the Casa de Alfeñique Museum in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] in central [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Marroquin1"&gt;Universidad Francisco Marroquín 2009a.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
The Lienzo was made sometime in the 1530s;&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p94"/&gt; it consists of 15 individual pieces of painted cotton stitched together to form a large map.&lt;ref name="Marroquin2"&gt;Universidad Francisco Marroquín 2009b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p2"&gt;Asselbergs 2002, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces are of differing sizes and manufacture and some of them are reused.&lt;ref&gt;Asselbergs 2002, p.4.n.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete Lienzo de Quauhquechollan measures {{convert|3.25|by|2.35|m|ft}} (width by height).&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p94"/&gt; The Lienzo was executed in a central Mexican style using indigenous artistic conventions to portray a mixture of Nahua and Spanish subjects.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p4"/&gt; The main focus of the map lies within the borders of modern Guatemala, specifically the area around [[Chimaltenango]] and [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]], the colonial capital.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p4"&gt;Asselbergs 2002, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lienzo concentrates upon the role of the Quauhquechollan allies in the conquest, their travels and the battles they took part in.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p4"/&gt; It was executed by more than one artist, as evidenced by stylistic differences in the painting.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p6"&gt;Asselbergs 2002, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The earliest mention of the Lienzo, under the name of the ''Lienzo de la Academia de Puebla'' ("Cloth of the Puebla Academy"), dates to the final decade of the 19th century when it was in the collection of the Puebla Painting Academy, although its provenance was unknown.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p5"&gt;Asselbergs 2002, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; It has various pieces of paper fixed beside the images and bearing text using the Latin alphabet, although these are very poorly preserved.&lt;ref name="Asselbergs02p6"/&gt;

==Content==
The top left corner of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is illustrated with the place [[Aztec writing|glyph]] representing Quauhquechollan combined with the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] coat of arms.&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p95"&gt;Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] is shown embracing a Quauhaquechollan noble, both are accompanied by their retinues and the scene includes an exchange of gifts.&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p95"/&gt; Another scene shows [[Jorge de Alvarado]] at the head of a large army as they depart from Quauhquechollan; the army itself is mixed, containing both Spanish and Nahuas. All the Quauhquechollans are depicted bearing Spanish swords, a privilege bestowed upon some of the native allies of the conquistadors.&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p95"/&gt; The route of the army on its march to Guatemala is depicted, including [[Tehuantepec]] in [[Oaxaca]] and the [[Soconusco]] region of lowland [[Chiapas]] (both within the borders of modern Mexico).&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p95"/&gt; In Guatemala the army passes through [[Retalhuleu]], [[San Francisco Zapotitlán|Zapotitlán]] and [[Suchitepéquez Department|Suchitepéquez]] and is shown engaging in a number of battles, even though [[Pedro de Alvarado]] had previously conquered this region.&lt;ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p95"/&gt;

This is a '''list of [[botanical illustrator]]s who were/are active or born in [[Australia]]'''.

[[Botanical illustration]] involves the painting, drawing and illustration of plants and ecosystems. Often meticulously observed, the botanical art tradition combines both science and art, and botanical artists throughout the centuries have been active in collecting and cataloguing a huge variety of species.

Roof shapes differ greatly from region to region. The main factors which influence the shape of [[roof]]s are the climate and the materials available for roof structure and the outer covering. Roof terminology is also not rigidly defined. Usages vary slightly from region to region, or from one builder or architect to another.

Roof shapes vary from almost flat to steeply pitched. They can be arched or domed; a single flat sheet or a complex arrangement of slopes, gables and hips; or truncated (terraced, cut)&lt;ref&gt;Long, George. "Roof". ''The Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge''. London: Charles Knight, 18331843. 143. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to minimize the overall height.

==Roof shapes==
* [[Flat roof|Flat]]: These are found in traditional buildings in regions with a low precipitation. Modern materials which are highly impermeable to water make possible the very large low-pitch roofs found on large commercial buildings. Although called flat they are generally gently pitched.
** [[Roof garden|Roof terrace (including roof garden)]]: the same with protections from falling such as a balustrade, parapet walls or surrounding raised plant beds used as a living or public dining space.
* Mono-pitched roofs (''Pitched'' here means a roof [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] rather than a slope and implies it is not a flat roof)
** [[Mono-pitched roof]] (shed, skillion, lean-to roof&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Henry J., and Peter R. Smith. "Shed roof" ''Dictionary of architectural and building technology''. London: Elsevier Applied Science Publishers ;, 1986. 272. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A roof with one slope, historically attached to a taller wall.
** [[Saw-tooth roof|Saw-tooth]]: A roof comprising a mono-pitched roof or for larger buildings, series of, mono-pitched roofs with vertical surfaces glazed and pitched upward in general terms away from the [[equator]], though other directions suit if direct sunlight is desired and where rooftop access may otherwise be impracticable. The roof tops are opaque, shielding traditionally workers and machinery from direct [[sunlight]]. This sort of roof commonly admits natural light into a [[factory]], and is also known as [[North light (architecture)|"Northlight"]] in the northern hemisphere implying a single such plane.&lt;ref&gt;"The Machine Shop and the Works. Modern Principles of Design", ''The Times: Engineering Supplement'', London, November 13, 1912, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pent roof (pentice, skirt roof if carried around the house&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M.. "Pent roof". ''Harris dictionary of architecture &amp; construction''. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A roof appended, thus the name, to the wall of a building and by implication having further roofs or terraces above. (See gallery below)
* Multi-pitched roofs:
** [[Gable]] (ridged, dual-pitched, peaked, saddle, pack-saddle, saddleback,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Honour, &amp; Pevsner, ''A Dictionary of Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt; span roof&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, Augustine C.. "Span Roof". ''Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects'', . London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. 325. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A simple roof design shaped like an inverted V.
*** Cross gabled: The result of joining two or more gabled roof sections together, forming a T or L shape for the simplest forms, or any number of more complex shapes.
***See also [[roof pitch]], [[Crow-stepped gable|crow-stepped, corbie stepped, stepped gable]]: A gable roof with its end parapet walls below extended slightly upwards and shaped to resemble steps.
** [[A-frame house|A-frame]]
** Half-hipped (clipped gable): A combination of a gable and a hip roof (pitched roof without changes to the walls) with the hipped part at the top and the gable section lower down.
** [[Gablet roof|Dutch gable, gablet]]: A hybrid of hipped and gable with the gable (wall) at the top and hipped lower down; i.e. the opposite arrangement to the ''half-hipped'' roof. Overhanging [[eaves]] forming shelter around the building are a consequence where the gable wall is in line with the other walls of the buildings that is unless the upper gable or gables is or are recessed.
** [[Saltbox]], catslide: A gable roof with one side longer than the other, and thus closer to the ground unless the pitch on one side is altered.
** Outshot or catslide: A pitched extension of a main roof similar to a lean-to but an extension of the upper roof.
** Bonnet roof: A reversed gambrel or Mansard roof with the lower portion at a lower pitch than the upper portion.
** Monitor roof: A roof with a [[Monitor (architecture)|monitor]]; 'a raised structure running part or all of the way along the ridge of a double-pitched roof, with its own roof running parallel with the main roof.'
** [[Butterfly roof]] (V-roof,&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, Augustine C.. "V Roof" ''Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects'', . London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. 362. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; London roof&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, John. ''Loft Conversions''. 2nd ed. New York: Wiley, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A V-shaped roof resembling an open book. A kink separates the roof into two parts running towards each other at an obtuse angle.
** [[Karahafu]]: A type of gable found in some traditional Japanese buildings.
** [[Hidden roof]]: A type of Japanese roof construction.
**[[Hip roof|Hip, hipped]]: A hipped roof is sloped in two pairs of directions (e.g. N-S and E-W) compared to the one pair of direction (e.g. N-S ''or'' E-W) for a gable roof.
** Half-hipped: A hybrid of a gable and a hipped roof. (See above.)
** Dutch gable, gablet: The reverse hybrid of a hipped and a gable roof. (See above.)
** Cross hipped: The result of joining two or more ''hip'' roof sections together, forming a T or L shape for the simplest forms, or any number of more complex shapes.
** Satari: A Swedish variant on the ''monitor roof''; a double hip roof with a short vertical wall usually with small windows, popular from the 17th century on formal buildings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (''Säteritak'' in Swedish.)
** [[Mansard roof|Mansard]] (French roof): A roof with the pitch divided into a shallow slope above a steeper slope. The steep slope may be curved. An element of the Second Empire architectural style (Mansard style) in the U.S.
** [[Gambrel|Gambrel, curb, kerb]]: A roof similar to a mansard but sloped in one direction rather than both.
** Bell-cast (sprocketed, flared): A roof with the shallow slope below the steeper slope at the eaves. Compare with [[bell roof]].
** [[East Asian hip-and-gable roof]]
** [[Mokoshi]]: A Japanese decorative pent roof
** Pyramidal
** Pyramid roof (pavilion roof): A hip roof on a square building.
** [[Pyatthat]]: A multi-tiered and spired roof commonly found in Burmese royal and Buddhist architecture.
** [[Tented roof|Tented]]:A type of polygonal hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak
** Helm roof, [[Rhenish helm]]: A pyramidal roof with gable ends; often found on church towers.
** Twisted, an extreme display of craftsmanship found on some church towers in France, see gallery below.
** Arched roof
** [[Barrel roof|Barrel, barrel-arched]] (cradle, wagon): A round roof like a barrel (tunnel) vault.
** [[catenary arch|Catenary]]: An arched roof in the form of a catenary curve.
** Bow roof, rainbow,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. Dictionary of architecture and building construction. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Architectural Press, 2008.304&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic, Gothic arch, and ship's bottom roof. Historically also called a ''compass roof''.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/rainbow+roof|title=Rainbow roof &amp;#124; Article about rainbow roof by The Free Dictionary|website=encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Circular
** [[Bell roof]] (bell-shaped, '''ogee''', [[Philibert de l'Orme]] roof): A bell-shaped roof. Compare with ''bell-cast'' eaves. De l'Orme also used ''bow roofs'' (see below).
** [[Dome]]d

The earliest well-known report of a man-eating tree originated as a literary fabrication written by Edmund Spencer for the ''[[New York World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Spencer |first=Edmund |editor-last=Somers |editor-first=Frederick Maxwell |title=Wonderful Stories: The Man-eating Tree |date=August 1888 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_ZYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 |magazine=Current Literature |volume=1 |number=2| |page=109,154-155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spencer's article first appeared in the daily edition of the ''New York World'' on 26 April 1874, and appeared again in the weekly edition of the newspaper two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York World|accessdate=2013-07-01|title=Crinoida Dajeeana, The Man-eating Tree of Madagascar|author=Spencer, Edmund|date=April 26–28, 1874 |url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/New%20York%20NY%20World/New%20York%20NY%20World%201880-1881%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20World%201880-1881%20Grayscale%20-%200070.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, a letter was published by a purported German [[explorer]] named "Karl Leche" (also spelled as Karl or Carl Liche in later accounts), who provided a report of encountering a [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] performed by the "Mkodo tribe" of [[Madagascar]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2007-10-26|title=The Dirt: Myths about man-eating plants - something to chew on|author=Ron Sullivan and Joe Eaton|date=October 27, 2007|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/27/HOIASVF6T.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story was picked up by many other newspapers of the day, which included the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' of 27 October 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=South Australian Register|accessdate=2013-07-01|title=Man-eating Tree of Madagascar|author=Spencer, Edmund|date=October 27, 1874|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39810790?searchTerm=man-eating%20tree%20madagascar&amp;searchLimits=l-title=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it gained even greater notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/nyregion/answering-a-question-about-a-tale-of-human-sacrifice-to-a-tree.html|title=Answering a Question About a Tale of Human Sacrifice to a Tree|last=Pollak|first=Michael|date=2014-08-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the tree, the account related:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The slender delicate palpi, with the fury of starved serpents, quivered a moment over her head, then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms; then while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after another, like great green serpents, with brutal energy and infernal rapidity, rose, retracted themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after fold, ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon their prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tyson | first =Peter | title =A Forest Full of Frights, part 2 | work =The Wilds of Madagascar | publisher =Nova Online | url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/madagascar/surviving/frights2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The tree was given further publicity by ''Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree'', a book by [[Chase Osborn]], who had been a [[Governor of Michigan]]. Osborn claimed that both the tribes and missionaries on Madagascar knew about the hideous tree, repeated the above Liche account, and acknowledged "I do not know whether this tigerish tree really exists or whether the bloodcurdling stories about it are pure myth. It is enough for my purpose if its story focuses your interest upon one of the least known spots of the world."&lt;ref name="Osborn1925"&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborn |first=Chase Salmon |title=Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree |year=1924 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.89667 |publisher=Republic Publishing Company |location=New York, N.Y. |pages=3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his 1955 book, ''Salamanders and other Wonders'', science author [[Willy Ley]] determined that the Mkodo tribe, Carl Liche, and the Madagascar man-eating tree all appeared to be fabrications: "The facts are pretty clear by now. Of course the man eating tree does not exist. There is no such tribe."&lt;ref name="Ley1955"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ley|first=Willy|title=Salmanders and Other Wonders: Still More Adventures of a Romantic Naturalist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XukeAAAAMAAJ|year=1955|publisher=Viking Press|pages=178–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yateveo==
In [[J. W. Buel]]'s ''Sea and Land'' (1887),&lt;ref name="Astro1976"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI4TAAAAYAAJ|title=Literature and the Sea: Proceedings of a Conference Held at the Marine Science Center, Newport, Oregon, May 8, 1976|publisher=Oregon State University, Sea Grant College Program|year=1976|author=Richard Astro}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Yateveo'' plant is described as being native to Africa and [[Central America]], so named for producing a hissing sound similar to the Spanish phrase "ya-te-veo" ([[literal translation|lit.]] "I-see-you"), and having poisonous "spines" that resemble "many huge serpents in an angry discussion, occasionally darting from side to side as if striking at an imaginary foe" which seize and pierce any creature coming within reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buel |first=James William |year=1887 |title=Sea and Land: An Illustrated History of the Wonderful and Curious Things of Nature existing before and since the Deluge |url=https://archive.org/details/sealandillustrat00buel |publisher=Historical Publishing Company |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |pages=475–477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The vampire vine==
[[William Thomas Stead]], editor of ''[[Review of Reviews]],'' published a brief article in October 1891 that discussed a story found ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]'' magazine, describing a plant in [[Nicaragua]] called by the natives the devil's snare. This plant had the capability "to drain the blood of any living thing which comes within its death-dealing touch." According to the article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Dunstan, naturalist, who has recently returned from Central America, where he spent nearly two years in the study of the flora and the fauna of the country, relates the finding of a singular growth in one of the swamps which surround the great lakes of Nicaragua. He was engaged in hunting for botanical and entomological specimens, when he heard his dog cry out, as if in agony, from a distance. Running to the spot whence the animal's cries came. Mr. Dunstan found him enveloped in a perfect network of what seemed to be a fine rope-like tissue of roots and fibers...  The native servants who accompanied Mr. Dunstan manifested the greatest horror of the vine, which they call "the devil's snare", and were full of stories of its death-dealing powers. He was able to discover very little about the nature of the plant, owing to the difficulty of handling it, for its grasp can only be torn away with the loss of skin and even of flesh; but, as near as Mr. Dunstan could ascertain, its power of suction is contained in a number of infinitesimal mouths or little suckers, which, ordinarily closed, open for the reception of food. If the substance is animal, the blood is drawn off and the carcass or refuse then dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 1891 |title=The Vampire Vine |journal=Review of Reviews. |volume=IV |issue=22 |pages=391 |editor=Stead, William |publisher=London: Mobray House |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ch3NPZiYvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An investigation of Stead's review determined no such article was published in the October issue of ''Lucifer'', and concluded that the story in ''Review of Reviews'' appeared to be a fabrication by the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1892 |title=A Cannibal Plant |journal=The Western Druggist. |volume=XIV |issue=3 |pages=93 |publisher=Chicago: G.P. Englehard &amp; Co. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkbnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=vampire+vine+lucifer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MARJUquaKcjNqgH2nYHQDw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vampire%20vine%20lucifer&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story in fact appeared in the September issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Besant |editor-first=Annie |date=15 September 1891 |title=A Curious Story |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=4C7YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |magazine=[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]] |location=London, England |volume=9 |issue=49 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; proceeded by a longer version in an 1889 newspaper describing Dunston as a "well-known naturalist" from New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Special Telegram |title=A Blood-Sucking Plant |date=9 December 1889 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52214686 |newspaper=The Times |publisher= |location=Philadelphia, PA |issue=5196 |page=2 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mujhe Insaaf Chahiye''''' (English: ''I want justice'') is an [[Cinema of India|Indian]] [[Bollywood]] film directed by [[T. Rama Rao]] , produced by [[D. V. S. Raju]] released on 23 September [[Bollywood films of 1983|1983]]. The film stars [[Mithun Chakraborty]], [[Rati Agnihotri]], [[Rekha]], [[Ranjeeta]], [[Danny Denzongpa]] and [[Asrani]]. The film was a remake of the Telugu film ''[[Nyayam Kavali]]''. The movie portrayed the social issue of single parenthood, as similarly done in [[Kundan Shah]]'s 2000 film ''[[Kya Kehna]]''.

==Plot==
Malati (Rati Agnihotri), a young girl from a middle-class family meets Suresh Ray (Mithun Chakraborty), who is the son of a well-known lawyer Dayashankar Ray (Danny Denzongpa). After dating each other for some time, she finds that she is pregnant. When Suresh refuses to marry Malati, and she decides against aborting the baby, her parents throw her out and disown her. Left alone, she decides to take Suresh to court. She is supported in this fight by Shakuntala (Rekha), a lawyer who works for woman's rights, who also has an illegitimate daughter from Dayashankar Ray. The case gets much publicity and public support, and the judge rules in Malati's favor. At this point however, Malati refuses to marry Suresh and decides to raise the child on her own. In the meantime, Shakuntala dies of a heart attack, and Malati promises her to take care of her daughter, and carry on Shakuntala's work.

Years later Suresh and his wife (Ranjeeta), now married for some years and still childless, run into Malati again. It turns out that she has been raising her son all by herself, and he has turned out to be a very talented and well-adjusted young and smart boy.

==Early life==
Natasha Allegri is the daughter of an [[Okinawa Island|Okinawan]] mother of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent and a [[Bolivia]]n father of [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Bolivia|Native Bolivian]] descent. She grew up in [[Inverness, Florida]]. In high school and college she made comics about her life that she posted to [[LiveJournal]], which is how she met [[Pendleton Ward]].

==Adventure Time==
While in college at the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=natazilla LiveJournal|url=http://natazilla.livejournal.com/profile|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; her friend, and creator of ''[[Adventure Time]]'', [[Pendleton Ward]], contacted her about working on ''Adventure Time'' and she has worked on the show for five seasons.&lt;ref name="Toon Buzz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive Interview w/ Natasha Allegri, creator of Bee and PuppyCat - Toon Buzz on Channel Fred|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2Iblw2sR_U|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on the show, Allegri began drawing gender-swapped versions of the show's characters, including ''[[Fionna and Cake]]'' as her gender-swapped versions of Finn and Jake, and eventually these characters were featured in full episodes of ''Adventure Time''. Since August 6, 2013, she also has written and illustrated ''Fionna and Cake'' comics for [[BOOM! Studios]].&lt;ref name="Toon Buzz" /&gt;

==''Bee and PuppyCat''==
Allegri created and produced her own animated short, ''[[Bee and PuppyCat]]'', for [[Frederator Studios]]' [[YouTube]] channel [[Cartoon Hangover]] which was released on July 11, 2013.&lt;ref name="Toon Buzz" /&gt; The episode introduces viewers to Bee, a recently unemployed young woman, and PuppyCat, a small and mysterious creature resembling both a dog and a cat. Bee takes PuppyCat in and, in return, he helps her find strange temp work, in this case babysitting a giant fish named Wallace in Fishbowl Space. In response to fans' overwhelming love for the original ''Bee and PuppyCat'' short, [[Frederator]] launched a Kickstarter on October 14, 2013 to raise funds for a full season. The Kickstarter was successful, raising Frederator $872,133 toward the production of ''Bee and PuppyCat'', the animated series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frederator/bee-and-puppycat-the-series&lt;/ref&gt; This exceeded their original goal of $600,000 and made them the 4th most funded Video and Film project to date.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/00000142-5980-d016-abf6-7ba3afae0000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|thumb|Horseman, Pazyryk [[felt]] artifact, c.300 BC.]]
The '''Pazyryk culture''' is  a [[Scythian]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Pazyryk&lt;/ref&gt; nomadic [[Iron Age]] [[archaeological culture]] (c. 6th to 3rd centuries BC) identified by excavated artifacts and mummified humans found in the [[Siberia]]n [[permafrost]], in the [[Altay Mountains]], [[Kazakhstan]] and nearby [[Mongolia]]. The mummies are buried in [[long barrow]]s (or ''[[kurgan]]s'') similar to the tomb mounds of Scythian culture in modern [[Ukraine]]. The type site are the [[Pazyryk burials]] of the [[Ukok Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|NOVA|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many artifacts and human remains have been found at this location, including the [[Siberian Ice Princess]], indicating a flourishing culture at this location that benefited from the many trade routes and caravans of merchants passing through the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|State Hermitage Museum|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pazyryk are considered to have had a war-like life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jordana|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other kurgan cemeteries associated with the culture include those of [[Bashadar]], [[Tuekta]], [[Ulandryk]], [[Polosmak]] and [[Katonkaragay District|Berel]]. There are so far no known sites of settlements associated with the burials, suggesting a purely nomadic lifestyle.

Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the [[Altai-Sayan region|Altai]] burials, notably those of the 5th century BC at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as [[Katanda]], [[Shibe, Siberia|Shibe]], and [[Tuekt]], were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them. At Pazyryk these included the bodies of horses and an embalmed man whose body was covered with tattoos of animal motifs. The remarkable textiles recovered from the Pazyryk burials include the oldest woollen [[knotted-pile carpet]] known, the oldest embroidered [[China|Chinese]] silk, and two pieces of woven [[Persian carpet|Persian]] fabric (State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). Red and ochre predominate in the carpet, the main design of which is of riders, stags, and griffins. Many of the Pazyryk felt hangings, saddlecloths, and cushions were covered with elaborate designs executed in appliqué feltwork, dyed furs, and embroidery. Of exceptional interest are those with animal and human figural compositions, the most notable of which are the repeat design of an investiture scene on a felt hanging and that of a semihuman, semibird creature on another (both in the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg]]). Clothing, whether of felt, leather, or fur, was also lavishly ornamented.

Horse reins either had animal designs cut out on them or were studded with wooden ones covered in gold foil. Their tail sheaths were ornamented, as were their headpieces and breastpieces. Some horses were provided with leather or felt masks made to resemble animals, with stag antlers or rams’ horns often incorporated in them. Many of the trappings took the form of iron, bronze, and gilt wood animal motifs either applied or suspended from them; and bits had animal-shaped terminal ornaments. Altai-Sayan animals frequently display muscles delineated with dot and comma markings, a formal convention that may have derived from appliqué needlework. Such markings are sometimes included in [[Assyria]]n, [[Achaemenian]], and even [[Urartian]] animal representations of the [[ancient Middle East]]. Roundels containing a dot serve the same purpose on the stag and other animal renderings executed by contemporary ''Śaka'' metalworkers. Animal processions of the Assyro-Achaemenian type also appealed to many [[Central Asian]] tribesmen and are featured in their arts.

Certain geometric designs and [[sun symbols]], such as the circle and [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. The stag and its relatives figure as prominently as in Altai-Sayan. Combat scenes between [[carnivores]] and [[herbivores]] are exceedingly numerous in Pazyryk work; the Pazyryk beasts are locked in such bitter fights that the victim's hindquarters become inverted.&lt;ref name="Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.britannica.com/art/Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts |title=Altaic Tribes|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peer-to-peer file sharing''' is the distribution and sharing of [[digital media]] using [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networking technology. P2P [[file sharing]] allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content.&lt;ref name="Carmack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carmack |first=Carman|url= http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent1.htm|title=How Bit Torrent Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required).

Peer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design stages from the early networks like [[Napster]], which popularized the technology, to the later models like the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol. Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing games (e.g. the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|mmorpg]] [[Skyforge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/3dmzhz/heads_up_if_youre_installing_skyforge_the/|title=Heads up if you're installing Skyforge - The downloader is a P2P client and by default starts with Windows. • /r/MMORPG|website=reddit|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) use it as their content distribution network for downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.

Several factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation of peer-to-peer file sharing. These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal computers. Users are able to transfer one or more files from one computer to another across the Internet through various [[file transfer]] systems and other file-sharing networks.&lt;ref name="Carmack" /&gt;

==History==
Peer-to-peer file sharing became popular in with the introduction of [[Napster]], a file sharing application and a set of central servers that linked people who had files with those who requested files. The central index server indexed the users and their shared content. When someone searched for a file, the server searched all available copies of that file and presented them to the user. The files would be transferred directly between the two private computers. A limitation was that only music files could be shared.&lt;ref name="Tyson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first= Jeff|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/napster2.htm|title=How the Old Napster Worked|work=howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this process occurred on a central server, however, Napster was held liable for copyright infringement and shut down in July 2001. It later reopened as a pay service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v11n1/douglas111.html|title= Copyright and Peer-To-Peer Music File Sharing: The Napster Case and the Argument Against Legislative Reform|date= March 2004|work=murdoch.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Napster was shut down, the most popular peer-to-peer services were [[Gnutella]] and [[Kazaa]]. These services also allowed users to download files other than music, such as movies and games.&lt;ref name="Tyson" /&gt;

===Technology evolution ===
[[Napster]] and [[eDonkey2000]], which both used a central server-based model, may be classified as the first generation of P2P systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1=Yiming|title=Identifying P2P users using traffic analysis|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/identifying-p2p-users-using-traffic-analysis|publisher=Symantec|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems relied on the operation of the respective central servers, and thus were susceptible to centralized shutdown. The second generation of P2P file sharing encompasses networks like [[Kazaa]], [[Gnutella]] and [[Gnutella2]], which are able to operate without any central servers, eliminated the central vulnerability by connecting users remotely to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/kazaa3.htm|title=How Kazaa Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation of filesharing networks are the so-called [[darknet]]s, including networks like [[Freenet]], which provide user anonymity in addition to the independence from central servers.

The [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol represents a special case. In principle, it is a filesharing protocol of the first generation, relying on central servers called ''trackers'' to coordinate users. However, it does not form a network in the traditional sense. Instead new, separate networks of coordinating users are created for every set of files, called a ''torrent''. Newer extensions of the protocol removes the need of centralized trackers, allow the usage of a decentralized server-independent network for source identification purposes, referred to as the [[Mainline DHT]]. This allows BitTorrent to encompass certain aspects of a filesharing network of the second generation as well. Users create an index file containing the metadata of the files they want to share, and upload the index files to websites where they are shared with others.

Peer-to-peer file sharing is also efficient in terms of cost.&lt;ref name="Babaoglu 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Babaoglu|first=Ozalp|title=Introduction to Peer-to-Peer Systems|url=http://www.cs.unibo.it/babaoglu/courses/cas/slides/p2p.pdf|work=Complex Systems|publisher=Universitá di Bologna|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ijcsits.org/papers/vol3no22013/1vol3no2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The system administration overhead is smaller because the user is the provider and usually the provider is the administrator as well. Hence each network can be monitored by the users themselves. At the same time, large servers sometimes require more storage and this increases the cost since the storage has to be rented or bought exclusively for a server. However, usually peer-to-peer file sharing does not require a [[dedicated server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winkelman|first=Dr. Roy|title=Software|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap6/chap6.htm|publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology College of Education, University of South Florida,|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic impact ==
{{Main article|File sharing#Economic impact|l1=Effects of file sharing}}
There is still ongoing discussion about the economic impact of P2P file sharing. Norbert Michel, a policy analyst at the [[Heritage Foundation]], said that because of "econometric and data issues, studies thus far have produced disparate estimates of file sharing's impact on album sales."&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;J. Michel, Norbert. [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/08/internet-file-sharing-the-evidence-so-far-and-what-it-means-for-the-future Internet File Sharing and The Evidence So far], heritage.org, August 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]'', [[Yochai Benkler]] states that peer-to-peer file sharing is economically efficient and that the users pay the full transaction cost and marginal cost of such sharing even if it "throws a monkey wrench into the particular way in which our society has chosen to pay musicians and re-cording executives. This trades off efficiency for longer-term incentive effects for the recording industry. However, it is efficient within the normal meaning of the term in economics in a way that it would not have been had Jack and Jane used subsidized computers or network connections".&lt;ref name="Yochai Benkler"&gt;{{cite book | author = Yochai Benkler | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=McotnvNSjQ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=benkler#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falsee | title = Wealth of Networks | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 0300127235 | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As peer-to-peer file sharing can be used to exchange files for which the distribution right was granted (e.g. [[public domain]], [[Creative Commons]], [[Copyleft|Copyleft licenses]], online games, updates, ...).

Especially startups can save massive amounts of money compared with other means of [[content delivery network]]s.

A calculation example:

with peer to peer file sharing: &lt;math&gt;\text{total cost} = \frac{\text{filesize}}{\text{customers}} \times \text{cost-per-byte}&lt;/math&gt;

with casual content delivery networks: &lt;math&gt;\text{total cost} = \text{filesize} \times \text{customers} \times \text{cost-per-byte}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Music industry ===
The economic effect of copyright infringement through peer-to-peer file sharing on music revenue has been controversial and difficult to determine. Unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on record sales.&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Zentner, [http://www.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1452&amp;amp;context=bejeap "File Sharing and International Sales of Copyrighted Music: An Empirical Analysis with a Panel of Countries"], ''The B.E.

Also many independent artists choose a peer-to-peer file sharing method named [[BitTorrent Bundle]] for distribution.

===Film industry===
The [[MPAA]] reported that American studios lost $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005, representing approximately one third of the total cost of film piracy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.MPAA.org/press_releases/2006_05_31.pdf|title=SWEDISH AUTHORITIES SINK PIRATE BAY: Huge Worldwide Supplier of Illegal Movies Told No Safe Harbors for Facilitators of Piracy!|date=2006-05-31|publisher=[[MPAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA's estimate was doubted by commentators since it was based on the assumption that one download was equivalent to one lost sale, and downloaders might not purchase the movie if illegal downloading was not an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/21/business/yourmoney/21view.html?ex=1258693200&amp;en=a210357f5dcc8523&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt |title=Does a Free Download Equal a Lost Sale? |first=Daniel |last=Gross |date=2004-11-21 |accessdate=2007-07-16 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|first=Felix|last=Oberholzer|author2=Strumpf, Koleman|title=The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis|date=March 2004|publisher=[[UNC Chapel Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A 2010 study, commissioned by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] and conducted by independent Paris-based economics firm TERA, estimated that unlawful downloading of music, film and software cost Europe's creative industries several billion dollars in revenue each year.&lt;ref&gt;Mundell, Ian. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118016618.html?categoryId=1338&amp;cs=1 Piracy in Europe costs $13.7 billion], ''Variety''. March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the TERA study entitled "Building a Digital Economy: The Importance of Saving Jobs in the EU's Creative Industries" predicted losses due to piracy reaching as much as 1.2 million jobs and €240 billion in retail revenue by 2015 if the trend continued.  Researchers applied a substitution rate of ten percent to the volume of copyright infringements per year. This rate corresponded to the number of units potentially traded if unlawful file sharing were eliminated and did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffron, Patrice.

== Public perception and usage ==
In 2004, an estimated 70 million people participated in online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Ray. [http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html Law professors examine ethical controversies of peer-to-peer file sharing]. ''Stanford Report'', March 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CBS News]] poll, nearly 70 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds thought file sharing was acceptable in some circumstances and 58 percent of all [[United States|Americans]] who followed the file sharing issue considered it acceptable in at least some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml Poll: Young Say File Sharing OK] ''CBS News'', Bootie Cosgrove-Mather, 2003-09-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, 32 million Americans over the age of 12 had downloaded at least one feature-length movie from the Internet, 80 percent of whom had done so exclusively over P2P. Of the population sampled, 60 percent felt that downloading copyrighted movies off the Internet did not constitute a very serious offense, however 78 percent believed taking a DVD from a store without paying for it constituted a very serious offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srgnet.com/pdf/Movie%20File-Sharing%20Booming%20Release%20Jan%2024%2007%20Final.pdf Solutions Research Group - Movie File-Sharing Booming: Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217011553/http://www.srgnet.com/pdf/Movie%20File-Sharing%20Booming%20Release%20Jan%2024%2007%20Final.pdf |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, 20 percent of Europeans used file sharing networks to obtain music, while 10 percent used paid-for digital music services such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;17:41 GMT, Thursday, 3 July 2008 18:41 UK. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7486743.stm Technology: "Warning letters to 'file-sharers'"], ''BBC NEWS''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, a [[Tiscali]] UK survey found that 75 percent of the English public polled were aware of what was legal and illegal in relation to file sharing, but there was a divide as to where they felt the legal burden should be placed: 49 percent of people believed P2P companies should be held responsible for illegal file sharing on their networks, 18 percent viewed individual file sharers as the culprits, while 18 percent either didn't know or chose not to answer.&lt;ref&gt;MarkJ - 24 February 2009 (1:46 PM).  [http://www.ispreview.co.uk/news/EkFVulFEAVbPsdkYcg.html "Tiscali UK Survey Reveals Illegal File Sharing Attitudes"], ''ISPreview UK News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an earlier poll, 75 percent of young voters in [[Sweden]] (18-20) supported file sharing when presented with the statement: "I think it is OK to download files from the Net, even if it is illegal." Of the respondents, 38 percent said they "adamantly agreed" while 39 percent said they "partly agreed".&lt;ref&gt;TT/Adam Ewing. 8 Jun 06 09:54 CET. [http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=4014&amp;date=20060608 "Young voters back file sharing"], ''The Local''.&lt;/ref&gt; An academic study among American and European college students found that users of file-sharing technologies were relatively anti-copyright and that copyright enforcement created backlash, hardening pro-file sharing beliefs among users of these technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Depoorter et al.

== Communities in P2P file sharing networks==
Communities have a prominent role in many peer to peer networks and applications, such as BitTorrent, Gnutella and [[DC++]]. There are different elements that contribute to the formation, development and the stability of these communities, which include interests, user attributes, cost reduction, user motivation and the dimension of the community.

=== Interest attributes ===
Peer communities are formed on the basis of common interests. For Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta common interests can be labelled as attributes "which are used to determine the peer communities in which a particular peer can participate".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24629-9_5|title = Structuring Peer-to-Peer Networks Using Interest-Based Communities|last = Khambatti|first = Mujtaba|date = 7 September 2003|journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume = 2944|pages = 48|doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-24629-9_5|last2 = Ryu|first2 = Kyung Dong|last3 = Partha|first3 = Dasgupta|isbn = 978-3-540-20968-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ways in which these attributes can be classified: explicit and implicit attributes.

Implicit values means that peers provide information about themselves to a specific community, for example they may express their interest in a subject or their taste in music. With explicit values, users do not directly express information about themselves, albeit, it is still possible to find information about that specific user by uncovering his or her past queries and research carried out in a P2P network. 
Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta  divide these interests further into three classes: personal, claimed and group attributes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A full set of attributes (common interests) of a specific peer is defined as personal attributes, and is a collection of information a peer has about him or herself. Peers may decide not to disclose information about themselves to maintain their privacy and online security. It is for this reason that the authors specify that "a subset of...attributes is explicitly claimed public by a peer", and they define such attributes as "claimed attributes".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third category of interests is group attributes, defined as "location or affiliation oriented" and are needed to form a...basis for communities", an example being the "domain name of an internet connection" which acts as an online location and group identifier for certain users.

=== Cost reduction ===
Cost reduction influences the sharing component of P2P communities. Users who share do so to attempt "to reduce...costs" as made clear by Cunningham, Alexander and Adilov.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://opus.ipfw.edu/econ_facpubs/23/|title = Peer-to-peer file sharing communities|last = Cunningham|first = Brendan|date = 28 October 2003|journal = Information Economics and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 16 December 2015|last2 = Alexander|first2 = Peter|last3 = Adilov|first3 = Nodir}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their work Peer-to-peer file sharing communities, they explain that "the act of sharing is costly since any download from a sharer implies that the sharer is sacrificing bandwidth".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As sharing represents the basis of P2P communities, such as Napster, and without it "the network collapses", users share despite its costs in order to attempt to lower their own costs, particularly those associated with searching, and with the congestion of internet servers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== User motivation and size of community ===
User motivation and the size of the P2P community contribute to its sustainability and activity. In her work Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities, Vassileva studies these two aspects through an experiment carried out in the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), where a P2P application (COMUTELLA) was created and distributed among students. In her view, motivation is "a crucial factor" in encouraging users to participate in an online P2P community, particularly because the "lack of a critical mass of active users" in the form of a community will not allow for a P2P sharing to function properly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39173-8_11|title = Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities|last = Vassileva|first = Julita|date = January 2002|journal = Engineering Societies in the Agents World III|volume = 2577|pages = 141|doi = 10.1007/3-540-39173-8_11|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-540-14009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usefulness is a valued aspect by users when joining a P2P community. The specific P2P system must be perceived as "useful" by the user and must be able to fulfil his or her needs and pursue his or her interests. Consequently, the "size of the community of users defines the level of usefulness" and "the value of the system determines the number of users".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This two way process is defined by Vassileva as a feedback loop, and has allowed for the birth of file-sharing systems like Napster and KaZaA. However, in her research Vassileva has also found that "incentives are needed for the users in the beginning", particularly for motivating and getting users into the habit of staying online.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be done, for example, by providing the system with a wide amount of resources or by having an experienced user provide assistance to a less experienced one.

=== User classification ===
Users participating in P2P systems can be classified in different ways. According to Vassileva, users can be classified depending on their participation in the P2P system. There are five types of users to be found: users who create services, users who allow services, users who facilitate search, users who allow communication, users who are uncooperative and free ride.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the first instance, the user creates new resources or services and offers them to the community. In the second, the user provides the community with disk space "to store files for downloads" or with "computing resources" to facilitate a service provided by another users.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the third, the user provides a list of relationships to help other users find specific files or services. In the fourth, the user participates actively in the "protocol of the network", contributing to keeping the network together. In the last situation, the user does not contribute to the network, downloads what he or she needs but goes immediately offline once the service is not needed anymore, thus free-riding on the network and community resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Tracking ==
Corporations continue to combat the use of the internet as a tool to illegally copy and share various files, especially that of copyrighted music. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) has been active in leading campaigns against infringers. Lawsuits have been launched against individuals as well as programs such as [[Napster]] in order to "protect" copyright owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f9f5f492-42ef-4892-80d3-e21faab3803c%2540sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4111|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recent efforts of the RIAA has been to implant decoy users to monitor the use of copyrighted material from a firsthand perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The P2P war: Someone is monitoring your activities|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128608000091|journal = Computer Networks|date = 2008-04-24|pages = 1272–1280|volume = 52|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.comnet.2008.01.011|first = Anirban|last = Banerjee|first2 = Michalis|last2 = Faloutsos|first3 = Laxmi|last3 = Bhuyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==
In early June 2002, Researcher Nathaniel Good at [[HP Labs]] demonstrated that user interface design issues could contribute to users inadvertently sharing personal and confidential information over P2P networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Good|first=Nathaniel|author2=Aaron Krekelberg|title=Usability and privacy: a study of Kazaa P2P file- sharing|journal=HP Labs Tech Report|date=5 June 2002|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2002/HPL-2002-163.html|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Good|first=Nathaniel|author2=Aaron Krekelberg|title=Usability and privacy: a study of Kazaa P2P file- sharing|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|year=2003|pages=137–144|doi=10.1145/642611.642636 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=642611.642636|isbn=1581136307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Security Hole Found in KaZaA File-Sharing Service|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/07/technology/07PRIV.html|accessdate=15 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Congressional hearings before the House Committee of Government Reform (''Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108hhrg88016/pdf/CHRG-108hhrg88016.pdf|work=Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks|title=Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate Judiciary Committee (''The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=4f1e0899533f7680e78d03281fed5fb5|work="The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?"|title=The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?}}&lt;/ref&gt; were convened to address and discuss the issue of inadvertent sharing on peer-to-peer networks and its consequences to consumer and national security.

Researchers have examined potential security risks including the release of personal information, bundled [[spyware]], and [[Computer virus|viruses]] downloaded from the network.&lt;ref&gt;By M. Eric Johnson, Dan McGuire, Nicholas D. Willey [http://csdl2.computer.org/comp/proceedings/hicss/2008/3075/00/30750383.pdf The Evolution of the Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Industry and the Security Risks for Users]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Where Only Fools Dare to Tread: An Empirical Study on the Prevalence of Zero-day Malware|author=Håvard Vegge, Finn Michael Halvorsen and Rune Walsø Nergård|publisher=2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proprietary file sharing clients have been known to bundle [[malware]], though [[Open-source software|open source]] programs typically have not. Some open source file sharing packages have even provided integrated anti-virus scanning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/torrentserver Open source file sharing software with integrated anti-virus scanning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since approximately 2004 the threat of [[identity theft]] had become more prevalent, and in July 2008 there was another inadvertent revealing of vast amounts of personal information through P2P sites. The "names, dates of birth, and [[Social Security number]]s of about 2,000 of (an investment) firm's clients" were exposed, "including [those of] [[Stephen Breyer|Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer]]."&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt; A drastic increase in inadvertent P2P file sharing of personal and sensitive information became evident in 2009 at the beginning of [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]'s administration when the blueprints to the helicopter [[Marine One]] were made available to the public through a breach in security via a P2P file sharing site. Access to this information has the potential of being detrimental to US security.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;Greg Sandoval. April 21, 2009 10:41 AM PDT. [http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10224080-93.html "Congress to probe P2P sites over 'inadvertent sharing'"], ''CNET News''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, shortly before this security breach, the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show had reported that more than 150,000 tax returns, 25,800 student loan applications and 626,000 credit reports had been inadvertently made available through file sharing.&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;

The United States government then attempted to make users more aware of the potential risks involved with P2P file sharing programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=P2P File-Sharing Risks|publisher=OnGuardOnLine.gov|url=http://www.onguardonline.gov/p2p}}&lt;/ref&gt; through legislation such as H.R. 1319, the Informed P2P User Act, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hearing on Barrow P2P Legislation Held on Tuesday|publisher =Congressman John Barrow|date=May 2009|url=http://www.barrow.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this act, it would be mandatory for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with peer-to-peer file sharing before purchasing software with informed consent of the user required prior to use of such programs. In addition, the act would allow users to block and remove P2P file sharing software from their computers at any time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1319 "Text of H.R. 1319: Informed P2P User Act"], ''GovTrack.us''&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] enforcing regulations. [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US-CERT]] also warns of the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Risks of File-Sharing Technology|publisher=[[US-CERT]]|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST05-007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in 2010, researchers discovered thousands of documents containing sensitive patient information on popular peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, including insurance details, personally identifying information, physician names and diagnosis codes on more than 28,000 individuals. Many of the documents contained sensitive patient communications, treatment data, medical diagnoses and psychiatric evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaikumar Vijayan.

==Copyright issues==
{{Main article|Legal aspects of file sharing}}
The act of file sharing is not illegal per se and peer-to-peer networks are also used for legitimate purposes. The legal issues in file sharing involve violating the laws of [[copyrighted]] material. Most discussions about the legality of file sharing are implied to be about solely copyright material. Many countries have [[fair use]] exceptions that permit limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders. Such documents include commentary, news reporting, research and scholarship. Copyright laws are territorial- they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement. Most countries today are parties to at least one such agreement.

In the area of privacy, recent court rulings seem to indicate that there can be no [[expectation of privacy]] in data exposed over peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  In a 39-page ruling released November 8, 2013, US District Court Judge [[Christina Reiss]] denied the motion to suppress evidence gathered by authorities without a search warrant through an automated peer-to-peer search tool.&lt;ref&gt;ComputerWorld.[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243970/Don_t_expect_data_on_P2P_networks_to_be_private_judge_rules] " Don't expect data on P2P networks to be private, judge rules".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edwin forrest house01.jpg|thumb|[[Edwin Forrest House]], formerly the home of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.]]

'''Philadelphia School of Design for Women''' (1848&amp;ndash;1932) was an art school for women in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under the directorship of [[Emily Sartain]] (1886&amp;ndash;1920), it became the largest art school for women in the United States, and its faculty included [[Robert Henri]], [[Samuel Murray]] and [[Daniel Garber]]. In 1932, it merged into what is now the [[Moore College of Art and Design]]. 

==History==
[[Sarah Peter|Sarah Worthington King Peter]], wife of the British consul in Philadelphia, established an industrial arts school in her home in 1848 to teach women without a means of supporting themselves a trade. The school taught lithography, wood carving, and design, such as for household items like carpets and wallpaper. Peter's husband died soon after she established the school and she returned to her Cincinnati, Ohio home.&lt;ref name=Tinling /&gt; 

In 1850, Peter wrote to the Franklin Institute about her drawing class of some 20 young women becoming a "co-operative, but separate branch" of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Cresson bio"&gt;{{ citation | publisher=The Franklin Institute | title=Donors of the Medals and their histories | work=The Elliott Cresson Medal - Founded in 1848 - Gold Medal | url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/bell/cresson_bio.pdf | accessdate=July 13, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528060054/http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/bell/cresson_bio.pdf | archivedate=May 28, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Franklin Institute established and supervised the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1850 to 1853.&lt;ref name="Cresson bio" /&gt; A group of 17 men were designated the incorporators of the school in 1853. [[Elliott Cresson]] was among these 17 directors, and was elected president at the first meeting.&lt;ref name="Cresson bio" /&gt; It was the country's largest art school for women&lt;ref name=Eisenmann /&gt; and its students included [[Emily Sartain]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]], [[Alice Barber Stephens]], [[Elizabeth Shippen Green|Elizabeth Shippen Green,]] [[Annie Traquair Lang]] and [[Alice Neel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Mott, Sharon, Amanda (2008). Moore College of Art &amp; Design. Arcadia Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7385-5659-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tinling /&gt;

Elizabeth Croasdale was the school's principal before [[Emily Sartain]] took the position in 1886. Sartain was the school's leader until 1920.&lt;ref name=Tinling /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinez p. 144"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharine Martinez|author2=Page Talbott|author3=Elizabeth Johns|title=Philadelphia's Cultural Landscape: The Sartain Family Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4phvm-bqDMC&amp;pg=PA144|year=2000|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-791-9|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She implemented life-drawing classes at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alice A.

Sartain created a professional program that was built upon technical and lengthy training and high standards. The women were taught to create works of art based upon three-dimensional and human forms, based upon her training in Paris and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="Martinez p. 139"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharine Martinez|author2=Page Talbott|author3=Elizabeth Johns|title=Philadelphia's Cultural Landscape: The Sartain Family Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4phvm-bqDMC&amp;pg=PA139|year=2000|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-791-9|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was responsible for introducing important faculty members such as [[Robert Henri]], [[Samuel Murray]] and [[Daniel Garber]].&lt;ref name="de Angelia Walls"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nina de Angeli Walls |title=Art, Industry, and Women's Education in Philadelphia |year=2001 |publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey |isbn=0-89789-745-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1892, Robert Henri began teaching at the school. William Innes Homer said, "A born teacher, Henri enjoyed immediate success at the school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=William Innes Homer | title=Robert Henri and his Circle | location=Ithaca | publisher=Cornell University Press |  year=1969 | isbn=0-87817-326-9 | page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina de Angeli Walls wrote,
{{quote|As Sartain's career illustrates, art schools conferred professional status in a cultural field once dominated by men. Women artists used formal schooling to counter the accusation of amateurism frequently leveled at them.

The '''Codex Pray''', '''Pray Codex''' or '''The Hungarian Pray Manuscript''' is a collection of [[medieval]] [[manuscript]]s. In 1813 it was named after [[György Pray]], who discovered it in 1770. It is the first known example of continuous prose text in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The [[Codex]] is kept in the [[National Széchényi Library]] of [[Budapest]]. 

One of the most prominent documents within the Codex (f. 154a) is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]] (Hungarian: Halotti beszéd és könyörgés). It is an old handwritten Hungarian text dating to 1192-1195. Its importance of the Funeral Sermon comes from that it is the oldest surviving [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], text. 

The Codex also features a [[missal]], an [[Easter]] mystery play, songs with [[musical notation]], laws from the time of [[Coloman of Hungary]] and the annals, which list the [[Hungarian kings]]. 

One of the five illustrations within the Codex shows the [[burial of Jesus]]. It is sometimes claimed that the display shows remarkable similarities with the [[Shroud of Turin]]: that Jesus is shown entirely naked with the arms on the [[pelvis]], just like in the body image of the Shroud of Turin; that the thumbs on this image appear to be retracted, with only four fingers visible on each hand, thus matching detail on the Turin Shroud; that the supposed fabric shows a [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] pattern, identical to the weaving pattern of the Shroud of Turin; and that the four tiny circles on the lower image, which appear to form a letter L, "perfectly reproduce four apparent "poker holes" on the Turin Shroud", which likewise appear to form a letter L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/scavone.htm|title= Book Review of "The Turin Shroud: In Whose Image?"|publisher =Shroud.com|author= Daniel C.

Poulle, "Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin, Revue Critique", ''Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique'', 104, 3-4, 2009, pp. 772-773.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of this idea point out, that the item that is sometimes identified as the Shroud is probably a rectangular tombstone as seen on other sacred images. The alleged holes may just be decorative elements, as seen, for example, on the angel's wing. Moreover, the alleged shroud in the Pray codex does not contain any image.&lt;ref&gt;G.M.Rinaldi, "Il Codice Pray", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion'']]

'''''Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion''''' is an 1812 oil painting by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]. It has been called "The most famous of the British romantic works...;"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobs and Paul Stirton, ''The Knopf Traveler's Guides to Art: Great Britain and Ireland'', New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1984; p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first of Martin's characteristically dramatic, grand, grandiose large pictures, and anchored the development of the style for which Martin would become famous. 

The painting shows a human figure climbing in a mountain landscape. The man struggles to surmount a rocky outcrop beside a pool and waterfall; more jagged cliffs and peaks loom in the background, vastly receding.

Martin later stated that he finished the work in a month. And he wrote, "You may easily guess my anxiety when I overheard the men who were to place it in the frame disputing as to which was the top of the picture! Hope almost forsook me, for much depended on this work."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in his Obituary, in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', April 1854, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; (At the time, Martin had left his £2-per-week job as a glass painter in a china factory, and was attempting to establish himself as an independent artist.)

The artist's anxiety was unnecessary; displayed in the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition at [[Somerset House]], the picture was a popular success. It was purchased for fifty [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] by William Manning, a member of the board of governors of the [[Bank of England]]. Reportedly, Manning's "dying son had been moved by its depiction of the slight solitary figure clinging perilously to a ledge."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Murray, ''The Encyclopedia of Romantic Art, 1760&amp;ndash;1850'', New York, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004; p. 976.&lt;/ref&gt;

"What makes the work so remarkable is its persuasive combination of science and fantasy: while the scale seems beyond terrestrial experience, the attention given to geological and meteorological phenomena is that of the knowledgeable observer."&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Boime]], ''Art in the Age of Bonapartism, 1800&amp;ndash;1815'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1990; p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;Critics who accept  the conventions of [[Romanticism]] in art have appreciated Martin's ''Sadak''; those who do not have regarded the picture as lurid or puzzling.

Martin's Romantic style can be seen as influenced by prevailing Promethean zeitgeist. This is the story of Prometheus, the Greek God who betrayed Zeus and stole the secret gift of fire. Eventually this became a popular metaphor to depict in romantic works of art, because romantics were known for employing  the role of nature vs. man in their works.They believed that humans were obsolete to natural world around them. Due to this interpretation, Sadak is drawn to a much smaller scale than the landscape that surrounds him, revealing that he stands no chance against the power of nature. Also, romanticism arose during the industrial revolution, a time when engineers and scientists were exploring nature's secret gifts, analogous to the act of Prometheus stealing the secret gift of fire. Romantics portray the unknown of nature with its unpredictability, intractability and its barbaric capabilities as an opposite of the enlightenment thought. This can be seen in the background of ''Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion'' with an erupting volcano taking place in an other worldly dimension. The idea behind the piece was not to render a precise location and accurate in its depiction, but to express the emotion that was being experienced by the subject. 

Another key factor of Martins style can also be seen as "end of the world" or "apocalyptic". Although, he depicts a grim scene Martin shows a mere chance of hope in the distance. A glimmering stream of light beams in the corner, giving the viewer a sense of aspiration.
 
Sadak is a fictional character in a story in [[James Ridley]]'s ''[[The Tales of the Genii]]'' (two volumes, [[1764 in literature|1764]]); it is a ''faux''-Oriental tale allegedly from a Persian manuscript, but actually the work of Ridley himself.&lt;ref&gt;Murray,  p. 977.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ridley's story, the hero Sadak is sent by his Sultan, Amurath, to find the memory-destroying "waters of oblivion." The Sultan maliciously intends to use the waters on Sadak's wife Kalasrade in a seduction attempt. Sadak endures a range of trials &amp;mdash; a tempest at sea, a plague, evil genii, a subterranean whirlpool &amp;mdash; before he attains his goal. In the end, the Sultan himself falls victim to the water's effect. Amurath dies; Sadak becomes Sultan. Martin's picture portrays Sadak at the climax of his struggle, just before he reaches the waters of oblivion.

(Ridley's tale was popular in its era, and was adapted into a play by [[Thomas John Dibdin]], titled ''Sadak and Kalasrade'', which was staged in [[1797 in literature|1797]].&lt;ref&gt;William Davenport Adams, ''A Dictionary of the Drama'', Vol. 1, Philadelphia, J. P. Lippincott, 1904; p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Bishop (composer)|Henry Bishop]] mounted an operatic version in 1814.)

The picture was reproduced as a steel-plate etching in 1828. The print bore a poem on the same subject, "Sadak the Wanderer," which was attributed by some to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. Modern editors of Shelley are skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, eds., ''The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley'', Vol. 1, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000;  pp. 460-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this and his subsequent paintings, Martin gained a reputation for replicating the effects of stained glass on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Yampolsky, "Transparency Painting: From Myth to Theater," in: ''Tekstura: Russian Essays on Visual Culture,'' Alla Efimova and Lev Manovich, eds., Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He employed a strong "chemical red" hue to express volcanic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolsky, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the painting was known only in a reduced version in the Southampton Art Gallery. The full-size original was discovered in Sweden and acquired by the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Acquisitions at The Saint Louis Art Museum: Supplement," ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 130 No. 1018 (January 1988), pp. 63-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Martin followed ''Sadak'' with ''Adam's First Sight of Eve'' (1813) and ''Clytie'' (1814), both shown at the Royal Academy.

By many, Martin's best work was ''Sadak in the Search of the Waters of Oblivion''

== Discovery ==
The sculpture was discovered on January 24, 1894 at a depth of {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} in the [[peat bog]] of Shigir,&lt;ref name="LS" /&gt; on the eastern slope of the [[Middle Urals]], approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from [[Yekaterinburg]]. Investigations in this area had begun 40 years earlier, after the discovery of a variety of prehistoric objects in an open-air gold mine.

It was extracted in ten parts. Professor D. I. Lobanov combined the main fragments to reconstitute a sculpture 2.8 meters high.&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com" /&gt;

In 1914, archaeologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Vladimir Tolmachev (archaeologist)|ru|3=Толмачёв, Владимир Яковлевич|lt=Vladimir Tolmachev}} proposed a variant of this reconstruction by integrating the unused fragments. His reconstruction suggested that the original height of the statue was 5.3 metres.&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com"&gt;http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/features/is-this-the-worlds-oldest-secret-code/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, some of these fragments were lost, so only Tolmachev's drawings of them remain.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhilin|first=Mikhail|last2=Savchenko|first2=Svetlana|last3=Hansen|first3=Svend|last4=Heussner|first4=Karl-Uwe|last5=Terberger|first5=Thomas|date=2018/04|title=Early art in the Urals: new research on the wooden sculpture from Shigir|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/early-art-in-the-urals-new-research-on-the-wooden-sculpture-from-shigir/1EE151AB1E571968B10267E48B78362A/core-reader|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=92|issue=362|pages=334–350|doi=10.15184/aqy.2018.48|issn=0003-598X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dating ==
The initial [[radiocarbon dating]] carried out by G. I. Zajtseva of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institute of the History for the Material Culture|ru|3=Институт истории материальной культуры РАН}} in [[Saint-Petersburg]], confirmed by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Geological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences|ru|3=Геологический институт РАН|lt=Geological Institute}} of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]], gave an age of around 9,500 years. In the 1990s, when this first radiocarbon dating was carried out, scholars suggested that the dating was incorrect, because they believed that the [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherers]] who inhabited the area 9,500 years ago would have been incapable of crafting and decorating such a massive object.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/20/shigur-idol-shatters-expert-views-birth-of-ritual-art-hunter-gatherers|title=Carved idol from the Urals shatters expert views on birth of ritual art|last=McKie|first=Robin|date=2018-05-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A later German analysis gave an age of 11,500 years.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is the most ancient wooden sculpture of its kind known in the world. Typically, wood degrades in most environments and does not endure for archaeological discovery so readily as other materials such as stone and metal. A decorated [[antler]] was found near the Shigir Idol and dated to the same period, giving credence to the estimated age of 11,500 years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

== Description ==
[[File:Shigir idol.jpg|thumbnail|Some of the lower faces on the sculpture are visible in this image]]
The sculpture is carved from [[larch]]. As identified from the annual rings, the tree was at least 159 years old. Stone tools were used for carving the markings. The top portion is a head with a face with eyes, nose, and mouth. The body is flat and rectangular. Geometrical motifs decorate its surface, including zigzag lines and depictions of human faces and hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Horizontal lines at the level of the thorax may represent ribs, and lines broken in chevrons cover the rest of what often is described as the body,&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/features/n0379-revelations-on-shigir-idol-change-our-understanding-of-ancient-civilisations/ |title=Revelations on Shigir Idol 'change our understanding of ancient civilisations' |last=Liesowska |first=Anna |publisher=The Siberian Times |date=2015-08-28 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, along with the face at the top, several faces are visible at various points along the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shigir-idol_55e3e761e4b0aec9f353b08d&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement resembles a [[totem pole]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/11000-year-old-statue-unearthed-siberia-may-reveal-ancient-views-taboos-and-demons|title=This 11,000-year-old statue unearthed in Siberia may reveal ancient views of taboos and demons|date=2018-04-24|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have proposed various theories about the carvings' meaning. Svetlana Savchenko, a researcher at the Sverdlovsk Regional Museum, suggested that the decoration tells the [[creation myth]] those who carved it believed in.&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com" /&gt; Other researchers at the museum have suggested that the markings could have served as a navigational aid or map.&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com" /&gt; Professor Mikhail Zhilin, an archaeologist at the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow, guessed that the statue could depict mythological creatures such as forest spirits.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/04/28/shigir-idol-could-be-oldest-piece-of-monumental-art-study/|title=Shigir Idol could be oldest piece of monumental art: study|date=2018-04-28|work=Salon|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologist Peter Vang Peterson, of the [[National Museum of Denmark]], speculated that the idol could serve as a warning not to enter a dangerous area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Scholars noted that the Shigir Idol's decoration was similar to that of the oldest known monumental stone ruins, at [[Göbekli Tepe|Gobekli Tepe]] in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The ornamentation on the sculpture was carved using three different sizes of chisels. In addition, following his 2014 examination of the sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.livescience.com/62404-shigir-idol-age-and-new-face.html&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Zhilin discovered another face in the sculpture and asserted that the faces were carved last of all, using tools made from the lower jaw bones of a beaver, with sharpened incisor teeth. A beaver jaw tool from the same period was found at the Beregovaya 2 site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Beaver's teeth 'used to carve the oldest wooden statue in the world' | url=http://siberiantimes.com/science/others/news/beavers-teeth-used-to-carve-the-oldest-wooden-statue-in-the-world/ | publisher=The Siberian Times | date=15 June 2017 | accessdate=16 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery upended scholars' views on when humans began making ritual art, as opposed to the kind of realistic art seen in the [[Lascaux Caves|Lascaux caves]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Scientists had previously believed that complex art comparable to the Shigir Idol began in sedentary farming populations in the Middle East around 8,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Preservation ==

Professor Zhilin stated that the sculpture was made from the [[phytoncidic]] larch, then preserved in turf, a bog, that had an acid anaerobic environment, which kills microorganisms and also has a tanning effect.&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com"/&gt; Scientists suspect that many more statues like the Shigir Idol existed, but that they did not benefit from the same unusual conditions and therefore were not preserved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{distinguish|Signal (magazine)|AFCEA#SIGNAL Magazine}}

'''Magazine ''Signal''''' with the subtitle "International Review of Signalist Research" was the periodical of [[Signalism]], international [[avant-garde]] creative movement. The magazine was founded in 1970 in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;Šram Godehard, [http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/12887 „Signal – internacionalna revija za signalistička istraživanja“], in: ''Signalizam u svetu'', Belgrade, 1984, pp. 14-15 (originally published in 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Founder and editor-in-chief was [[Miroljub Todorović]].

The movement was significantly boosted by the magazine, publishing multilingual works of neo avant-garde poets, fiction writers, essayists and visual artists from Europe, North and South America, Japan and Australia.

Nine issues of ''Signal'' appeared between 1970 and 1973,&lt;ref&gt;No. 1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world. From 1973 until 1995 magazine could not be published, mainly for financial reasons. 

From 1995 to 2004 another 21 issues of ''Signal'' appeared.&lt;ref&gt;No. 10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16-17, 18, 19-20, 21, 22-23-24, 25-26-27 and 28-29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The new release of ''Signal'' revitalized the Signalist movement and brought numerous young artists into the movement in 21st century.

'''Spontaneous symmetry breaking''' is a [[spontaneous process]] of [[symmetry breaking]], by which a physical system in a [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] state ends up in an asymmetric state.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir A. Miransky, ''Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Field Theories''. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=UOpY9kmL3YQC&amp;pg=PA15 15].  {{ISBN|9810215584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of Symmetry Breaking. Edited by Henryk Arodz, Jacek Dziarmaga, Wojciech Hubert Zurek. Pg  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uF1P7cFFsNMC&amp;pg=PA141 141].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bubbles, Voids and Bumps in Time: The New Cosmology. Edited by James Cornell. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=vRIs8mY1yZcC&amp;pg=PA125 125].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it can describe systems where the [[equations of motion]] or the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy [[vacuum solution]]s do not exhibit that same [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry.

==Overview==

In [[explicit symmetry breaking]], if we consider two outcomes, the probability of a pair of outcomes can be different.  By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of a symmetric probability distribution—any pair of outcomes has the same probability.  In other words, the underlying laws{{clarify|date=December 2016}} are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under a [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] transformation.

The system, as a whole{{clarify|date=December 2016}}, changes under such transformations.

Phases of matter, such as crystals, magnets, and conventional superconductors, as well as simple phase transitions can be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Notable exceptions include topological phases of matter like the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].

==Examples==

===Mexican hat potential===
[[Image:Mexican hat potential polar.svg|270px|thumb|Graph of Goldstone's "Mexican hat" potential function &lt;math&gt;V(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Consider a symmetric upward dome with a trough circling the bottom. If a ball is put at the very peak of the dome, the system is symmetric with respect to a rotation around the center axis.  But the ball may ''spontaneously break'' this symmetry by rolling down the dome into the trough, a point of lowest energy. Afterward, the ball has come to a rest at some fixed point on the perimeter.  The dome and the ball retain their individual symmetry, but the system does not.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald M. Edelman, Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind (New York: BasicBooks, 1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGIIGZmarOAC&amp;pg=PA203 203].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest idealized relativistic model, the spontaneously broken symmetry is summarized through an illustrative [[scalar field theory]]. The relevant [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which essentially dictates how a system behaves, can be split up into kinetic and potential terms,
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - V(\phi).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

It is in this potential term &lt;math&gt;V(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; that the symmetry breaking is triggered. An example of a potential, due to [[Jeffrey Goldstone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goldstone | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1007/BF02812722 | title = Field theories with " Superconductor " solutions | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 19 | pages = 154–164 | year = 1961 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1961NCim...19..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt; is illustrated in the graph at the right.
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V(\phi) = -10|\phi|^2 + |\phi|^4 \,&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This potential has an infinite number of possible [[minimum|minima]] (vacuum states) given by
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\phi = \sqrt{5} e^{i\theta} &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
for any real ''θ'' between 0 and 2''π''. The system also has an unstable vacuum state corresponding to {{nowrap|1=''Φ'' = 0}}. This state has a [[Unitary group|U(1)]] symmetry. However, once the system falls into a specific stable vacuum state (amounting to a choice of ''θ''), this symmetry will appear to be lost, or "spontaneously broken".

In fact, any other choice of ''θ'' would have exactly the same energy, implying the existence of a massless [[Goldstone boson|Nambu–Goldstone boson]], the mode running around the circle at the minimum of this potential, and indicating there is some memory of the original symmetry in the Lagrangian.

===Other examples===
* For [[ferromagnet]]ic materials, the underlying laws are invariant under spatial rotations. Here, the order parameter is the [[magnetization]], which measures the magnetic dipole density. Above the [[Curie temperature]], the order parameter is zero, which is spatially invariant, and there is no symmetry breaking. Below the Curie temperature, however, the magnetization acquires a constant nonvanishing value, which points in a certain direction (in the idealized situation where we have full equilibrium; otherwise, translational symmetry gets broken as well). The residual rotational symmetries which leave the orientation of this vector invariant remain unbroken, unlike the other rotations which do not and are thus spontaneously broken.
* The laws describing a solid are invariant under the full [[Euclidean group]], but the solid itself spontaneously breaks this group down to a [[space group]]. The displacement and the orientation are the order parameters.
* General relativity has a Lorentz symmetry, but in [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FRW cosmological models]], the mean 4-velocity field defined by averaging over the velocities of the galaxies (the galaxies act like gas particles at cosmological scales) acts as an order parameter breaking this symmetry. Similar comments can be made about the cosmic microwave background.
* For the [[electroweak]] model, as explained earlier, a component of the Higgs field provides the order parameter breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Like the ferromagnetic example, there is a phase transition at the electroweak temperature. The same comment about us not tending to notice broken symmetries suggests why it took so long for us to discover electroweak unification.
* In superconductors, there is a condensed-matter collective field ψ, which acts as the order parameter breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.
* Take a thin cylindrical plastic rod and push both ends together. Before buckling, the system is symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations in the direction of the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite [[Goldstone boson|Nambu–Goldstone boson]].
* Consider a uniform layer of [[fluid]] over an infinite horizontal plane. This system has all the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. But now heat the bottom surface uniformly so that it becomes much hotter than the upper surface. When the temperature gradient becomes large enough, [[convection cell]]s will form, breaking the Euclidean symmetry.
* Consider a bead on a circular hoop that is rotated about a vertical [[diameter]]. As the [[rotational velocity]] is increased gradually from rest, the bead will initially stay at its initial [[equilibrium point]] at the bottom of the hoop (intuitively stable, lowest [[gravitational potential]]). At a certain critical rotational velocity, this point will become unstable and the bead will jump to one of two other newly created equilibria, [[equidistant]] from the center. Initially, the system is symmetric with respect to the diameter, yet after passing the critical velocity, the bead ends up in one of the two new equilibrium points, thus breaking the symmetry.

==Spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics==
[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking (explanatory diagram).png|thumb|right|250px|''Spontaneous symmetry breaking illustrated'': At high energy levels (''left'') the ball settles in the center, and the result is symmetric. At lower energy levels (''right''), the overall "rules" remain symmetric, but the symmetric  "[[sombrero|Mexican hat]]" enforces an asymmetric outcome, since eventually the ball must rest at some random spot on the bottom, "spontaneously", and not all others.]]

===Particle physics===
In [[particle physics]] the [[force carrier]] particles are normally specified by field equations with [[gauge symmetry]]; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A ''by the same amount''. The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions.

An actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. "Hidden" is a better term than "broken", because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called [[Spontaneous magnetization|''spontaneous'']] symmetry breaking (SSB) because ''nothing'' (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations.&lt;ref name="Weinberg2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Weinberg|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rsg3PE_9_ccC|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78786-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194–195}}

====Chiral symmetry====
{{Main article|Chiral symmetry breaking}}
Chiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the [[chiral symmetry]] of the [[strong interactions]] in particle physics. It is a property of [[quantum chromodynamics]], the [[quantum field theory]] describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the [[nucleons]], and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound [[quarks]] into 100 times heavier constituents of [[baryons]]. The approximate [[Nambu–Goldstone boson]]s in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the [[pions]], whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking.

====Higgs mechanism====
{{Main article|Higgs mechanism|Yukawa interaction}}

The strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]. The [[Higgs mechanism]], the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the [[superconductivity]] of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and ''gauge symmetries'', is that the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry does not give rise to characteristic massless Nambu–Goldstone physical modes, but only massive modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics.

In the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the {{nowrap|SU(2) × U(1)}} gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The [[W and Z bosons]] are the elementary particles that mediate the [[weak interaction]], while the [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. At energies much greater than 100 GeV all these particles behave in a similar manner. The [[Unified field theory#Modern progress|Weinberg–Salam theory]] predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking, Bantam; 10th anniversary edition (September 1, 1998). pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, fermions develop mass consistently.

Without spontaneous symmetry breaking, the [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the [[W and Z bosons]]) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the [[Higgs mechanism]] to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the [[Higgs boson]], detected in 2012.

[[Superconductivity]] of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism.

===Condensed matter physics===
Most phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking [[rotational symmetry]]. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids and many others.

There are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter like [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall liquids]], and [[Quantum spin liquid|spin-liquids]]. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states.&lt;ref name=chen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys. Rev. B | volume = 82 | issue = | page = 155138 | doi=10.1103/physrevb.82.155138|arxiv = 1004.3835 |bibcode = 2010PhRvB..82o5138C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continuous symmetry====
The ferromagnet is the canonical system which spontaneously breaks the continuous symmetry of the spins below the [[Curie temperature]] and at {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 0}}, where ''h'' is the external magnetic field. Below the [[Curie temperature]] the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization ''m''('''x''') such that {{nowrap|1=''m''('''x''') = −''m''(−'''x''')}}. The symmetry is spontaneously broken as {{nowrap|''h'' → 0}} when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant.

Spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization.

Spontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with slow long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal's atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry-breaking  states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu–Goldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity.

An important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu–Goldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one-dimensional systems even at zero temperature (an important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations).

Other long-range interacting systems such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the [[Coulomb potential]] or [[Yukawa potential]] has been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

===Dynamical symmetry breaking===
Dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description ([[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]).

Dynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, that happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e. at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e. at the level of the [[effective action]]).

Dynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry {{ref|note1}} is subtler. In the conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists  an unstable [[Higgs particle]] in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (see e.g. [[Electroweak interaction]]). In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates  in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper which attempts to replace the conventional [[Higgs mechanism]] in the [[standard model]], by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks (such models, where a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as "Composite Higgs models").&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a [[fermionic condensate]]; for example the [[quark condensate]], which is connected to the [[Chiral symmetry breaking|dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Conventional [[superconductivity]] is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.

==Generalisation and technical usage==
For spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed "hidden symmetry", and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the [[Nambu–Goldstone boson|Goldstone boson]].)

When a theory is symmetric with respect to a [[symmetry group]], but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate ''which'' member is distinct, only that ''one is''. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.

The crucial concept in physics theories is the [[order parameter]]. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a [[vacuum expectation value|''vacuum'' expectation value]]) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the [[ordered phase]], and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a "frame of reference" to be measured against. In that case, the [[vacuum state]] does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized  '''Wigner mode''' in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) '''Nambu–Goldstone mode'''. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless [[Goldstone boson]]s arise.

The symmetry group can be discrete, such as the [[space group]] of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a [[Lie group]]), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a [[vacuum state]] of the full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry.

==Nobel Prize==
On October 7, 2008, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awarded the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. [[Yoichiro Nambu]], of the [[University of Chicago]], won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically [[chiral symmetry breaking]]. Physicists [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] and [[Toshihide Maskawa]], of [[Kyoto University]], shared the other half of the prize for discovering the origin of the [[Explicit symmetry breaking|explicit breaking]] of CP symmetry in the weak interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Nobel Foundation|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2008|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/index.html|work=nobelprize.org|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This origin is ultimately reliant on the Higgs mechanism, but, so far understood as a "just so" feature of Higgs couplings, not a spontaneously broken symmetry phenomenon.

'''St Vigeans Sculptured Stones Museum''', located in the [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] village of [[St Vigeans]], houses an outstanding collection of [[Pict]]ish [[Pictish stones|carved stones]]. St Vigeans, close to [[Arbroath]], was the centre of a royal estate in the Early Middle Ages, and was of religious importance as a monastery founded in the 8th century. The present-day [[St Vigeans Church]] was built in the 12th century, on a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} mound. 

The museum displays 38 carved stones which formerly stood upon the old church mound. Among the stones on display is the 9th-century [[Drosten Stone]], a flat rectangular slab with a cross carved on one side and Pictish symbols on the other, and also bearing a [[Pictish language|Pictish]] inscription in [[Latin script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | first = Thomas Owen   | last = Clancy  | title = The Drosten Stone: a new reading  | journal = Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland  | volume = 123  | year = 1993  | pages = 345&amp;ndash;353  | url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_123/123_345_353.pdf  | accessdate = 7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is managed by [[Historic Scotland]] and is housed in two adjoining sandstone cottages close to the church.

'''Thomas Couture''' (21 December 1815 &amp;ndash; 30 March 1879) was a French [[history painting|history painter]] and teacher. He taught such later luminaries of the art world as [[Édouard Manet]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[John La Farge]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Burke. ''The Life and Works of Augustus Saint-Gaudens'', Dover Publications, Inc., New York. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Karel Javůrek]], and [[Joseph-Noël Sylvestre|J-N Sylvestre]].

==Life==
'''Early life and education'''&lt;/br&gt;
Couture was born at [[Senlis, Oise]], France.  When he was 11 his family moved to Paris, where he would study at the industrial arts school ([[École des Arts et Métiers]]) and later at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. 

'''Art and teaching career'''&lt;/br&gt;
He failed the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]] competition at the École six times, but he felt the problem was with the École, not himself. Couture finally did win the prize in 1837.

In 1840 he began exhibiting historical and genre pictures at the [[Paris Salon]], earning several medals for his works, in particular for his masterpiece,  ''Romans During the Decadence'' (1847). Shortly after this success, Couture opened an independent atelier meant to challenge the École des Beaux-Arts by turning out the best new history painters.

Couture's innovative technique gained much attention, and he received Government and Church commissions for murals during the late 1840s through the 1850s. He never completed the first two commissions, and the third met with mixed criticism. Upset by the unfavorable reception of his murals, in 1860 he left Paris, for a time returning to his hometown of Senlis, where he continued to teach young artists who came to him. In 1867 he thumbed his nose at the academic establishment by publishing a book on his own ideas and working methods called ''Méthode et entretiens d'atelier'' (''Method and Workshop Interviews''). It was also translated to ''Conversations on Art Methods'' in 1879, the year he died.

Asked by a publisher to write an autobiography, Couture responded: "Biography is the exaltation of personality—and personality is the scourge of our time." 

'''Death'''&lt;/br&gt;
In 1879 he died at [[Villiers-le-Bel]], Val-d'Oise, and was interred in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris.

'''Victoria Mahoney''' is an American filmmaker and actress best known for her debut feature ''[[Yelling to the Sky]]''.

==Career==

===Acting career===

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s Mahoney worked as an actress appearing in small roles in the TV show ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and the movie ''[[Legally Blonde]]''.

In 1992 she starred as "Antinea" in the French film ''[[L'Atlantide (1992 film)|L'Atlantide]]'', based on the French novel "[[Atlantida (novel)|Atlantida]]" by [[Pierre Benoit (novelist)|Pierre Benoit]].

Her most recent appearance in front of the camera was a brief cameo in [[Ava DuVernay]]'s short film ''Say Yes'' in 2013.

===Directing career===

Mahoney made her directing debut in 2011 with the semi-autobiographical film ''[[Yelling to the Sky]]''. When Mahoney was 21 she developed “Yelling to the Sky” which is an American drama feature film that was released in 2011. The film follows a young girl’s struggle in high school and her difficult home life. The film, which starred [[Zoe Kravitz]] as a troubled teen and [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]] as her abusive alcoholic father, debuted in competition at the [[61st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_7188.html |title=Berlinale 2011: First Competition Films |accessdate=2011-01-03|work=Berlinale}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed the script through the help of the Directors and Screenwriters Sundance Institute Labs and was awarded the title of Auerbach Screenwriting Fellow, Annerberg Film Fellow, Cinereach Fellow, Maryland Fellow, IFP Narrative Lab fellow and a Tribeca Film Fellow. The film was written and directed by Victoria Mahoney. The film received credit from the 61st Berlin International Film Festival and the Golden Bear. Victoria was the first woman director/writer, American invited in over sixty years to the Golden Bear competition. Variety praised the film saying it had a strong directional voice and stated that Mahoney had a clear driven and genuine creative gift.  Victoria entered the film into multiple film festivals across the world before releasing theatrically in late 2012.

In an interview with the Tribeca Film Institute, Mahoney reveals what she wants people to take away from her films saying, “The level of ‘take away’ exists on such a case by case basis. It all depends on what an audience member is experiencing and investigating in their own life. My overriding intentions as a filmmaker, is to tap into individual inquiries and reflect-whatever is hidden. Inspiring an audience’s need for further inquiry into whatever stories, wishes, wants, hungers, desires, questions or aches-presently propel them. From my filmmaking, I’d love audiences to receive some measure of inspiration; to investigate the human condition.” Mahoney followed ''[[Yelling to the Sky]]'' with the short film ''[[Wracked (film)|Wracked]]'', starring [[Noah Mills]], in 2012. The film premiered during the Golden Egg Film Festival in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://ny-offers.timeout.com/deals/052013-geff-golden-egg-festival&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 she was nominated for the inaugural Tribeca Film Institute's Heineken Affinity Award's $20,000 prize, but lost to her friend and colleague [[Ava DuVernay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://affinity.strutta.com/entry/1205773&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013 she directed a short film starring [[Selena Gomez]] and [[Shiloh Fernandez]] for [[Flaunt]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzZOInRU4ng&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future projects==

As of 2012 Mahoney was working on her second feature, a film entitled ''[[Chalk Rx]]''. The film went into development in early 2015 with a cast that included [[Iddo Goldberg]], [[Shiloh Fernandez]] and [[Mirrah Foulkes]]. Mahoney’s next film that she developed was a big budget feature called Chalk RX. The cast consisted of Mirrah Foulkes and a handful of new unknown actors. The film interprets a depiction of the youth involved in street life and violence. The film is planned to premier at Sundance in May 2016.

Mahoney has been named as the Second Unit Director for Star Wars Episode 9.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/VictoriaMahoney/status/986380690714341376&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vincent Scully Prize''' was established in 1999 to recognize exemplary practice, scholarship or criticism in architecture, historic preservation and urban design. Created by the [[National Building Museum]] in Washington, D.C., the award first honored the distinguished Yale professor and namesake of the award, author and educator, [[Vincent Scully]].&lt;br&gt;
The Museum’s website states that the Prize is awarded annually, however no award was made in 2003, 2004, 2015 or 2016. These omissions are not explained on the website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbm.org/about/awards/ “National Building Museum – Awards”] Retrieved 8 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 2014 Prize was presented to former talk show host [[Charlie Rose]]. The Museum website no longer lists Rose as a winner of the Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbm.org/about/awards/ “National Building Museum – Awards”] Retrieved 8 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The National Building Museum awards two other annual prizes: the [[Honor Award]] for individuals and organizations who have made important contributions to the U.S.'s building heritage, and the [[Henry C. Turner Prize]] for Innovation in Construction Technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30627">'''Visual arts of Chicago''' refers to [[paintings]], [[printmaking|prints]], [[illustrations]], [[Textile arts|textile art]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]] and other visual artworks produced in Chicago or by people with a connection to Chicago. Since [[World War II]], Chicago visual art has had a strong individualistic streak, little influenced by outside fashions. "One of the unique characteristics of Chicago," said [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] curator Bob Cozzolino, "is there's always been a very pronounced effort to not be derivative, to not follow the status quo."&lt;ref name=Loviglio&gt;Joann Loviglio, "Chicago Art Stars in Philly Exhibition", [[Chicago Sun-Times]], Wednesday, February 22, 2006, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago art world has been described as having "a stubborn sense ... of tolerant pluralism."&lt;ref name=Thodos&gt;Diane Thodos, "Self-Portraits 2000", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', May–June 2001, Vol. 28, no. 8-9, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chicago's art scene is "critically neglected."&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;Richard Vine, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_/ai_19385182 Where the Wild Things Were]", ''[[Art in America]]'', May 1997, pp. 98-111 {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Andrew Patner has said, "Chicago's commitment to figurative painting, dating back to the post-War period, has often put it at odds with New York critics and dealers."&lt;ref name=Patner&gt;Andrew Patner, "Chicago: Special Report: Contemporary Art", ''[[Art and Antiques Magazine]]'', Summer 1996, p. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that Chicago art is rarely found in Chicago museums; some of the most remarkable Chicago artworks are found in other cities (such as the brilliantly warped epic drawings of [[Henry Darger]] at the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in [[New York City]], or [[Carlos Cortez|Carlos Cortez']] collection of early twentieth-century Chicago "Wobbly" ([[Industrial Workers of the World]]) woodcut prints, now in the [http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/taxonomy/term/12 Walter P. Reuther Library] at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]]).&lt;ref name=Sherlock&gt;Maureen P. Sherlock, "Missing/Inaction: 'Art in Chicago, 1945-95'", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', February 1997, Volume 24, no. 5, pp. 23-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days: before the War==
[[File:Davies-Elysian Fields, undated oil on canvas painting, The Phillips Collection (Washington, D. C.).jpg|thumb|right|Arthur B. Davies, ''Elysian Fields,'' undated, oil on canvas, [[The Phillips Collection]] (Washington, D. C.)]]

The [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] was founded in 1879, from the remains of an earlier school founded in 1866 (thus the school predates the museum of the same name).&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Marzio, "A Museum and a School: An Uneasy But Creative Union", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1979, Vol. VIII, number 1, pp. 20-23; 44-52&lt;/ref&gt; Early students and faculty were conservative and derivative in their tastes, imitating popular European models. [[Arthur B. Davies]], a former SAIC student and one of "[[Ashcan School|the Eight]]" was considered a disappointment for being a member of a radical group of urban modernists. In 1913, SAIC students held a protest with costumes and bonfires against the Chicago showing of the [[Armory Show]], a collection of the best new modern art; the newspapers described the students' activity as a riot.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;Andrew Martinez, "A Mixed Reception for Modernism: The 1913 Armory Show at the Art Institute of Chicago", The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 19, no. 1, 1993, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a year later the African-American [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] [[Archibald Motley|Archibald J. Motley]], graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; he kept his modern, jazz-influenced paintings secret for some years after.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine D. Woodall, "Looking Backward: Archibald J. Motley and the Art Institute of Chicago: 1914-1930", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1979, Vol. VIII, number 1, pp. 53-57&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the Art Institute of Chicago regularly held annual exhibits of local artists,&lt;ref name=Martinez/&gt; but these ended decades ago. [[Mary Agnes Yerkes]], (1886–1989), was an American Impressionist painter and one such exhibitor at AIC from 1912-1915. Born in Oak Park, she studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, where she also taught, and the at the currently named School of the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Miss Yerkes' Exhibit|newspaper= Oak Leaves|date= October 23, 1915| pages = 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is noted for her plein-air painting while camping the American West and its National Parks.

==Interbellum: Chicago arts between the World Wars==
The time period between the World Wars witnessed an outpouring of artistic creativity in Chicago, led by artists of the calibre of  [[Stanislav Szukalski]], [[Todros Geller]]&lt;ref name="occgeller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakton.edu/museum/Geller.html|title=Todros Geller (1889-1949)|publisher=Oakton Community College|accessdate=21 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322160221/http://www.oakton.edu/museum/Geller.html|archive-date=22 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albin Polasek]].

The Chicago art scene was not strictly an all-boys club however; [[Sr. Maria Stanisia]] was able to overcome the patriarchal attitudes both within early twentieth century [[Chicago]] and the hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to become acclaimed as one of the greatest painters in the field of [[religious art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040428164700/http://stmargaretofscotland.com/stations.htm Stations of Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Women Artists|woman artist]] [[Gertrude Abercrombie]] who like Stanisia attended the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], sold her [[surrealist]] paintings in art fairs that took place near the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Lynne, ''Art in Chicago 1945-1995'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-500-23728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940s==
Early evidence of Chicago's unique style came with [[Ivan Albright]], with his "excruciatingly detailed surfaces depicting things in states of decay."&lt;ref name=Holg&gt;Garret Holg, "Art of the City: The Imagists -- and Beyond" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Sunday, March 22, 1998, Section B, pp. 1, 14&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eldzier Cortor]] documented African-American life for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Vera Berdich]], an influential [[surrealist]] printmaker, taught many future [[Chicago Imagists]] at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

==1950s: individuality, realism, surrealism==
[[Claes Oldenburg]] was born in Sweden and only spent a few years in the 1950s in Chicago, but he sold his first works here, 5 pieces at the [[57th Street Art Fair]] for $25.&lt;ref&gt;David McCracken, "The Art Fair That's Been In the Picture the Longest", [[Chicago Tribune]], June 5th, 1987, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-War art in Chicago was more figurative and less abstract than the [[New York City|New York]] fashion dictated, and was largely ignored by New York dealers and critics.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;  Chicago artists rejected the abstract aesthetics of New York [[modernists]], preferring strong surrealism, "following their own vision,"&lt;ref name=Loviglio/&gt; and "savage political satire."&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;

==1960s==

[[Claire Zeisler]], a fiber artist, switched from weaving to large, free-standing fiber sculptures which "redefined the art form".&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

===The Chicago Imagists===
In the late 1960s, a group of former students of the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], many of whom had been mentored by teacher-artist [[Ray Yoshida]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry Finley, "Influential Figure in Chicago Art World: Teacher, Mentor to Artists in Imagism School of 1970s", [[Chicago Sun-Times]], Monday, January 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; organized a series of exhibits at the [[Hyde Park Art Center]].  Their art was notable for its surrealism and cartoon-influenced grotesques.

Strictly speaking, they were three different groups:  The earliest was the "Monster Roster", which included [[Cosmo Campoli]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Nancy Spero]], and [[Karl Wirsum]]; then the "Hairy Who", which included [[Art Green (artist)|Art Green]], [[Gladys Nilsson]], and [[Jim Nutt]]; and finally the [[Chicago Imagists]], which included [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Ed Paschke]], and [[Barbara Rossi (artist)|Barbara Rossi]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

According to Imagist [[Ed Paschke]], the Imagists felt liberated by a lack of critical coverage.  "There was a sense that no one much cared what we did here.  We weren't going to get a whole lot of national attention.  We could do what we wanted to do."&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;  After Paschke's death, in 2004, a New York critic infamously said that Paschke's "contribution to the art of his time was somewhat obscured by his distance from New York."&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Smith, "Ed Paschke, Painter, 65, Dies; Pop Artist With Dark Vision", New York Times, December 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  At that same time, Chicago artists Tony Fitzpatrick and Wesley Kimler and art consultant Paul Klein stirred outrage when they reported that not a single Chicago museum had any of Paschke's work on display (a claim that was later disputed).&lt;ref name=Foumberg&gt;Jason Foumberg, "Art in Chicago 2000-2009: At Zeroes End", [[Newcity]], December 3, 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the Chicago Imagists were given recognition in a show at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Imagist Art'', Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Illinois 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Chicago Surrealist Group===
Under the leadership of [[Penelope Rosemont|Penelope]] and [[Franklin Rosemont]], the [[Chicago Surrealist Group]] came together with both artistic and political ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jack J.|last=Spector|title=Surrealist Art and Writing, 1919-1939: The Gold of Time|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-55311-3|year=1997|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the group played a major role in organizing the World Surrealist Exhibition at the [[Gallery Black Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.corpse.org/issue_10/critiques/postel.html |title="Women and the Surrealist Revolution: an interview with Penelope Rosemont" by Danny Postel, in 'Exquisite Corpse: A Journal of Letters and Life' |access-date=2014-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020620/http://www.corpse.org/issue_10/critiques/postel.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==

Chicago produced several [[Photorealism|photorealists]], including [[Arne Besser]], and [[Richard Estes]].  Many photorealists were collected by Morton Neumann "against the grain of the prevailing critical thought at the time" (which espoused abstract expressionism),  and exhibited at Chicago's [[Terra Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;"American Super Realism from the Morton G. Neumann Family Collection", Terra Museum of American Art, Evanston, Illinois 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago artists internationally==

Over the last few decades, many contemporary Chicago artists have become internationally successful. A persistent problem for the development of art scenes in Chicago has been the fact that, in the past, a large number of artists began in Chicago, but had to relocate elsewhere before gaining attention. [[Curator]] Robert Cozzolino sees this positively, stating that we must "recognize a powerful Chicago diaspora." Such artists include [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cozzolino, "Post:Correcting the Chicago Record", ''artblog'', February 3, 2006, http://fallonandrosof.blogspot.com/2006/02/correcting-chicago-record.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no overarching theme or style characterizes Chicago's contemporary art, many contemporary critics contend that institutional support has favored Neo-Conceptual work almost to exclusion. Chicago art is nevertheless diverse and pluralistic, as is art in general. Contemporary Chicago artists continue to explore personal styles.  Although abstraction has never been as strong in Chicago as in New York, there are noteworthy Chicago abstract artists, such as [[William Conger]], who paints brightly colored, sprightly designs, and [[Rodney Carswell]], whose work is more formal and cooler; and conceptual artists such as photographer [[Jeanne Dunning]] and installation artist [[Kay Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Holg, "City Focus Chicago: Industrious Evolution", ''[[ARTnews]]'', April 1998, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's other notable contemporary artists are too numerous to name; but a few who would make any list are [[Kerry James Marshall]], [[Dan Peterman]], [[Gregg Bordowitz]], [[Julia Fish]], [[Wesley Kimler]], [[Tony Fitzpatrick (artist)|Tony Fitzpatrick]] and [[Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle]].



===Painters===
[[Robert Guinan]] paints psychologically penetrating portraits of bar patrons and jazz musicians which are very popular in France, but he is almost unknown in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;John Golden, "Hunting Guinan: An Artist Renowned in France Finds Fame Elusive in His Native Land", [[New York Times]], Sunday, March 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Hogin continues the grotesque Chicago tradition with lush, Dutch-style portraits of cartoonishly savage animals.&lt;ref&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Hogin's Horrors: How a Gifted Representational Painter Became an Angry Philosopher-Activist", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Friday, February 28, 1997, Section 7, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellen Lanyon's paintings show "fairy-tale gentleness and antiquarian whimsy."&lt;ref name=Artner&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Grabner Homes in on Subject Matter: Lanyon Exhibit Combines the Past with the Present, While Lowly Mixes Figures with Landscapes", [[Chicago Tribune]], Thursday, May 27, 1999, section 5, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Riva Lehrer, herself disabled, paints intense, sympathetic, surreal portraits of disabled persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcritical.com/thodos/DTLehrer.htm Diane Thodos reviews Riva Lehrer at the Chicago Cultural Center, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Loving paints luminous, spiritual abstractions.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Tim Lowly]], who has mastered the difficult medium of [[egg tempera]], paints heartbreaking spiritual pictures of seemingly ill children.&lt;ref name=Artner/&gt;  [[Audrey Niffenegger]]  paints beautifully weird surreal images and writes acclaimed fiction as well.&lt;ref name=Thodos/&gt;  Frank Piatek paints not-quite-abstracts of giant, writhing tube-forms.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  Judith Raphael paints pugnacious little girls posed like classical artworks.&lt;ref name=Thodos/&gt;  [[Patrick Skoff]] leaves his paintings in public places for people to find and keep.&lt;ref name="New City"&gt;New City Chicago Magazine - http://art.newcity.com/2009/07/28/on-the-hunt-patrick-skoff-wants-you-to-take-his-paintings/ 28 July 2009, "On The Hunt: Patrick Skoff Wants You to Take His Paintings"&lt;/ref&gt;[[Matt Lamb]], a self-taught artist, creates luminous expressionist paintings with bold uses of color, whimsical figures and symbols, and unlikely combinations of mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Richard.

John F. Miller taught for a few decades at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|SAIC]] and, during the bulk of that period, produced paintings and some drawings in an abstract style. Since the late 1990s, Miller has produced most of his work using compters and graphics software.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Nance, "The Outsider With Loads of Talent, Rivaled Only by His Ego", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 29 January 2006.

===Sculptors, textile art===
[[Cat Chow]] constructs dresses out of subversive materials.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cole, "Artist Spotlight: Cat Chow", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', May/June 2004, Vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)|Richard Hunt]] sculpts ruggedly abstract commentaries on social issues.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Kerry James Marshall]] paints and sculpts multi-media works commenting on African-American life.&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

===Photography===
These same impulses also appeared in Chicago's lively [[Street photography]] scene, gaining notoriety through artists centered around the [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]] such as [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]], [[Aaron Siskind]], [[Leon Lewandowski]] as well as in the work of nanny-savant [[Vivian Maier]]. Ray K. Metzker and Barbara Crane studied at the Institute of Design in the 1950s. They spread the ideas of the Institute of Design teaching photography in the second half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Metzker was Philadelphia based and Crane was based in Chicago. [[Bob Thall]]'s beautiful, bleak photographs of Chicago-area architecture have also won much acclaim.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

===Illustration, printmaking===
Contemporary [[illustrators]] include [[Jay Ryan (artist)|Jay Ryan]], whose hand-silkscreened posters have advertised many a rock band,&lt;ref&gt;Anders Smith Lindall, "Off the Wall: Jack Ryan's Whimsical Illustrations Put a Face on the Chicago Rock Scene", ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Tuesday, December 20, 2005, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and fantasist [[Scott Gustafson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Fenner and Arnie Fenner, ''Spectrum 11: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art'', Underwood Books, Nevada City,&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tony Fitzpatrick (artist)|Tony Fitzpatrick]] etches wild, detailed, tattoo-like pop images.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Carpenter, "Tony Fitzpatrick: Max and Gaby's Alphabet", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', January/February 2004, Vol. 27, no. 1, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public art===

Chicago had a revival, dating to the 1960s, of public [[mural]] art, involving local artists and community members.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eric Hoyt, "The Explosion of a Dormant Art Form: Chicago's Murals", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring-Summer 1974, Vol. III, number 1, pp. 28-35&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chicago Public Art Group]] is a non profit cultural organization in [[Chicago]] that organizes and promotes creation of community public art.

==Irreverence, satire==
[[File:Cowardly lion2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|W. W. Denslow's illustration of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.]]

Chicago has a strong tradition of satirical, even grotesque art and illustration.  The early books of [[L. Frank Baum]] were illustrated with the strange work of [[William Wallace Denslow]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell P. Macfall, "The Baum Explosion",''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1978, Vol. VII, number 1, pp. 59-62&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chicago tradition of political satire is seen in installation artist [[Öyvind Fahlström]], cartoonish artist [[Hy Roth]], and actual cartoonists [[Heather McAdams]] and [[Nicole Hollander]].&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;  Other Chicago cartoonists recognised by the art world include [[Lynda Barry]], [[Dan Clowes]], [[Jay Lynch]] and [[Chris Ware]] (whose work was shown at the 2002 [[Whitney Biennial]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christa Donner, ""Drawing the Line: Midwest Comics &amp; Contemporary Art", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', Nov/Dec 2002, Volume 25, Number 4, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant comics artists from Chicago include [[Jessica Abel]],&lt;ref&gt;Joy Press, "The Further Adventures of Artbabe: Brooklyn Graphic Novelist Jessica Abel, Up From Underground", ''[[Village Voice]]'', Tuesday, March 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herblock|"Herblock" (Herbert Block)]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert C.

==Self-taught artists and Outsider Art==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Xdx - Manierre Dawson - overall.jpg|right|thumb|Xdx by Manierre Dawson from ca. 1910]]

"Chicago emerged early on as an outpost for [[Outsider Art|outsider art]]," according to critic Andrew Patner.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

[[Manierre Dawson]] was an early self-taught artist, who began painting abstracts in 1910.  He was invited to display in the [[Armory Show]].&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

In the 1990s, a group of Chicago collectors, including Bob Roth, founder of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', and Ann Nathan and Judy Saslow, both of whom have opened acclaimed galleries, organized [[Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art]], which leads tours of Midwestern self-taught artists and has its own exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

Paul Waggoner, an eccentric himself, was an art dealer and champion of outsider art.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Jenses, "Offbeat Gallery Owner", Chicago Tribune, Saturday, March 22, 2008, section 1, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Hammer, an art dealer in Chicago, has handled much strange, figurative [[outsider art]], including the epic novel, illustrated with hermaphroditic girls traced from coloring books, of [[Henry Darger]], and the naive portraits of society ladies of [[Lee Godie]].  Hammer also represents [[Mr. Imagination (Gregory Warmack)|Mr. Imagination]], a self-taught bottlecap muralist&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt; Mr. Imagination, whose work is in several museums, also participated in the 2007 public art project, "[[Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet: Guidebook", For Her Information Media, Chicago, Illinois 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Troubles and controversies==
In the 1980s, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], along with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs, attempted to put on a show of contemporary Chicago art.  Called "The Chicago Show", it was supposed to celebrate Chicago's artistic diversity.  Embarrassingly, 84 of the 90 artists chosen by the 5-member blind jury were found to be white.  The organizers published an apology in the exhibit catalogue and invited twenty minority artists who  had not been juried in to participate.  Half of the invited artists, angered by this condescension, refused and organized a counter-exhibit at the [[Chicago Cultural Center]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

On April 15, 1989, the same night that the [[Hyde Park Art Center]] celebrated its 50th anniversary, a devastating fire destroyed most of an entire block of important galleries and art spaces in the [[River North Gallery District, Near North Side, Chicago|River North gallery district]].&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

In spring of 1996, the Feigen, Inc. gallery's exhibit of [[Gregory Green (artist)|Gregory Green]]'s "10,000 Doses" and "Recipe for Making '[[LSD]]' in the Kitchen" was raided by the [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]], who confiscated and broke open the artworks.  No drugs were found.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

In 1996 the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], to get over the embarrassment of "The Chicago Show", attempted a survey of Chicago Art called "Art in Chicago: 1945-1995".  It was criticized by the press as cramped, inadequate, and incomprehensive.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;  Its catalogue was judged a disappointment by Dennis Adrian, an art critic and participant, who called it "visually ... an atrocity of staggering proportions."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Adrian, "This Map is Not to Scale", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', February 1997, Volume 24, no. 5, pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual arts coverage===
In the last decade, all major print publications in Chicago have ceased seriously covering the visual arts .  In 2009, the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', an [[alternative newspaper|alternative]] weekly newspaper, reduced its formerly complete art listings of galleries and museums and regular art reviews by [[Fred Camper]] to "a smattering of listings and pictures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Jason Foumberg, "Art in Chicago 2000-2009: At Zeroes End", [[Newcity]], December 3, 2009, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', one of Chicago's two major newspapers, never had gallery or art listings and fired its sole dedicated fine arts reporter, [[Alan G. Artner]], in 2009.&lt;ref name=Foumberg/&gt;
And the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', the other of Chicago's two major newspapers, has no gallery or art listings and no dedicated arts reporter, although [[Kevin Nance]] has covered some fine art issues along with movies and popular culture.

Additionally, The ''[[New Art Examiner]]'' (from Chicago) and ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'' magazine ([[Columbus, Ohio]]) reported on Chicago and midwestern arts communities until they both folded in 2002, though the ''[[New Art Examiner]]'' relaunched in 2015'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Art Examiner|url=http://www.newartexaminer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Gallery News]]'', a glossy color magazine published three times a year, lists gallery shows but has no articles.  ''[[Gallery Guide]]'' magazine publishes a Chicago/midwest edition which is similar.

However, smaller online and print publications have continued to cover the art scene in Chicago and have increased dramatically in number in recent years. Since 1988, [[NewCity Magazine|New City Magazine]] has covered the visual arts in Chicago, joined in the 1990s by [[Lumpen (magazine)|Lumpen Magazine]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. [[Gapers Block]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gapers Block|url=http://www.gapersblock.com|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Chicago-focused web publication established in 2003, added coverage with their arts and culture section. They were soon followed by Paul Klein's Art Letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Letter|url=http://www.artletter.com/info.html|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 and the [[Bad at Sports|Bad At Sports]] podcast and blog in 2005. In 2008, print-based Proximity Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proximity Magazine About|url=http://proximitymagazine.com/information/about/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established, joined by two more print publications, Jettison Quarterly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jettison Quarterly|url=http://jettisonquarterly.com/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The School of the Art  Institute's F News Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F News Magazine|url=http://fnewsmagazine.com/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 2009. Also in 2009, Chicago Art Magazine broke off of Art Talk Chicago, part of the Chicago Tribune-sponsored blog network, to start their own independent online platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Art Magazine - About|url=http://chicagoartmagazine.com/about/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago Art Review, which ran from 2009-2011 and is currently in hiatus, began in 2009 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Art Review|url=http://www.Chicagoartreview.com|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sixty Inches From Center was established and includes The Chicago Arts Archive, a web publication focusing on visual art in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixty Inches From Center|url=http://sixtyinchesfromcenter.org/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org Chicago Artists Resource], launched by the Department of Cultural Affairs in 2005, provides articles on visual art in addition to providing resources and tools for Chicago artists.

Local artists' interests are represented by the [[Chicago Artists' Coalition]], a nonprofit advocacy organization, which has a monthly newsletter, the ''[[Chicago Artists' News]]''.

[[Wall Hangings]] was an exhibition of textile [[fiber art]] at [[Museum of Modern Art]] from 25 February to 4 May 1969. It was planned in 1966 and toured 11 cities in 1968–1969&lt;ref name="String, Felt &amp; Thread" /&gt;.
 

==About==
Wall Hangings Exhibition was curated by [[Mildred Constantine]] and [[Jack Lenor Larsen]] and featured 28 Artists from 8 countries&lt;ref name="Exhibition Catalogue Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Constantine|first1=Mildred|last2=Lenor Laren|first2=Jack|title=Wall Hangins|date=1969|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was the first major art exhibition in [[fiber arts]] or textiles.&lt;ref name="String, Felt &amp; Thread"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auther|first1=Elissa|title=String, felt, thread : the hierarchy of art and craft in American art|date=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9780816656097|page=32-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks were noted for their techniques, material, scale and three-dimensionality and were referenced both to their break from and use of tradition in those areas. The history of the artists in the show were directly attributed to the Austrian [[Wiener Werkstätte]] and the German [[Bauhaus]], though mention was made of other inspirations such as [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] Peruvian [[Weaving|weavers]].&lt;ref name="Exhibition Catalogue Book" /&gt;  

==Ideology==
The 19 December 1968 Press release by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] for the exhibition Wall Hangings states: "During the last 10 years, developments in weaving have caused us to revise our concepts of this craft and view the work within the context of twenty-first century art. The weavers from eight countries represented in this exhibition are not part of the fabric industry, but of the world of art. They have extended the formal possibilities of weaving, frequently using complex and unique techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/4163/releases/MOMA_1968_July-December_0095_135.pdf?2010|title=Press Release| accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The only national [[art world]] press was written by [[Louise Bourgeois]] for ''Craft Horizons'' and was negative and suggested that the work was not fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auther|first=Elissa|date=2008|title=Fiber Art and the Hierarchy of Art and Craft, 1960–80|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern Craft|volume=1.1|pages=19–20|via=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="String, Felt &amp; Thread" /&gt; As craft theorist Elissa Auther states in her 2009 book ''String Felt &amp; Thread'': "Despite the awareness of the negative art world attitudes concerning media traditionally associated with the crafts, the strategy Constantine and Larsen adopted to assert fiber's art status was to introduce the new genre into the fine art world on the terms set by that world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auther|first1=Elissa|title=String, felt, thread : the hierarchy of art and craft in American art|date=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9780816656097|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
