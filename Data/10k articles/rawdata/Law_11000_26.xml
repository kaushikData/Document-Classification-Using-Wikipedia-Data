'''Oregon Ballot Measure 97''' was a [[ballot measure]] in the [[Oregon state elections, 2016|2016 election]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. The initiative asked voters to determine whether or not to impose a 2.5&amp;nbsp;percent [[gross receipts tax]] on [[C corporation]]s with Oregon sales exceeding $25&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/ESFI/97-final-es-08112016.pdf|format=PDF|title=Measure 97: Explanatory Statement|publisher=[[Oregon Secretary of State]]|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/faq_oregons_corporate_tax_meas.html |title=FAQ: Oregon's corporate tax measure is a big deal.

The nonpartisan Oregon Legislative Revenue Office determined that of the some 250,000 businesses registered in Oregon, 951 would be subject to the tax; of these, the hundred largest taxpayers would pay about two-thirds of the monies raised.  The same report estimated that wholesale companies in Oregon would see their taxes grow by almost $600&amp;nbsp;million, a 583&amp;nbsp;percent increase.  Taxes on Oregon retailers would increase by $535&amp;nbsp;million, a 766&amp;nbsp;percent jump.  Health care firms operating in Oregon would experience a 1,211&amp;nbsp;percent increase in their taxes, adding almost $100&amp;nbsp;million per year to the cost of health care across the state.&lt;ref name="RogowayFAQ"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogoway|first=Mike|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2016/10/measure_97_faq_how_the_tax_wou.html |title=Measure 97 FAQ: How the tax would work, who would pay, where the money goes|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]/OregonLive|date=October 28, 2016&lt;!--(updated November 1, 2016)--&gt;|access-date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anat Kamm 9.jpg|thumb|Anat Kamm]]

The '''Anat Kamm–Uri Blau affair''' refers to a leak of thousands of classified [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) documents by the former Israeli soldier Anat Kamm.

During her military service as an assistant in the [[Central Command (Israel)|Central Command]] bureau, Kamm secretly copied thousands of classified documents, including many confidential documents. After she finished her military service, Kamm copied the documents to a CD and leaked it to the Israeli ''[[Haaretz]]'' journalist [[Uri Blau]]. On these acts, Kamm was later on convicted of espionage and providing confidential information without authorization.

Information from the leak suggested that the military had defied a ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] against assassinating wanted militants in the [[West Bank]] who could potentially be arrested safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/01/israeli-woman-detained-military-leak-accusation/ |title=Israeli woman detained on military leak accusation |date=1 April 2010 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News]] |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kampeas&gt;{{cite news|last=Kampeas |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Kampeas |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/03/29/1011331/israel-gags-news-of-journalist-under-house-arrest |title=Israel gags news of soldier turned journalist under arrest |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402204513/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/03/29/1011331/israel-gags-news-of-journalist-under-house-arrest |archivedate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israeli-leak-suspect-held-in-secret-house-arrest-1930672.html |title=Israeli leak suspect held in secret house arrest |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |location=London |first=Donald |last=MacIntyre |authorlink=Donald Macintyre (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/journalist-on-the-run-from-israel-is-hiding-in-britain-1934015.html |title=Journalist on the run from Israel is hiding in Britain |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |location=London |first=Kim |last=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/02/israeli-journalist-anat-kam-house-arrest |title=Israeli journalist Anat Kamm under secret house arrest since December |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 April 2010|accessdate=26 October 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101013172755/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/02/israeli-journalist-anat-kam-house-arrest| archivedate= 13 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7086417.ece |title=Israel arrests soldier Anat Kamm over targeted-killings 'leak' |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts in the case were subjected to an Israeli [[gag order]].

Uri Blau ({{lang-he|אורי בלאו}}, born 1977) is an Israeli writer and journalist and currently an investigative reporter for the ''Haaretz'' newspaper, specializing in military affairs.

== Details of the leak ==
In 2008, Blau published a report&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-ignoring-high-court-on-west-bank-assassinations-1.258296 |title=IDF Ignoring High Court on West Bank Assassinations |last=Blau |first=Uri |authorlink=Uri Blau |date=26 November 2008 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on these documents, which said that the IDF senior command planned and executed [[targeted killings]] of three people, in violation of an earlier 2006 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] limiting the circumstances in which such a tactic could be used.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is an arrest operation," the document said, attributing the quote to Naveh. "But in case [the soldiers] identify one of the senior leaders of the Islamic Jihad, Walid Obeid, Ziad Malaisha, Adham Yunis, they have permission to open fire in accordance with their appraisal of the situation during the operation."&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Izenberg |first=Dan |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=172983 |title=Stamp of approval from attorney-general |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of General Staff]], Lieutenant General [[Gabi Ashkenazi]] was angered by the leak of highly classified documents, and ordered an investigation about its source.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

Following a petition for investigation by two Israeli leading human rights attorneys,&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt; the Attorney-General [[Menahem Mazuz]] responded in a letter challenging the allegations made by Blau:

::Regarding the killing of Malaisha, Mazuz wrote, "The IDF operation met all the conditions laid down in the [Supreme Court targeted killing ruling]. The attack took place after the possibility of arresting the fugitives was ruled out as being impossible to achieve under the circumstances and after it was made clear to the soldiers that arrest was the first preference."

::Mazuz added "the legal aspects of the operation were examined at each one of the planning stages and there is no basis to the charge that the IDF 'ignored' the High Court's instructions.... On the contrary, the operational officers in the general staff, who had close legal consultation, were aware of the High Court instructions and stressed and carried them out in all stages of the planning and the approval of the operation."&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

According to documents released by The [[Tel Aviv]] [[District Court]], Kamm said during her interrogation: "There were some aspects of the IDF's operational procedures in the West Bank that I felt should be public knowledge... When I was burning the CDs I kept thinking that history tends to forgive people who expose [[war crimes]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Vered Luvitch |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3874912,00.html |title=Kam: History forgives those who expose war crimes |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002085040/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-3874912%2C00.html |archivedate=2 October 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli police secured a gag order prohibiting Israeli media from reporting on Kamm's arrest, and the reasons for it. The charges against Kamm do not relate to her journalistic activities as a media correspondent, but rather to being a journalistic source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Middle East Informer|url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/Middle-East-Informer-2/600760968595cdc6faa655be6535cb81|accessdate=4 July 2017|agency=Associated Press|date=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication of the affair==
Despite the fact that numerous foreign media outlets, as well as local blogs, had reported on the case and her identity, there was a gag order within the mainstream media. No printed newspaper had published her name, though many have published reports criticizing the authorities for imposing the gag and preventing them from telling their readers about the major story. The first overseas reporting on the case came in the [[Tikun Olam (blog)|Tikun Olam blog]], which collaborated with Israeli bloggers and journalists to bring the story into the public consciousness.&lt;ref name=NYT-Debate/&gt;

After pressure from articles in the foreign media and from the Israeli press itself, which resented its muzzling, the gag order was removed on 8 April and an indictment was published accusing Kamm of espionage and damaging the security of the state. She faced a possible penalty of life in prison. Reaction among some in the public has been especially harsh, with some calling her a spy and traitor. Kamm's trial was scheduled to begin in May 2010, unless her attorneys arrived at a plea bargain with the prosecution.

Though the prosecution originally sought the gag order, in this case Kamm and her attorneys felt it was in her interest to honor it as well. She has exerted great pressure on her supporters not to publicize her arrest or the charges against her. She asked the [[Hebrew Wikipedia]] to remove the article about her (although a deletion vote was opened before her request was made),&lt;ref&gt;1. [[:he:שיחה:ענת קם/ארכיון 1|Discussion in Hebrew about Kamm's request]]; 2. [[:he:ויקיפדיה:רשימת מועמדים למחיקה/:ענת קם|The deletion vote in Hebrew]] – Note that two of the voters cited Kamm's request as a reason to delete the article.&lt;/ref&gt; raised controversy both within the Hebrew Wikipedia community and among free speech and free press advocates within Israel and abroad.

The case raised profound questions about the balance between national security and press scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite news |author=Ilene R. Prusher |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0408/Press-freedom-vs.-state-security-Israel-s-Anat-Kam-faces-jail-for-leaking-army-files |title=Press freedom vs. state security: Israel's Anat Kamm faces jail for leaking army files |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=10 September 2014}} and {{cite news |author=Daniella Peled |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/08/anat-kamm-shin-bet-israel |title=The real moral of the Anat Kamm story |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates for human rights and democracy both within Israel and outside are closely monitoring the case. The Paris-based [[Reporters Without Borders]] issued a statement saying that "Defence of national security is a legitimate objective but censorship must not be used to prevent the Israel Defense Forces from being held responsible if they broke the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=6 April 2010 |url=http://en.rsf.org/israel-israeli-media-forbidden-to-report-06-04-2010,36948 |title=Israeli media forbidden to report case widely covered internationally |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a gag order was initially issued in late January 2010 while Kamm was in [[house arrest]], the Israeli journalist Yitzhak Tessler of NRG Ma'ariv was the first to refer to the affair in his column where he called journalists to find ways to make the publish the details surrounding the affair.&lt;ref name=Tessler/&gt; Beside several Israeli blogs, that soon deleted the information they published about the affair (some deleted the information due to the gag order and some due to a request from Kamm herself) and [[HaAyin HaShevi'it|The Seventh Eye]], an Israeli site that discusses the investigation and criticism of the Israeli media, which dropped hints about the affair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hanoch Marmari |url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/41209 |title=It cannot happen here |publisher=[[HaAyin HaShevi'it|The Seventh Eye]] |date=28 March 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; no Israeli media outlet published any details about Kamm's arrest.

Outside of Israel, the first to published details of affair (in mid-March 2010) was [[Richard Silverstein]], a Jewish-American blogger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Judith Miller |authorlink=Judith Miller |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/04/03/israels-free-press-crackdown.html |title=Israel's Censorship Scandal |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=April 3, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full publication (by an established media source) appeared at the end of March 2010 in the Jewish news agency [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA) from the United States.&lt;ref name=Kampeas/&gt; In the following days the affair was published in many newspapers&lt;ref name=NYT-Debate&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07israel.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Debate in Israel on Gag Order in Security Leak Case | date=6 April 2010 |page=A12 |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7086417.ece | location=London | work=[[The Times]] | first=James | last=Hider | title=Israel arrests soldier Anat Kam over targeted killings leak | date=3 April 2010}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and news agencies. After the details of the affair were published in various media outlets worldwide, the Israeli media began to carefully hint about the affair. The ''Haaretz'' newspaper and [[Channel 10 (Israel)|Channel 10]] filed a petition to the District Court in Tel Aviv against the gag order, which was eventually lifted on 8 April.

With the removal of the gag order an extensive discussion was held in the Israeli media about Kamm's actions. The dominant approach in the media was that Kamm's actions risked lives without a real justification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Haim Misgav |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3873510,00.html |script-title=he:מרגלים תמיד יודעים איך עלינו לנהוג |language=he |trans-title=Spies always know how we should act |publisher=[[Ynet]] |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2011}}. Various parties have supported Kamm's actions, including ''Haaretz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gideon Levy |authorlink=Gideon Levy |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/1.1196707  |script-title=he:פרשת ענת קם &amp;#124; במקום לעסוק בגילויים, רודפים את המגלים |language=he |trans-title=Anat Kam affair &amp;#124; Instead of dealing with disclosures, chasing the discoverers |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Silverstein classified Kamm on the same level of [[Julian Assange]] and [[Chelsea Manning]], as a world-class whistleblower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Silverstein |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/opinion/opinion-opinion/kamm-agrees-to-plea-bargain-israel%E2%80%99s-assange-gets-nine-year-sentence-07022011/ |title=Kamm Agrees to Plea Bargain, Israel's Assange Gets Nine-Year Sentence |publisher=Eurasia Review |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal proceedings ==
On 14 January 2010, Kamm was indicted for [[espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shmulik Grossman |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3873277,00.html |title=Attorney: Kam case threatens democracy |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2011, Kamm was convicted in the Tel Aviv District Court after pleading guilty in a [[plea bargain]] to leaking more than 2,000 secret military documents to ''Haaretz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ofra Edelman |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1213585.html |script-title=he:הפרקליטות: נבקש מאסר ארוך ומשמעותי לענת קם |language=he |trans-title=Prosecution: we request a long and significant sentence for Anat Kam |date=6 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208003433/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1213585.html |archivedate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plea bargain contained that Kamm would not be charged with damaging national security, which carried a life sentence if convicted. Instead, she was charged with leaking classified materials, which carries a 15-year maximum sentence. The prosecution was expected to ask for a nine-year sentence.&lt;ref name=Cohen-Friedman&gt;{{cite news |author=Naama Cohen-Friedman |title=Anat Kam sentenced to 4.5 years in prison |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=30 October 2011 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4141015,00.html |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2011, Kamm was sentenced to four and a half years in prison and 18 months probation. The panel of judges ruled that the two years Kamm had spent under house arrest would not be deducted from her sentence.&lt;ref name=Cohen-Friedman/&gt; Kamm's defense appealed the sentence to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]], claiming that the sentence was too harsh. Kamm also requested that her sentence be deferred until a decision was made on the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Naama Cohen Friedman |date=16 November 2011 |title=Anat Kam appeals 4.5-year sentence |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4149183,00.html |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hearing before Supreme Court justice Miriam Naor, the prosecution accused Kamm of posing a major threat to the state, and claiming that due to her actions, "we are paying the price to this day." Prosecutors also claimed that it was odd that Kamm complained of being judged prematurely by the press when she had previously argued that the public had a right to the information contained in the documents she leaked. Justice Naor accepted the prosecution's arguments and rejected Kamm's appeal. However, she was given three extra days of freedom so she could undergo a medical examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Aviel Magnezi |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4149795,00.html |title=Court rules: Anat Kam to be jailed Wednesday |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 November, Kamm arrived at [[Neve Tirtza Women's Prison]] in [[Ramla]] to begin serving her sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 November 2011 |title=Anat Kam begins serving prison sentence |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4151980,00.html |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamm appealed her sentence to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]]. On 31 December 2012 the Supreme Court granted her appeal and shortened her sentence to three and a half years by majority decision, noting that she had confessed to the crime, cooperated with the investigation, spent a considerable period of time under house arrest, and is unlikely to make repeat violations. Justices [[Hanan Melcer]] and [[Edna Arbel]] voted in favor of reducing her penalty, while [[Noam Sohlberg]] voted against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Aviel Magnezi |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4326565,00.html |title=Court cuts Anat Kam's prison sentence |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Uri Blau was sentenced to four months of community service for his role in the leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Israel+reporter+sentenced+over+secret+army+papers&amp;NewsID=345978|title=Israel reporter sentenced over secret army papers|date=4 September 2012|publisher=The Himalayan|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;!-- also: |url=http://www.unitedjerusalem.org/index2.asp?id=1601919&amp;Date=9/2/2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Anat Kamm demanded NIS 2 million in compensation from ''Haaretz''. In a letter from her attorney, Ilan Bombach, it was claimed that the newspaper's actions in exposing her as the source of the leaks caused her "great harm" by destroying her budding journalism career and academic studies, and threatened to sue for compensation in court unless the newspaper paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tucker |first=Nati |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/anat-kamm-demands-nis-2-million-from-haaretz-for-exposing-her.premium-1.501251 |title=Anat Kamm demands NIS 2 million from Haaretz for exposing her - National Israel News |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamm was released after 26 months in January 2014.&lt;ref name="haaretz260114"&gt;{{cite news |author=Yaniv Kubovich |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.570553 |title=Anat Kamm released after two years in jail |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=26 January 2014 |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="564">'''Armistice of Malmö''' was a treaty signed on August 26, 1848 following the [[First Schleswig War]] between [[Denmark]] and [[Prussia]]. This treaty forced Prussia and the [[Frankfurt National Assembly]] to accept Danish demands of its annexation of the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] and temporarily maintained the balance between under the pressure from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russia]].

A '''black market''', '''underground economy''', or '''shadow economy''' is a [[Secrecy|clandestine]] [[Market (economics)|market]] or transaction that has some aspect of illegality or is characterized by some form of noncompliant behavior with an institutional set of rules. If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitutes membership in the unreported economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12methods.pdf|title="Internal Revenue Service Summary of Estimation Methods"|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feige"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edgar L. Feige|year=1989|title= The Underground Economies:Tax Evasion and Information Distortion |editor=Edgar L.Feige|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because tax evasion or participation in a black market activity is illegal, participants will attempt to hide their behavior from the government or regulatory authority.&lt;ref name=Feige&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feige |first=Edgar L. |title=Defining And Estimating Underground And Informal Economies: The New Institutional Economics Approach |journal=[[World Development (journal)|World Development]] |date=2009 |volume=18 |series=Elsevier, |issue=7 |pages=989–1002 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpdc/0312003.html |doi=10.1016/0305-750x(90)90081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash usage is the preferred medium of exchange in illegal transactions since cash usage does not leave a footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = New Estimates of U.S. Currency Abroad, the Domestic Money Supply and the Unreported Economy |last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2012|journal = Crime, Law and Social Change |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 57(3)|others = pp. 239-263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common motives for operating in black markets are to trade contraband, avoid taxes and regulations, or skirt price controls or rationing. Typically the totality of such activity is referred to with the definite article as a complement to the official economies, by market for such goods and services, e.g. "the black market in bush meat".

The black market is distinct from the [[grey market]], in which commodities are distributed through channels that, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer, and the [[white market]], in which trade is legal and official.

'''Black money''' is the proceeds of an illegal transaction, on which income and other taxes have not been paid, and which can only be legitimised by some form of [[money laundering]]. Because of the clandestine nature of the black economy it is not possible to determine its size and scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawji.in/2018/09/black-money-in-india.html|title=Black Money in India {{!}} LawJi|work=LawJi.in : one-stop destination for all law students|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Mercado Negro, La Paz, Bolivia.JPG|thumbnail|right|Mercado Negro, so called "Black Market", in [[La Paz]], Bolivia.]]

The literature on the black market has not established a common terminology and has instead offered many synonyms including: subterranean; hidden; [[Grey market|grey]]; shadow; informal; clandestine; illegal; unobserved; unreported; unrecorded; second; parallel and black.&lt;ref name=Feige /&gt;

There is no single underground economy; there are many. These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate. Four major underground economies can be identified:&lt;ref name=Feige /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the "Shadow Economy"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the illegal economy
# the unreported economy
# the unrecorded economy
# the informal economy

The "illegal economy" consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce. Illegal economy participants engage in the production and distribution of prohibited [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]], such as [[drug trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]], and [[prostitution]].&lt;ref name="Feige 2016"/&gt;

The "unreported economy" consists of those economic activities that circumvent or evade the institutionally established fiscal rules as codified in the tax code. A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the "[[tax gap]]", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a "tax gap" of $450–$600 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "unrecorded economy" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.&lt;ref name="Feige 2016"/&gt; A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not. Unrecorded income is a particular problem in [[transition countries]] that switched from a [[Socialist economics|socialist]] accounting system to [[United Nations System of National Accounts|UN standard national accounting]]. New methods have been proposed for estimating the size of the unrecorded (non-observed) economy.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2002) Measuring the Non-Observed Economy A Handbook, Paris France.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is still little consensus concerning the size of the unreported economies of transition countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feige | first1 = Edgar L. | last2 = Urban | first2 = Ivica | year = 2008 | title = Measuring underground (unobserved, non-observed, unrecorded) economies in transition countries: Can we trust GDP? | url = | journal = [[Journal of Comparative Economics]] | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 287–306 | doi=10.1016/j.jce.2008.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[informal economy]]" comprises those economic activities that circumvent the costs and are excluded from the benefits and rights incorporated in the laws and administrative rules covering property relationships, commercial licensing, labor contracts, torts, financial credit and social security systems.&lt;ref name="Feige 2016"/&gt; A summary measure of the informal economy is the income generated by economic agents that operate informally.&lt;ref&gt;De Soto, Hernando, ''The Other Path: The Invisible Revolution in the Third World''. Harper and Row, New York, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Portes | first1 = Alejandro | last2 = Sassen-Koob | first2 = Saskia | year = 1987 | title = Making it underground: Comparative material on the informal sector in western market economies | url = | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 30–61 | doi=10.1086/228705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The informal sector is defined as the part of an economy that is [[tax noncompliance|not taxed]], monitored by any form of [[government]], or included in any [[gross national product]] (GNP), unlike the formal economy. In [[Developed country|developed countries]] the informal sector is characterized by [[unreported employment]]. This is hidden from the state for tax, social security or labour law purposes but is legal in all other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Commodified World?: Mapping the limits of capitalism |author=Colin C. Williams |year=2005 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=1-84277-355-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJWD-2eYAlAC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Cash%20in%20hand%20informal&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=73–74 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the term ''black market'' can be used in reference to a specific part of the economy in which [[contraband]] is traded.

==Pricing==
Goods and services acquired illegally and/or transacted for in an illegal manner may exchange above or below the price of legal market transactions:
* They may be cheaper than legal market prices. The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.
* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.

==Consumer issues==

|}
Even when the underground market offers lower prices, consumers still have an incentive to buy on the legal market when possible, because:
* They may prefer legal suppliers, as they are easier to contact and can be held accountable for faults;
* In some jurisdictions, such as the [[United States]], customers may be charged with a [[criminal offense]] if they knowingly participate in the black economy, even as a consumer;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jury orders student to pay $675,000 for illegally downloading music|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=8226751&amp;page=1|website=ABCnews.com|publisher=ABC|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* They may have a moral dislike of black marketing;
* In some jurisdictions (such as [[England]] and [[Wales]]), consumers found to be in possession of stolen goods will have them taken away if they are traced, even if they did not know they were stolen. Though they themselves will not usually face criminal prosecution, they are still left without the goods they paid for and with little if any recourse to get their money back. This risk may make some averse to buying goods that they think may be from the underground market, even if in fact they are legitimate (for example, items sold at a [[car boot sale]]).

However, in some limited situations, consumers conclude that they are actually better off using black market services, particularly when government regulations hinder what would otherwise be a legitimate competitive service. For example:
* Unlicensed [[taxicab]]s. In [[Baltimore]], it has been reported that many consumers actively prefer illegal taxis, citing that they are more available, convenient, and priced fairly.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite news |author=Christina Royster-Hemby |url=http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=6264 |title=Feature: A Baltimore Way of Life |date=April 21, 2004 |newspaper=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |accessdate=2012-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214183721/http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=6264 |archive-date=February 14, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traded goods and services==
Some examples of underground economic activities include:

===Sexual exploitation and forced labor===
{{Main|Human trafficking}}
[[Prostitution]] is illegal or highly regulated in many countries across the world. These places form a classic study of the underground economy, because of consistent high demand from customers, relatively high pay, but labor-intensive and low skilled work, which attracts a continual supply of workers. While prostitution exists in every country, studies show that it tends to flourish more in poorer countries, and in areas with large numbers of unattached men, such as around military bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://the-idea-shop.com/papers/prostitution.pdf |title=A Theory of Prostitution |format=pdf |publisher=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110| issue = 1 |year=2002 |author1=Lena Edlund |author2=Evelyn Korn |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, an empirical study showed that the supply of prostitutes rose abruptly in Denver and Minneapolis in 2008 when the Democratic and Republican National Conventions took place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cunningham | first1 = S. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = T. D. | year = 2011 | title = Men in transit and prostitution: using political conventions as a natural experiment. B.E | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy | volume = 11 | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1515/1935-1682.3059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes in the black market generally operate with some degree of secrecy, sometimes negotiating prices and activities through [[Code word (figure of speech)|codewords]] and subtle gestures. In countries such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]], where prostitution is legal but regulated, illegal prostitutes exist whose services are offered cheaper without regard for the legal requirements or procedures—health checks, standards of accommodation, and so on.

In other countries, such as [[Nicaragua]], where legal prostitution is regulated, hotels may require both parties to identify themselves, to prevent the rise of [[child prostitution]].

===Personal information===
[[Personally identifying information]], financial information like credit card and bank account information, and [[Medical data breach|medical data]] is bought and sold, mostly in [[darknet market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holt |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Smirnova |first2=Olga |last3=Chua |first3=Yi-Ting |title=Data thieves in action : examining the international market for stolen personal information |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-58904-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Value of Stolen Data on the Dark Web  |url=https://darkwebnews.com/dark-web/value-of-stolen-data-dark-web/ |work=Dark Web News |date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rossi |first1=Ben |title=The ripple effect of identity theft: What happens to my data once it's stolen?|url=https://www.information-age.com/ripple-effect-identity-theft-what-happens-my-data-once-its-stolen-123459795/ |work=Information Age |date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal drugs===
[[File:Yellow Cannabis strain.jpg|thumb|left|In the U.S., [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] has been termed as a [[cash crop]].]]
{{Main|Illegal drug trade}}
From the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries began to ban the keeping or using of some [[recreational drug]]s, such as the United States' [[war on drugs]]. Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is $321.6 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |title=World Drug Report 2005 |work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price. Many [[drug legalization]] activists draw parallels between the illegal drug trade and the [[Prohibition]] of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s.

===Weapons===
{{Main|Arms trafficking}}
[[Image:Gun pyre in Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A tower of confiscated smuggled weapons about to be set ablaze in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]]]
The [[legislatures]] of many countries forbid or restrict the personal [[ownership]] of [[weapon]]s. These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.

In England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration—convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.

===Illegally logged timber===
{{Main|Illegal logging}}
The illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue. According to Interpol, the illegal logging industry is worth almost as much as drug production industry, in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/item_single.php?it_id=7076&amp;it=news|title=Illegal logging news|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/approach.php?a_id=109 |title=Illegal logging industry worth almost as much as drug production industry |access-date=January 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702142928/http://www.illegal-logging.info/approach.php?a_id=109 |archive-date=July 2, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals and animal products===
{{Main|Ivory trade|Wildlife trade}}
In many developing countries, living animals are captured in the wild and sold as pets. Wild animals are also hunted and killed for their [[Bushmeat|meat]], hide, and organs, the latter of which and other animal parts are sold for use in traditional medicine.

In several of the states within the [[United States]], laws requiring the pasteurization of milk has created black market situations involving the transport and sale of [[raw milk]], and sometimes raw milk cheese which is legal in a number of EU countries but banned in the US if aged less than 60 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/black-market-cheese-america|title=Inside the World of Black Market Cheese|author=|date=|website=vogue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
{{Main|Rum-running}}
[[File:Raid at elk lake.jpg|thumb|Broken barrels of liquor after a police raid in 1925, in [[Elk Lake, Ontario]]]]

[[Rum-running]], or bootlegging, is the illegal business of transporting ([[smuggling]]) [[alcoholic beverage]]s where such transportation is forbidden by law. Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land. According to the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Prohibition (miniseries)|Prohibition]]'', the term "bootlegging" was popularized when thousands of city dwellers would sell liquor from flasks they kept in their boot leg all across major cities and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Mary | title = Bootlegging Mothers and Drinking Daughters: Gender and Prohibition in Butte Montana | url = | journal = [[American Quarterly]] | volume = 46 | issue = 2| year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Prohibition (miniseries)]], Episode 1, "A Nation of Drunkards". Directed by [[Ken Burns]] &amp; [[Lynn Novick]]. Distributed by PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "rum-running" most likely originated at the start of [[Prohibition in the United States]] (1920–1933), when ships from [[Bimini]] in the western Bahamas transported cheap Caribbean [[rum]] to Florida [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]]. But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high. It was said that some ships carried $200,000 in contraband in a single run.

===Tobacco===
It has been reported that smuggling one truckload of cigarettes from a low-tax [[U.S. state|US state]] to a high-tax state can lead to a profit of up to $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23384-2004Jun7.html
|title=Cigarette Smuggling Linked to Terrorism |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A04 |last=Horiwitz |first=Sari |date=June 8, 2004 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low-tax states are generally the major tobacco producers, and have come under enormous criticism for their reluctance to increase taxes. [[North Carolina]] eventually agreed to raise its taxes from 5 cents to 35 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes, although this remains far below the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press_releases/post/id_0861 |title=North Carolina’s Cigarette Tax Increase Is A Small Step In The Right Direction But Kids and Taxpayers Will Miss Benefits of Greater Increase |work=Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids |author=Matthew L. Myers |date=August 5, 2005 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; But [[South Carolina]] has so far refused to follow suit and raise taxes from seven cents per pack (the lowest in the USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/245.html |title=State Sales, Gasoline, Cigarette, and Alcohol Tax Rates by State, 2000–2010 |work=Tax Foundation |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, it has been reported that "27% of cigarettes and 68% of roll your own tobacco is purchased on the black market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishshop.org.uk/latest-news/205-illegal-cigarettes-partnership-must-address-all-aspects-of-black-market |author=Scottish Grocers' Federation |title=Illegal Cigarettes Partnership Must Address All Aspects of Black Market |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological organs===
{{Main|Organ trade#Illegal organ trade}}
According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), illegal organ trade occurs when organs are removed from the body for the purpose of commercial transactions.&lt;ref name="Jafar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jafar |first=Tazeen H. |title=Organ Trafficking: Global Solutions for a Global Problem |journal=[[American Journal of Kidney Diseases]] |volume=54 |issue=6 |year=2009 |doi=10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.08.014 |pmid= |pages=1145–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[WHO]] justifies these actions by stating, "Payment for ... organs is likely to take unfair advantage of the poorest and most vulnerable groups, undermines altruistic donation and leads to profiteering and human trafficking."&lt;ref name=Crim&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ambagtsheer |first=F. |first2=W. |last2=Weimar |year=2011 |title=A Criminological Perspective: Why Prohibition of Organ Trade Is Not Effective and How the Declaration of Istanbul Can Move Forward |journal=[[American Journal of Transplantation]] |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=571–75 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03864.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these ordinances, it was estimated that 5% of all organ recipients engaged in commercial organ transplant in 2005.&lt;ref name="Shimazono"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shimazono |first=Yosuke |title=The State of the International Organ Trade: A Provisional Picture Based on Integration of Available Information |journal=[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] |volume=85 |issue=12 |year=2007 |doi=10.1590/S0042-96862007001200017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that illegal organ trade is on the rise, with a recent report by [[Global Financial Integrity]] estimating that the illegal organ trade generates profits between $600 million and $1.2 billion per year with a span over many countries.

===Racketeering===
{{Main|Racket (crime)}}
A [[racket (crime)|racket]] is a service that is [[fraud]]ulently offered to solve a problem, such as for a problem that does not actually exist, that will not be put into effect, or that would not otherwise exist if the racket did not exist. Conducting a racket is racketeering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering|title= Racketeering|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, although that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].
Racketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.&lt;ref&gt;David Witwer, "'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s", in {{cite book |first2=William Chester, Ed. |last2=Jordan |title=Corrupt histories |location=Rochester, New York |first1=Emmanuel, Ed. |last1=Kreike |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-58046-173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation providers===
{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}
Where taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt; for city residents.

===Housing rental===
In places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner. Specialised black-market dealers assist the property owners with such transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/svd-avslojar-systematisk-forsaljning-av-svartkontrakt_8146104.svd "Hyrestvåan är din för 300 000"] (in Swedish, "The rental one-bedroom [apartment] is yours for 300 000 [SEK]"), [[Svenska Dagbladet]], May 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In India, places like Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkotta, and New Delhi where students are coming from all over India, getting high rented PG (paying guests) or other forms of rented apartments without any taxation or regulations.

===Counterfeit medicine, essential aircraft and automobile parts===
{{Main|Counterfeit consumer goods}}
Medicines and essential aircraft and automobile parts (e.g. brakes, motor parts, etc.) are counterfeited on a large scale.

===Copyrighted media===
{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2017}}
{{Main|Copyright infringement}}

[[Street vendor]]s in countries where there is little enforcement of [[copyright law]], particularly in Asia and Latin America, often sell deeply discounted copies of [[film]]s, music [[CD]]s, and computer [[software]] such as [[video game]]s, sometimes even before the official release of the title. A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.

Copyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |title=Is music piracy stealing? |author=Charles W. Moore |date=August 8, 2003 |accessdate=2012-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401235246/http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Anti-copyright|not all people agree]] with 'copyright laws', as it unfairly criminalises competition, allowing the copyright-holder to effectively monopolise related industries. It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.

The comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal "[[mixtape]]s" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job. Many artists and film producers have accepted the role of piracy in media distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/documentary-filmmaker-supports-bittorrent-uploader-090514/ |title=Documentary Filmmaker Supports BitTorrent Uploader |work=TorrentFreak |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of material through file sharing is a major source of publicity for artists and has been shown to build fan bases that may be more inclined to see the performer live&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Illegal downloading: What happens if you're caught? |first=Robert |last=Verkaik |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/illegal-downloading-what-happens-if-youre-caught-1736013.html |location=London |work=The Independent |date=July 8, 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (live performances make up the bulk of successful artists' revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2009/11/13/labels-may-be-losing.html |title=Labels may be losing money, but artists are making more than ever |author=Cory Doctorow |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; however not all artists can make live performances, for example photographers typically only have a single source of income that is the licensing of their photos).

===Currency===
{{Main|Fixed exchange rate}}
Money itself is traded on the black market. This may happen for one or more of several reasons:
* The government sets ("pegs") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.
* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.
* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).
* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].
* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |work=PBS Frontline |author1=Oriana Zill |author2=Lowell Bergman |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the "harder" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.

In situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency. The U.S. dollar is viewed as a relatively stable and safe currency and is often used abroad as a second currency. In 2012, $340 billion, roughly 37 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Edgar L. Feige|last=Feige|first=Edgar L.|title=New Estimates of U.S. Currency Abroad, the Underground Economy, and the "Tax Gap"|date=April 2012|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/34778/|journal=Crime Law and Social Change|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all U.S. currency, was believed to be circulating abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/ |title=Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Z.1 Table 204 |work=U.S. Federal Reserve |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent study of the amount of currency held overseas suggests that only 25 percent of U.S. currency is presently held abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/42169.html|title=The myth of the "cashless society": How much of America's currency is overseas?|author=Feige, Edgar L.|date=February 2, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread substitution of U.S. currency for local currency is known as ''[[de facto]] [[dollarisation]]'', and has been observed in transition countries such as Cambodia&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar L. Feige]], "Dynamics of Currency Substitution, Asset Substitution and De facto Dollarisation and Euroisation in Transition Countries", ''Comparative Economic Studies'', September 2003, Vol. 45 #3 pp. 358–83.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Feige et al. "Unofficial Dollarization in Latin America: Currency Substitution, Network Externalities and Irreversibility", in Dean, Salvatore and Willett (eds.) The Dollarization Debate, Oxford Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as [[Ecuador]], abandoned their local currency and now use US dollars, essentially for this reason, a process known as [[de jure dollarization]]. See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.

If foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.&lt;ref name="Cebula and Feige"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America’s Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes favored over [[Central bank|centralized currency]] due to their anonymous nature and their ability to be traded over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/09/05/follow-the-bitcoins-how-we-got-busted-buying-drugs-on-silk-roads-black-market/ |title=Follow The Bitcoin: How We Got Busted Buying Drugs On Silk Road's Black Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel===
In the EU, it is not illegal for a person or business to buy fuel in one EU state for their own use in another, but as with other goods the tax will generally be payable by the final customer at the physical place of making the purchase.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], there has often been a black market in [[petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Peterkin |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publication-place=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509280/IRA-fuel-smuggling-drove-oil-giants-to-abandon-Ulster.html |title=IRA fuel smuggling 'drove oil giants to abandon Ulster' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501041920/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509280/IRA-fuel-smuggling-drove-oil-giants-to-abandon-Ulster.html |archivedate=2011-05-01 |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Fuel smuggling down say customs |location=Belfast |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1311445.stm |date=May 3, 2001 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The direction of smuggling can change depending on the variation of the taxes and the [[exchange rate]] between the [[Euro]] and [[Pound Sterling]]; indeed sometimes diesel will be smuggled in one direction and petrol the other.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In some countries, diesel fuel for agricultural vehicles or domestic use is taxed at a much lower rate than that for other vehicles. This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that £350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.

==Organized crime==
{{Main|Organized crime}}
People engaged in the black market usually run their business hidden under a [[Front organization|front]] business that is legal.

Often, certain types of illegal products are traded against one another, depending on the geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/ff_orgchart_crime/|title=Organized Crime: The World's Largest Social Network|work=WIRED|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Wars===
Black markets flourish in most countries during [[war]]time. States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.&lt;ref name="TheHomeFront"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Home Front|date=July 1945|isbn=1-904897-11-8|publisher=Imperial War Museum|publication-place=London|edition=facsimile}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened. Another in Britain was supplies from the US, intended only for use in US army bases on British land, but leaked into the local native British black market.

For example, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on February 17, 1945,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' February 17, 1945, reprinted on page 30 ''The Daily Telegraph'' February 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[Member of parliament|members]] said that "the whole [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] production of [[East Anglia]] had gone to the black market" and "prosecutions [for black-marketing] were like trying to stop a leak in a battleship", and it was said that official prices of such foods were set so low that their producers often sold their produce on the black market for higher prices; one such route (seen to operate at the market at [[Diss]] in Norfolk) was to sell live poultry to members of the public, and each purchaser would sign a form promising that he was buying the birds to breed from, and then take them home for eating.

During the [[Vietnam war]], soldiers would spend [[Military Payment Certificate]]s on [[maid]] service and [[Human sexuality|sexual]] entertainment,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} thus supporting their [[cuckold|partners]] and their families. If the Vietnamese civilian wanted something that was hard to get, he would buy it at double the price from one of the soldiers, who had a monthly ration card and thus had access to the military stores.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The transactions ran through the on-base maids to the local populace. Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Laws and regulations===
A classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[Prohibition]] of alcohol. Similarly when the law disappears, so does the black market, which is why of the arguments for marijuana legalization is the elimination of the black market, and thus taxes from that economy being used by the government.

==Black markets by country==
===India===
{{further|Indian black money|Corruption in India|Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Bill, 2015}}
In India, "black money" refers to funds earned on the black market, on which income and other taxes have not been paid. The black money market situation in [[India]] is [[epidemic]]. India currently tops the list for illegal monies in the entire world, estimated to be almost US$1,456 billion stored in Swiss banks in the form of unaccounted money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2010/08/13/stories/2010081350370900.htm |title=Black, bold and bountiful |work=The Hindu Business Line |author=V.

Burton stated, "We just shouldn't be cramming a tube down a duck's throat and forcing in food to make foie gras," and that foie gras production is "an inhumane process that other countries have sensibly banned. I'm pleased California will be next on the list."&lt;ref name=Macias&gt;{{cite news|title=As California ban on foie gras looms, some press for repeal |first=Chris |last=Macias |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/06/24/v-print/153593/as-california-ban-on-foie-gras.html |newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]] |issn=0890-5738 |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-07-02 |quote=We just shouldn't be cramming a tube down a duck's throat and forcing in food to make foie gras |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68repUIwH?url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/06/24/v-print/153593/as-california-ban-on-foie-gras.html |archivedate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislature passed the bill and it was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on September 29, 2004.&lt;ref name="BillHistory"/&gt;

The law included a provision that it would take effect almost eight years after enactment, in order to allow time for techniques to be developed by which foie gras could be produced without force-feeding birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=California Foie Gras Fans Seek to Beat Curb as Ban Begins |first=Alison |last=Vekshin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-26/california-foie-gras-fans-seek-to-duck-curb-as-ban-begins |newspaper=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |issn=0007-7135 |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-04 |quote=The California law had postponed enforcement of the ban for almost eight years to allow producers to find an alternative to force-feeding. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68wWHIQ5A?url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-26/california-foie-gras-fans-seek-to-duck-curb-as-ban-begins |archivedate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the date the law took effect, no such technique had been developed that was deemed commercially viable.

During the months leading up to the date when the law would go into effect, some California restaurants hosted elaborate multi-course meals featuring foie gras in many forms, drawing patrons who wanted to eat foie gras before the ban went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dishcrawl.com/dishcrawl/227 |title=Foie Battle Kickoff Dinner!

Five animal welfare organizations (the "Proposed Defendant Intervenors") ([[Farm Sanctuary]], [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]], the Marin Humane Society, the [[Humane Society of the United States]], and the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association) who were sponsors of the challenged law had petitioned to be accepted as defendant intervenors in the case.

'''Communal violence''' is a form of violence that is perpetrated across [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or communal lines, the violent parties feel solidarity for their respective groups, and victims are chosen based upon group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. (2000) ''The Deadly Ethnic Riot''. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt; The term includes conflicts, riots and other forms of violence between communities of different religious faith or ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/communal Communal] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime includes any conflict and form of violence between communities of different religious group, different sects or tribes of same religious group, clans, ethnic origins or national origin as communal violence.&lt;ref name=unodc&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/Chapter_4.pdf Homicide, Violence and Conflict] UNODC, United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; However, this excludes conflict between two individuals or two families.

Communal violence, in different parts of the world, is alternatively referred to as ethnic violence, non-State conflict, violent civil unrest, minorities unrest, mass racial violence, inter-communal violence and ethno-religious violence.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Horowitz (1985), Ethnic Groups in Conflict, {{ISBN|978-0520053854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human history has experienced numerous episodes of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;David Nirenberg, Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages, Princeton University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medieval Europe, Protestants clashed with Catholics, Christians clashed with Muslims while both perpetuated violence against Jews and [[Romani people|Roma]] minorities. In 1561, [[Huguenot]]s in Toulouse took out in a procession through the streets to express their solidarity for Protestant ideas. A few days later, the Catholics hunted down some of the leaders of the procession, beat them and burned them at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Jean Souriac]], "Du corps à corps au combat fictif. Quand les catholiques toulousains affrontaient leurs homologues protestants," in Les affrontements: Usages, discours et rituels, Editor: Frédérique Pitou and Jacqueline Sainclivier, Presses Universitaires de Rennes (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In the French town of Pamiers, communal clashes were routine between Protestants and Catholics, such as during holy celebrations where the Catholics took out a procession with a statue of St. Anthony, sang and danced while they carried the statue around town. Local Protestants would year after year disrupt the festivities by throwing stones at the Catholics. In 1566, when the Catholic procession reached a Protestant neighborhood, the Protestants chanted "kill, kill, kill !!" and days of communal violence with numerous fatalities followed.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Ruff, Violence in Early Modern Europe 1500–1800, Cambridge University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1572, thousands of Protestants were killed by Catholics during communal violence in each of the following cities – Paris, Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyon, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partner, P. 1999"/&gt; In Switzerland, communal violence between the Reformation movement and Catholics marked the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gordon (2002), The Swiss Reformation, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719051180}}, pp. 90–99&lt;/ref&gt;

;Africa
The Horn of Africa as well as West African regions have similar history of communal violence. Nigeria has seen centuries of communal violence between different ethnic groups particularly between Christian south and Islamic north.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20045621 The Clash of Civilizations?], Foreign Affairs, Vol. 72, No. 3 (Summer, 1993), pp. 22–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desplat &amp; Ostebo (2013), Muslim Ethiopia: The Christian Legacy, Identity Politics, and Islamic Reformism, {{ISBN|978-1137325297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, after receiving independence from the British colonial rule, there were widespread communal violence in the ethnically diverse state of [[Zanzibar]].

The frequency of communal violence in South Asia increased after the first partition of Bengal in 1905, where segregation, unequal political and economic rights were imposed on Hindus and Muslims by Lord Curzon, based on religion. The colonial rule was viewed by each side as favoring the other side, resulting in a wave of communal riots and 1911 reversal of Bengal partition and its re-unification.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P.

==National laws==

===India===
The Indian law defines communal violence as, "any act or series of acts, whether spontaneous or planned, resulting in injury or harm to the person and or property, knowingly directed against any person by virtue of his or her membership of any religious or linguistic minority, in any State in the Union of India, or Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within the meaning of clauses (24) and (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution of India".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf PREVENTION OF COMMUNAL AND TARGETED VIOLENCE (ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND REPARATIONS) BILL, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814185325/http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf |date=2014-08-14 }} Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, communal violence is defined as that is driven by a sense of religious, ethnic or tribal solidarity. The equivalence of tribalism to ethnicity was referred locally as ''kesukuan''.&lt;ref name=gvk&gt;Gerry van Klinken, [http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20Communal%20violence%20democratization%20in%20Indonesia%20%20small%20town%20wars.pdf Communal Violence and Democratization in Indonesia – Small Town Wars], {{ISBN|978-0-415-41713-6}}, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Communal violence in Indonesia includes numerous localized conflicts between various social groups found on its islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html Social violence in Indonesia is localized] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104117/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html |date=2016-03-04 }} Jakarta Post&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
In Kenya, communal violence is defined as that violence that occurs between different community who identify themselves based on religion, tribes, language, sect, race and others. Typically this sense of community identity comes from birth and is inherited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ACLED-Country-Report_Kenya_December-2013.pdf COUNTRY REPORT: KENYA – 2013] ACLED, Africa (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar definition has been applied for 47 African countries, where during 1990–2010, about 7,200 instances of communal violence and inter-ethnic conflicts has been seen.&lt;ref&gt;Idean Salehyan et al, Social Conflict in Africa: A New Database, International Interactions: Empirical and Theoretical Research in International Relations, Volume 38, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Cyprus Greek Turk Communal Violence at Ktima, Paphos.jpg|thumb|Damage from communal violence between Christian Greeks and Muslim Turks in [[Cyprus]].]]
Colm Campbell has proposed, after studying the empirical data and sequence of events during communal violence in South Africa, Palestinian Territories and Northern Ireland, that communal violence typically follows when there is degradation of rule of law, the state fails to or is widely seen as unable to provide order, security and equal justice, which then leads to mass mobilization, followed by radicalization of anger among one or more communities, and ultimately violent mobilization. Targeted mass violence by a few from one community against innocent members of other community, suppression of complaints, refusal to prosecute, killing peaceful demonstrators, imprisonment of people of a single community while refusal to arrest members of other community in conflict, perceived or actual prisoner abuse by the state are often the greatest mobilizers of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Colm Campbell (2011), 'Beyond Radicalization: Towards an Integrated Anti-Violence Rule of Law Strategy', Transitional Justice Institute Research Paper No. 11-05, in Salinas de Friás, KLH Samuel and ND White (eds), Counter-Terrorism: International Law and Practice (Oxford University Press, Oxford 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stewart, Horizontal Inequalities and Conflict: Understanding Group Violence in Multiethnic Societies, {{ISBN|978-0230245501}}, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that ethnic segregation may also cause communal violence. Empirically estimating the effect of segregation on the incidence of violence across 700 localities in Rift Valley Province of [[Kenya]] after the contested 2007–2008 general election, Kimuli Kahara finds that local ethnic segregation increases communal violence by decreasing interethnic trust rather than by making it easier to organize violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if a small minority of individuals prefer to live in ethnically homogenous settings due to fear of other ethnic groups or otherwise, it can result in high degrees of ethnic segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schelling|first=Thomas|date=1971|title=Dynamic Models of Segregation|url=|journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology|volume=1|issue=2|pages=143–186|doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahara argues that such ethnic segregation decreases the possibility of positive contact across ethnic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence? Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration and the resultant positive interethnic contact reduces prejudice by allowing individuals to correct false beliefs about members of other ethnic groups, improving intergroup relations consequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas|date=1998|title=Intergroup Contact Theory.|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49|pages=65–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, segregation is correlated with low levels of interethnic trust. This widespread mistrust along ethnic lines explains the severity of communal violence by implying that when underlying mistrust is high, it is easier for extremists and elites to mobilize support for violence, and that where violence against members of other ethnic groups is supported by the public, perpetrators of such violence are less likely to face social sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Copyright Act'' of Canada''' is the federal statute governing [[copyright law in Canada|copyright law]] in [[Canada]]. It is jointly administered by the Department of [[Industry Canada]] and the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]. The ''Copyright Act'' was first passed in 1921 and substantially amended in 1988 and 1997. Several attempts were made between 2005 and 2011 to amend the ''Act'', but each of the bills ([[Bill C-60 (38th Canadian Parliament, 1st Session)|Bill C-60]] in 2005, [[Bill C-61 (39th Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)|Bill C-61]] in 2008, and [[Bill C-32 (40th Canadian Parliament, 3rd Session)|Bill C-32]] in 2010) failed to pass due to political opposition. In 2011, with a majority in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] introduced Bill C-11, titled the ''Copyright Modernization Act''. Bill C-11 was passed and received [[Royal Assent]] on June 29, 2012.

==History==
===1921 Canadian Copyright Act===
The first ''Copyright Act'' was passed in 1921 and came into force in 1924. Although Canada was no longer subject to imperial copyright law, the 1921 Act was closely modelled on the UK [[Copyright Act 1911|''Copyright Act'']] of 1911 to comply with the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]].&lt;ref name="Vaver"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vaver | first = David | title = Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-marks | publisher = Irwin Law | edition = 2nd | location = Toronto  | date = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-55221-209-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1988 the ''Copyright Act'' saw only minor amendments while the [[Government of Canada]] engaged in a number of studies on copyright reform. New technological developments and the emergence of computers, photocopiers and recording devices led to a recognition that copyright law needed to be updated. Between 1954 and 1960 the Royal Commission on Patents, Copyright, and Industrial Design, known as the Ilsley Commission, published a series of reports. Its brief was "to enquire as to whether federal legislation relating in any way to patents of invention, industrial designs, copyright and trademarks affords reasonable incentive to invention and research, to the development of literary and artistic talents, to creativeness, and to making available to the Canadian public scientific, technical, literary and artistic creations and other adaptations, applications and uses, in a manner and on terms adequately safeguarding the paramount public interest."&lt;ref name="Makarenko"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Makarenko| first = Jay| title = Copyright Law in Canada: An Introduction to the Canadian Copyright Act| work = Judicial System &amp; Legal Issues| publisher = Maple Leaf Web| date = 13 March 2009| url = http://www.mapleleafweb.com/features/copyright-law-canada-introduction-canadian-copyright-act#history| accessdate = 15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Patents, Copyright and Industrial Designs, Royal Commission on | publisher = [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]| url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006135| accessdate = 15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform  in 1988 and 1997===
In 1977, the Government of Canada's Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs published the Keyes-Brunet Report, a working paper with the full title "Copyright in Canada: Proposals for Revision of the Law". In 1984, the Government of Canada published "From Gutenberg to Telidon: A White Paper on Copyright" and in 1985 the House of Commons' Standing Committee on Communications and Culture published "A Charter of Rights for Creators - Report of the Subcommittee on the Revision of Copyright". A copyright reform process was initiated in two phases: Phase one was started in 1988 and saw several amendments to the original ''Copyright Act'' of 1921. Computer programs were included as works protected under copyright, the extent of moral rights was clarified, the provision for a compulsory licence for the reproduction of musical works was removed, new licensing arrangements were established for [[orphan works]] in cases where the copyright owner could not be identified, and rules were enacted on the formation of [[copyright collecting societies]] and their supervision by a reformed [[Copyright Board of Canada]].&lt;ref name="Makarenko"/&gt;

Phase two of the reform took place in 1997 and saw the ''Copyright Act'' amended with a new remuneration right for producers and performers of sound recordings when their work was broadcast or publicly performed by radio stations and public places such as bars. A [[private copying levy]] was introduced on blank audio tapes used for private copying and exclusive book distributors were granted protection in Canada. New copyright exceptions were introduced for nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, museums, broadcasters, and people with disability, allowing them to copy copyrighted works in specific circumstances without the permission of the copyright owner or the need to pay royalties. Damages payable for [[copyright infringement]] and the power to grant injunctions were increased, and the 1997 reforms introduced a mandatory review of the ''Copyright Act''.&lt;ref name="Makarenko"/&gt;

===Bills to amend the Copyright Act===
====Bill C-60====
{{main|Bill C-60 (38th Canadian Parliament, 1st Session)}}
In June 2005, the Government of Canada introduced [[Bill C-60]] to amend the ''Copyright Act''. Bill C-60 sought to extend moral rights to performers of other people's works and repeal the photographer exception allowing people to gain de facto authorship of anything they photograph. The bill also proposed to make circumventing rights management schemes an offence, but mostly when done for the purpose of violating another right. The bill was never passed into law as Parliament was dissolved after a motion of non-confidence was passed in November 2005.

====Bill C-61====
{{main|Bill C-61 (39th Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)}}
In Summer 2008, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-61 in their continuing effort to update the ''Copyright Act'', with numerous similarities to the previous Bill C-60 and the American [[DMCA]]. Industry Minister Jim Prentice introduced the bill to improve compliance with [[WIPO]] treaties. It was heavily criticized and praised by conflicting sides, of being too harsh and setting up "police states", to being needed copyright reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/442677|title=Troubling details in new downloading law|date=13 June 2008|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill died on the table due to the September 7, 2008 election call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworldcanada.com/Pages/Docbase/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=idgml-2ea4d00b-3de4-462b&amp;Portal=448d158c-d857-4785-b759-ffa1c005933c&amp;sub=46833|title=Manager, Pilot Network Services |author=Greg Meckbach  |date=2 September 2008|work=IT World Canada |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307083819/http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/manager-pilot-network-services/03780 |archive-date=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bill C-32====
{{main|Bill C-32 (40th Canadian Parliament, 3rd Session)}}
On June 2, 2010, Bill C-32 was tabled by federal Industry Minister Tony Clement, full title ''An Act to Amend the Copyright Act.'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/Consumers+stint+when+Comes+entertainment+Costs/3159189/story.html {{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many aspects of the bill changed with respect to Bill C-61, those portions regarding legal protection of technological protection measures remained fundamentally unchanged. These measures were criticised by consumer groups, including the Consumers Council of Canada, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, Option consommateurs and Union des consommateurs;&lt;ref name="C32criticism"&gt;{{Cite news  | url = http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/06/16/copyright-reform-consumers.html  | title = Consumer groups blast Moore over copyright  | last = Nowak  | first = Peter  | publisher = [[CBC News]]  | date = 16 June 2010  | accessdate = 2010-06-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the Canadian Consumer Initiative, they sent a letter to [[Minister of Canadian Heritage|Heritage Minister]] [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]], who had stated in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] that consumer interests were represented by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, noting that the Canadian Chamber of Commerce "is a business lobby group that in no way represents consumer interests, and in fact opposes the position of consumer groups on copyright policy".&lt;ref name="C32criticism" /&gt; On April 2011, before the bill could be passed, the government lost the confidence of the House of Commons and an election was called.

====Bill C-11====
{{main|An Act to amend the Copyright Act (41st Canadian Parliament, 1st Session)}}
On September 29, 2011, Bill C-11 was introduced into Canadian 41st Parliament by the federal Industry Minister Christian Paradis with the short title ''Copyright Modernization Act'' &lt;ref&gt;''[http://parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=5144516&amp;File=9 parl.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill is virtually identical to Bill C-32 from the previous Parliament which did not pass due to the dissolution of Parliament. Most of the opposition to the Bill from the opposition parties, in particular the NDP's opposition is about two aspects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-11/|title=Bill C-11 (Historical)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it is prohibited to circumvent digital locks even for lawful purposes and henceforth all the fair dealing&lt;ref&gt;Raj, Althia (17 June 2012), "[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/06/17/bill-c-11-copyright-modernization-act-canada_n_1603837.html Bill C-11: Copyright Legislation And Digital Lock Provisions Face Opposition In Canada]", ''Huffington Post Canada'', retrieved 28 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; rights in the bill can easily be removed by the usage of such a digital lock, and the missing compensation of creators of works through a scheme similar to the one used in the past that puts a levy on recording media at the time of sale of such blank media. On June 18, 2012 the bill received its third and final reading; receiving unanimous Conservative support and unanimous opposition by Liberal and NDP members of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vote #446 on June 18th, 2012 - C-11 An Act to amend the Copyright Act|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/votes/41-1/446/|publisher=openparliment.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill received Royal Assent on June 29, 2012 with all amendments rejected.

==Provisions of the ''Copyright Act''==
===Rights granted===
Copyright grants the sole and exclusive right to create and recreate a work whether wholly or substantially.  It also includes the sole rights to:
*publish the work if unpublished
*perform the work in public
*to produce, reproduce, perform or publish any translation of the work,
*in the case of a dramatic work, to convert it into a novel or other non-dramatic work,
*in the case of a novel or other non-dramatic work, or of an artistic work, to convert it into a dramatic work, by way of performance in public or otherwise,
*in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to make any sound recording, cinematograph film or other contrivance by means of which the work may be mechanically reproduced or performed,
*in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to reproduce, adapt and publicly present the work as a cinematographic work,
*in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to communicate the work to the public by telecommunication,
*to present at a public exhibition, for a purpose other than sale or hire, an artistic work created after June 7, 1988, other than a map, chart or plan,
*in the case of a computer program that can be reproduced in the ordinary course of its use, other than by a reproduction during its execution in conjunction with a machine, device or computer, to rent out the computer program, and
*in the case of a musical work, to rent out a sound recording in which the work is embodied,
and to authorize any such acts.&lt;ref name="Act"&gt;Copyright Act (R.S., 1985, c. C-42)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
The ''Act'' provides protection for all "original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic" works. Close attention has been paid to the use of the word "original". It has been well established that the foremost requirement for the subsistence of copyright is that the work is original.

The [[CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada|''CCH Canadian'' case]] re-evaluated the meaning of "original" and found that for a work to be original it must be the result of the exercise of "skill and judgment". More specifically: skill, meaning the "use of one's knowledge, developed an aptitude or practiced ability in producing work", and judgment, meaning the "use of one's capacity for discernment or ability to form an opinion or evaluation by comparing different possible options in producing the work". Nevertheless, originality does not require any novelty or creativity. It does require intellectual effort beyond mere mechanical exercise.

The determination of originality on the basis presented in ''CCH Canadian'' depends on the facts. For a large part, it depends on the degree to which the work originated from the author. Many factors are considered, The medium or form used is significant. Whether it comprises elements that are in the public domain or not, whether it the ordering of data or facts, or whether the form is pedestrian or novel. Mere selection is generally not enough. As well, it is significant to consider whether there are any artistic elements to it.

===Fixation===
Copyright provides the protection of expression of ideas. This entails that there must be a form, or "fixation", to the expression. It is fixation that distinguishes an expression from an idea.

In ''[[Canadian Admiral Corp. v. Rediffusion]]'', the court considered fixation: "for copyright to exists in a 'work' it must be expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance." In this case, the court found that there was an insufficient fixation in the live broadcast of a sports event. Any sort of broadcast, telecast, or display of a spectacle on its own is not sufficient to be fixed. At the least, it must be simultaneously recorded in some fashion to be fixed.

To the possible exception of choreographed works, there is a requirement that the work be recorded in a relatively permanent form. Typing a note into a computer screen may be sufficiently permanent. Some cases have shown that unstructured speech or other spontaneous or improvised creations, such as a sports game, cannot contain copyright.

===Exclusion===
Both facts and ideas are by their very nature uncopyrightable. This will often create difficulties when it becomes necessary to separate the idea from the expression as well as in the separation of fact from the arranging and use of those facts. Where the distinction between idea and expression becomes obscured the Courts often take a precautionary view that it cannot be copyrighted so as to avoid preventing others from expressing the same idea.

Minor designs that are largely ornamental or functional are excluded as well. For example, coloured blocks used as tools in an educational program are excluded.

===Ownership===
The copyright of an artist's work is owned directly by the artist in most cases with the exception of ''engravings'', ''photographs'', ''portraits'', and works created in the course of employment. Furthermore, these rights can be alienated through assignment and licences.

An artist's moral rights, however, are inalienable and stay with the artist their entire lives. As with copyrights, moral rights are inheritable.

===Crown Copyright===
Section 12 of the ''Copyright Act'' reserves copyright for all works that are "prepared or published by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or any government department."&lt;ref name="CAC"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Copyright Act (Canada), S. 12 |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-7.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220215142/http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-7.html |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, such copyright lasts for a period of 50 years following the end of the calendar year when the work was performed or created.&lt;ref name="CAC"/&gt; However, Crown copyright applies "without prejudice to any rights or privileges of the Crown".&lt;ref name="CAC"/&gt; In this way it is "said to be perpetual...and not to lapse through non-use or non-assertion", although the exact extent of what is or is not covered by this "perpetual copyright" is not entirely clear in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/conf/dac/en/vaver/vaver.html |title=Copyright and the State in Canada and the United States |publisher=University of Montreal |date=6 June 1995 |accessdate=11 December 2013 |author=Vaver, David |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527140536/http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/conf/dac/en/vaver/vaver.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 18, 2013, Crown Copyright and Licensing is no longer centrally administered, and the department or agency that created the information must be contacted for specific Crown copyright information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/ccl/index.html | title=Crown Copyright and Licensing | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=28 November 2013 | accessdate=11 December 2013 | author=Government of Canada Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in varied approaches by different organisations, where "the non-commercial licence has disappeared from the Public Works and Government Services site and it is unclear whether it remains active", and where "some departments have denied permission or asserted crown copyright to take down content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/7005/125/ | title=Government of Canada Quietly Changes Its Approach to Crown Copyright | date=25 November 2013 | accessdate=11 December 2013 | author=Geist, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of Crown copyright being applied beyond the 50 year expiration mark is the 1921 design of the [[Arms of Canada]], and its 1957 revision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/fip-pcim/spec/T105-eng.asp | title=Legal Protection (Canada) - Official Symbols | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=10 May 2010 | accessdate=11 December 2013 | author=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "may not be reproduced, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/terms-conditions.page?#ownership | title=Government of Canada Symbols | date=21 November 2013 | accessdate=11 December 2013 | author=Department of National Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music recordings===
The music industry created a loophole in Canadian copyright laws when it asked for a levy on [[Private copying levy#Canada|blank audio media]].  Since 1999, these private copying levies&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100228191550/http://cpcc.ca/english/currentTariff.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; on blank audio recording media (such as audio cassettes, CDs and CD-Rs) have raised millions of dollars for songwriters, recording artists, music publishers and record companies who partake in the industry system.  In exchange, and subject to certain exceptions, the act of copying music onto an audio recording medium for the private use of the person who makes the copy does not constitute copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright Act'', R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, s.80.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the statutory private copying provision is silent as to whether the person doing the private copying must also be the owner of the music being copied.

Some argue that the private copying levy legalized copying in the digital age, to the consternation of the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070917-cria-about-face-on-ipod-levies-tied-to-concerns-over-legitimizing-downloads.html|title=CRIA about-face on iPod levies tied to concerns over legitimizing downloads|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Canadian courts have not extended the definition of "audio recording medium" to exempt music copied onto computer hard drives, digital audio recorders (such as iPods or MP3 players), or other types of permanently embedded memory.&lt;ref&gt;See both {{cite CanLII|litigants=Canadian Private Copying Collective v.

===Foreign works===
Section 5 of the ''Copyright Act'' applies copyright protection to all citizens, residents, and corporations of Berne Convention, Universal Copyright Convention and World Trade Organization countries. The status is determined at the time the work is created or published. The section also permits the Minister of Industry to certify that these rights are extended to other countries. These are listed in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140121065514/http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/regu/crc-c-421/latest/crc-c-421.html Regulations]

===Copyright terms===
According to s. 6 of the Act the copyright of a work lasts the life of the author plus 50 years from the end of the calendar year of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 6|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-3.html#h-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except if the work is a cinematographic work in which case it's 50 years from the date of publication or, if unpublished, 50 years from the date of making &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 11.1|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For joint authors, the copyright of a work lasts the life of the author who dies last, plus 50 years from the end of the calendar year of that death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 9|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to s. 9(2), the duration of foreign works generally follow the [[Rule of the shorter term]] except in the case of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] countries (i.e. USA and Mexico). Works from NAFTA countries follow the Canadian duration rule.

===Unknown or anonymous authors===

Where the identity of the author is unknown (if the author is anonymous or pseudonymous) then the copyright lasts for either 50 years from the publication of the work or 75 years from the making of the work, whichever is shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 6.1|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if author's identity becomes commonly known during this time, the term provided in section 6 applies. The act also makes provisions for posthumous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 7|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orphaned works===
The ''Copyright Act'' allows anyone who seeks permission to use a copyright-protected work but cannot locate the copyright owner to apply to the Copyright Board ("the Board") for a licence to use that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 6.2|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-3.html#h-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works that are published or fixed (as the case may be) are eligible for a licence. The four categories are eligible material are:
* A published work (e.g. a book)
* A published sound recording (e.g. a single from a previously released album)
* A fixation of a performer's performance (e.g. the video recording of a live concert)
* A fixation of a communication signal (e.g. a recorded broadcast of a football game)

The Board can only issue a licence to works that are copyright-protected. If a work is not within the scope of copyright protection (e.g. a book containing only facts) or the copyright of the work is expired, the Board will not issue a licence since none would be required. Before the Board can issue a licence, the applicant must demonstrate that reasonable efforts have been made to locate the copyright owner and the copyright owner cannot be located. The Board takes many factors into consideration in determining what a "reasonable" effort entails. For example, the Board will take into account whether the proposed use is commercial, whether the work's author is still living, and whether information about ownership could be found in publicly available records.

The Board can issue a licence for any rights belonging to the copyright owner. Any use that is not within the copyright owner's rights will not be issued a licence since none would be required. For example, no licence will be granted to copy an insubstantial portion of a work because it is not a use that is protected by copyright.

Any particular licence will be specified to the needs of the applicant. For example, if the applicant asks for the authorization to distribute a film, the licence will read accordingly. Licences can also include permission to sub-license. For example, a film distribution licence can allow the licensee to enter into an agreement with a sub-distributor, provided the sub-distributor proceeds on the same terms as those set out in the licence.

If the Board decides to grant an application for a licence, it must also set appropriate terms and conditions for that licence. Generally, the licence will be valid only in Canada, for a specified amount of time, and involves a reasonable royalty payment (either upfront to a collective society or to an owner if one emerges). Sometimes, the licence will also contain attribution obligations, requiring the licensee to indicate: the name of the author, that the use is carried out pursuant to a licence obtained from the Board, and how the owner might obtain compensation for the use made.

According to their website, the Board granted 217 licences and rejected 8 applications between 1990 and 2013. Rejections were usually because no licence was required, or because the applicant had not proven that the work had been published (only published works are eligible for a licence). Although 217 licences had been granted, the number of works implicated is likely much larger. A 2009 study revealed that the 421 applications filed to date pertained to roughly 12,640 different works (a collection of orphan works would commonly proceed under a single application).  The study also found that many applications were withdrawn or abandoned because the copyright owner was found with the help of the Board or a collective society.

===Photographs===
As with other works, the copyright duration for a photograph is the life of the author plus 50 years. Until June 2012, the copyright owner of an engraving, photograph or portrait was considered to be the person who ordered the work once payment was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 13(2)|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-4.html#h-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copyright Modernization Act]] repealed s. 13(2) such that the copyright is no longer held by the commissioner. Subject to a contract that says otherwise, the owner is now the photographer and the commissioner is granted limited rights to display and transmit the photograph without his or her permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?source=library_prb&amp;ls=C11&amp;Parl=41&amp;Ses=1&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1#a13|title=Legislative Summary of Bill C-11: An Act to amend the Copyright Act|publisher=Parliament of Canada|date=2012-04-20|accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
According to section 34(4) of the ''Copyright Act'', specific penalties will be decided by the court.  Section 35(1) states that an infringer is liable for the financial gain made through infringement, and "such damages to the owner of the copyright as the owner has suffered due to the infringement"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 35|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A copyright holder can instead elect to protect his/her copyright under section 38.1, which allows for "a sum of not less than $100 or more than $5,000 as the court considers just." for '''all''' non-commercial infringement, and $500 up to $20,000 for '''each''' commercial infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 38.1|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-18.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the civil penalties described above, Section 42(1) of the ''Copyright Act'' sets out a number of criminal offences.  These primarily deal with infringement that involves sale or rental of copyrighted materials, and can result in fines of up to $1,000,000 or prison sentences of up to 2 years for indictment.  For a summary conviction, the maximum fine is $25,000 and prison term is limited to 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 42.1|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-22.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 44 of the ''Copyright Act'', copyright owners may apply to have copies of their work that, were they made in Canada would be infringing, and are about to be, or have been, imported into Canada dealt with by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]].  In these cases, such copies can be detained, and eventually destroyed or handed over to the copyright holder, at the discretion of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'', s. 44|url =http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-22.html#h-59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012''', officially recorded as '''Republic Act No. 10175''', is a [[List of Philippine laws|law]] in the [[Philippines]] approved on September 12, 2012. It aims to address legal issues concerning online interactions and the [[Internet in the Philippines]]. Among the cybercrime offenses included in the bill are [[cybersquatting]], [[cybersex]], [[child pornography]], [[identity theft]], illegal access to data and [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/2012/09/12/republic-act-no-10175/ Republic Act No. 10175] AN ACT DEFINING CYBERCRIME, PROVIDING FOR THE PREVENTION, INVESTIGATION, SUPPRESSION AND THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. Approved by President of the Philippines BENIGNO S. AQUINO III on September 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

While hailed for penalizing illegal acts done via the Internet that were not covered by old laws, the act has been criticized for its provision on criminalizing libel, which is perceived to be a curtailment in freedom of expression.

On October 9, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] issued a temporary restraining order, stopping implementation of the Act for 120 days, and extended it on 5 February 2013 "until further orders from the court."&lt;ref name=gma1&gt;{{cite news|title=SC extends TRO on cybercrime law|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/293478/news/nation/sc-extends-tro-on-cybercrime-law|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=GMA News Online|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sunstar1&gt;{{cite news|title=SC won't lift TRO on cybercrime law|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/breaking-news/2013/02/05/sc-wont-lift-tro-cybercrime-law-266578|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=Sunstar|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2013, The DOJ announced that the contentious online libel provisions of the law had been dropped.&lt;ref name="revised"&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/309704/scitech/technology/doj-to-drop-online-libel-from-revised-cybercrime-law DOJ to drop online libel from revised cybercrime law] Mark Merueñas, GMA network May 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that section 5 of the law decision was constitutional, and that sections 4-C-3, 7, 12 and 19 were unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meruenas|first1=Mark|title=Internet libel in cybercrime law constitutional – SC|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/348945/scitech/technology/internet-libel-in-cybercrime-law-constitutional-sc|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=GMA News Online|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 is the first law in the Philippines which specifically criminalizes [[computer crime]], which prior to the passage of the law had no strong legal precedent in Philippine jurisprudence.  While laws such as the [[Electronic Commerce Act of 2000]] (Republic Act No. 8792&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=3453 Electronic Commerce Act of 2000] (Republic Act No. 8792)&lt;/ref&gt;) regulated certain computer-related activities, these laws did not provide a legal basis for criminalizing crimes committed on a computer in general: for example, Onel de Guzman, the computer programmer charged with purportedly writing the [[ILOVEYOU]] computer worm, was ultimately not prosecuted by Philippine authorities due to a lack of legal basis for him to be charged under existing Philippine laws at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/22/business/technology-philippines-to-drop-charges-on-e-mail-virus.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Technology; Philippines to Drop Charges on E-Mail Virus | first=Wayne | last=Arnold | date=22 August 2000 | accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first draft of the law started in 2001 under the Legal and Regulatory Committee of the former Information Technology and eCommerce Council ([http://www.itecc.gov.ph/ ITECC]) which is the forerunner of the Commission on Information and Communication Technology (CICT). It was headed by former Secretary Virgilio "Ver" Peña and the Committee was chaired by Atty. Claro Parlade (+). It was an initiative of the Information Security and Privacy Sub-Committee chaired by Albert Dela Cruz who was the President of [http://www.cert.ph PHCERT] together with then Anti-Computer Crime and Fraud Division Chief, Atty. Elfren Meneses of the [http://www.nbi.gov.ph NBI]. The administrative and operational functions was provided by the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) acting as the CICT secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doj.gov.ph/files/cybercrime_office/Short%20History%20of%20the%20Dvlpt%20of%20Cybercrime.pdf] A Short History of the Development of Cybercrime Legislation in the Philippines - Geronimo L. Sy, Assistant Secretary - Department of Justice Manila&lt;/ref&gt; 

This was superseded by several cybercrime-related bills filed in the [[14th Congress of the Philippines|14th]] and [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]]. The Cybercrime Prevention Act ultimately was the product of House Bill No. 5808, authored by Representative [[Susan Yap-Sulit]] of the [[Legislative districts of Tarlac#Second District|second district of Tarlac]] and 36 other co-authors, and Senate Bill No. 2796, proposed by Senator [[Edgardo Angara]].  Both bills were passed by their respective chambers within one day of each other on June 5 and 4, 2012, respectively, shortly after the [[impeachment of Renato Corona]], and the final version of the Act was signed into law by President [[Benigno Aquino III]] on September 12.

==Provisions==
The Act, divided into 31 sections split across eight chapters, criminalizes several types of offense, including [[hacker (computer security)|illegal access]] (hacking), [[data destruction|data interference]], device misuse, [[cybersquatting]], computer-related offenses such as [[computer fraud]], content-related offenses such as [[cybersex]] and [[spam (electronic)|spam]], and other offenses.  The law also reaffirms existing laws against [[child pornography]], an offense under Republic Act No. 9775 (the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009), and [[libel]], an offense under Section 355 of the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]], also criminalizing them when committed using a computer system.  Finally, the Act includes a "catch-all" clause, making all offenses currently punishable under the Revised Penal Code also punishable under the Act when committed using a computer, with severer penalties than provided by the Revised Penal Code alone.

The Act has [[universal jurisdiction]]: its provisions apply to all Filipino nationals regardless of the place of commission.  Jurisdiction also lies when a punishable act is either committed within the Philippines, whether the erring device is wholly or partly situated in the Philippines, or whether damage was done to any natural or juridical person who at the time of commission was within the Philippines.  [[Regional Trial Court]]s shall have jurisdiction over cases involving violations of the Act.

A takedown clause is included in the Act, empowering the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] to restrict and/or demand the removal of content found to be contrary to the provisions of the Act, without the need for a court order.  This provision, originally not included in earlier iterations of the Act as it was being deliberated through Congress, was inserted during [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] deliberations on May 31, 2012.&lt;ref name="takedown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reyes|first=Karl John C.|title=Senate inserted Section 19: How the 'take-down' clause emerged in Cybercrime Law|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/44588/senate-inserted-section-19-how-the-take-down-clause-emerged-in-cybercrime-law||accessdate=3 October 2012|publisher=[[News5|TV5 News and Information]]|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Complementary to the takedown clause is a clause mandating the retention of data on computer servers for six months after the date of transaction, which may be extended for another six months should law enforcement authorities request it.

The Act also mandates the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] to organize a cybercrime unit Lyle Harvey Espinas, staffed by special investigators whose responsibility will be to exclusively handle cases pertaining to violations of the Act, under the supervision of the Department of Justice.  The unit is empowered to, among others, collect real-time traffic data from Internet service providers with due cause, require the disclosure of computer data within 72 hours after receipt of a court warrant from a service provider, and conduct searches and seizures of computer data and equipment.  It also mandates the establishment of special "cybercrime courts" which will handle cases involving cybercrime offenses (offenses enumerated in Section 4(a) of the Act).The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] declares on February 18, 2014  that the libel provisions of this act is now legal.

==Reactions==

The new Act received mixed reactions from several sectors upon its enactment, particularly with how its provisions could potentially affect freedom of expression, [[freedom of speech]] and [[data security]] in the Philippines.

The [[business process outsourcing in the Philippines|local business process outsourcing industry]] has received the new law well, citing an increase in the confidence of investors due to measures for the protection of electronic devices and online data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Agcaoili|first=Lawrence|title=IT-BPO industry welcomes passage of Cybercrime Prevention Act|url=http://www.philstar.com/cybercrime-law/2012/9/20/850809/it-bpo-industry-welcomes-passage-of-cybercrime-prevention-act|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media organizations and legal institutions though have criticized the Act for extending the definition of libel as defined in the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]], which has been criticized by international organizations as being outdated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Panela|first=Shaira|title=Cybercrime Act extends reach of 'draconian', outdated libel laws|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/274755/scitech/technology/cybercrime-act-extends-reach-of-draconian-outdated-libel-laws|publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]|accessdate=24 September 2012|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations for one has remarked that the current definition of libel as defined in the Revised Penal Code is inconsistent with the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and therefore violates the respect of freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tiongson|first=Frank Lloyd|title=Libel law violates freedom of expression – UN rights panel|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/16100-libel-law-violates-freedom-of-expression--un-rights-panel|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Manila Times]]|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Edgardo Angara]], the main proponent of the Act, defended the law by saying that it is a legal framework to protect freedoms such as the freedom of expression.  He asked the Act's critics to wait for the bill's implementing rules and regulations to see if the issues were addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sy|first=Marvin|title='Give Cybercrime Prevention Act a chance'|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2012/09/23/851973/give-cybercrime-prevention-act-chance|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added that the new law is unlike the controversial [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and [[PROTECT IP Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Angara|first=Edgardo|title=Protecting our Cyberspace - The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012|url=http://www.edangara.com/protecting-our-cyberspace-the-cybercrime-prevention-act-of-2012-angara|publisher=EdAngara.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Senator [[TG Guingona]] criticized the bill, calling it a prior restraint to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendes|first=Christina|title=Guingona criticizes Cybercrime Prevention Act|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2012/09/22/851654/guingona-criticizes-cybercrime-prevention-act|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has also expressed concern about the Act,&lt;ref name="effconcern"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/09/philippines-new-cybercrime-prevention-act-troubling-free-expression|title=Philippines' New Cybercrime Prevention Act Troubling for Free Expression|work=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting local media and journalist groups which are opposed to it. The Centre for Law and Democracy also published a detailed analysis criticizing the law from a freedom of expression perspective.&lt;ref name="CLDconcern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law-democracy.org/live/philippines-analysis-finds-major-problems-in-cybercrime-law/|title=Philippines: Analysis Finds Major Problems in Cybercrime Law|work=[[Centre for Law and Democracy]]|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petitions to the Supreme Court ==
Several petitions have been submitted to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] questioning the constitutionality of the Act.&lt;ref name="petitions"&gt;{{cite news|last=Canlas|first=Jonas|title=Suits pile up assailing anti-cybercrime law|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/nation/31925-suits-pile-up-assailing-anti-cybercrime-law|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Manila Times]]|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 2, the Supreme Court deferred on acting on the petitions, citing the absence of justices which prevented the Court from sitting ''en banc''.&lt;ref name="deferral"&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Tetch|title=SC defers action on petitions vs cybercrime law|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/281390/sc-defers-action-on-petitions-vs-cybercrime-law |accessdate=2 October 2012|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of a temporary restraining order meant that the law went into effect as scheduled on October 3.  In protest, Filipino netizens reacted by blacking out their [[Facebook]] profile pictures and trending the hashtag #notocybercrimelaw on [[Twitter]].   [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] also defaced government websites, including those of the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the [[Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]] and the [[Intellectual Property Office (Philippines)|Intellectual Property Office]].

On October 8, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] issued a [[Injunction#Temporary restraining orders|temporary restraining order]], stopping implementation of the Act for 120 days.&lt;ref name="TRO"&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Tetch|title=SC issues TRO vs cyber law|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/285848/sc-stops-cyber-law|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. |date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early December, 2012, the government requested the lifting of the TRO &lt;ref name="TRO2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Phneah|first=Ellyne|title=Philippine govt asks court to lift injunction on Cybercrime Law|url=http://www.zdnet.com/ph/philippine-govt-asks-court-to-lift-injunction-on-cybercrime-law-7000008597/|accessdate=19 December 2012|newspaper=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=ZDNet |date=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno''''', 547 U.S. 332 (2006), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving [[taxpayer standing|the standing of taxpayers]] to challenge state tax laws in federal court.  The Court unanimously ruled that state taxpayers did not have [[standing (law)|standing]] under [[Article III of the United States Constitution]] to challenge state tax or spending decisions simply by virtue of their status as taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;This decision will not affect whether such challenges may be brought in state courts, which would be purely an issue of whether state law permitted it.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] delivered the majority opinion (his fifth on the Court), which was joined by all of the justices except for [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who [[concurring opinion|concurred]] separately.

== Background ==
=== Tax incentives and taxpayer lawsuit ===
On November 12, 1998, the city of [[Toledo, Ohio]] entered into a development agreement with auto manufacturer [[DaimlerChrysler]], for it to construct a new [[Jeep]] assembly plant near its existing facility in exchange for various tax incentives.  DaimlerChrysler was to receive approximately $280,000,000 in tax benefits, in the form of a ten-year [[Tax exemption|exemption]] from certain [[property taxes]] and a [[Tax credit|credit]] applied against its state corporate franchise tax for certain investments.  The [[Toledo Public School District|Toledo Public]] and [[Washington Local School District (Lucas County)|Washington Local]] school districts, in which the facilities were located, consented to the exemption.

Eighteen taxpayers subsequently filed suit in [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] against DaimlerChrysler, the city and school districts, and other State of [[Ohio]] defendants, claiming that the state statutes that permitted the property tax exemption&lt;ref&gt;[[Ohio Revised Code|Ohio Rev. Code]] §§ 5709.62(C)(1), 5709.631.&lt;/ref&gt; and the investment tax credit&lt;ref&gt;Ohio Rev. Code § 5733.33.&lt;/ref&gt; violated the [[Commerce Clause]] in [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] and provisions of the [[Ohio Constitution]] by granting preferential treatment to in-state investment and activity.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Dormant Commerce Clause]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The plaintiffs claimed that their personal injury resulted from the tax breaks diminishing the funds available to the city and State, which imposed a "disproportionate burden" on the plaintiffs.

=== Federal court proceedings ===
The case was then [[removal jurisdiction|removed]] to the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio]] by the defendants on the basis of the [[federal question]] raised by the Commerce Clause claims.&lt;ref&gt;Judge [[David A. Katz]] presided.&lt;/ref&gt;  The plaintiffs filed a motion to [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]] the case back to state court, in part because of concerns that they could not meet the [[standing (law)|standing]] requirements of federal court.  The District Court denied the motion, finding that at a minimum the taxpayer plaintiffs could proceed under the "[[municipality|municipal]] taxpayer standing" rule articulated in ''[[Massachusetts v. Mellon]]'', 262 U.S. 447 (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Massachusetts v. Mellon|volume=262|page=447|pin=|year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The District Court then granted the defendants' [[motion to dismiss|motions to dismiss]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cuno v. DaimlerChrysler, Inc.'', 154 [[Federal Supplement|F. Supp. 2d]] 1196 ([[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|N.D. Ohio]] 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  The claims against the State defendants were barred by their [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] [[Sovereign immunity in the United States|immunity]], but were dismissed without [[prejudice (law)|prejudice]] so the plaintiffs could refile the claims in state court.  The District Court ruled that the remaining claims all failed to establish that the tax statutes violated either the Ohio or U.S. Constitutions, and were accordingly dismissed with prejudice.

On appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], the dismissal was affirmed in part, and reversed as to the claims regarding the investment tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;''Cuno v. Daimler Chrysler, Inc.'', 386 [[Federal_Reporter#Federal_Reporter.2C_Third_Series|F.3d]] 738 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|6th Cir.]] 2004).  This is an amended decision; the original was reported at 383 F.3d 379 and then withdrawn.  Judges [[Eugene Edward Siler, Jr.]], [[Martha Craig Daughtrey]], and [[R. Guy Cole, Jr.]] participated, with Judge Daughtrey writing the court's opinion.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court ruled that the tax credit violated the Commerce Clause and [[injunction|enjoined]] its enforcement, because it coerced businesses that were already subject to Ohio's franchise tax to expand locally rather than out-of-state, at the expense of interstate commerce.

== Opinion of the Court ==
The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] to review the Sixth Circuit's decision, and additionally directed the parties to [[brief (law)|brief]] and [[oral argument|argue]] on the issue of whether the plaintiff had the [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge the investment tax credit in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;''DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno'', 126 S. Ct. 36 (2005); ''Wilkins v. Cuno'', 126 S. Ct. 36 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court unanimously vacated the Sixth Circuit in part, ruling that it had improperly reached the merits of the case without first determining the issue of standing.  In a decision delivered by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] and joined by seven justices, the Court held that the status of an individual as a state taxpayer does not establish the standing required by [[Article III of the United States Constitution]] for a challenge to state tax laws to be heard in federal court.  Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] filed a separate [[concurring opinion]].

=== Roberts' majority opinion ===
The Court stated that the power of federal courts to engage in [[judicial review]] was limited by the requirement that the case be an actual [[case or controversy]] under Article III.  "If a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so."  Despite the plaintiffs' previous position regarding standing and the propriety of the federal court forum for their case, the Court furthermore stated that because the plaintiffs were now asserting standing, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden]] was on them to establish it.

==== Injury as taxpayers ====
The plaintiffs had principally claimed that they had standing by virtue of their status as [[Ohio]] taxpayers, alleging that the investment tax credit injured them by "deplet[ing] the funds of the State of Ohio to which the Plaintiffs contribute through their tax payments" and thus "diminish[ing] the total funds available for lawful uses and impos[ing] disproportionate burdens on" them.  The Court had in several prior cases denied federal taxpayers standing under Article III to object to a particular expenditure of federal funds simply because they are taxpayers.  The Court believed that the rationales for rejecting federal taxpayer standing applied with equal force to state taxpayers, as a prior case had indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne|link=|volume=342|page=429|pin=|year=1952}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[municipality|municipal]] taxpayer standing established by ''Mellon'' was not available in claims that did not involve municipal action, where the plaintiffs challenged a state law and state tax credit.

The Court also observed that there was no standing where the alleged injury was not "concrete and particularized," but was instead suffered "in some indefinite way in common with people generally."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife|link=|volume=504|page=555|pin=560|year=1992}}; ''Mellon'',  262 U.S. at 488.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, there is also no standing where the injury is not "actual or imminent," but is instead "conjectural or hypothetical."&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan'', 504 U.S. at 560.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court believed that the plaintiffs' alleged injury was "conjectural or hypothetical," because it required speculation that state legislators would respond to a reduction in revenue caused by the credit (a consequence the Court also found speculative, and unlikely) by increasing the plaintiffs' taxes.  Establishing that this injury is redressable would furthermore require speculation that legislators would pass along the increase in revenue resulting from the abolition of the tax credit in the form of tax reductions to the plaintiffs.  "Neither sort of speculation suffices to support standing."

==== Analogy to Establishment Clause challenges ====
The Court rejected the argument that an exception for Commerce Clause challenges to state tax or spending decisions should exist, as an analogy to the [[Establishment Clause]] taxation challenge the Court had permitted in ''[[Flast v. Cohen]]'', 392 U.S. 83 (1968), because both constitutional clauses operate as a specific limit on the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{ussc|name=Flast v. Cohen|volume=392|page=83|pin=|year=1968}}. The Taxing and Spending Clause is at [[Article One of the United States Constitution|U.S. Const. art. I]], § 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court explained that the right not to contribute money for the support of a religious establishment was "fundamentally unlike" whatever rights the plaintiffs may have under the Commerce Clause, and the comparison the plaintiffs attempted was "at such a high level of generality that almost any constitutional constraint on government power would 'specifically limit' a State's taxing and spending power for ''Flast'' purposes."  The injury alleged in ''Flast'' was instead the specific extraction of money from the plaintiff to spend in aid of a religion, an injury that could be redressed by an injunction, in contrast to that alleged in this case.

=== Ginsburg's concurrence ===
Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] filed a separate [[concurring opinion]], in which she concurred in the Court's judgment, which she believed to be based on longstanding precedent, and in the balance of its opinion.  However, she wrote separately to express a "large reservation" to the further limitations on standing that the Court had adopted in decisions dating from the late 1970s through the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', {{ussc|name=Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization|link=|volume=426|page=26|pin=|year=1976}}; {{ussc|name=Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.|link=|volume=454|page=464|pin=|year=1982}}; {{ussc|name=Allen v. Wright|volume=468|page=737|pin=|year=1984}}; {{ussc|name=Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife|volume=504|page=555|pin=|year=1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which she believed were not necessary to support the Court's ruling.

In the context of the [[World Wide Web]], '''deep linking''' is the use of a [[hyperlink]] that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed, piece of [[web content]] on a [[website]] (e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com/path/page&lt;/nowiki&gt;"), rather than the website's home page (e.g., "&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;"). The [[URL]] contains all the information needed to point to a particular item, in this case the "Example" section of the [[English Wikipedia]] article entitled "Deep linking", as opposed to only the information needed to point to the highest-level [[home page]] of Wikipedia at &lt;code&gt;https://www.wikipedia.org/&lt;/code&gt;.

==Deep linking and HTTP==
The technology behind the World Wide Web, the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), does not actually make any distinction between "deep" links and any other links&amp;mdash;all links are functionally equal. This is intentional; one of the design purposes of the Web is to allow authors to link to any published document on another site. The possibility of so-called "deep" linking is therefore built into the Web technology of [[HTTP]] and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s by default&amp;mdash;while a site can attempt to restrict deep links, to do so requires extra effort. According to the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] Technical Architecture Group, "any attempt to forbid the practice of deep linking is based on a misunderstanding of the technology, and threatens to undermine the functioning of the Web as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/deeplinking.html | title=Deep Linking in the World Wide Web | accessdate=May 30, 2007 | last=Bray | first=Tim | date=Sep 11, 2003 | publisher=W3.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Some commercial websites object to other sites making deep links into their content either because it bypasses advertising on their main pages, passes off their content as that of the linker or, like ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', they charge users for permanently valid links.
Sometimes, deep linking has led to legal action such as in the 1997 case of [[Ticketmaster]] versus [[Microsoft]], where Microsoft deep-linked to Ticketmaster's site from its Sidewalk service. This case was settled when Microsoft and Ticketmaster arranged a licensing agreement.
Ticketmaster later filed a [[Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com|similar case]] against [[Tickets.com]], and the judge in this case ruled that such linking was legal as long as it was clear to whom the linked pages belonged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Attention Editors: Deep Link Away| first=Michelle| last=Finley| date=Mar 30, 2000| publisher=Wired News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also concluded that URLs themselves were not copyrightable, writing: "A URL is simply an address, open to the public, like the street address of a building, which, if known, can enable the user to reach the building. There is nothing sufficiently original to make the URL a copyrightable item, especially the way it is used. There appear to be no cases holding the URLs to be subject to copyright. On principle, they should not be."

==Deep linking and web technologies==
Websites built on technologies such as [[Adobe flash|Adobe Flash]] and [[AJAX]] often do not support deep linking. This can cause usability problems for visitors to those sites. For example, they may be unable to save bookmarks to individual pages or [[State machine|states]] of the site, use the [[web browser]] forward and back buttons—and clicking the browser refresh button may return the user to the initial page.

However, this is not a fundamental limitation of these technologies. Well-known techniques, and libraries such as [[SWFAddress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://squibl.com/blog/2010/10/14/swfaddress-and-deep-linking/ |title=a swfaddress example: how to deep link your flash tutorial » SQUIBL Blog |publisher=Squibl.com |date=2010-10-14 |accessdate=2014-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525190022/http://squibl.com/blog/2010/10/14/swfaddress-and-deep-linking/ |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and unFocus [[History Keeper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unfocus.com/projects/historykeeper/ | title=History Keeper – Deep Linking in Flash &amp; JavaScript |publisher=Unfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; now exist that website creators using Flash or AJAX can use to provide deep linking to pages within their sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/articles/deep_linking.html | title=Deep-linking to frames in Flash websites |publisher=Adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/ | title=Deep Linking for Flash and Ajax |publisher=Asual.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.onthewings.net/2009/04/08/deep-linking-for-ajax/ | title=Deep Linking for AJAX |publisher=Blog.onthewings.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court rulings ==

Probably the earliest legal case arising out of deep-linking was the 1996 [[Scotland|Scottish]] case of ''[[The Shetland Times]] vs. [[The Shetland News]]'', in which the ''Times'' accused the ''News'' of appropriating stories on the ''Times''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; website as its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=BBC|title= Shetland Internet squabble settled out of court|date= 11 November 1997|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/29191.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a more extended discussion, see generally the Wikipedia article [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2006, in a case between the search engine [[Bixee.com]] and job site Naukri.com, the [[Delhi High Court]] in [[India]] prohibited Bixee.com from deeplinking to Naukri.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most important and widely cited U.S. opinions on deep linking are the Ninth Circuit's rulings in ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.]]''&lt;ref&gt;336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;487 F.3d 701 (9th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the court exonerated the use of deep linking. In the second of these cases, the court explained (speaking of defendant Google, whom Perfect 10 had also sued) why linking is not a copyright infringement under US law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Google does not…display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line linked images that appear on a user's computer screen. Because Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In other words, Google does not have any "material objects…in which a work is fixed…and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated" and thus cannot communicate a copy. Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML instructions that direct a user's browser to a website publisher's computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First, the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image. Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user's computer screen. The HTML merely gives the address of the image to the user's browser. The browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user's computer screen. Google may facilitate the user's access to infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner's display rights. …While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2006, a Texas court ruled that linking by a [[motocross]] website to videos on a Texas-based motocross video production website did not constitute fair use.  The court subsequently issued an injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6145744.html|title=Judge: Can't link to Webcast if copyright owner objects|accessdate=May 30, 2007|author=Declan McCullagh|publisher=News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case, SFX Motor Sports Inc., v. Davis, was not published in official reports, but is available at 2006 WL 3616983.

In a February 2006 ruling, the [[Denmark|Danish]] Maritime and Commercial Court ([[Copenhagen]]) found systematic [[web crawler|crawling]], indexing and deep-linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk not to conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the [[European Union]]. The Court stated that search engines are desirable for the functioning of the Internet, and that, when publishing information on the Internet, one must assume—and accept—that search engines deep-link to individual pages of one's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvhd.dk/uploads/tx_mocarticles/S_-_og_Handelsrettens_afg_relse_i_Ofir-sagen.pdf|title=Udskrift af SØ- &amp; Handelsrettens Dombog|language=Danish|accessdate=May 30, 2007|date=February 24, 2006|publisher=Bvhd.dk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012005033/http://www.bvhd.dk/uploads/tx_mocarticles/S_-_og_Handelsrettens_afg_relse_i_Ofir-sagen.pdf|archivedate=October 12, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opt out==
Web site owners who don't want search engines to deep link, or want them only to index specific pages can request so using the [[Robots Exclusion Standard]] (&lt;tt&gt;robots.txt&lt;/tt&gt; file).  People who favor deep linking often feel that content owners who don't provide a robots.txt file are implying by default that they do not object to deep linking either by search engines or others.{{cn|date=October 2015}} People against deep linking often claim that content owners may be unaware of the Robots Exclusion Standard or may not use robots.txt for other reasons.{{cn|date=October 2015}} Sites other than search engines can also deep link to content on other sites, so some question the relevance of the Robots Exclusion Standard to controversies about Deep Linking. The Robots Exclusion Standard does not programmatically enforce its directives so it does not prevent search engines and others who do not follow polite conventions from deep linking.

{{Accounting}}
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

A '''deferral''', in ''[[accrual accounting]]'', is any [[Account (accountancy)|account]] where the [[asset]] or [[liability (accounting)|liability]] is not realized until a future date ([[accounting period]]), e.g. [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuities]], [[fee|charges]], [[tax]]es, [[income]], etc. The deferred item may be carried, dependent on type of deferral, as either an asset or liability. See also [[accrual]].

Deferrals are the consequence of the [[Revenue recognition|revenue recognition principle]] which dictates that revenues be recognized in the period in which they occur, and the [[matching principle]] which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Deferrals are the result of [[cash flows]] occurring before they are allowed to be recognized under [[accrual accounting]]. As a result, adjusting entries are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] or [[assets]]. Because of the similarity between deferrals and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.

* Deferred expense: cash has left the company, but the event has not actually occurred yet. Prepaid expenses are the most common type. For instance, a company may purchase a year of insurance. After six months, only half of the insurance will have been 'used' with another six months of the insurance still owed to the company. Thus, the company records half of the payment as an outflow (an expense) and the other half as a receivable from the insurance company (an asset).
* Deferred revenue: Revenue has come into the company, but the event has still not occurred – it is unearned revenue. A magazine company, for instance, may receive money for a one-year subscription. However, the company has not spent the resources in producing and delivering those magazines and thus accountants record this revenue as a liability equal to the amount of cash received. The magazine company, while now having more cash on hand, also now owes a year of magazines. The amount of each magazine that gets delivered is then taken out of liabilities and recorded as revenue during the economic period in which it actually happens, not just when the company gets paid for it.

==Deferral (deferred charge)==
'''Deferred charge '''(or '''deferral''') is [[cost]] that is accounted-for in latter [[accounting period]] for its anticipated future benefit, or to comply with the requirement of [[matching principle|matching]] costs with [[revenues]]. ''Deferred charges'' include costs of [[Startup company|starting up]], obtaining long-term [[debt]], [[advertising]] campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet]] pending [[amortization]]. 
''Deferred charges'' often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike '''prepaid expenses''', e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial [[ratios]] are based on the total assets excluding ''deferred charges'' since they have no physical substance ([[cash]] realization) and cannot be used in reducing total [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Deferred expense==
A '''Deferred expense''' or '''prepayment''', '''prepaid expense''', plural often '''prepaids''', is an [[asset]] representing cash paid out to a counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later [[accounting period]].  For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, at the end of the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense.  In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment.&lt;ref name="NortonDiamond2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Curtis L. Norton|author2=Michael A. Diamond|author3=Donald P. Pagach|title=Intermediate accounting: financial reporting and analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wvxs17T5-D8C&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=2 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-618-72185-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deferred expense shares characteristics with [[Accrued Revenue|accrued revenue]] (or ''accrued assets'') with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related [[revenue]] item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from ''accrued revenues''.

For example, when the accounting periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid [[insurance]] cost is added to ''prepaid expenses'', which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an [[expense]], rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as ''prepayments'' (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period.

Similarly, cash paid out for (the cost of) goods and services not received by the end of the accounting period is added to the ''prepayments'' to prevent it from turning into a fictitious loss in the period cash was paid out, and into a fictitious profit in the period of their reception. Such cost is not recognized in the [[income statement]] (''profit and loss'' or P&amp;L) as the [[expense]] incurred in the period of payment, but in the period of their reception when such costs are recognized as expenses in [[P&amp;L]] and deducted from prepayments (assets) on [[balance sheets]].

==Deferred revenue==
'''Deferred revenue''' (or '''[[deferred income]]''') is a [[liability (accounting)|liability]], such as cash received from a counterpart for goods or services that are to be delivered in a later [[accounting period]]. When such income item is earned, the related [[revenue]] item is recognized, and the ''deferred revenue'' is reduced. It shares characteristics with ''accrued expense'' with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from ''accrued expenses''.

For example, a company receives an annual [[software license]] fee paid out by a customer upfront on the January 1. However, the company's [[fiscal year]] ends on May 31. So, the company using accrual accounting adds only five months' worth (5/12) of the fee to its [[revenues]] in [[profit and loss]] for the fiscal year the fee was received. The rest is added to ''[[deferred income]]'' (liability) on the [[balance sheet]] for that year.

A '''diktat''' is a statute, harsh penalty or settlement imposed upon a defeated party by the victor, or a dogmatic decree. The term has acquired a pejorative sense, to describe a set of rules dictated by a foreign power or an unpopular local power. The phrases "To impose its values" or "give orders" can be synonymous with giving a diktat.

==Origins==
The term is from the [[German language]], derived from the Latin past participle dictātum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WordReference Definition &amp; Etymology|url=http://www.wordreference.com/definition/diktat|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It arose from [[Dictatus Papae]], which attempts to resolve the struggle of the priesthood and the Empire in [[the Holy Roman Empire]].

==Historical use==
The term was used for the first time in 1919{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} in a French newspaper about the [[Treaty of Versailles]] imposed on the defeated Germany. 
It was particularly used in Germany to refer to that treaty. It was referred to as such because its terms were presented to Germany without allowing it to negotiate its terms. Other occurrences in Germany were the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] in 1919 and the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in 1807, and in Czech and Slovak for the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]].

However, the term came into popular journalism use during the years of the [[Cold War]] where there was talk of the [[politburo]] diktats from Moscow to describe and characterize the commands by the bureaucrats of the former USSR towards its satellite countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marples|first=David R.|title=Belarus : a denationalized nation|year=1999|publisher=Harwood Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9057023431|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in India with a very negative meaning. Police in [[Jharkhand]] have used it to describe rules enforced by local [[Maoists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maoists' diktat to villagers: Use traditional instruments, modern equipment is banned|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_maoists-diktat-to-villagers-use-traditional-instruments-modern-equipment-is-banned_1793949|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use was in referring to a directive from the Drug Controller General of India’s concerning launches of new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uncertainty clouds drug regulator’s diktat on launches|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/uncertainty-clouds-drug-regulators-diktat-on-launches/article4361523.ece?homepage=true&amp;ref=wl_home|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diktat is sometimes used in Europe to refer to directives of governments against large groups as in the case of the dispute between the [[European Union]] and [[Microsoft]] regarding license information on how Windows communicates over a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft finally bows down to EU diktat |url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Oct232007/business2007102231799.asp |accessdate=1 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Italy|Italian]] press, there is a wide use of diktat to refer to events of the political sphere. The term is used to refer to either union demands against politicians, to the demands of politicians towards its allies to achieve cohesion, or to refer to imposition of rules or acts of various kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The dictates of the CGIL Prodi: Raise taxes|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/diktat-cgil-prodi-alza-tasse.html|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] has accused the United States of endangering the international order by trying to "remake the whole world" for its own, Putin excoriated the United States for escalating world conflicts by "unilateral diktat" and imposing sanctions that he said were aimed at pushing Russia toward "economic weakness", while he denied that Russia aspires to rebuild an empire or reclaim its Cold War-era stature as a superpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia's Putin blames U.S. for destabilizing world order|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russias-putin-blames-us-for-destabilizing-world-order/2014/10/24/1c2e684f-6c00-41a0-8458-03533d644657_story.html|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
An '''employment consultant''' is an [[expert witness]] who advises courts and tribunals on employment related issues such as earnings, labour market analysis, residual earning capacity, and retraining. The main area involved is that of personal injury litigation where loss of earnings is an important component of a claim. Employment consultants give evidence on pre and post accident earnings, thus establishing a loss of earnings formula.  Employment consultants also deal with sex, race and [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|disability discrimination]], matrimonial matters and any case involving a loss or dispute of earnings. Increasingly, pay parity is a growth area.

Usually [[solicitor]]s will use an employment report to quantify the loss of earnings or ''Smith v. Manchester'' awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piba.org.uk/assets/docs2/S_M-piba.doc |title=Smith v. Manchester Awards |format=[[Microsoft Word]] [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] |accessdate=2008-08-08 |first=Andrew |last=Ritchie |date=April 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012142608/http://www.piba.org.uk/assets/docs2/S_M-piba.doc |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An employment consultant, like other experts witnesses, may be instructed by the solicitors for the claimant, the defendant, or as a jointly instructed expert, and may be required to give evidence under oath at trials and tribunal hearings.

Although employment consultants provide reports for many jurisdictions worldwide, the core areas are the countries using the [[common law]] system. Because of its different trial and compensation system for personal injury, the [[United States]] is less important than might be expected, and the main jurisdictions for which these experts prepare reports are [[English law|England and Wales]], [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[South Africa]]. Most employment experts are based in the UK.

This type of expertise was a growth area from the mid-1980s to the end of the 1990s, but was adversely affected by changes in the [[United Kingdom]], the most important area. These included the withdrawal of [[legal aid]] for most personal injury cases, which meant that lawyers operating on a "[[no win no fee]]" basis were less likely to take up claims or incur the additional costs. 

The [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]] also meant that the need for an [[expert report]] had to be sanctioned by a [[Judiciary of England and Wales#District judges|District Judge]], which, together with the introduction of joint instruction also reduced demand.

In the decade since the CPR a number of practitioners have diversified into associated areas such as case management, rehabilitation, and, increasingly, pay parity cases, following the wave of such cases initiated in the mid-2000s by [[trade union]]s and the controversial solicitor, Stefan Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Cohen |title=A lawyer's help to underpaid women is putting the wind up trade unions |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/careers/story/0,,1800949,00.html |work=[[The Observer]]  |date=2006-06-18 |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Greedy lawyers are making a fortune out of inequality |url=http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2007/01/16/38887/greedy-lawyers-are-making-a-fortune-out-of-inequality.html |work=Personnel Today |date=2007-01-16 |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent (2007) case of importance to employment consultants and personal injury [[solicitor]]s is [[Van Wees v Karkour and Walsh]]. This dealt with the medical aspects of post-traumatic amnesia, but also clarified the financial impact of mild head injury even on those who remain capable of high level work. The judge in the case also made an important ruling that awards to women should '''not''' be based on their current lower earnings compared to men in the same occupation, since that would perpetuate inequality in the face of [[Equal Pay Act 1970|equal pay legislation]].

'''Federal law''' is the body of [[law]] created by the [[federal government]] of a country. A federal government is formed when a group of political units, such as [[state (subnational)|states]] or [[provinces]] join together in a [[federation]], delegating their individual [[sovereignty]] and many powers to the [[central government]] while retaining or reserving other limited powers. As a result, two or more levels of government exist within an established geographic territory. The body of law of the common central government is the federal law.

Examples of federal governments include those of [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Republic of India]], [[Russia]], the former [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]].

== United States ==
{{Main|Law of the United States}}

The [[United States Constitution]] provides for a [[federal government]] that is superior to [[state government]]s with regard to its [[enumerated powers]]. These powers include the authority to govern [[international relations|international affairs]], [[commerce clause|interstate commerce]], the [[currency]] and [[defense (military)|national defense]]. After the [[American Civil War]], the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] applied the Constitution's [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to state governments. Legislation passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]], an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] of the [[President of the United States|President]], or a decision of [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] pursuant to the Constitution are federal law.

Through the system of checks and balances, it is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] makes final decisions regarding [[Law of the United States|federal laws]] regarding specific cases brought before them.  United States federal laws are [[Codification (law)|codified]] in the [[United States Code]].

'''Herman Oliphant''' (1884–1939) was a professor of law. He started at the [[University of Chicago]], going to [[Columbia University]] in 1922. He was originally from Forest, Indiana, the grandson of William Oliphant, an early pioneer of that area. Herman grew up on the family farm. In 1903, he graduated from Forest High School and attended Marion College. He returned home in 1905 to marry his childhood sweetheart, Julia Sims. In 1907, he graduated from Marion College and then went on to obtain degrees from Indiana University (1909) and his law degree from the University of Chicago in 1914. Shortly after his arrival at Columbia University, he wrote to the university's president, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], outlining some plans he had for reorganizing the curriculum of the law school. Essentially, his goal was to transform the school into a research center, placing particular emphasis on the interaction of the law and other social sciences. Under the administration of [[Huger Jervey]], who became dean of the law school in 1924, Oliphant's plans were used as the basis for a reorganization of the law school.

In his 1928 inaugural address as President of the American Association of Law School, Herman Oliphant said:  "Our case material is a gold mine for scientific work. It has not been scientifically exploited... We should critically examine all the methods now used in any of the social sciences and having any useful degree of objectivity."&lt;ref&gt;Herman Oliphant, A Return to Stare Decisis, 14 A.B.A. J. 71, 161 (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 he was co-author with [[Emily &amp; Theodore Hope Forest|Theodore S. Hope Jr.]] of "Study of Day Calendars" 1932, an in-depth look into how time effects trial cases.

Oliphant later went on to teach at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and later became the chief counsel of the [[United States Treasury Department]], serving in that capacity from 1934 to 1939. While serving in that position, he was regarded as an economic experimenter, and was the prime advocate of the [[Undistributed profits tax]].

While at the Treasury Department, he was lobbied by [[William Randolph Hearst]] to make [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] illegal. Hearst had recently become heavily involved in synthetics based on petroleum hydrocarbons, and wanted to quash efforts from competing companies to make similar products from hemp seed oil. Although that theory has been promoted for Oliphant's push for the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, his nephew Dr. Cleon O. Swayzee of Columbia University, in a 1984 interview stated two other reasons that took precedence for Oliphant's efforts. First was the influence of Oliphant's brother, Dr. Homer Oliphant, a physician who practiced in [[Forest, Indiana|Forest]] and [[Frankfort, Indiana]] and who was promoting the theory as early as 1919 that smoking was dangerous for the health of mothers and unborn babies. Granted Oliphant didn't do anything about smoking cigarettes. The second reason was that in the midst of the Great Depression with limited employment opportunities this endeavor was a vehicle to discourage immigration particularly from Mexico.

He is generally regarded as a representative of American [[legal realism]] and is famous for his statement that the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'' is no longer applicable. Although the approach could be implemented in a time when society was relatively simply structured, in the present age it should be abandoned. To this effect, Oliphant pleaded a scientific approach. In his opinion, the way a judge deals with a case can be qualified as a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus-response]] situation, in the sense that the judge reacts to the stimulus of the case brought to his attention.

He died on January 11, 1939, of heart disease at the age of 54. He is buried in Frankfort, Indiana.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6212">'''Indefeasible right of use''' (IRU) is a permanent [[contract]]ual agreement, that cannot be undone, between the owners of a communications system and a customer of that system. The word "indefeasible" means "not capable of being annulled, or voided, or undone." The customer purchases the right to use a certain amount of the capacity of the system, for a specified number of years. IRU contracts are almost always long term, commonly lasting 20 to 30 years. The communication system can be a wire cable, such as [[submarine communications cable]], or a fiber optic cable, or a satellite. Depending on the type of system the customer might be buying exclusive use of one, or more, wires in a wire cable, fibers in a fiber optic cable, or channels through a satellite.  An IRU owner can unconditionally and exclusively use the relevant capacity of the IRU grantor’s network for the specified time period.

These contracts obligate the purchaser to pay a portion of the operating costs, and the costs of maintaining the cable, including any costs incurred repairing the cable after mishaps. The right of use is indefeasible, so the capacity purchased is also nonreturnable, and maintenance costs incurred become payable and irrefusable.

==Definition of IRU==

The IRU "shall mean the exclusive, unrestricted, and indefeasible right to use the relevant capacity (including equipment, fibers or capacity) for any legal purpose."&lt;ref&gt;http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/athome/att.iru.1998.12.19.html&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] purchased after, for example, a submarine cable system has been sealed at the end of construction, and to the maintenance agreement (C&amp;MA) among the owners. It is a way for the owners to capitalize the unused capacity or any unowned capacity, after the system comes into service.

In plainer English, the purchase of an IRU gives the purchaser the right to use some capacity on a telecommunications cable system, including the right to lease that capacity to someone else.  Smaller companies that need a leased line between, say, London and New York do not buy an IRU – they lease capacity from a telecommunications company that themselves may lease a larger amount of capacity from another company (and so on), until at the end of the chain of contracts there is a company that has an IRU, or wholly owns a cable system.

''(extract from WSJ)'' Pioneered decades ago by AT&amp;T, IRUs allowed competitors to gain access to the costly undersea cables that only AT&amp;T could afford to build. There remains some controversy over booking IRUs as assets in an asset-swap transaction between companies. Since IRU's are technically rights to a physical part of a cable, they can be considered an asset, which means their cost isn't part of the company's operating results, but shows up under [[Fixed asset|tangible assets]].  The IRU is counted as though it is a part of the physical plant of the business buying the IRU.

== Dark Fiber IRU ==

The [[Dark fibre|Dark fiber]] (DF) IRU "shall mean the exclusive, unrestricted, and indefeasible right to use one, a pair, or more strands of fiber of a fiber cable for any legal purpose." With an IRU contractual arrangement the buyer of the IRU can unconditionally, and exclusively, use the fibers of the IRU for a long time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://its.ucsc.edu/core_tech/projects/dark_fiber/frequentlyaskedquestionsaboutdarkfiber.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703223637/http://its.ucsc.edu/core_tech/projects/dark_fiber/frequentlyaskedquestionsaboutdarkfiber.doc |archivedate=2010-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case [[dark fiber]] is called "dark" since it has to be lit by the IRU owner, not the cable's owner.

The wholesale purchase of dark fiber has normally been accomplished by means of IRUs. Fiber cable owners do not normally sell their fiber but offer IRUs for up to 20 years for unrestricted use. 10 to 25 years corresponds to a typical lifetime of the [[Optical fiber cable]] systems. The up-front cost for the purchase of a 20-year IRU can be a one-time investment. It will normally be associated with ongoing obligations for shared maintenance. Usually, the IRU can be considered to be a physical asset, which can be resold, traded or used as collateral.

For regulatory reasons, generally only licensed carriers are allowed access to support structures, and to municipal rights of way.

The IRU contract defines detailed technical and performance specifications for the IRU fibers. More specifically, it includes dark fiber acceptance and testing procedures, the description of the dark fiber physical route, operating specifications for the dark fiber infrastructure, performance specifications ([[attenuation]], [[Dispersion (optics)|Chromatic Dispersion]], [[Polarization Mode Dispersion]], [[Return loss|Optical Return Loss]]), maintenance and restoration terms. These terms must be valid for the full duration of the IRU contract. Moreover, it includes specific actions and procedures in cases of changes on the IRU grantor’s fiber network, degradation of fiber performance etc.

== Payment for IRU ==

* A lump sum payment corresponding to the DF construction cost and the use of the DF infrastructure for the IRU duration. This payment usually accounts for the greatest part of the IRU budget.
* A periodic (e.g. annual) fee corresponding to the maintenance services provided to IRU user by the IRU grantor. This is usually fixed or slightly increasing, taking into account a country’s inflation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.porta-optica.org/publications/POS-D3.2_Economical_analysis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">[[File:Mouat_Cover.jpg|thumb|Title page of Mouat's book with an engraving based on a sketch of John Andaman by [[Colesworthey Grant]]. The illustration also appeared in Harper's Weekly and the Illustrated London News. Mouat claimed that Grant's picture depicted the "mild, gentle, and benevolent" expression perfectly.]]
'''John Andaman''' or '''Jack Andaman''' (captured January 1858 and returned in the same year) was the name given to an [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] native (or Mincopie as then termed) who was taken captive aboard a British navy ship near Interview Island on a survey of the Andaman Islands under [[Frederic J. Mouat]]. He was taken to Calcutta and returned to the place of his capture when ill health began to torment him. It has been suggested that Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] described Tonga, an Andamanese native character, in his 1890 novel ''[[The Sign of Four]]''  based on Mouat's description of John Andaman.
== Context and capture==
In 1858, a British survey was undertaken to identify a suitable penal colony to deal with the large numbers of prisoners taken in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. The Andaman Islands were chosen. Although the islands had been surveyed by [[Robert Hyde Colebrooke]] and [[Archibald Blair]] in the past, it had not been permanently settled by the British. The survey aboard the ''Pluto'' began in November 1857 and was led by Frederic J. Mouat, George Playfair and Lieutenant J.A. Heathcote. The team also included French photographer Oscar Mallitte. When the group landed on Interview Island (Long Reef Island), they had judged to be a safe and friendly island on the accounts of J.H. Quigley titled ''Wanderings in the Islands of Interview, (Andaman), Little and Great Coco'' (1850). Mouat had asked Quigley if he would be interested to join the mission but he had refused. Quigley had reported the islanders to be very friendly and had written fantastic accounts of tigers, deer and fabulous plants which later led Mouat to make comparisons of the author with [[Baron Munchausen]]. While ashore, the team was attacked by the natives armed with arrows. They made a rapid exit and a second armed navy [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] moved in to keep the natives away. Heathcote was injured by an arrow to the thigh and in defence Mouat was forced to shoot a man he called the "chief". The natives finally pulled back but not before at least three were killed of which two of the bodies were taken aboard the navy boat. One of the natives, a strong swimmer, had managed to get quite close to the boat and when offered a strap and rope, he took it and came aboard. The crew called him "Jack" and the captive found company in ''Neptune'', the dog aboard the ship, an animal he was unfamiliar with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=72–73, 238–260  |url=https://archive.org/stream/adventuresresear00moua#page/238/mode/2up/|author=Mouat, Frederic J. | year=1863| publisher=Hurst and Blackett| place=London| title=Adventures and researches among the Andaman Islanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calcutta==
In Calcutta, they found that John Andaman recognized none of the words in the vocabulary of the Andamanese compiled by R.H. Colebrooke. He imitated well and learnt to dress (to the point that he began to be ashamed of nudity, his original state), wash and always behaved with propriety. When shown a photograph of himself, he laughed and turned it around to see if his back was seen as well. [[Charlotte Canning, Countess Canning|Lady Canning]] wrote that he was "gentle and tractable and imitates everything and is amused at everything from a glass of water upwards". Pictures of John Andaman appeared in many places including the ''Illustrated London News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2010.07.001|title=Colonization, kidnap and confinement in the Andamans penal colony, 1771–1864|journal=Journal of Historical Geography|volume=37|pages=68|year=2011|last1=Anderson|first1=Clare}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Careful anthropological measurements were taken of John and published in the journals of various scholarly journals.&lt;ref name=owen /&gt;

Mouat had photos of the two dead natives taken (and a copy went to [[Alexander von Humboldt]] who confirmed them to as "Negrilloes") and their skulls were preserved and taken with him to London where they were studied and described by Professor [[Richard Owen]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=owen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Osteology and Dentition of the Aborigines of the Andaman Islands, and the Relations Thereby Indicated to Other Races of Mankind| author=Owen, Richard| journal=Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London| volume=2| year=1863| pages=34–49| jstor=3014305 |url=https://archive.org/stream/transactionseth01londgoog#page/n50/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As for John Andaman, the government report stated:&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite book|title=Selections from the Records of the Government of India (Home Department). Number XXV. The Andaman Islands; with notes on Barren Island| place=Calcutta| publisher=Baptist Mission Press| year=1859 |pages=19 |url=https://archive.org/stream/TheAndamanIslands/The%20Andaman%20Islands#page/n37/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|One of the natives, when in the water, seized a strap thrown to him from the second cutter, and was taken on board. The Committee deliberated anxiously as to disposal of this man, whether to release, or to carry him to Calcutta. They ultimately decided on the latter course as the one required by the interests of humanity, although attended with hardship to the individual, until he can he instructed sufficiently to know the reasons which led to his removal from his country and his kindred.}}

== Repatriation ==

John suffered in Calcutta and frequently took ill. He had cholera and then a lung infection leading to a decision by the Governor General to have him sent back from where he had been taken. There had been hope that he would spread the message of his captors' kindness among the natives with whom the British had failed to make any peace. Nothing was heard again about John.&lt;ref name=owen /&gt;

Fifty copies of the photographs taken by Oscar Mallitte both on the journey to the Andamans as well as at Calcutta were made and these were thought to have been lost until one set was discovered in 2005 by a new curator appointed to the Queen's Collection at Windsor Castle. The set includes three photos of John Andaman including one in which he is dressed in a navy uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=History Workshop Journal|year= 2009|volume= 67 |issue=1|pages= 152–172| title= Oscar Mallitte's Andaman Photographs, 1857–8|author=Anderson, Clare|doi=10.1093/hwj/dbn078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Sign of Four'' (1890), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses deprecating language almost identical to that used by Mouat to describe the character Tonga, an Andamanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sign of Four|author=Doyle, Arthur Conan| publisher=Broadview Press| year=2010| page=35|editor=Towheed, Shafquat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Joseph''' (15 November 1932 – 6 May 1998) was the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop]] of [[Faisalabad]] from 1984–1998 and was best known for committing suicide to protest the [[Persecution of Christians#Pakistan|cruel treatment of Christians]] in Pakistan.

After completing a doctorate he went on to serve on the faculty of the Christ the King Seminary. On 24 October 1980 he was appointed Auxiliary [[Bishop]] of Faisalabad and ordained Bishop on 9 January 1981.  On 9 January 1984 he became Bishop of Faisalabad. He committed suicide by shooting himself on 6 May 1998, in protest at the execution of a [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christian]] man on trumped up [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy]] charges by Muslims in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Blasphemy Law in Pakistan | url=http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/blasphem.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jones 2003, p. 19"&gt;[[Bennett-Jones, Owen]] (2003).

== After death ==
Three new publications on Bishop John Joseph have been published since the bishop's death. "A Peaceful Struggle" is a compilation of the bishop's writings on matters related to justice and peace. The 197-page book was compiled by the Faisalabad diocesan human rights office, led by Father Khalid Rashid Asi. A translation of the English-language book into [[Urdu]] has also been published.
The third book, "Sermons in Blood," is a 110-page book written by labor activist Gulzar Wafa Chaudhry. Chaudhry attempts to keep alive the revolutionary spirit that Bishop Joseph tried to initiate in protest at the situation of [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christians]] and other religious minority communities in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =UCANews.com May 27, 1999|url= http://www.ucanews.com/1999/05/27/new-books-seek-to-keep-alive-memory-of-late-bishop-john-joseph/?key=faisalabad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film showing Bishop John Joseph's struggles for minority rights was screened  at the South Asian film festival in [[Kathmandu]] October 4–7, 2001. The 45-minute documentary "A Sun Sets in" was produced by Waseem Anthony and showed the life of the late Bishop, the first Punjabi bishop, and his struggle for [[Pakistani Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =UCANews.com October 13, 2001|url =http://www.ucanews.com/2001/10/13/film-festival-presents-social-issues-in-south-asia-including-a-bishops-struggle/?key=faisalabad}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bishop John Joseph Memorial Hall in Darulaloom Jamia Rehmania madrassa in Faisalabad, was inaugurated on March 31, 2007. Bishop [[Joseph Coutts]] was present during the opening. No other Islamic seminary in the country has a building named after a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =UCANews.com October 26, 2007  |url= http://www.ucanews.com/2007/10/26/church-hosts-ramadan-celebrations-for-muslims/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Bishop John Joseph's advice Mr. Aftab Alexander Mughal and Mr. Peter Jacob wrote a book, ''[[Section 295 C, Pakistan Penal Code]] – Study of the History, Effects and Cases under Blasphemy Laws in Pakistan'', which was published in 1995.

The '''Judge Advocate of the Fleet''' was an appointed civilian [[judge]] who was responsible for the supervision and superintendence of the [[court martial]] system in the [[Royal Navy]] from 1663 to 2008. 

==History==
The position dates to the sixteenth century but was filled on an occasional basis until 1663 when it became a permanent role. Appointments were by Admiralty Order and included an annual stipend worth £146 between 1663 and 1666, and £182 thereafter. From 1824 the Judge Advocate also held office as Counsel to the Admiralty.&lt;ref name=sainty/&gt;

Until 2004 the Judge Advocate shared responsibility for the naval court martial system with the '''Chief Naval Judge Advocate''', a legally trained serving naval [[commissioned officer|officer]] who was responsible for the appointment of judge advocates. However the Chief Naval Judge Advocate's post was abolished in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Naval Discipline Act 1957 (Remedial) Order 2004, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2004/20040066.htm SI 2004/66] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012073127/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2004/20040066.htm |date=2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following a ruling by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] that held that, as a serving naval officer, his position was insufficiently [[judicial independence|independent]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grieves v. United Kingdom'' (N° 57067/00)
Judgment 16.12.2003 [Grand Chamber]&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of 'Judge Advocate of the Fleet was taken over by the [[Judge Advocate General (United Kingdom)|Judge Advocate General]] from 2004 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about_judiciary/roles_types_jurisdiction/military_justice/index.htm |publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales |title=Military Justice |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-07-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413180525/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about_judiciary/roles_types_jurisdiction/military_justice/index.htm |archivedate=2008-04-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally abolished on 31 December 2008 under the [[Armed Forces Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;S.272(2)/ Sch.8; s.378(2)/ Sch.17; Armed Forces Act 2006 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2007, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20072913_en_1 SI 2007/2913] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908054302/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20072913_en_1 |date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4614">'''Microsoft Media Server''' ('''MMS'''), a Microsoft [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] network-streaming protocol, serves to transfer [[unicast]] data in [[Windows Media Services]] (previously called '''NetShow Services'''). MMS can be transported via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. The MMS default [[TCP and UDP port|port]] is [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|UDP/TCP 1755]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc875824.aspx|title=Network Ports Used by Key Microsoft Server Products|accessdate=2017-09-29|author=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft deprecated MMS in favor of [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] (TCP/UDP port 554) in 2003 with the release of the Windows Media Services 9 Series, but continued to support the MMS for some time in the interest of [[backward compatibility]]. Support for the protocol was finally dropped in [[Windows Media Services]] 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/licensing/netprokit.aspx#TechnicalSpecificationDelivery Microsoft's Windows Media Networking Protocols Porting Kit]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2012}} Microsoft still recommends&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; using "mms://" as a "protocol rollover&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa390673.aspx Microsoft's Windows Media Format 11 SDK Protocol Rollover]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]". As part of protocol rollover a [[Windows Media Player]] version 9, 10, or 11 client opening an "mms://" URL will attempt to connect first with RTSP over UDP and if that fails it will attempt RTSP over TCP. After an RTSP attempt fails, Windows Media Player versions 9 and 10 will attempt MMS over UDP, then MMS over TCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa390673(VS.85).aspx|title=Protocol Rollover|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If using Windows Media Player 11 and an [[RTSP]] attempt fails, or if using a previous version of Windows Media Player and MMS fails, a modified version of a [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] over TCP connection will be attempted. This modified version is referred to by some third parties as MMSH,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} and by Microsoft as MS-WMSP (Windows Media HTTP Streaming Protocol).&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc251059.aspx Windows Media HTTP Streaming Protocol Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uniform resource identifier|uniform resource identifier (URI)]] scheme &lt;code&gt;mms&lt;/code&gt; has also been proposed to be used for the unrelated [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wugofski-mms-uri-scheme draft-wugofski-mms-uri-scheme-00 - MMS URI Schemes]. Tools.ietf.org. Retrieved on 2014-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years developers of the [[SDP Multimedia]] download-tool [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] the MMS protocol and published unofficial documentation for it. However, Microsoft finally released the protocol specification in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdp.ppona.com/news2008.html SDP multimedia news update 2008]. Sdp.ppona.com (2008-02-08).

The '''Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust''' ({{lang-cy|Ymddiriedolaeth Elusennol Stadiwm y Mileniwm}}) is a [[charitable trust]] based in [[Wales]], which was established 8 February 2001 and is registered with the [[Charity Commission]]. The Trust was established between the [[Millennium Stadium]] plc and the [[Millennium Commission]] when the Millennium Stadium was built in 1999.&lt;ref name="Stadium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3540.php |publisher=Millennium Stadium plc |title=Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust |accessdate=2008-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509194220/http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3540.php |archivedate=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The Trust assesses any application it receives against the following criteria: [[quality of life]], knowledge and need, passion and value, leaving a legacy, life exchanges and working with [[disadvantaged]] people.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.welshasa.co.uk/docs/The%20Millennium%20Stadium%20Charitable%20Trust.doc|publisher= Swim Wales (Welsh Amateur Swimming Association)|title= Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust|accessdate= 2008-06-15|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111004085653/http://www.welshasa.co.uk/docs/The%20Millennium%20Stadium%20Charitable%20Trust.doc|archivedate= 4 October 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust only supports applications from [[Non-profit organization|non-profit making organisations]], [[Non-governmental organization|voluntary organisations]], [[Charitable organization|charitable organisations]], voluntary groups working alongside [[Local government|local authorities]].&lt;ref name="Welsh" /&gt; Priority however is given to organisations working in disadvantaged communities and to youth programmes in sport, arts, the environment and the community. Local, regional and national organisations can apply for funding, and they can receive up to GB£2,000, £10,000 and £20,000 respectively.&lt;ref name="Trust"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.millenniumstadiumtrust.co.uk/en/fe/page.asp?n1=4|publisher= Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust|title= Funding Levels|accessdate= 2008-06-15|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080610125129/http://www.millenniumstadiumtrust.co.uk/en/fe/page.asp?n1=4|archivedate= 10 June 2008|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust does not support any project outside Wales, any [[operating cost]]s of a project, projects for third party organisations, any requests for payment of debts, retrospective requests for grants, requests from individuals, profit making organisations or requests made solely by local authorities.&lt;ref name="Welsh" /&gt;

==Revenue and grants==

The predecessor trust was established in July 1996, to support local charitable activities in Wales and it received 10% of distributable profit from Millennium Stadium plc.&lt;ref name="Conrete"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o0BsU6JbpYAC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=national+lottery+commission+Millennium+stadium+for+the+construction+of+the+club+ground.&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U2vgwZWq84tb9X_fC20S3dwm5W2KA#PPA224,M1 |publisher= Google Books and [[Concrete Society]]|title= Stadia, Arenas and Grandstands By P. Thompson, J. J. A. Tolloczko, Jean Benedetti, J. N. Clarke, Concrete Society |accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trust became the Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust on 8 February 2001, and its income also comes from a levy of GB£0.25 or 1%, whichever is greater,&lt;ref name="Conrete"/&gt; paid on every ticket that is sold at public events held at the Millennium Stadium.&lt;ref name="Stadium" /&gt; On 22 June&amp;nbsp;2007, the Chairman of the Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust, [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] announced, "The Trust has now been able to distribute £2 million to more than 500 individual projects".&lt;ref name="Union"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wru.co.uk/10351_12441.php|publisher= Welsh Rugby Union Limited|title= Charitable Trust makes milestone announcement|accessdate= 2008-06-15|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905132308/http://www.wru.co.uk/10351_12441.php|archivedate= 5 September 2008|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mineral''' is a naturally occurring [[chemical compound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hans-Rudolf |last1=Wenk |first2=Andrei |last2=Bulakh |title=Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn= 9780521529587|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually of [[crystal]]line form and [[abiogenic|not produced by life processes]]. A  mineral has one specific [[chemical composition]], whereas a [[rock (geology)|rock]] can be an [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] of different minerals or [[mineraloid]]s. The study of minerals is called [[mineralogy]].

Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. As of November 2018, there are [[List of minerals (complete)|more than 5,500]] known mineral ''species'';&lt;ref name="rruff1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rruff.info/ima/ |title=IMA Database of Mineral Properties/ RRUFF Project |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Department of Geosciences, University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5,389 of these have been approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrmima.nrm.se//imalist.htm | title=The New IMA List of Minerals  – A Work in Progress | publisher=[[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]] – CNMNC (Commission on New Minerals Nomenclature and Classification) | work=The New IMA List of Minerals | date=September 2018 | accessdate=2 November 2018 | author=Pasero, Marco et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minerals are distinguished by various [[Chemical property|chemical]] and [[physical property|physical properties]]. Differences in [[chemical composition]] and [[crystal structure]] distinguish the various species, which were determined by the mineral's geological environment when formed. Changes in the temperature, pressure, or bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in its minerals. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral ''variety'',&lt;ref name="MinVar1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/mineral_variety | title=Definition of mineral variety | publisher=mindat.org | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[amethyst]], a purple variety of the mineral species [[quartz]].

Minerals can be described by their various physical properties, which are related to their chemical structure and composition. Common distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and [[Crystal habit|habit]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[diaphaneity]], colour, [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]], [[Tenacity (mineralogy)|tenacity]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[Fracture (mineralogy)|fracture]], parting, [[specific gravity]], [[magnetism]], taste or smell, [[radioactivity]], and [[acid|reaction to acid]].

Minerals are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. [[Silicon]] and [[oxygen]] constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of [[silicate minerals]]. The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/mineral-chemical-compound/Silicates&lt;/ref&gt; The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the degree of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymerization]] in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen [[anion]]s, which gives the shape of a [[tetrahedron]]. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), inosilicates (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the [[Native element minerals|native elements]], [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]], [[Oxide minerals|oxides]], [[Halide minerals|halides]], [[Carbonate minerals|carbonates]], [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]], and [[Phosphate minerals|phosphates]].

==Definition==

===Basic definition===
One definition of a mineral encompasses the following criteria:&lt;ref name="DG2_4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mineralogy and Optical Mineralogy|last = Dyar, Gunter, and Tasa|first = |publisher = Mineralogical Society of America|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0939950812|location = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Formed by a natural process ([[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] compounds are excluded).
#[[thermodynamic stability|Stable or metastable]] at [[room  temperature]] (25&amp;nbsp;°C). In the simplest sense, this means the mineral must be solid. Classical examples of exceptions to this rule include native [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which crystallizes at −39&amp;nbsp;°C, and water ice, which is solid only below 0&amp;nbsp;°C; because these two minerals were described before 1959, they were grandfathered by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2647.html |title=Mercury |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2001.html |title=Ice |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern advances have included extensive study of [[liquid crystals]], which also extensively involve mineralogy.
#Represented by a [[chemical formula]]. Minerals are chemical compounds, and as such they can be described by fixed or a variable formula. Many mineral groups and species are composed of a solid solution; pure substances are not usually found because of contamination or chemical substitution. For example, the [[olivine]] group is described by the variable formula (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a solid solution of two end-member species, magnesium-rich [[forsterite]] and iron-rich [[fayalite]], which are described by a fixed chemical formula. Mineral species themselves could have a variable composition, such as the sulfide [[mackinawite]], (Fe, Ni)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, which is mostly a ferrous sulfide, but has a very significant nickel impurity that is reflected in its formula.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2512.html|title=Mackinawite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Ordered atomic arrangement. This generally means [[crystallinity|crystalline]]; however, crystals are also periodic, so the broader criterion is used instead.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; An ordered atomic arrangement gives rise to a variety of [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] physical properties, such as crystal form, hardness, and cleavage.&lt;ref name="CL13-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several recent proposals to classify biogenic or [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] substances as minerals. The formal definition of a mineral approved by the IMA in 1995: "A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes."&lt;ref name=Nickel&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nickel |first = Ernest H. |title = The definition of a mineral |journal = The Canadian Mineralogist |volume = 33 |issue = 3 |pages = 689–90 |date = 1995 |url = https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/canmin/article-abstract/33/3/689/12679/the-definition-of-a-mineral?redirectedFrom=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Usually [[abiogenic]] (not resulting from the activity of living organisms). Biogenic substances are explicitly excluded by the IMA: "Biogenic substances are chemical compounds produced entirely by biological processes without a geological component (e.g., urinary calculi, oxalate crystals in plant tissues, shells of marine molluscs, etc.) and are not regarded as minerals. However, if geological processes were involved in the genesis of the compound, then the product can be accepted as a mineral."&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;

The first three general characteristics are less debated than the last two.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;

===Recent advances===
Mineral classification schemes and their definitions are evolving to match recent advances in mineral science. Recent changes have included the addition of an organic class, in both the new Dana and the [[Strunz classification]] schemes.&lt;ref name=Dana&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Classification 8th edition – Organic Compounds|url=http://www.mindat.org/dana.php?a=50|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strunz&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickel-Strunz Classification - silicates (Germanates) 10th edition|url=https://www.mindat.org/strunz.php?a=9|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic class includes a very rare group of minerals with [[hydrocarbons]]. The IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names adopted in 2009 a hierarchical scheme for the naming and classification of mineral groups and group names and established seven commissions and four working groups to review and classify minerals into an official listing of their published names.&lt;ref name="Mills09" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html IMA divisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810045840/http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html |date=2011-08-10 }}. Ima-mineralogy.org (2011-01-12). Retrieved on 2011-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to these new rules, "mineral species can be grouped in a number of different ways, on the basis of chemistry, crystal structure, occurrence, association, genetic history, or resource, for example, depending on the purpose to be served by the classification."&lt;ref name="Mills09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mills | first1=J. S. | last2=Hatert | first2=F. | last3=Nickel | first3=E. H. | last4=Ferraris | first4=G. | title=The standardisation of mineral group hierarchies: application to recent nomenclature proposals | journal=European Journal of Mineralogy | volume=21 | pages=1073–80 | doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2009/0021-1994 | date=2009 | issue=5 | bibcode=2009EJMin..21.1073M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nickel (1995){{huh|date=September 2017}} exclusion of biogenic substances was not universally adhered to. For example, Lowenstam (1981) stated that "organisms are capable of forming a diverse array of minerals, some of which cannot be formed inorganically in the biosphere."&lt;ref name="Lowenstam81"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Lowenstam | last1=H. A. | title=Minerals formed by organisms | journal=Science | date=1981 | volume=211 | issue=4487 | pages=1126–31 | doi=10.1126/science.7008198 | jstor=1685216 | pmid=7008198|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1126L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is a matter of classification and less to do with the constituents of the minerals themselves. Skinner (2005) views all solids as potential minerals and includes [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] in the mineral kingdom, which are those that are created by the metabolic activities of organisms. Skinner expanded the previous definition of a mineral to classify "element or compound, amorphous or crystalline, formed through ''[[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] '' processes," as a mineral.&lt;ref name="Skinner05" /&gt;

Recent advances in high-resolution [[genetics]] and [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] are providing revelations on the biogeochemical relations between [[microorganism]]s and minerals that may make Nickel's (1995) biogenic mineral exclusion obsolete and Skinner's (2005) biogenic mineral inclusion a necessity.&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinner05"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Skinner | first1=H. C. W. | title=Biominerals | journal=Mineralogical Magazine | volume=69 | issue=5 | pages=621–41| doi=10.1180/0026461056950275 | date=2005 | bibcode=2005MinM...69..621S }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the IMA-commissioned "Working Group on Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry " deals with minerals in the [[hydrosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Group on Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry|url=https://www.ima-mineralogy.org/WGEMG_objectives.htm|website=Commissions, working groups and committees|publisher=International Mineralogical Association|accessdate=4 April 2018|language=en|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's scope includes [[Biomineralization|mineral-forming microorganisms]], which exist on nearly every rock, soil, and particle surface spanning the globe to depths of at least 1600 metres below the [[Seabed|sea floor]] and 70 kilometres into the [[stratosphere]] (possibly entering the [[mesosphere]]).&lt;ref name="Takai10"&gt;{{cite book | last=Takai | first=K. | chapter=Limits of life and the biosphere: Lessons from the detection of microorganisms in the deep sea and deep subsurface of the Earth. | title=Origins and Evolution of Life: An Astrobiological Perspective | editor1-last=Gargaud | editor1-first=M. | editor2-last=Lopez-Garcia | editor2-first=P. | editor3-last=Martin | editor3-first=H. | pages=469–86 | date=2010 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK |isbn= 9781139494595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roussel08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Roussel | first1=E.

===Rocks, ores, and gems===
[[File:Sillimanite-199671.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Schist]] is a [[metamorphic rock]] characterized by an abundance of platy minerals. In this example, the rock has prominent [[sillimanite]] [[porphyroblast]]s as large as {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.]]
Minerals are not equivalent to rocks. A [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is an aggregate of one or more minerals&lt;ref name="ChL15-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as [[limestone]] or [[quartzite]], are composed primarily of one mineral—[[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] in the case of limestone, and [[quartz]] in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 719–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 747–48&lt;/ref&gt; Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a [[granite]] is defined by proportions of quartz, [[alkali feldspar]], and [[plagioclase feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 694–96&lt;/ref&gt; The other minerals in the rock are termed accessory, and do not greatly affect the bulk composition of the rock. Rocks can also be composed entirely of non-mineral material; [[coal]] is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of organically derived carbon.&lt;ref name="ChL15-16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 728–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In rocks, some mineral species and groups are much more abundant than others; these are termed the rock-forming minerals. The major examples of these are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, the [[mica]]s, the [[amphibole]]s, the [[pyroxene]]s, the [[olivine]]s, and calcite; except for the last one, all of these minerals are silicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, around 150 minerals are considered particularly important, whether in terms of their abundance or aesthetic value in terms of collecting.&lt;ref name="ChL14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially valuable minerals and rocks are referred to as [[industrial minerals]]. For example, [[muscovite]], a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, pp. 531–32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ore]]s are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), an ore of tin. [[gemstone|Gem]]s are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] are both [[corundum]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ChL14-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature and classification===
Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. The basic level of definition is that of mineral species, each of which is distinguished from the others by unique chemical and physical properties. For example, quartz is defined by its [[Chemical formula|formula]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a specific [[Crystal structure|crystalline structure]] that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). When there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined. For example, the [[biotite]] series is represented by variable amounts of the [[endmembers]] [[phlogopite]], [[siderophyllite]], [[annite]], and [[eastonite]]. In contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure. The [[pyroxene]] group has a common  formula of XY(Si,Al)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, where X and Y are both cations, with X typically [[ionic radius|bigger]] than Y; the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates that crystallize in either the [[orthorhombic]] or [[monoclinic]] crystal systems. Finally, a mineral variety is a specific type of mineral species that differs by some physical characteristic, such as colour or crystal habit. An example is [[amethyst]], which is a purple variety of quartz.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common classifications, Dana and Strunz, are used for minerals; both rely on composition, specifically with regards to important chemical groups, and structure. [[James Dwight Dana]], a leading geologist of his time, first published his ''System of Mineralogy'' in 1837; as of 1997, it is in its eighth edition. The Dana classification assigns a four-part number to a mineral species. Its class number is based on important compositional groups; the type gives the ratio of cations to anions in the mineral, and the last two numbers group minerals by structural similarity within a given type or class. The less commonly used [[Strunz classification]], named for German mineralogist [[Karl Hugo Strunz]], is based on the Dana system, but combines both chemical and structural criteria, the latter with regards to distribution of chemical bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp 558–59&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|11}}, 5,389 mineral species are approved by the IMA.&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"/&gt; They are most commonly named after a person (45%), followed by discovery location (23%); names based on chemical composition (14%) and physical properties (8%) are the two other major groups of mineral name etymologies.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "species" (from the Latin ''species'', "a particular sort, kind, or type with distinct look, or appearance")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/species|website=etymonline|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the classification scheme in ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. He divided the natural world into three kingdoms &amp;ndash; plants, animals, and minerals &amp;ndash; and classified each with the same hierarchy.&lt;ref name="wilk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilk|first1=H|editor1-last=Wilk|editor1-first=H|title=The Magic of Minerals|date=1986|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-64783-3|page=154|format=Hardcover|chapter=Systematic Classification of Minerals|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In descending order, these were Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Tribe, Genus, and Species.

==Chemistry==
[[File:Hubnerite-Quartz-216455.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Hübnerite]], the manganese-rich end-member of the [[wolframite]] series, with minor quartz in the background]]
The abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry, in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the Earth. The majority of minerals observed are derived from the Earth's crust. Eight elements account for most of the key components of minerals, due to their abundance in the crust. These eight elements, summing to over 98% of the crust by weight, are, in order of decreasing abundance: [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. Oxygen and silicon are by far the two most important – oxygen composes 47% of the crust by weight, and silicon accounts for 28%.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The minerals that form are directly controlled by the bulk chemistry of the parent body. For example, a [[magma]] rich in iron and magnesium will form [[mafic]] minerals, such as olivine and the pyroxenes; in contrast, a more silica-rich magma will crystallize to form minerals that incorporate more SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as the feldspars and quartz. In a [[limestone]], [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] (both CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form because the rock is rich in calcium and carbonate.  A corollary is that a mineral will not be found in a rock whose bulk chemistry does not resemble the bulk chemistry of a given mineral with the exception of trace minerals. For example, [[kyanite]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; forms from the [[metamorphism]] of aluminium-rich [[shale]]s; it would not likely occur in aluminium-poor rock, such as [[quartzite]].

The chemical composition may vary between [[Endmember (mineralogy)|end member]] species of a [[solid solution]] series. For example, the [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]s comprise a continuous series from [[sodium]]-rich end member [[albite]] (NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[calcium]]-rich [[anorthite]] (CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): [[oligoclase]], [[andesine]], [[labradorite]], and [[bytownite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the [[wolframite]] series of [[manganese]]-rich [[hübnerite]] and iron-rich [[ferberite]].

Chemical substitution and coordination polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals. In nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements are present in the given chemical system. As a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge; for example, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will not substitute for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by a big difference in size and charge. A common example of chemical substitution is that of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which are close in charge, size, and abundance in the crust. In the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution. Feldspars are all framework silicates, which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1, and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to give a base unit of [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; without the substitution, the formula would be charge-balanced as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, giving quartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra. The second substitution occurs between Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; however, the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination polyhedra are geometric representations of how a cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; surrounded by four O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: in the case of the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where the compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination with oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination numbers because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last [[Atomic orbital|orbital subshell]] of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure, such as in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and [[garnet]], will change to a [[perovskite structure]], where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Other examples are the aluminosilicates [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] (polymorphs, since they share the formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which differ by the coordination number of the Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"/&gt; In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaolinite-Orthoclase-lw18c.jpg|thumb|When minerals react, the products will sometimes assume the shape of the reagent; the product mineral is termed a pseudomorph of (or after) the reagent. Illustrated here is a pseudomorph of [[kaolinite]] after [[orthoclase]]. Here, the pseudomorph preserved the Carlsbad [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] common in orthoclase.]]

Changes in temperature and pressure and composition alter the mineralogy of a rock sample. Changes in composition can be caused by processes such as [[weathering]] or [[metasomatism]] ([[hydrothermal alteration]]). Changes in temperature and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes [[tectonic]] or [[magmatic]] movement into differing physical regimes. Changes in [[thermodynamic]] conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals; as such, it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy. This process of mineralogical alteration is related to the [[rock cycle]]. An example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows.&lt;ref name="DG549"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthoclase]] feldspar (KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral commonly found in [[granite]], a [[plutonic]] [[igneous rock]]. When exposed to weathering, it reacts to form [[kaolinite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a sedimentary mineral, and [[silicic acid]]):

:2 KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Under low-grade metamorphic conditions, kaolinite reacts with quartz to form [[pyrophyllite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

As metamorphic grade increases, the pyrophyllite reacts to form kyanite and quartz:

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Alternatively, a mineral may change its crystal structure as a consequence of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, and [[coesite]] at high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Classifying minerals ranges from simple to difficult. A mineral can be identified by several physical properties, some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation. In other cases, minerals can only be classified by more complex [[Optical mineralogy|optical]], chemical or [[X-ray diffraction]] analysis; these methods, however, can be costly and time-consuming.  Physical properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage and fracture, and specific gravity. Other less general tests include [[fluorescence]], [[phosphorescence]], [[magnetism]], [[radioactivity]], tenacity (response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form), [[piezoelectricity]] and reactivity to dilute [[acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Topaz-235220.jpg|right|thumb|[[Topaz]] has a characteristic orthorhombic elongated crystal shape.]]
[[Crystal structure]] results from the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral. This crystal structure is based on regular internal atomic or [[ion]]ic arrangement that is often expressed in the geometric form that the crystal takes. Even when the mineral grains are too small to see or are irregularly shaped, the underlying crystal structure is always periodic and can be determined by [[X-ray]] diffraction.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; Minerals are typically described by their symmetry content. Crystals are [[crystallographic restriction theorem|restricted]] to [[Crystallographic point group|32 point groups]], which differ by their symmetry. These groups are classified in turn into more broad categories, the most encompassing of these being the six crystal families.&lt;ref name="DG69-80"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 69–80&lt;/ref&gt;

These families can be described by the relative lengths of the three crystallographic axes, and the angles between them; these relationships correspond to the symmetry operations that define the narrower point groups. They are summarized below; a, b, and c represent the axes, and α, β, γ represent the angle opposite the respective crystallographic axis (e.g. α is the angle opposite the a-axis, [[wikt:viz.|viz.]] the angle between the b and c axes):&lt;ref name="DG69-80" /&gt;

The hexagonal crystal family is also split into two crystal ''systems'' – the [[trigonal]], which has a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the hexagonal, which has a six-fold axis of symmetry.

Chemistry and crystal structure together define a mineral. With a restriction to 32 point groups, minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure. For example, [[halite]] (NaCl), [[galena]] (PbS), and [[periclase]] (MgO) all belong to the hexaoctahedral point group (isometric family), as they have a similar [[stoichiometry]] between their different constituent elements. In contrast, [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure. For example, [[pyrite]] and [[marcasite]], both iron sulfides, have the formula FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; however, the former is isometric while the latter is orthorhombic. This polymorphism extends to other sulfides with the generic AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formula; these two groups are collectively known as the pyrite and marcasite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 654–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymorphism can extend beyond pure symmetry content. The aluminosilicates are a group of three minerals – [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] – which share the chemical formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These differences arise corresponding to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination with oxygen. Silicon, as a general rule, is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 631–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in crystal structure and chemistry greatly influence other physical properties of the mineral. The carbon allotropes [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted for by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker [[van der Waals force]]s, and this discrepancy translates to large macroscopic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinel-4mb4c.jpg|Contact twins, as seen in [[spinel]]|left|thumb]]

[[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is the intergrowth of two or more crystals of a single mineral species. The geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped [[staurolite]] twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. This type of twinning occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twins through the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, polysynthetic twinning occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.&lt;ref name="DG4143"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal habit refers to the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to describe this property. Common habits include acicular, which describes needlelike crystals as in [[natrolite]], bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in [[native copper]]), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardness===
{{main article|Mohs scale of mineral hardness}}
[[File:Rough diamond.jpg|right|thumb|Diamond is the hardest natural material, and has a Mohs hardness of 10.]]
The hardness of a mineral defines how much it can resist scratching. This physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral. A mineral's hardness is not necessarily constant for all sides, which is a function of its structure; crystallographic weakness renders some directions softer than others.&lt;ref name="DG2829"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this property exists in kyanite, which has a Mohs hardness of 5½ parallel to [001] but 7 parallel to [100].&lt;ref name="Kyanite"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2303.html|title=Kyanite|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=[[Mindat.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common scale of measurement is the ordinal Mohs hardness scale. Defined by ten indicators, a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it. The scale ranges from talc, a [[phyllosilicate]], to diamond, a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material. The scale is provided below:&lt;ref name="DG2829"/&gt;

===Lustre and diaphaneity===
{{main article|Lustre (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Pyrite 2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pyrite]] has a metallic lustre.]]
Lustre indicates how light reflects from the mineral's surface, with regards to its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are [[galena]] and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: adamantine, such as in [[diamond]]; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in [[talc]] and [[apophyllite]]; resinous, such as members of the garnet group; silky which is common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform [[chrysotile]].&lt;ref name="DG2628"&gt;Dyar and Darby, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[diaphaneity]] of a mineral describes the ability of light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through them. An example of a transparent mineral is [[muscovite]] (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent. [[Jadeite]] and [[nephrite]] (mineral forms of [[jade]] are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DG25"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The diaphaneity of a mineral depends on the thickness of the sample. When a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g., in a [[thin section]] for [[petrography]]), it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in a hand sample. In contrast, some minerals, such as [[hematite]] or pyrite, are opaque even in thin-section.&lt;ref name="DG25" /&gt;

===Colour and streak===
{{main article|Streak (mineralogy)}}
{{double image|right|Quartz-Uvarovite-LTH15C.JPG|150|Grossular-ww51a.jpg|161|Colour is typically not a diagnostic property of minerals. Shown are green [[uvarovite]] (left) and red-pink [[grossular]] (right), both [[garnet]]s. The diagnostic features would include dodecahedral crystals, resinous lustre, and hardness around 7.|||}}

&lt;!--[[File:Tourmaline.xtal.750pix.jpg|Watermelon [[elbaite]]|left|thumb]]--&gt;
Colour is the most obvious property of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by [[electromagnetic radiation]] interacting with electrons (except in the case of [[incandescence]], which does not apply to minerals).&lt;ref name="DG131144"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 131–44&lt;/ref&gt; Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic.&lt;ref name="B72"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG24"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such minerals are [[malachite]] (green) and [[azurite]] (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] varieties of the mineral [[corundum]].&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;
The colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. Examples include [[labradorite]] and [[bornite]].

In addition to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, [[Asterism (gemmology)|asterism]], [[chatoyancy]], [[iridescence]], tarnish, and [[pleochroism]]. Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, such as in [[opal]], results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. Iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating on the surface of crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry.&lt;ref name="DG2426"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure.&lt;ref name="B73"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum.&lt;ref name="DG2426" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B73"/&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Streak plate with Pyrite and Rhodochrosite.jpg|thumb|Streak plates with [[pyrite]] (left) and [[rhodochrosite]] (right)|left]]--&gt;
The streak of a mineral refers to the colour of a mineral in powdered form, which may or may not be identical to its body colour.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; The most common way of testing this property is done with a streak plate, which is made out of porcelain and coloured either white or black. The streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; or any weathering surface.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; A common example of this property is illustrated with [[hematite]], which is coloured black, silver, or red in hand sample, but has a cherry-red&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; to reddish-brown streak.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; Streak is more often distinctive for metallic minerals, in contrast to non-metallic minerals whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; Streak testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral, as those harder than 7 powder the ''streak plate'' instead.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;

===Cleavage, parting, fracture, and tenacity===
{{main article|Cleavage (crystal)|Fracture (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Biotite-Orthoclase-229808.jpg|left|thumb|Perfect basal cleavage as seen in [[biotite]] (black), and good cleavage seen in the matrix (pink [[orthoclase]]).]]
By definition, minerals have a characteristic atomic arrangement. Weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage. The quality of cleavage can be described based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks; common descriptors, in order of decreasing quality, are "perfect", "good", "distinct", and "poor". In particularly transparent minerals, or in thin-section, cleavage can be seen as a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed from the side. Cleavage is not a universal property among minerals; for example, quartz, consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra, does not have a crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave. In contrast, micas, which have perfect basal cleavage, consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

As cleavage is a function of crystallography, there are a variety of cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the [[mica]]s. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or [[rhodochrosite]], it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in [[fluorite]] and diamond, and [[sphalerite]] has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Minerals with many cleavages might not break equally well in all of the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three directions, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Parting, sometimes called "false cleavage", is similar in appearance to cleavage but is instead produced by structural defects in the mineral, as opposed to systematic weakness. Parting varies from crystal to crystal of a mineral, whereas all crystals of a given mineral will cleave if the atomic structure allows for that property. In general, parting is caused by some stress applied to a crystal. The sources of the stresses include deformation (e.g. an increase in pressure), exsolution, or twinning. Minerals that often display parting include the pyroxenes, hematite, magnetite, and corundum.&lt;ref name="DG39-40"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

When a mineral is broken in a direction that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in [[native copper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenacity is related to both cleavage and fracture. Whereas fracture and cleavage describes the surfaces that are created when a mineral is broken, tenacity describes how resistant a mineral is to such breaking. Minerals can be described as brittle, ductile, malleable, sectile, flexible, or elastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific gravity===
[[File:Calcite-Galena-elm56c.jpg|right|thumb|Galena, PbS, is a mineral with a high specific gravity.]]
[[Specific gravity]] numerically describes the [[density]] of a mineral. The dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units: kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Specific gravity measures how much water a mineral sample displaces. Defined as the quotient of the mass of the sample and difference between the weight of the sample in air and its corresponding weight in water, specific gravity is a unitless ratio. Among most minerals, this property is not diagnostic. Rock forming minerals – typically silicates or occasionally carbonates – have a specific gravity of 2.5–3.5.&lt;ref name="DG4344"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

High specific gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates to a change in specific gravity. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has a specific gravity of 5.26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1856.html|title=Hematite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[galena]], PbS, has a specific gravity of 7.2–7.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1641.html|title=Galena|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high specific gravity becomes very pronounced in [[native metal]]s; [[kamacite]], an iron-nickel alloy common in [[iron meteorite]]s has a specific gravity of 7.9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Kamacite.shtml#.WsQTQGbn9SM|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Webmineral.com|title=Kamacite|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3.&lt;ref name="DG4344" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1720.html|title=Gold|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other properties===
[[File:Carnotite-201050.jpg|left|thumb|Carnotite (yellow) is a radioactive uranium-bearing mineral.]]
Other properties can be used to diagnose minerals. These are less general, and apply to specific minerals.

Dropping dilute acid (often 10% [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]) onto a mineral aids in distinguishing carbonates from other mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate ([CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) group, which causes the affected area to [[effervesce]], giving off [[carbon dioxide]] gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered form. An example of this test is done when distinguishing calcite from [[dolomite]], especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock), for it to effervesce.&lt;ref name="DG4445"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeolite]] minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|title=Mineral Identification Key: Radioactivity, Magnetism, Acid Reactions|publisher=[[Mineralogical Society of America]]|accessdate=2012-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922231836/http://minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|archivedate=2012-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tested, [[magnetism]] is a very conspicuous property of minerals. Among common minerals, [[magnetite]] exhibits this property strongly, and magnetism is also present, albeit not as strongly, in [[pyrrhotite]] and [[ilmenite]].&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt; Some minerals exhibit electrical properties – for example, quartz is piezoelectric – but electrical properties are rarely used as diagnostic criteria for minerals because of incomplete data and natural variation.&lt;ref name="Helman2016"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Symmetry-based electricity in minerals and rocks: A summary of extant data, with examples of centrosymmetric minerals that exhibit pyro- and piezoelectricity | author=Helman, Daniel S. | journal=Periodico di Mineralogia | year=2016 | volume=85 | doi=10.2451/2016PM590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minerals can also be tested for taste or smell. Halite, NaCl, is table salt; its potassium-bearing counterpart, [[sylvite]], has a pronounced bitter taste. Sulfides have a characteristic smell, especially as samples are fractured, reacting, or powdered.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

[[Radioactivity]] is a rare property; minerals may be composed of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in [[uraninite]], [[autunite]], and [[carnotite]], or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a ''radioactive halo'' or ''[[pleochroic halo]]'', is observable with various techniques, such as thin-section petrography.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

==Classification==
As the composition of the Earth's crust is dominated by silicon and oxygen, silicate elements are by far the most important class of minerals in terms of rock formation and diversity. However, non-silicate minerals are of great economic importance, especially as ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 641&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-silicate minerals are subdivided into several other classes by their dominant chemistry, which includes native elements, sulfides, halides, oxides and hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and organic compounds. Most non-silicate mineral species are rare (constituting in total 8% of the Earth's crust), although some are relatively common, such as calcite, [[pyrite]], [[magnetite]], and [[hematite]]. There are two major structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra. [[Close-packing of equal spheres|close-packed structures]] is a way to densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space. Hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same ("ababab"), whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers ("abcabcabc"). Analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (sulfate), PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (phosphate), AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (arsenate), and VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (vanadate). The non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 641–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest grouping of minerals by far are the [[Silicate minerals|silicates]]; most rocks are composed of greater than 95% silicate minerals, and over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of these minerals.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The two main constituents of silicates are silicon and oxygen, which are the two most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Other common elements in silicate minerals correspond to other common elements in the Earth's crust, such as aluminium, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Some important rock-forming silicates include the [[feldspar]]s, quartz, [[olivine]]s, [[pyroxene]]s, [[amphibole]]s, [[garnet]]s, and [[mica]]s.

The base unit of a silicate mineral is the [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron. In the vast majority of cases, silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen. In very high-pressure situations, silicon will be in six-fold or octahedral coordination, such as in the [[perovskite structure]] or the quartz polymorph [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In the latter case, the mineral no longer has a silicate structure, but that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and its associated group, which are simple oxides. These silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures, such as one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge. In other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge. It is common for the Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to be substituted by  Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; because of similarity in ionic radius and charge; in those cases, the [AlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra, but their charge-balancing requirements are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of polymerization can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. Disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates have two or three shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The silicate subclasses are described below in order of decreasing polymerization.

====Tectosilicates====
[[File:Natroliteinde1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Natrolite]] is a mineral series in the zeolite group; this sample has a very prominent acicular crystal habit.]]
Tectosilicates, also known as framework silicates, have the highest degree of polymerization. With all corners of a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2. Examples are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, [[feldspathoid]]s, and the [[zeolite]]s. Framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable as a result of strong covalent bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most abundant mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, high-pressure [[coesite]], and ultra-high pressure [[stishovite]]. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed so much that it had changed from a silicate structure to that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573&amp;nbsp;°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a "kinking" of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 578–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspars are the most abundant group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%. In the feldspars, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; substitutes for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, which creates a charge imbalance that must be accounted for by the addition of cations. The base structure becomes either [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  There are 22 mineral species of feldspars, subdivided into two major subgroups – alkali and plagioclase – and two less common groups – [[celsian]] and [[banalsite]]. The alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich orthoclase and sodium-rich [[albite]]; in the case of plagioclase, the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich [[anorthite]]. Crystal twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars. If the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt, it forms exsolution lamellae because the two components – orthoclase and albite – are unstable in solid solution. Exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample; perthitic texture forms when Na-rich feldspar exsolve in a K-rich host. The opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 583–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspathoids are structurally similar to feldspar, but differ in that they form in Si-deficient conditions, which allows for further substitution by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, feldspathoids cannot be associated with quartz. A common example of a feldspathoid is [[nepheline]] ((Na, K)AlSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); compared to alkali feldspar, nepheline has an Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 1:2, as opposed to 1:6 in the feldspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; Zeolites often have distinctive crystal habits, occurring in needles, plates, or blocky masses. They form in the presence of water at low temperatures and pressures, and have channels and voids in their structure. Zeolites have several industrial applications, especially in waste water treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 589–93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phyllosilicates====
[[File:Muscovite-Albite-122886.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Muscovite, a mineral species in the mica group, within the phyllosilicate subclass]]
Phyllosilicates consist of sheets of polymerized tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important examples include the [[mica]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and the [[kaolinite]]-[[Serpentine group|serpentine]] groups. The sheets are weakly bound by [[van der Waals forces]] or [[hydrogen bond]]s, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balance out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked in a variety of combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The kaolinite-serpentine group consists of T-O stacks (the 1:1 clay minerals); their hardness ranges from 2 to 4, as the sheets are held by hydrogen bonds. The 2:1 clay minerals (pyrophyllite-talc) consist of T-O-T stacks, but they are softer (hardness from 1 to 2), as they are instead held together by van der Waals forces. These two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation; specifically, kaolinite and pyrophyllite are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 110–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Micas are also T-O-T-stacked phyllosilicates, but differ from the other T-O-T and T-O-stacked subclass members in that they incorporate aluminium into the tetrahedral sheets (clay minerals have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral sites). Common examples of micas are [[muscovite]], and the [[biotite]] series. The chlorite group is related to mica group, but a [[brucite]]-like (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layer between the T-O-T stacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 602–05&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their chemical structure, phyllosilicates typically have flexible, elastic, transparent layers that are electrical insulators and can be split into very thin flakes. Micas can be used in electronics as insulators, in construction, as optical filler, or even cosmetics. Chrysotile, a species of serpentine, is the most common mineral species in industrial asbestos, as it is less dangerous in terms of health than the amphibole asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 593–95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inosilicates====
[[File:Asbestos with muscovite.jpg|left|thumb|[[Asbestiform]] [[tremolite]], part of the amphibole group in the inosilicate subclass]]
Inosilicates consist of tetrahedra repeatedly bonded in chains. These chains can be single, where a tetrahedron is bound to two others to form a continuous chain; alternatively, two chains can be merged to create double-chain silicates. Single-chain silicates have a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:3 (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11, e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;. Inosilicates contain two important rock-forming mineral groups; single-chain silicates are most commonly [[pyroxene]]s, while double-chain silicates are often [[amphibole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-order chains exist (e.g. three-member, four-member, five-member chains, etc.) but they are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/strunz/strunz.php?class=09&amp;subclass=09.D|title=09.D Inosilicates|publisher=Webmineral.com|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyroxene group consists of 21 mineral species.&lt;ref name="DG112" /&gt; Pyroxenes have a general structure formula of XY(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), where X is an octahedral site, while Y can vary in coordination number from six to eight. Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to balance the negative charge on the backbone. Pyroxenes are common in the Earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}} pp. 612–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphiboles have great variability in chemistry, described variously as a "mineralogical garbage can" or a "mineralogical shark swimming a sea of elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group ([OH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), although it can be replaced by a fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 606–12&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="DG112"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Several amphibole mineral species can have an [[asbestiform]] crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as [[asbestosis]]; amphibole asbestos ([[anthophyllite]], [[tremolite]], [[actinolite]], [[grunerite]], and [[riebeckite]]) are considered more dangerous than [[chrysotile]] serpentine asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 611–12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclosilicates====
[[File:Elbaite-121353.jpg|right|thumb|An example of elbaite, a species of tourmaline, with distinctive colour banding.]]
Cyclosilicates, or ring silicates, have a ratio of silicon to oxygen of 1:3. Six-member rings are most common, with a base structure of [Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; examples include the [[tourmaline]] group and [[beryl]]. Other ring structures exist, with 3, 4, 8, 9, 12 having been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 113–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyclosilicates tend to be strong, with elongated, striated crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourmalines have a very complex chemistry that can be described by a general formula XY&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Z&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W. The T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; is the basic ring structure, where T is usually Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, but substitutable by Al&lt;sub&gt;3+&lt;/sub&gt; or B&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the X site, and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the W site. The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour. Other cyclosilicates include beryl, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;, whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish). [[Cordierite]] is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 617–21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sorosilicates====
[[File:Epidote Oisans.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Epidote often has a distinctive pistachio-green colour.]]
Sorosilicates, also termed disilicates, have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen, which results in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen. The resultant common structural element is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; group. The most common disilicates by far are members of the [[epidote]] group. Epidotes are found in variety of geologic settings, ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to [[pelite|metapelites]]. Epidotes are built around the structure [(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;10−&lt;/sup&gt; structure; for example, the mineral ''species'' epidote has calcium, aluminium, and ferric iron to charge balance: Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al)(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)O(OH). The presence of iron as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; helps understand oxygen [[fugacity]], which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis.&lt;ref name="DG612-627"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 612–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of sorosilicates include [[lawsonite]], a  metamorphic mineral forming in the [[blueschist]] facies (subduction zone setting with low temperature and high pressure), [[vesuvianite]], which takes up a significant amount of calcium in its chemical structure.&lt;ref name="DG612-627" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 565–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthosilicates====
[[File:Andradite-172390.jpg|right|thumb|Black andradite, an end-member of the orthosilicate garnet group.]]
Orthosilicates consist of isolated tetrahedra that are charge-balanced by other cations.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt; Also termed nesosilicates, this type of silicate has a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:4 (e.g. SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Typical orthosilicates tend to form blocky equant crystals, and are fairly hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; Several rock-forming minerals are part of this subclass, such as the aluminosilicates, the olivine group, and the garnet group.

The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; – are structurally composed of one [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron, and one Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be in six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as [[tephroite]], Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 574–75&lt;/ref&gt; The garnet group has a general formula of X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Y position: [[pyrope]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[almandine]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[spessartine]] (Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ugrandite garnets have Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the X position: [[uvarovite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[grossular]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[andradite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"/&gt;

Other orthosilicates include [[zircon]], [[staurolite]], and [[topaz]]. Zircon (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is useful in geochronology as the Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; can be substituted by U&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;; furthermore, because of its very resistant structure, it is difficult to reset it as a chronometer. Staurolite is a common metamorphic intermediate-grade index mineral. It has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986. Topaz (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(F, OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, often found in granitic pegmatites associated with [[tourmaline]], is a common gemstone mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 627–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-silicates===

====Native elements====
{{main article|Native element minerals}}
[[File:Gold-mz4b.jpg|left|thumb|Native gold. Rare specimen of stout crystals growing off of a central stalk, size 3.7 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm, from Venezuela.]]
[[native element minerals|Native elements]] are those that are not chemically bonded to other elements. This mineral group includes [[native metal]]s, semi-metals, and non-metals, and various alloys and solid solutions. The metals are held together by metallic bonding, which confers distinctive physical properties such as their shiny metallic lustre, ductility and malleability, and electrical conductivity. Native elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes.

The gold group, with a cubic close-packed structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are [[kamacite]] and [[taenite]], which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ by the amount of Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5–7% nickel and is a variety of [[telluric iron|native iron]], whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 7–37%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic traits; for example, they lack the malleability of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 644–48&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfides====
{{main article|Sulfide minerals}}
[[File:Cinnabar on Dolomite.jpg|right|thumb|Red cinnabar (HgS), a mercury ore, on dolomite.]]
The [[sulfide minerals]] are chemical compounds of one or more metals or semimetals with a sulfur; tellurium, arsenic, or selenium can substitute for the sulfur. Sulfides tend to be soft, brittle minerals with a high specific gravity. Many powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered. Sulfides are susceptible to weathering, and many readily dissolve in water; these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited, which creates enriched secondary ore deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or semimetal to the sulfur, such as M:S equal to 2:1, or 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 649&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[sulfide mineral]]s are economically important as metal [[ore]]s; examples include [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, [[galena]] (PbS), an ore of lead, [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, and [[molybdenite]] (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ore of molybdenum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 651–54&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments. It is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 654&lt;/ref&gt; Related to the sulfides are the rare [[Sulfosalt mineral|sulfosalts]], in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a semimetal such as [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], or [[bismuth]]. Like the sulfides, sulfosalts are typically soft, heavy, and brittle minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oxides====
{{main article|Oxide minerals}}
[[Oxide minerals]] are divided into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The [[periclase]] group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include [[cuprite]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as [[corundum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[hematite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the chief ore of [[titanium]]; other examples include [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[tin]]), and [[pyrolusite]] (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[manganese]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 400–03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 657–60&lt;/ref&gt;  In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Bauxite]]s are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals [[diaspore]], [[gibbsite]], and [[bohmite]]; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 663–64&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the [[spinel group|spinels]], with a general formula of X&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Examples of species include [[spinel]] (MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chromite]] (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two [[oxidation state]]s (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which makes it a multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 660–63&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halides====
{{main article|Halide minerals}}
[[File:Halite-Nahcolite-51411.jpg|left|thumb|Pink cubic [[halite]] (NaCl; halide class) crystals on a [[nahcolite]] matrix (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; a carbonate, and mineral form of sodium bicarbonate, used as [[baking soda]]).]]

The [[halide minerals]] are compounds in which a [[halogen]] (fluorine, chlorine, iodine, or bromine) is the main anion. These minerals tend to be soft, weak, brittle, and water-soluble. Common examples of halides include halite (NaCl, table salt), [[sylvite]] (KCl), [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Halite and sylvite commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, and can be dominant minerals in chemical sedimentary rocks. [[Cryolite]], Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is a key mineral in the extraction of aluminium from [[bauxite]]s; however, as the only significant occurrence at [[Ivittuut]], [[Greenland]], in a granitic pegmatite, was depleted, synthetic cryolite can be made from fluorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 425–30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbonates====
{{main article|Carbonate minerals}}
The [[carbonate minerals]] are those in which the main anionic group is carbonate, [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and [[aragonite]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key in the formation of limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and [[karst]] landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is surrounded by three O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt; The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, which is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, can have a high magnesium impurity. Under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an [[aragonite sea|aragonite]] or [[calcite sea]], depending on which mineral preferentially forms. [[Dolomite]] is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, in which calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two mineral species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with the general formula XY(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 668–69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfates====
{{main article|Sulfate minerals}}
[[File:Roses des Sables Tunisie.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Gypsum desert rose]]
The [[sulfate mineral]]s all contain the sulfate anion, [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. They tend to be transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfate minerals commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters. Sulfates can also be found in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 456–57&lt;/ref&gt; or as oxidation products of sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 674&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is [[gypsum]], CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form [[Desert rose (crystal)|desert rose]]s. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is [[anhydrite]]; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include [[barite]] (BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] (SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[anglesite]] (PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); anhydrite is not part of the barite group, as the smaller Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is only in eight-fold coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 672–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phosphates====
{{main article|Phosphate minerals}}
The [[phosphate minerals]] are characterized by the tetrahedral [PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; unit, although the structure can be generalized, and phosphorus is replaced by antimony, arsenic, or vanadium. The most common phosphate is the [[apatite]] group; common species within this group are fluorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), chlorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) and hydroxylapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)). Minerals in this group are the main crystalline constituents of teeth and bones in vertebrates. The relatively abundant [[monazite]] group has a general structure of ATO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where T is phosphorus or arsenic, and A is often a [[rare-earth element]] (REE). Monazite is important in two ways: first, as a REE "sink", it can sufficiently concentrate these elements to become an ore; secondly, monazite group elements can incorporate relatively large amounts of uranium and thorium, which can be used in [[monazite geochronology]] to date the rock based on the decay of the U and Th to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 675–80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organic minerals====
{{main article|Organic mineral}}
The Strunz classification includes a class for [[Strunz classification#Class: organic compounds|organic minerals]]. These rare compounds contain [[Organic compound|organic carbon]], but can be formed by a geologic process. For example, [[whewellite]], CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is an [[oxalate]] that can be deposited in hydrothermal ore veins. While hydrated calcium oxalate can be found in coal seams and other sedimentary deposits involving organic matter, the hydrothermal occurrence is not considered to be related to biological activity.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681"/&gt;

==Astrobiology==
It has been suggested that [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] could be important indicators of [[extraterrestrial life]] and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet [[Mars]].  Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book |editor2-first=David |editor2-last= Beaty |contribution=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Steele |publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) – NASA |place= |page=72 |date=September 26, 2006 |id= |contribution-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc |format=.doc |accessdate=2009-07-22 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies by the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'']] and [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] [[Mars rover|rovers]] on Mars will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a [[biosphere]] based on [[autotroph]]ic, [[chemotroph]]ic and/or [[Lithotroph#Chemolithotrophs|chemolithoautotrophic]] [[microorganism]]s, as well as ancient water, including [[Lacustrine plain|fluvio-lacustrine environments]] ([[plain]]s related to ancient [[river]]s or [[lake]]s) that may have been [[Planetary habitability|habitable]].&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grotzinger |first=John P. |title=Introduction to Special Issue – Habitability, Taphonomy, and the Search for Organic Carbon on Mars |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=January 24, 2014 |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=386–87 |doi=10.1126/science.1249944 |pmid=24458635 |bibcode=2014Sci...343..386G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124special"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Various |title=Exploring Martian Habitability |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=345–452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Various |title=Special Collection – Curiosity – Exploring Martian Habitability |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/extra/curiosity/index.xhtml |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124c"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grotzinger, J.P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Habitable Fluvio-Lacustrine Environment at Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater, Mars |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=343 |number=6169 |doi=10.1126/science.1242777 |pmid=24324272 |pages=1242777 |citeseerx=10.1.1.455.3973 |bibcode=2014Sci...343A.386G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search for evidence of [[Planetary habitability|habitability]], [[taphonomy]] (related to [[fossils]]), and [[organic carbon]] on the planet [[Mars]] is now a primary [[NASA]] objective.&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124special"/&gt;

'''Mount Albert Borough Council v Johnson''' [1979] 2 NZLR 234 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the Statute of Limitations defence in tort claims.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Sydney Construction purchased a 3-acre block of land in Mt Albert, with the intention of a residential development. At the time of the sale, the seller had informed Sydney that there was rubbish buried in the land.

Sydney subsequently subdivided the land, and built numerous houses there. On the section that Johnson ultimately purchased, six flats were constructed in 1967.

In 1970, Johnson purchased the flat, and within the year she had noticed subsidence in the building, and as a result she got an engineer to do an inspection.

The engineer did some test drilling, and discovered amongst other rubbish, gib board and motor vehicle parts buried in the foundation, requiring 20 steel poles to be drilled to rectify the subsidence.

Johnson in 1973 sued the council for negligently approving the building permit. Then council filed for Sydney Construction to be made a third party, which Johnson later applied to have Sydney listed as a codefendant.

The High Court awarded Johnson $10,000 in damages.

The Council appealed.

==Held==
The court dismissed the appeal.

The '''Open Publication License''' (OPL) was published by the [[Open Content Project]] in 1999 as a [[public copyright license]] for documents.&lt;ref name="opl"/&gt; It superseded the [[Open Content License]], which was published by the Open Content Project in 1998.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; Starting around 2002-2003, it began to be superseded, in turn, by the [[Creative Commons license]]s.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

== History ==
In 1998, the Open Content Project published a licence called the Open Content License, which was among the first (perhaps ''the'' first) public copyright licenses intended for ''content'' (i.e. documents) rather than for ''software''.&lt;ref name="ocl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; The following year, it published the Open Publication License, which was intended to be an improvement upon the Open Content License.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

The two licenses differ substantially: the Open Publication License is not a [[share-alike]] license while the Open Content License is; and the Open Publication License can optionally restrict the distribution of derivative works or restrict the commercial distribution of paper copies of the work or derivatives of the work, whereas the Open Content License forbids copying for profit altogether.

In June 2003, David A. Wiley, the founder of the Open Content Project, indicated that the Creative Commons licenses, which were developed in collaboration with lawyers, would be "more likely to stand up in court" than the Open Content Project licenses, which were not.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; He also announced that for this reason, he was joining [[Creative Commons]] and shutting down the Open Content Project, and that users thinking of using an Open Content Project license would be "far better off using a Creative Commons license".&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Confusingly, the Open Content License gives its abbreviation as "OPL" rather than "OCL",&lt;ref name="ocl"/&gt; and that license is sometimes referred to by the former initialism.&lt;ref name="fsf-opl"/&gt; ("OPL", as used by the Open Content Project in 1998, stood for OpenContent Principles and License.)&lt;ref name="opl-explanation"/&gt; Nevertheless, the license's author has subsequently referred to that license as the "OCL", and to the Open Publication License as the "OPL".&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; This ambiguity about the initialism "OPL" risks confusion, and the only sure way to know which of the two licenses is being referred to, in a given context, is to look for the full name.&lt;ref name="fsf-ocl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fsf-opl"/&gt;

== Reception ==
According to the [[Free Software Foundation]], the Open Publication License "can be used as a free documentation license" and is "a copyleft free documentation license provided the copyright holder does not exercise any of the 'LICENSE OPTIONS' listed in Section VI of the license."&lt;ref name="fsf-opl"/&gt; It is not, however, [[License compatibility|compatible]] with the [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU FDL]].&lt;ref name="fsf-opl" /&gt;

In March 2004, the OPL v1.0 was determined by the [[Debian]] legal team to be incompatible with the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].&lt;ref name="debian-legal"/&gt;

In October 2004, an analysis of the Open Public License was published by Andrew M. St. Laurent, the author of ''Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/10/07/OSlicenses_part2.html Open Source and Free Documentation Licenses, Part 2: The Open Publication License], Onlamp.com, Andrew M. St. Laurent, October 7, 2004{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCL predates the GFDL (Nov 2002) and Creative Commons (Dec 2002) by over four years, while the improved OPL predates both by over three years. The OCL was developed primarily by me... The improved OPL was written primarily by Eric Raymond after discussions with me, Tim O’Reilly, and others... The OPL was truly innovative in that, in addition to requiring citation of the original author as source, it contained two license options which authors could choose to invoke: one restricts users’ abilities to creative derivative works, while the second restricts users’ abilities to make certain commercial uses of the material. The student of open content licensing will recognize that these are exactly the options that Creative Commons now employs. What may be forgotten is that in version 1.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, Attribution was actually included in the licenses only as an option. In version 2.0 of the CC licenses (May 24, 2004) attribution was standard on every license, and there were two licenses options: one regarding derivative works, and one regarding commercial use. So in terms of high level structure, the OPL was here about five years before CC. ... Actually, the [OCL and OPL] licenses weren’t that great, seeing as I am not a lawyer, and neither was anyone else involved in the creation of the license. The concept was right, and the execution was “good enough,” but Creative Commons (with its excellent lawyers and law school students) created a better legal instrument. As I said on the opencontent.org homepage on Monday June 30, 2003: 'My main goal in beginning OpenContent back in the Spring of 1998 was to evangelize a way of thinking about sharing materials, especially those that are useful for supporting education. ... I’m closing OpenContent because I think Creative Commons is doing a better job of providing licensing options which will stand up in court [and I'm joining] Creative Commons as Director of Educational Licenses. Now I can focus in on facilitating the kind of sharing most interesting to me ... with the pro bono support of really good IP lawyers... The OpenContent License and Open Publication License will remain online for archival purposes in their current locations. However, no future development will occur on the licenses themselves.' ... Anyone interested in a license like this is far better off using a Creative Commons license.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous trial''' or '''post-mortem trial''' is a [[trial]] held after the [[defendant]]'s death. Posthumous trials can be held for a variety of reasons, including the legal declaration that the defendant was the one who committed the crime, to provide justice for society of family members of the victims, or to exonerate a wrongfully convicted person after their death. Due to the heavy cost, they are usually held only under extraordinary circumstances.

==Notable posthumous trials==
* [[Cadaver Synod]] of [[Pope Formosus]]
* [[Pope Boniface VIII]]
* [[Francesco Maria Carafa]], resulting in exoneration
* [[Retrial of Joan of Arc]], overturned her earlier heresy conviction 
* [[Sergei Magnitsky]]
* [[Henry Plummer]], resulting in a mistrial.

The '''Recreational Charities Act 1958''' was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that was repealed in its entirety by the [[Charities Act 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;SCHEDULE 10 Charities Act 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1958 Act recognised the place of "recreational facilities" within [[English trusts law|English law]] on [[Charitable trusts in English law|charitable trusts]]. In trusts law, there are requirements that such trusts contain both a charitable purpose and public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.211&lt;/ref&gt; 

Charitable trusts are invalid if they include "purely recreational pastimes", as in ''[[IRC v City of Glasgow Police Athletic Association]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[1953] 1 All ER 747&lt;/ref&gt; even though the purpose of the charity was to improve the efficiency of the police force, the fact that this included a recreational element invalidated the trust. In response to this case and ''[[IRC v Baddely]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1955] A.C. 572&lt;/ref&gt; the Recreational Charities Act was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act provides, in Section 1, that "it shall be and be deemed always to have been charitable to provide, or assist in the provision of, facilities for recreation or other leisure-time occupation, if the facilities are provided in the interests of social welfare". This preserves the requirement of public benefit, with acceptable "social welfare" interests being where the facilities are dedicated to "improving the conditions of life" of the young, old, physically handicapped, poor or people with extenuating "social or economic circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;Price (1958) p.535&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1(3) provides the facilities at women's centres, community centres and sports grounds as particular examples of ones advancing "social welfare". In Section 2 the Act specifically covers trusts set up under the [[Miners’ Welfare Act 1952]] before 17 December 1957, when the Act received its first reading in the [[House of Lords]]. Section 3 of the Act notes that the provisions do not validate, invalidate or disturb any charities established before 17 December, while Sections 4 and 5 note that the Act applies to both [[Northern Ireland]] and [[the Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;Price (1958) p.536&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2, dealing with trusts established under the Miners' Welfare Act, was repealed by the [[Charities Act 2006]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4ST8-9XY0-TWPY-Y1G4&amp;csi=274768&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|title=Lexis@Library: Document (subscription needed)|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Section 4 was repealed by the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4ST8-9XY0-TWPY-Y14R&amp;csi=274768&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|title=Lexis@Library: Document (subscription needed)|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was subject to judicial interpretation in ''[[Guild v IRC]]'', where it was decided that recreational charities could be for  public benefit if they impacted on the public in general, not just the categories of people listed in Section 1; [[Henry Keith, Baron Keith of Kinkel|Lord Keith]] stated "the fact is that persons from all walks of life and all kinds of social circumstances may have their conditions of life improved by the provision of recreational facilities of a suitable nature".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sale of Goods Act''' (with its variations) is a stock [[short title]] used for [[legislation]] in [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[common law]] provinces of [[Canada]] relating to the [[sale of goods]].

The Bill for an Act with this short title will have been known as a Sale of Goods Bill during its passage through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

Sale of Goods Acts may be a generic name either for legislation bearing that short title or for all legislation which relates to the sale of goods.

==List==
===Malaysia===
*The [[Sale of Goods Act 1957]]

===New Zealand===
New Zealand's Sale of Goods Act was passed in 1908 by the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand]]. It has been amended several times, including by the Sale of Goods Amendment Act 1961 and the Sale of Goods Amendment Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1908/0168/latest/DLM173958.html|title=Sale of Goods Act 1908|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office, New Zealand|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Sale of Goods Act was replaced by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]], which covers contracts entered into from 1 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/sale-of-goods-act |title=Sale of Goods Act|website=Which? Consumer Rights |date=  |author= |accessdate= 1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier legislation was:
*The [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]] (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c.71)
*The [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] (c.54)
*The [[Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1994]] (c.32)
*The [[Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994]] (c.35)
*The [[Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1995]] (c.28)

A '''solar lamp''' also known as solar light or solar lantern, is a lighting system composed of an [[LED lamp]], [[solar panel]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], [[charge controller]] and there may also be an [[Power inverter|inverter]]. The lamp operates on electricity from batteries, charged through the use of solar photovoltaic panel.

Solar-powered household lighting can replace other light sources like candles or [[kerosene lamp]]s. Solar lamps have a lower [[operating cost]] than kerosene lamps because renewable energy from the sun is free, unlike fuel. In addition, solar lamps produce no indoor air pollution unlike kerosene lamps. However, solar lamps generally have a higher initial cost, and are weather dependent.

Solar lamps for use in rural situations often have the capability of providing a supply of electricity for other devices, such as for charging [[Mobile phone|cell phones]]. American investors have been working towards developing a $10 / unit solar lantern for replacement of kerosene lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = $10 solar-powered lamp to help the poor|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/6365124/10-solar-powered-lamp-to-help-the-poor.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|272px|Global market-share in terms of annual production by PV technology since 1990]]
Some solar photovoltaics use [[Monocrystalline silicon]] or polycrystalline silicon panels, while newer technologies have used [[thin-film solar cell]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How does solar power work?|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-does-solar-power-work/|website = www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since  modern solar cells were introduced in 1954 at [[Bell labs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Champions of photovoltaics technology|url = http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2010/10/champions-of-photovoltaics.html|website = www.renewableenergyworld.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How do Photovoltaics Work?  - NASA Science|url = https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2002/solarcells/|website = science.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; advances in [[solar cell efficiency]] at converting light into electric power, and modern manufacturing techniques combined with efficiencies of scale have led to an international [[growth of photovoltaics]].

As of 2016, LED lamps use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/jiec.12342|title=Potential Long-Term Global Environmental Implications of Efficient Light-Source Technologies|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=20|issue=2|page=263|year=2016|last1=Bergesen|first1=Joseph D.|last2=Tähkämö|first2=Leena|last3=Gibon|first3=Thomas|last4=Suh|first4=Sangwon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency in production of LED lamps has led to increased adoption as an alternative to other electric lighting.

Solar panels are made out of silicon, a [[semiconductor]] material. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How do solar cells work? - Explain that Stuff|url = http://www.explainthatstuff.com/solarcells.html|website = www.explainthatstuff.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[solar cell]] has two different layers of silicon. The lower layer has less electrons and hence has a slight positive charge due to the negative charge nature of electrons. In addition, the upper layer has more electrons and has slightly negative charge. A potential barrier is created between these two layers. 

When the stream of light particles called photons enter, they give up their energy to the atoms in the silicon. It promotes one electron from a covalent bond to a next energy level from upper layer to the lower layer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This promotion of an electron allows freer movement within the crystal which produces a current. More light shines through, more electrons move around hence more current flows between. This process is called [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] and photoelectric effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Photovoltaic systems directly convert sunlight into electricity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Photovoltaic Systems|url = http://photovoltaics.sustainablesources.com/|website = Photovoltaic Systems|accessdate = 2015-10-31|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar panels are made out of layers of different materials, as you can see in Figure 2, in order of glass, encapsulate, crystalline cells, encapsulate, back sheet, junction box and lastly frame. The encapsulate keeps out moisture and contaminants which could cause problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.dowcorning.com/content/publishedlit/06-10028_solar-energy-the-basics.pdf|title = The Science of Solar: Solar Energy - The Basics|last = Dow Corning|first = |date = 2009|journal = Solar Solutions|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Background clip image004.jpg|thumb|Figure 2 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Solar Panel|url = https://swcphysics30.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/the-solar-panel/|website = swcphysics30|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Battery ===

A [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] is usually housed within a metal or plastic case. Inside the case are electrodes including cathodes and anodes where chemical reactions occur. A separator also exists between cathode and anode which stops the electrodes reacting together at the same time as allowing electrical charge to flow freely between the two. Lastly, the collector conducts a charge from the battery to outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Batteries Work|url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/battery2.htm|website = HowStuffWorks|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batteries inside solar lamps usually use gel electrolyte technology with high performance in deep discharging, in order to enable use in extreme ranges of temperature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solar – Philips Lighting|url = http://www.lighting.philips.com/main/products/solar.html|website = www.lighting.philips.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also use lead-acid, nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, or lithium.

This part of the lamp saves up energy from the solar panel and provides power when needed at night when there is no light energy available.

In general, the efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion is limited for physical reasons. Around 24% of [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] of a long wavelength is not absorbed. 33% is heat lost to surroundings, and further losses are of approximately 15-20%. Only 23% is absorbed which means a battery is a crucial part of solar lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crystalline silicon solar cells|last = Goetzberger|first = Adolf|publisher = John Wiley&amp;Sons|year = 1998|isbn = 0-471-97144-8|location = Germany|pages = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charge controller ===

This section controls the entire working systems to protect battery charge. It ensures, under any circumstances including extreme weather conditions with large temperature difference, the battery does not overcharge or over discharge and damage the battery even further.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solar Street Light,LED Street Light -- Anern Industry Group|url = http://www.anern.com/Application-27.html|website = www.anern.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section also includes additional parts such as light controller, time controller, sound, temperature compensation, lighting protection, reverse polarity protection and AC transfer switches which ensure sensitive back-up loads work normally when outage occurs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Working principles ==
[[File:Screen Shot 2015-10-26 at 11.56.26.png|thumb|Figure 3 &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8earltsP35w|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
LED lights are used due to their high luminous efficiency and long life. Under the control of a DC charge controller, non-contact control automatically turns on the light at dark and switches off at daytime. It sometimes also combines with time controllers to set curtain time for it to automatically switch light on and off.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As shown in Figure 3, the chip includes microchip(R), B-, B+, S- and S+. S+ and S- are both connected to solar panels with wire, one of which has plus charge and the other minus charge. B- and B+ are attached to two batteries in this case. The light will be shown through the LED light when all of these are connected.

== Benefits ==

Solar lamps can be easier for customers to install and maintain as they do not require an electricity cable. Solar lamps can benefit owners with reduced maintenance cost and costs of electricity bills. Solar lamps can also be used in areas where there is no [[electrical grid]] or remote areas that lack a reliable electricity supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Advantages and Disadvantages of Solar Energy {{!}} GreenMatch.co.uk|url = http://www.greenmatch.co.uk/blog/2014/08/5-advantages-and-5-disadvantages-of-solar-energy|website = www.greenmatch.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many stories of people with lung disease, eye deterioration, burns and sometimes even death simply because they do not have a healthy alternative to light at night.  Women have felt unsafe walking to the toilet outside after dark.  Babies are being delivered by midwives using only a candle, and students cannot study when the sun goes down for lack of light leading to increased illiteracy and perpetual poverty.  These are the realities for over 1 billion people around the globe.   Lack of lighting equates to continued poverty felt around the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://esperanzamarket.com/blogs/news/93744963-changemakers-spotlight-unite-to-light&lt;/ref&gt;
In solar energy lamp it converts light energy into electrical energy, i.e. It is convenient to our daily life.

Solar energy output is limited by weather and can be less effective if it is cloudy, wet, or winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solar Power Advantages and Disadvantages|url = http://www.sepco-solarlighting.com/blog/bid/115086/Solar-Power-Advantages-and-Disadvantages|website = www.sepco-solarlighting.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Households switching to solar lamps from kerosene lamps also gain from health risk associated with kerosene emissions. Kerosene often has negative impacts on human lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solar-powered lamp and charger|url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/solar-powered_lamp__charger.aspx|website = British Museum|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of solar energy minimizes the creation pollution indoors, where kerosene have been linked to cases of health issues. However, photovoltaic panels are made out of silicon and other toxic metals including [[Lead poisoning|lead]] that can be difficult to [[Waste management|dispose]] of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disadvantages Of Solar Energy - Conserve Energy Future|url = http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/Disadvantages_SolarEnergy.php|website = Conserve-Energy-Future|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of solar lights improves education for students who live in households without electricity. When the nonprofit Unite-To-Light donated solar-lamps to schools a remote region of Kwa Zulu Natal in South Africa test scores and pass rates improved by over 30%.  The light gives students added time to study after dark.&lt;ref&gt;Unite To Light https://esperanzamarket.com/blogs/news/93744963-changemakers-spotlight-unite-to-light&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 experimental study in unelectrified areas of northern Bangladesh found that the use of solar lanterns decreased total household expenditure, increased children’s home-study hours and increased school attendance. It did not however improve the children's educational achievement to any large extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kudo|first=Yuya|last2=Shonchoy|first2=Abu S.|last3=Takahashi|first3=Kazushi|title=Can Solar Lanterns Improve Youth Academic Performance?

== Use ==

=== Solar street light ===
{{main|Solar street light}}
These lights provide a convenient and cost-effective way to light streets at night without the need of AC electrical grids for pedestrians and drivers. They may have individual panels for each lamp of a system, or may have a large central solar panel and battery bank to power multiple lamps.[[File:Solaru lantaru.jpg|thumb|right|Solar LED lantern]]

=== Rural ===

In rural India, solar lamps, commonly called solar lanterns, using either LEDs or CFLs, are being used to replace kerosene lamps. Especially in areas where electricity is otherwise difficult to access, solar lamps are very useful and it will also improve life in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/cheapest-solar-lantern-a|title=nannammmaims-to-displace-kerosene-lamps.html Cheapest Solar Lantern Aims to Displace Kerosene Lamps|author=|date=|website=treehugger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Espionage{{!}}secret agent}}
{{Template:Law enforcement in the United States}}

A '''special agent''', in the [[United States]], is usually a criminal investigator or detective for a federal, state, or county government who primarily serves in investigatory roles. Within the US [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement system]], dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles ''special agent'' and ''agent''.

In intelligence usage, agent refers to one who is recruited, trained, controlled, and employed to obtain and report information.&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO Standardization Agency [http://standard.di.mod.bg/pls/mstd/MSTD.blob_upload_download_routines.download_blob?p_id=281&amp;p_table_name=d_ref_documents&amp;p_file_name_column_name=file_name&amp;p_mime_type_column_name=mime_type&amp;p_blob_column_name=contents&amp;p_app_id=600 AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, only some agents are federal law enforcement officers and hold either arrest authority or the right to conduct minor criminal/non-criminal investigations. In some agencies, however, an agent may have both arrest and minor criminal/non-criminal investigatory authority but still have no authority to conduct major criminal investigations.

On the other hand, nearly all special agents are federal law enforcement officers, are distinctly empowered to conduct both major and minor criminal investigations, and hold arrest authority. Most special agents are authorized to carry firearms both on and off duty, but only some agents are authorized to do so, relying on "[[Professional_courtesy#In_law_enforcement|professional courtesy]]" when dealing with local law enforcement in areas where carrying a firearm is prohibited. In US federal law enforcement, the title of special agent is used almost exclusively for federal criminal investigators.

==Federal government==
Within the U.S. government, the title of special agent designates a general investigator in GS-1810 [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|job series]], federal criminal investigator in the GS-1811, [[Diplomatic Security Service]] FS-2501 job series, or a counterintelligence operations specialist in the GS-0132 job series according to the [[Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM) handbook. Special Agents typically have an [[undergraduate]] degree. They are usually empowered to carry firearms, make [[Arrest warrant|arrests]], and investigate violations of [[federal laws]]. The titles of "Agent", "Investigator", and "Background Investigator" refer to all other 1800 series job series designations, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families – May 2009|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/classifying-general-schedule-positions/occupationalhandbook.pdf|website=OPM|publisher=OPM|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1801: General Inspection, Investigation, Enforcement and Compliance Series
* 1802: Compliance Inspection and Support Series
* 1805: Investigative Analysis
* 1811: Criminal Investigator

Although some federal agencies have recently defined certain background investigators and other non-1811 personnel as "special agents", this is purely an administrative title with a different meaning, and does not confer actual Special Agent status on them.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Although some 1810-series investigators are empowered in some circumstances to carry firearms and investigate crimes, they are not empowered to make arrests. In general, [[arrest authority]] is what distinguishes a traditional Special Agent (1811) from most other 1800 series personnel. There are exceptions: some 1800 series positions, such as Border Patrol Agents, Federal Air Marshals and Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers have the authority to enforce federal law, and thus have arrest authority. However, unlike the 1811 Criminal Investigators, or Special Agents, they do not have the authority to conduct major criminal investigations. In general, non-1811 personnel who wear a badge and a gun and have arrest authority are considered "Agents", while Criminal Investigators who carry a badge, gun, and credentials and have arrest authority are considered "Special Agents". All other 1800 personnel who conduct investigations (background or otherwise) and who do not have arrest authority are "Investigators", "Background Investigators", or "Compliance Officers", no matter what their administrative title might be.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

===Training for the federal criminal investigator===
Federal [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] [[training]] can be divided into various categories, the most common being basic, agency-specific basic (ASB), advanced/specialized, and agency-advanced/specialized. To operate safely and effectively, U.S. special agents and criminal investigators must possess skills and knowledge regarding criminal and civil [[law]] and procedure, enforcement operations, physical techniques, and technical equipment, to mention a few. They must also be physically fit. While possession of a college degree can aid in obtaining employment in this profession, only extensive training provided at specialized facilities, combined with on-the-job training, can provide the skills and knowledge needed to perform the duties of a federal criminal investigator. As of 2012, there were 13,913 [[FBI]] agents, as of 2016, there were approximately 6,500 ICE-Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents, and as of 2011, there were 4,890 [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top Careers for Students of Criminology and Criminal Justice |url=http://online.ccj.pdx.edu/resources/infographics/top-careers-for-students-of-criminology-and-criminal-justice-ig/ |publisher=Portland State University |accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most U.S. special agents and federal criminal investigators receive their basic training at the U. S. Department of Homeland Security’s [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]]s (FLETC), including ICE-HSI, ATF, IRS-CI, USMS, USSS, DSS, AFOSI, NCIS and OIGs. FLETC has facilities in Brunswick (Glynco), GA, Artesia, NM, Charleston, SC, and Cheltenham, MD. 

Only DEA and FBI agents receive their basic training at [[FBI Academy|Quantico]]. The FBI and DEA operate completely self-contained academies that provide all levels of training to their agents. These academies make no distinction between basic and agency-specific basic training. New FBI and DEA agents train at their academies for approximately five months before they begin their first investigative assignment. Both agencies' academies also provide advanced training in various subjects to other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

The U. S. Department of Homeland Security’s FLETC, commonly pronounced "flet-see", is a consolidated training facility that provides basic and advanced training to the vast majority of U.S. special agents and other federal law enforcement personnel. The FLETC also provides advanced and specialized training for most federal, state, local, tribal and non-U.S. law enforcement agencies willing to share in the cost. The FLETC's basic training course for special agents, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP), lasts about 13 weeks, and may be given to persons if required for self-protection, depending on changes to program content or holidays. Nevertheless, CITP only represents the beginning or basic training received by U.S. special agents not employed by the FBI, Federal Air Marshals, DEA, or USPIS.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

After completing the FLETC CITP, most agents immediately transition to training provided by their own agencies (hence the term agency-specific basic, or ASB), lasting another 2 to 16 weeks and sometimes longer, depending on the agency. Some smaller agencies, like the 64 Offices of Inspector General (OIGs), operate consolidated academies, such as the Inspector General Criminal Investigator Academy (IGCIA), through which specialized but common ASB-type skills and knowledge are more economically taught. So agents employed by the OIGs first attend CITP, then attend the IGCIA's IG Investigator Training Program (IGITP), then attend their own agencies' ASB training after completing IGITP, receiving a total of up to 16 weeks or more of training before conducting their first investigation. Many of the agencies utilizing FLETC maintain their individual academies for providing ASB and agency-specific advanced training on the same grounds as FLETC and share use of the same facilities. Some agencies, such as the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and the U.S. Secret Service, conduct their ASB training in separate agency-owned and operated facilities.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

Although a much smaller agency than the FBI or DEA, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service also operates a self-contained federal law enforcement training academy called the Career Development Division (CDD). Like FLETC and Quantico, USPIS CDD has been fully accredited by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation (FLETA). Like the other academies, CDD provides basic training to postal inspectors in firearms, legal use of force, driving training, crime scene management, controlled deliveries, felony arrests, case management, case development, informant management, and surveillance, but also incorporates agency-specific basic training to help prepare the USPIS candidates in enforcing postal laws and federal mail statutes such as mail fraud, mail theft, and other mail related crimes. In addition to basic training, CDD also provides advanced training for the postal inspectors, the uniformed postal police personnel, and the analysts.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

For all U.S. special agents, training does not stop after basic and ASB. The career of a federal special agent is one of regular training in new legal issues and investigative techniques, and frequently includes quarterly, if not monthly, refresher training in hand-to-hand [[defensive tactics]], the use of weapons of less than lethal force, and regular qualification in the use of [[firearm]]s.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

===Criminal investigators and the use of the term special agent===
Not all federal criminal investigators are called special agents. Some federal agencies entitle their investigators as criminal investigators but use the term interchangeably with special agent. Other federal agencies use different titles for the same 1811 criminal investigative job series. Series 1811 criminal investigators for the U.S. marshals are entitled deputy marshals. Series 1811 criminal investigators for the U.S Postal Inspection Service are called postal inspectors. These inspectors were originally called surveyors and received a title change in 1801 to special agent. In 1880, the U.S. Congress created the position of Chief Postal Inspector and renamed these special agents to postal inspectors. The first special agents in the United States were appointed in 1791 when the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] was authorized to employ "Special Agents" for the purpose of examining the accounts and books of the Collectors of Customs. The position of Special Treasury Agent was created, and until 1860 submitted reports to the [[United States Department of Treasury|Department of Treasury]], through the Collectors of Customs in the Customs District in which they were employed.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

===Other titles===
The titles special agent and [[secret agent]] are not synonymous. The title special agent is commonly the official title assigned to individuals employed in that capacity, especially by the U.S. agencies described above (and for the reasons described below), whereas secret agent is less of an official title, but is used to describe individuals employed or engaged in [[espionage]]. Special agents, like state, county, and municipal [[law enforcement officer]]s, can, at various times, engage in secret or undercover activities as part of [[sting operation|investigative operations]], or counter-espionage assignments, during which they might be referred to as [[undercover]] agents. They may also be referred to, or refer to themselves, as criminal investigators, federal agents, U.S. Agents, U.S Special Agents, U.S. Federal Agents, agents, federal authorities, federal officers, federal investigators, or U.S. officers.

Criminal Investigators of the U.S. Secret Service conduct criminal investigations pertaining to counterfeit U. S. currency, financial and electronic crimes, and are "Special Agents". But Secret Service Special Officers who assist Special Agents on protective details only and do not conduct criminal investigations of any kind are, like the USSS Uniformed Division Officers, only considered to be "Agents".

At the management level, the head of a region or office might be called a '''special agent in charge''', abbreviated as an '''SAC''' or '''SAIC'''. The Deputy Special Agent in Charge (DSAC), acts as the operational manager for investigations and typically supervises Assistant Special Agents in Charge (ASAC's). First line supervisors may be called simply Supervisory Special Agent. Assistant Special Agent in Charge, abbreviated as ASAC, are second line supervisors.

===Jurisdictional issues===
Exactly which U.S. special agents have the broadest authority is a matter of debate. The issue of concurrent jurisdiction (in which multiple agencies have non-exclusive jurisdiction over a given set of the [[United States Code|U.S. Code]], such as the FBI, HSI and DEA in respect to drug laws) does not make the issue clearer. However, special agents of many agencies can often enforce [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] (general criminal code) of the US Code included in their agency specific duties. Some U.S. special agents have a larger number of Titles, or just different Titles, to enforce and with those titles sometimes include unique authorities.

The following are some examples of unique authorities that agency-specific special agents possess: [[Administrative subpoena]] powers. Department of Defense and any military special agents are authorized to enforce the UCMJ. Title 19 designation authorizes HSI special agents, CBP officers, Border Patrol Agents to perform [[border search]]es, which require no suspicion or warrant.

Some agencies have been designated lead agency by the Attorney General over particular types of investigations. The FBI usually is the lead in public corruption cases involving elected government officials. In another instance, HSI is normally the lead agency in matters with a clear nexus to the U.S. border, including weapons and narcotics smuggling; financial crimes, money laundering and bulk cash smuggling; human trafficking or smuggling; counter-terrorism; counter proliferation; cybercrime; transnational gang activity; commercial fraud and intellectual property theft; human rights violations; immigration, document and benefit fraud; international art and antiquity theft; and import/export violations.

Many exclusive jurisdictions also exist. In these cases, only one criminal investigative agency is authorized or assigned jurisdiction over a particular Title or type of investigation.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

Special agents of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], [[FBI]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]]-[[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement#Homeland Security Investigations .28HSI.29|Homeland Security Investigations]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], [[United States Secret Service|USSS]], [[Diplomatic Security Service |DSS]], and [[United States Marshals Service|USMS]] not only have the power to enforce the General Criminal Code (Title 18),{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} but also applicable state and local laws if authorized by the state in which they are operating. [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service]] (DCIS), [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command]] (USACIDC), [[United States Army Counterintelligence]], [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS), and [[U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] (AFOSI) special agents not only investigate statutes within the United States Code and state and local laws with a nexus to their branch, but are also tasked with enforcing the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ), a jurisdiction not held by most of the larger federal agencies. All DCIS, USACIDC, Army Counterintelligence, NCIS, and AFOSI special agents enjoy statutory law enforcement authority, although civilian and military agents derive their principal arrest authority from different federal statutes. Other special agents, such as those employed by the [[National Park Service]], have jurisdiction over crimes committed within the boundaries of or have a nexus to the lands managed by their agency or department only. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement#Homeland Security Investigations .28HSI.29|Homeland Security Investigations]] (HSI) Special Agents have administrative arrest powers under the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality Act]]. They can administratively arrest and detain aliens for violations of United States immigration laws pending federal removal (deportation) proceedings. HSI Special Agents can also seize merchandise and articles introduced into the United States contrary to U.S. laws under [[Title 19 of the United States Code]].{{fact|date=February 2016}}

Certain active-duty special agents employed by the military have broad authority, when the nexus of the violation they are investigating occurred on military-controlled areas or there is a military connection.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

===U.S. railroads===
All of the major [[List of U.S. Class I railroads|Class I railroads]], most regional carriers, and some local railways employ their own police departments whose officers carry the title special agent. Railroad special agents are commissioned by the governor or other agency of the state they are employed in, are armed, and carry state arrest powers in all states in which their employing railroad owns property, if authorized by the state. Their primary concern is policing crimes against the railroad, although they sometimes have the authority to police the general public, make arrests on public property, and enforce applicable local, state, or federal laws when necessary.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

The [[BNSF Police Department#Jurisdiction|BNSF Police Department]], [[Union Pacific Police Department#Jurisdiction and duties|Union Pacific Police Department]], and [[Amtrak Police#Rank structure and insignia|Amtrak Police]], among other departments, all utilize the rank/title of "Special Agent".{{fact|date=February 2016}}

[[Railroad police]] and the term special agent, along with the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton Detective Agency]], were models for the FBI when it was created in 1907.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

==State, county, municipal, and tribal governments==
A state or municipal criminal investigator can also be a special agent if so titled by the employing agency. Some examples include the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]'s [[Alabama Bureau of Investigation]], [[Illinois Department of Revenue]]'s [[Illinois Bureau of Criminal Investigations|Bureau of Criminal Investigation]], the [[Georgia Bureau of Investigation]], [[Ohio Attorney General]]'s Office, Iowa Department of Public Safety, [[Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control]] Bureau of Law Enforcement, [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]], and the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]].{{fact|date=February 2016}}

Several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes also employ special agents as criminal investigators, court investigators, or gaming investigators, and some are deputized as special federal officers of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].{{fact|date=February 2016}}

==In popular culture==
Special Agents, particularly those within the FBI, have been depicted in [[Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_portrayal_in_media|popular entertainment]] for years.

The title "assistant special agent in charge" and its acronym "ASAC" are stated frequently throughout the TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. For example, in [[Breaking Bad (season 1)|Season 1]] through [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|Season 4]], both [[Hank Schrader]] and [[Gus Fring]] are shown to be friendly with Hank's boss, ASAC [[List of Breaking Bad characters#George Merkert|George Merkert]], and in Season 4 Episode 12 "[[End Times (Breaking Bad)|End Times]]", [[Steve Gomez]] tells [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Dennis Markowsky|Dennis]] the "ASAC" is being pressured to search Gus's laundry for drugs. In Season 5, Hank – who is proud to have been promoted to the job vacated by his ousted boss – repeatedly chants "ASAC Schrader" to his baby niece [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Holly White|Holly]].{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In the TV series ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', [[List of White Collar characters#Peter Burke|Peter Burke]] is the "Special Agent in Charge" (promoted from assistant special agent in charge at the end of Season 6) and the head of the Manhattan White Collar Division.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In the TV series ''[[The X Files]]'', the title "special agent" is given to both Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The title is referenced by them numerous times throughout each episode.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

The main character from the TV series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', is FBI Special Agent ''[[Dale Cooper]]'', and also, other FBI special agents make numerous cameos throughout the series, and its prequel movie, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me]]''.

'''TONO''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] corporation that administers [[copyright]]s for music in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TONO - Tono|url=https://www.tono.no/english/|website=Tono|accessdate=23 September 2017|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is owned and governed by its members; composers, music publishers and text-writers. Through the managing agreement the originators give TONO an exclusive right to administer the members' performing rights in Norway. 

By 2006 the number of members reached about 14,000, through agreements of reciprocation with about 60 other corporations, organised under the umbrella-organisation [[Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs|CISAC]]. TONO ''de facto'' manages the whole world-repertoire. TONO was originally created in 1928 under the name of ''Norsk Komponistforenings Internasjonale Musikkbyrå''. Managing of mechanical rights is transferred to NCB, ''Nordisk Copyright Byrå''.

Norway has ratified the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] protecting literary and artistic productions. Furthermore, the convention’s articles are continued in Norwegian law through ''Lov om opphavsrett til åndsverk'' 12. mai Nr.2 1961 (åndsverkloven). The law provides the originator an exclusive right to make productions accessible to an audience. Thereby also granting the originator an exclusive right to consent in public use of his or hers productions. According to the law the production is made accessible when it is performed publicly. An important principle of the Berne Convention is that foreign originators, whose country has ratified the convention, as the same protection has national originators.

On this legal background TONO collects amends for broadcasting and other public use of musical productions. Responsible for paying the fee is the person responsible for making the production accessible to the public. The fees are then distributed to each originator individually. The deductions are made possible by reports made by those responsible for making the productions accessible. The reports contain information of the productions that have been used as well as frequency. As a result of TONO being a non-profit organisation, over 80% of the total income is transferred to the originators. The net result transferred to the originators in 2005 was {{NOK|218,579,908}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15848">The '''Tariff Act of 1789,''' was the first major Act passed in the United States under its present Constitution of 1789 and had two purposes as stated in Section I of the Act which reads as follows;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas it is necessary for that support of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States, and the encouragement and protection of manufactures, that duties be laid on goods, wares and merchandise&lt;ref&gt;United States Statutes At Large, Vol. 1, Dennis &amp; Co., Inc. Buffalo, N.Y. 1961, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Federal legislature, acting under the recently ratified US Constitution, authorized the collection of tariff and tonnage duties to meet the operating costs of the new central government, to provide funds to pay the interest and principal on [[American Revolution|revolutionary war]] debts inherited from the [[Continental Congress]].&lt;ref name="Miller1960p15"&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided a degree of protection. "The protective acts of the states furnished the experience on which the national legislators based their proceedings."&lt;ref&gt;William Hill, Protective Purpose of the Tariff Act of 1789, The Journal of Political Economy, Volume 2, December 1, 1893, p. 54 www.archive.org/stream/jstor-1819831/1819831#page/n1/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; The general range of duties was by no means such as would have been thought protective in later days; but the intention to protect was there.&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Taussig, The Tariff History of the United States, Fifth Edition, G. P. Putnam's Sons, The Knickerbacker Press, 1910, p. 9, www.mises.org/etexts/taussig.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The debates over the purpose of the tariff exposed the sectional interests at stake: Northern manufacturers favored high duties to protect industry; Southern planters desired a low tariff that would foster cheap consumer imports.&lt;ref name="Miller1960p15"/&gt; The final bill extracted concessions from both interests, but delivered a distinct advantage to maritime and manufacturing regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone, 1960, p. 256"&gt;Malone, 1960, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Representative [[James Madison]]  of Virginia navigated to passage, but was unable to insert provisions that would have discriminated against British imports&lt;ref name="Malone, 1960, p. 256"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 16-17, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and shift the carrying trade to French and American vessels.
 
The Tariff Bill was passed in the House by a vote of 31-19 on July 1, 1789; the resultant enrolled Bill was signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on July 2, 1789; and President Washington signed the Act in law on July 4, 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 15, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic conditions prior to passage==
The American Revolution was followed by an economic reorganization, which carried in its wake a period of uncertainty and hard times. During the conflict, labor and investment had been diverted from agriculture and legitimate trade to manufacturing and privateers. Men had gone into occupations that ceased with the end of the war. Lowered prices, resulting from the cessation of war demands, in combination with the importation of the cheaper goods of Europe, were fast ruining such infant manufacturing concerns as had sprung up during the war, some of which were at a comparative disadvantage with the resumption of normal foreign trading relations.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1938, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor which made the situation even  more distressing was the British [[Navigation Acts]]. The only clause in the treaty of peace (1783) concerning commerce was a stipulation guaranteeing that the navigation of the Mississippi would be forever free to the United States. [[John Jay]] had tried to secure some reciprocal trade provisions with Great Britain but without result. Pitt, in 1783, introduced a bill into the British Parliament providing for free trade between the United States and the British colonies, but instead of passing the bill, Parliament enacted the British [[Navigation Act 1783]], which admitted only British built and manned ships to the ports of the West Indies, and imposed heavy tonnage dues upon American ships in other British ports. It was amplified in 1786 by another act designed to prevent the fraudulent registration of American vessels and by still another in 1787, which prohibited the importation of American goods by way of foreign islands. The favorable features of the old Navigation Acts that had granted bounties and reserved the English markets in certain cases to colonial products were gone; the unfavorable ones were left. The British market was further curtailed by the depression there after 1783. Although the French treaty of 1778 had promised "perfect equality and reciprocity" in commercial relations, it was found impossible to make a commercial treaty on that basis. Spain demanded, as the price for reciprocal trading relations, a surrender by the United States for 25 years the right of navigating the Mississippi, a price that the New England merchants would have been glad to pay.

France (1778) and the Netherlands (1782) made treaties but not on even terms; Portugal refused all advances. Only Sweden (1783) and Prussia (1785) made treaties guaranteeing reciprocal commercial privileges.&lt;ref name="faulkner182"&gt;Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1938, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The weakness of Congress under the Articles of Confederation prevented retaliation by the central government. Congress repeatedly asked for power to regulate commerce.but was refused by the states upon which rested the execution of such commercial treaties as Congress might negotiate. Eventually, the states themselves attempted retaliatory measures, and from 1783 to 1788, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia levied tonnage dues upon British vessels or discriminating tariffs upon British goods. Whatever effect these efforts might have had were neutralized by the fact that the duties varied 0% to 100%, which simply drove British ships to the free or cheapest ports to flood the market with their goods. Commercial war between the states followed and turned futility into chaos.&lt;ref name="faulkner182"/&gt;

Adoption of the Constitution meant the elimination of many of the economic ills under which industry and commerce had struggled since the war. A reorganization was essential and the immediate economic results were salutary. Its most important additions to the power of Congress were those relating to finance and commerce: it enabled the federal government to levy taxes, regulate trade, coin money, protect industry, and direct the settlement of the West, and, as later events proved, to establish credit and redeem its securities. Under it, freedom of trade was insured throughout the young republic.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1938, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months leading up to the passage of the Tariff Act, Congress received several petitions from different cities representing manufacturing groups asking for relief from the flood of European imported goods.

The United States Congress answered the petitions of these groups for urgent attention, by making the Tariff of 1789 the first major bill to be considered in its first session and passed.

==Import duty legislation and American sectional interests==

The import fees "represented a compromise between the advocates of a high protective tariff and those who favored a tariff for revenue only [to maintain the central government]."&lt;ref name="Miller1960p15"/&gt; Charges up to fifty percent were imposed on selected manufactured and agricultural goods, including "steel, ships, cordage, tobacco, salt, indigo [and] cloth." On the majority of items subject to duty, a five percent fee was levied, ''[[ad valorem tax|ad valorem]]''.&lt;ref name="Miller1960p15"/&gt; Molasses, an indispensable ingredient for Northeastern rum producers, was lowered from 6¢ per gallon to 2.5¢. 
 
Madison modified the terms of the tariff to balance sectional conflicts&lt;ref name="Miller1960p15"/&gt; but conceded that articles subject to high duties "were pretty generally taxed for the benefit of the manufacturing part of the northern community."&lt;ref name="Miller1960p16"&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the South, the main wealth-producing part of the nation, would inevitably "shoulder a disproportionate share of the financial burden involved in the transforming the United States into a commercial, manufacturing, and maritime power."&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 18"&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tonnage duty legislation and US foreign relations==

In its final form, the tariff erected "an American navigation system," superseding the individual state sanctioned fees designed to protect domestic shipping during the [[Articles of Confederation]] period from 1781 to 1789.&lt;ref name="Miller1960p16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1957, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The act established tonnage rates favorable to American carriers by charging them lower cargo fees than those imposed on foreign boats importing similar goods. Coastal trade was reserved exclusively for American flag vessels.&lt;ref name="Miller1960p16"/&gt; These provisions were consistent with mercantilist policies practice by European powers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960,  p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dating from the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], ending the [[American Revolutionary War|War for Independence]] in 1783, Great Britain had declined to seek a commercial treaty with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1957, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, provisions of the treaty had gone unfulfilled, including compensation to slaveholders for slaves emancipated by the British Navy during the War and the failure to abandon military posts in the [[Northwest Territory]].&lt;ref name="Miller1960p16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1957, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Great Britain remained the dominant trading partner for the United States, the countries reverting to an essentially colonial-era trade relationship.  
 
Representative James Madison, presiding over the tariff debates in Congress, attempted to introduce discriminatory provisions into the tonnage legislation that would favor France and its colonial possessions and shift American trade away from Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Miller1960p16"/&gt;
 
To effect this, Madison called for a 60¢ per ton fee upon foreign carriers lacking a commercial agreement with the United States, while France, which possessed a treaty, would be charged tonnage at 30¢. This measure alone "was equivalent to levying economic war" upon Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Madison's proposals were intended to unify politically the agricultural and manufacturing interests in support of that commercial realignment at the national level, damaging to Great Britain and beneficial to revolutionary France.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 16-17, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Many representatives of northern business were wary of abandoning Great Britain as their primary trading partner and [[merchant marine]] and questioned whether France could ever act "as the principle supplier and market for the United States." &lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 18"/&gt;
 
The House of Representatives, nevertheless, initially passed Madison's "controversial" legislation,&lt;ref name="Miller1960p16"/&gt; with the discriminatory provision intact. The Senate, however, removed it from the bill and sent it back to the House, where it was passed, without amendment, 31 to 19, on July 4, 1789.&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 19"&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Tariff of 1789 placed France and Great Britain on an equal footing with regard to shipping, manufactures, and raw products delivered to American ports. All foreign-owned or foreign-built ships paid 50¢ per ton duty; American-owned vessels were charged 6¢ per ton.&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 19"/&gt;

==Political and sectional responses to the tariff==
Madison's attempt to enlist northern merchants and businessmen in supporting an economic contest with Great Britain elicited a cool response.&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 18, p. 19"&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 18, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, British capital and markets contributed to the general prosperity of the North, and secondly, a shift towards France would mean aligning the United States with a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|revolutionary government]] that exhibited what Federalist leadership regarded as "an excess of democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Brock, 1957, p. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 100"&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Alexander Hamilton]], soon to enter the executive branch as Secretary of the Treasury, declined to support Madison's proposal and warned that economic warfare with Great Britain would drastically reduce the import duty revenue that the tariff legislation called for, placing at risk the funds anticipated to run the new federal government and finance the national debt.&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 18"/&gt;

This dispute between Madison and Hamilton marked "the first important breach" between these two Federalist leaders,&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 19"/&gt; which would deepen when Hamilton, as Treasury Secretary, launched his fiscal and economic programs, ending their long collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation produced the first sectional strains within "the Federalist coalition of northern businessmen and southern planters."&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 100"/&gt; In the South, "agricultural interests" viewed the high tariff and tonnage rates as a triumph for northern merchants and manufacturers, the burden of which fell on southern staple crop exporters.&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 18, p. 19"/&gt;

This early application of constitutional authority highlighted north-south social and economic differences and presaged the dissolution of the Federalist coalition, the formation of an agrarian alliance,&lt;ref name="Miller, 1960, p. 100"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1948, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of the [[First Party System]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1960, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, 1960, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Emperor's New Clothes'''" ({{lang-da|Kejserens nye klæder}}) is a short tale written by Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]], about two weavers who promise an [[emperor]] a new suit of clothes that they say is invisible to those who are unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent – while in reality, they make no clothes at all, making ''everyone'' believe the clothes are invisible to them. When the emperor parades before his subjects in his new "clothes", no one dares to say that they do not see any suit of clothes on him for fear that they will be seen as stupid. Finally, a child cries out, "But he isn't wearing anything at all!"  The tale has been translated into over 100 languages.&lt;ref name="AndP4"&gt;Andersen 2005a 4&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Emperor’s New Clothes" was first published with "[[The Little Mermaid]]" in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]], by C. A. Reitzel, on 7&amp;nbsp;April 1837, as the third and final installment of Andersen's ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]''. The tale has been [[The Emperor's New Clothes#Adaptations and cultural references|adapted to various media]], and the story's title, the phrase "The Emperor has no clothes", and variations thereof have been adopted for use in numerous [[The Emperor's New Clothes (disambiguation)|other works]] and as [[The Emperor's New Clothes#Use as an idiom|an idiom]].

==Plot==
A vain [[emperor]] who cares about nothing except wearing and displaying clothes hires weavers who promise him they will make him the best suit of clothes. The weavers are con-men who convince the emperor they are using a fine fabric invisible to anyone who is either unfit for his position or "hopelessly stupid". The [[Fraud|con]] lies in that the weavers are actually only [[mime|pretending]] to manufacture the clothes. Thus, no one, not even the emperor nor his [[Minister (government)|minister]]s can see the alleged "clothes", but they all pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions. Finally, the weavers report that the suit is finished and they mime dressing the emperor who then marches in procession before his subjects. The townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear unfit for their positions or stupid. Finally, a child in the crowd blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all and the cry is then taken up by others. The emperor realizes the assertion is true but continues the procession.

==Sources==
Andersen's tale is based on a 1335 story from the {{lang|es|[[Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio|Libro de los ejemplos]]}} (or {{Lang|es|El Conde Lucanor}}),&lt;ref&gt;In Spanish:''[[wikisource:es:Conde Lucanor:Ejemplo 32|Exemplo XXXIIº]]&amp;nbsp;– De lo que contesció a un rey con los burladores que fizieron el paño''. In English: [http://www.elfinspell.com/CountLucanor3.html#ch7 Of that which happened to a King and three Impostors] from ''Count Lucanor; of the Fifty Pleasant Stories of Patronio'', written by the Prince Don Juan Manuel and first translated into English by James York, M. D., 1868, Gibbings &amp; Company, Limited; London; 1899; pp. xiii–xvi. Accessed 2010-03-06. This version of the tale is one of those collected by [[Idries Shah]] in ''[[World Tales]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  a medieval Spanish collection of fifty-one cautionary tales with various sources such as [[Aesop]] and other classical writers and Persian folktales, by [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena]] (1282–1348).  Andersen did not know the Spanish original but read the tale in a German translation, titled {{Lang|de|"So ist der Lauf der Welt"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bredsdorff 312–3&lt;/ref&gt; In the source tale, a king is hoodwinked by weavers who claim to make a suit of clothes invisible to any man not the son of his presumed father; whereas Andersen altered the source tale to direct the focus on courtly pride and intellectual vanity rather than adulterous paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Wullschlager 2000, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/forskning/konference/tekst_e.html?id=10922 |publisher=HC Andersen Centret|title=Count Lucanor by Don Juan Manuel as Inspiration for Hans Christian Andersen and Other European Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an Indian version of the story, which appears in the ''Līlāvatīsāra'' by Jinaratna (1283), a summary of a now-lost anthology of fables, the ''Nirvāṇalīlāvatī'' by Jineśvara (1052). The dishonest merchant Dhana from [[Hastinapur|Hastināpura]] swindles the King of [[Shravasti|Śrāvastī]] by offering to weave a supernatural garment that cannot be seen or touched by any person of illegitimate birth. When the king is supposedly wearing the garment, his whole court pretends to admire it. The king is then paraded about his city to show off the garment; when the common folk ask him if he has become a [[Digambara|naked ascetic]], he realizes the deception, but the swindler has already fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl0l5ZTkNxI|author=Anthony Kennedy Warder|year=1992|title=Indian Kāvya Literature: The art of storytelling, Volume 6|pages=261-262, 268-270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Andersen's manuscript was at the printer's when he was suddenly inspired to change the original climax of the tale from the emperor's subjects admiring his invisible clothes to that of the child's cry.&lt;ref&gt;Wullschlager 2000, p.  177&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many unconfirmed theories about why he made this change.  Most scholars agree that from his earliest years in Copenhagen, Andersen presented himself to the Danish bourgeoisie as the naïvely precocious child not usually admitted to the adult [[Salon (gathering)|salon]].  "The Emperor's New Clothes" became his [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] of the hypocrisy and snobbery he found there when he finally gained admission.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 2005b, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen's decision to change the ending may have occurred after he read the manuscript tale to a child,&lt;ref&gt;Bredsdorff, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; or its inspiration may have been one of Anderson's own childhood incidents which was similar to that in the tale: he once recalled standing in a crowd with his mother, waiting to see King [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]], and when the king made his appearance, Andersen cried out, "Oh, he's nothing more than a human being!"  His mother then tried to silence him saying, "Have you gone mad, child?"  Whatever the reason, Andersen thought the change would prove more satirical.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
[[File:C.A. Jensen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Andersen in 1836]]

"The Emperor's New Clothes" was first published with "[[The Little Mermaid]]" on 7&amp;nbsp;April 1837, by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, as the third and final installment of the first collection of Andersen's ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]''.  The first two booklets of the collection were published in May and December 1835, and met with little critical enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Wullschlager 2000, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  Andersen waited a year before publishing the third installment of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 2005d, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Danish tales, as well as German and French folktales, were regarded as a form of exotica in nineteenth century Denmark and were read aloud to select gatherings by celebrated actors of the day. Andersen's tales eventually became a part of the repertoire, and readings of "The Emperor's New Clothes" became a specialty of and a big hit for the popular Danish actor Ludvig Phister.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 2005d, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1&amp;nbsp;July 1844, the Hereditary Grand Duke [[Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Carl Alexander]] held a literary soiree at [[Ettersburg]] in honor of Andersen. Tired by speaking various foreign languages and on the verge of vomiting after days of feasting, the author managed to control his body and read aloud "[[The Princess and the Pea]]", "Little Ida's Flowers", and "The Emperor's New Clothes".&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 2005d, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
[[Jack Zipes]], in ''Hans Christian Andersen: The Misunderstood Storyteller'', suggests that seeing is presented in the tale as the courage of one's convictions; Zipes believe this is the reason the story is popular with children. Sight becomes insight, which, in turn, prompts action.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes 2005, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alison Prince]], author of ''Hans Christian Andersen: The Fan Dancer'', claims that Andersen received a gift of a ruby and diamond ring from the king after publications of "The Emperor's New Clothes" and "[[The Swineherd]]"—tales in which Andersen voices a satirical disrespect for the court. Prince suggests the ring was an attempt to curb Andersen's sudden bent for [[political satire]] by bringing him into the royal fold. She points out that after "[[The Swineherd]]", he never again wrote a tale colored with political satire, but, within months of the gift, began composing "[[The Ugly Duckling]]", a tale about a bird born in a henyard who, after a lifetime of misery, matures into a swan, "one of those royal birds".&lt;ref&gt;Prince, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hans Christian Andersen: The Life of a Storyteller'', biographer Jackie Wullschlager points out that Andersen was not only a successful adapter of existing lore and literary material, such as the Spanish source tale for "The Emperor's New Clothes", but was equally competent at creating new material that entered the human [[collective consciousness]] with the same mythic power as ancient, anonymous lore.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 2005a, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hollis Robbins]], in "The Emperor's New Critique" (2003), argues that the tale is itself so transparent "that there has been little need for critical scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robbins, Hollis |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/new_literary_history/v034/34.4robbins.html  |title=The Emperor's New Critique|journal=New Literary History|volume= 34|number= 4|date= Autumn 2003|accessdate= March 1, 2013|pages= 659–675|doi=10.1353/nlh.2004.0010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins argues that Andersen's tale "quite clearly rehearses four contemporary controversies:  the institution of a meritocratic civil service, the valuation of labor, the expansion of democratic power, and the appraisal of art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robbins, Hollis |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/new_literary_history/v034/34.4robbins.html  |title=The Emperor's New Critique|journal=New Literary History|volume= 34|number= 4|date= Autumn 2003|accessdate= March 1, 2013|page= 670}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robbins concludes that the story's appeal lies in its "seductive resolution" of the conflict by the truth-telling boy.

In ''The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen'' (2008), folk and fairy tale researcher [[Maria Tatar]] offers a scholarly investigation and analysis of the story, drawing on Robbins' political and sociological analysis of the tale.  Tatar points out that Robbins indicates the swindling weavers are simply insisting that "the value of their labor be recognized apart from its material embodiment" and notes that Robbins considers the ability of some in the tale to see the invisible cloth as "a successful enchantment".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tatar pages 8, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Tatar observes that "The Emperor's New Clothes" is one of Andersen's best-known tales and one that has acquired an iconic status globally as it migrates across various cultures reshaping itself with each retelling in the manner of oral folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar xxii, xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have noted that the phrase, "Emperor's new clothes", has become a standard metaphor for anything that smacks of pretentiousness, pomposity, social hypocrisy, collective denial, or hollow ostentatiousness.  Historically, the tale established Andersen's reputation as a children's author whose stories actually imparted lessons of value for his juvenile audience, and "romanticized" children by "investing them with the courage to challenge authority and to speak truth to power."&lt;ref&gt;Tatar xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; With each successive description of the swindlers' wonderful cloth, it becomes more substantial, more palpable, and a thing of imaginative beauty for the reader even though it has no material existence. Its beauty, however, is obscured at the end of the tale with the obligatory moral message for children. Tatar is left wondering if the real value of the tale is the creation of the wonderful fabric in the reader's imagination or the tale's closing message of speaking truth no matter how humiliating to the recipient.

Naomi Wood of [[Kansas State University]] challenges Robbins' reading, arguing that before the [[September 11 attacks|World Trade Center attacks of 2001]], "Robbins's argument might seem merely playful, anti-intuitive, and provocative."&lt;ref&gt;Wood 193–207&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood concludes: "Perhaps the truth of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' is not that the child's truth is mercifully free of adult corruption, but that it recognizes the terrifying possibility that whatever words we may use to clothe our fears, the fabric cannot protect us from them."&lt;ref&gt;Wood 205&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, computer scientist [[C.A.R.

This followed requests from the player base to be able to hide a piece of equipment they do not want displayed, using the in-game glamour system that allows gear appearance alteration. The flavour text of the gear pieces is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the tale: ''"The most beautiful handwear you never have seen".''

==Use as an idiom==
As an idiom, use of the story's title refers to something widely accepted as true or professed as being praiseworthy, due to an unwillingness of the general population to criticize it or be seen as going against popular opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/the+emperor's+new+clothes|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|title=Idoioms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "emperor's new clothes" has become an [[idiom]] about [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graves, Joseph L. |date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXv7KfkomI8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=  |title=The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robbins, Hollis |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/new_literary_history/v034/34.4robbins.html  |title=The Emperor's New Critique|journal=New Literary History|volume= 34|number= 4|date= Autumn 2003|accessdate= March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story may be explained by [[pluralistic ignorance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Zellner, William W. &amp; Petrowsky, Marc|date=1998| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MI82YLm244C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq= |title=Sects, Cults, and Spiritual Communities: A Sociological Analysis|page= 13|quote=&lt;!-- Pluralistic ignorance is caused by constraints on communication that prevent members from raising questions and expressing doubts .... --&gt;Like the villagers in the story of the emperor's new clothes, members of the inner circle were unwilling to reveal their ignorance by challenging ....

The story is about a situation where "no one believes, but everyone believes that everyone else believes. Or alternatively, everyone is ignorant to whether the emperor has clothes on or not, but believes that everyone else is not ignorant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hansen, Jens Ulrik|date=2011|url=https://www.academia.edu/1894486/A_Logic-Based_Approach_to_Pluralistic_Ignorance  |title=A Logic-Based Approach to Pluralistic Ignorance|website= Academia.edu|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14819">'''The Haitian National Truth and Justice Commission''' began its operations in April 1995 and ended in February 1996. [[Haiti]]'s once diverse and lively civil society had been tarnished greatly as a result of the ousting of its first democratically elected President, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], by its military forces. This deposing of President Aristide is widely known as a [[coup d'état]], and from 1991 to 1994, the country became known for its weak civilian government. The army was determined to return Haiti to the intimidated society existing during the Duvalier dictatorship seven years prior.

==Background==

===The Duvalier dictatorship===
The [[Duvalier regime]] of the late 1960s and the early 1970s is partly to blame for the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état|coup d'état]] that occurred resulting in Aristide's removal from power the first time. Duvalier was elected president with the help of the United States and a Haitian populace that was enduring a previous coup d'état that occurred in 1950.&lt;ref name=Silencing&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/03/01/silencing-people-destruction-civil-society-haiti |title=Silencing a People: The Destruction of Civil Society in Haiti |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 March 1993 |website=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in office, the Haitian President, [[François "Papa Doc" Duvalier]], had the [[Haitian constitution]] rewritten so that no other President could succeed him, despite his term legally ending on May 15, 1963. Duvalier remained Haiti's President until his death on April 21, 1971, ending the reign of the most corrupt President in Haiti's history. Most of Haiti's governments have been corrupt,&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt; essentially making him the most prestigious in this field so far.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The oppression in Haiti resulting from Duvalier's regime was evident. With much aid from the United States throughout this period, Haiti provided him with five palaces, the [[Tonton Macoute]], (which was his own private police force), and many sources of income.&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt;  At the time, [[Haiti's literacy rate]] was ten percent, fifty percent [[Health in Haiti|infant mortality rate]], fifteen percent of budget went in operations, while 85 percent went to the staff and associates of Duvalier.&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt;

Little of Papa Doc's mandate favored Haitian citizens and their [[human rights in Haiti|human rights]]. With the Tonton Macoute intimidating all threatening oppositions by forcing activists to leave the country or by ascertaining liberties or apportioning assets. Many executions were disguised, as exiles and sources state that as many as 2000 people could be executed in the span of one month&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt; during this dictatorship.

===Jean-Bertrand Aristide (1990–91)===
Being Haiti's first democratically elected president, coming out of a very harsh dictatorship, the Haitian populace welcomed Aristide with open arms. He symbolized change in a time that previously lacked hope in Haiti. Despite the people voting Aristide into office, he still had much of the Duvalier military to worry about and they had a very different opinion of the changes that were occurring in 1990.&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt; They became hostile towards the newly elected President and were able to assert their dominance of the island quickly as a result of their military weapons and training. Only a year into Aristide's presidency, he found himself removed from power by an army led by commander-in-chief, [[Raoul Cédras]], who had overseen many accounts of human rights violations without holding any of his section chiefs responsible.&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt;

The three year ''coup d'état'' brought systematic oppression for the citizens of Haiti, which was maintained through intimidation from a violent military who were said to be responsible for numerous beatings, killings and disappearances which led to the destruction of civil society in the country.&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt;

As a result of the worsening conditions in Haiti, the United Nations and the Organization of America States imposed [[international sanctions]] against Haiti because of the corrupt powers terrorizing and controlling the island. It was expected that Aristide would return as president of Haiti October 1993, but military deterrence pushed his return to power back as far as July of the next year. The deciding factor allowing Aristide to return to office was the 20,000 United States troops and the United Nations persuading support.&lt;ref name=Silencing/&gt;

==Commission nationale de vérité et de justice (CNVJ)==
The CNVJ was appointed by presidential Decree, six months after Aristide returned to office in Haiti. This Commission was established to seek and identify the instigators, perpetrators, and accessories to the many human rights violations and crimes against humanity following the military control of government from September 1991 to October 1994, both inside and outside the country.&lt;ref name=JHR&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quinn |first=Joanna |date=18 August 2009 |title=Haiti's Failed Truth Commission: Lessons in Transitional Justice |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14754830903110350?journalCode=cjhr20#.UrSYwtIW1ic |journal=Journal of Human Rights |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=265–281 |doi=10.1080/14754830903110350 |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was implemented in order to aid the country in reconciliation and to recover the truth about the human rights violations in the given time period. The hope of the commissioners was to provide a guideline for legal recourse and a way of helping the country move forward.

The Commission was required to submit a report that many felt was unfinished to an extent, mainly because Aristide was being pressured to hand the presidency over to his elected successor, and the mandate specifically expressed that the report had to be handed directly to Aristide.&lt;ref name=JHR/&gt; In the end the mandate was intended for everybody to access. Even though the report included the testimonies of the public, time and financial constraints that made it difficult for the report to provide details of what was discovered. A bright spot in the report was that it revealed names of almost 9,000 victims from the period along with the particular abuse that was inflicted upon them.&lt;ref name=JHR/&gt;

The initiative is largely credited to the Haitian diaspora as the impetus toward establishing a truth and justice commission initially came from Haitians abroad.

==The mandate of CNVJ==
The mandate of the CNVJ was to begin an investigation regarding human rights violations that occurred during the three year [[Haiti|coup d'état]] that begun September 30, 1991 until Aristide's return to power in October 1994.

"to globally establish the truth concerning the most serious Human Rights violations perpetrated between September 29, 1991 and October 15, 1994, inside and outside the country and help to the reconciliation of all Haitians without any prejudice against seeking legal action based on these violations."&lt;ref name=Benedetti&gt;Benedetti, Fanny."Haiti's Truth and Justice Commission."Human Rights Brief 3, no.3 (1996):4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is a quote from Jean-Bertrand Aristide upon creating the mandate of the CNVJ.

===Commissioners===
The commission consisted of seven commissioners, including two women and five men. It was supported by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) and the United Nations Permanent Mission to Haiti (''International Civilian Mission in Haiti'' or [[MICIVIH]]). Including the chair of the commission, four of the commissioners were Haitian nationals, a number of which had been living in exile (commission chair Francoise Boucard, Ertha Elysee, and {{ill|Rene Magloire|fr}}), and the final three were representatives of the international community ([[Patrick Lipton Robinson|Patrick Robinson]], Oliver Jackman, and Bacre Waly Ndiaye). Throughout the tenure of the commission, the CNVJ did 8,650 interviews with people uncovering 19,308 violations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]][AI] 1998:8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final report==
The final report of the CNVJ was submitted to Aristide on February 5, 1996. The commission had centered its findings on the testimonies gathered by forty Haitians and foreign rights investigators throughout the country in the summer of 1995."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; During the commission's investigation, they quickly discovered that they had to stress the safety of victims coming to testify because many of them feared retaliation as a result of their testimony. This caused the commission to take the path of discretion during their investigation to put victims at ease once they made the decision to speak out."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; Information soon got out to many popular organizations in Haiti, which allowed most of the population to obtain knowledge of the commission's ongoing investigation. Despite of the commission's activity in the country being common knowledge to the important organizations, they actually added to the efficiency of the investigation by notifying even more citizens."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; With these institutions influence, the inclination of the Haitian populace to testify increased, even though many were still threatened by the presence of known human rights violators walking around in immediate areas. In almost three months the CNVJ received more than seven thousand complaints from Haitian citizens."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; The human rights violations expressed in these complaints were documented thoroughly with questions created by the commission. In addition to the complaints the commission received, they used secondary information from local and international organizations (this included the United Nations and the Organization of American States Civil Mission in Haiti)."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; These secondary sources were essential to help validate the information given in the numerous complaints submitted.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The commission had to distinguish what classified as outstanding evidence against the perpetrators of human rights violations. They established three types of supporting evidence for different types of violations. They accepted testimonies that were backed by ''sufficient evidence'' which means that there was more proven facts supporting the testimony than opposing it."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; If the information gathered could not be contradicted by any other information then it was deemed to be ''overwhelming evidence''."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; The third distinction was if the evidence was extremely supportive to a finding of the commission, it was deemed to be ''substantial evidence''."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; These distinctions were used when testimonies revealed a violators name, which proved to be important because this was the goal of the mandate. The information given to the commission by thousands of victims, which revealed many perpetrators by name, was undermined by time constraints restricting the commission to perform thorough investigations of the accused. Some violators had numerous complaints towards them because they exercised most of their human rights violations in the same area, being observed by most community members."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt;

Once the victim testimonies were collected, they had to be carefully analyzed regionally, pertaining to the targets, planners and displays of repression cruelty."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; The commission opened special investigations pertaining to certain types of cruelty, such as sexual abuse and subjugation of the press.

The CNVJ prioritized investigations that pointed to the repression of government in a large scale, more than anything else. [[Truth commissions]] in the past, such as the [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador|UN Commission of El Salvador]], prioritized a smaller number of cases that impacted the country's society overall. It was the CNVJ's desire to essentially develop a summary of the repression. To contrast the UN Commission of El Salvador with the CNVJ, the commission in El Salvador did fewer but more detailed investigations which provided for more quality cases against named perpetrators to be done. The UN Commission of El Salvador had to do this because they had to worry about a twelve-year period of human rights violations as opposed to the Haitian mandate only having to worry about a three-year period of repression. As a result, the CNVJ's investigation had to be more widespread than the UN Commission of El Salvador.

Reconciliation is also stressed in the mandate of the CNVJ. The commission was not meant to be the reason for national reconciliation but to aid it, by revealing the truth regarding the past human rights violations that occurred in Haiti."&lt;ref name=Benedetti/&gt; The commission was implemented by executive order to provide guidance and influence rooted from the recommendations made to the Haitian government so the nation can move forward.

==Update==
Many of the victims are still waiting for justice for the terrors they endured during the [[Haiti|coup etat]] of 1991-1994, but a few important trials were held, specifically ones involving the Raboteau and the Carrefour-Feuillles killings. The case regarding the Raboteau, ended in November 2000 and as many as fifty accused perpetrators were convicted.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Massacre Witness Hearings Open in Haiti.|publisher=BBC News|date=2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included everybody in the military high command and the leaders of the paramilitary '''FRAPH (Front Revolutionaire pour l'Avancement et le Progres Haitiens)'''&lt;ref name=JHR/&gt; On May 3, 2005, the Supreme Court of Haiti opposed the verdicts given to fifteen of the former members of the FRAPH,.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; none of whom were imprisoned at the time.

The testimonies the commission based its findings on would have been more structured if the commission was able to gain access to the U.S government information regarding the FRAPH.&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida Website:Annex I, Annex II, and Overview of Statistical Analysis&lt;/ref&gt; Without this information from the United States, the testimonies lacked the quality needed for them to hold their ground. The United States documents concerning the FRAPH were finally returned to Haiti in early 2000, which was one of the final priorities of the Clinton Administration.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

'''''Ultra vires''''' is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] meaning "beyond the powers". If an act requires legal authority and it is done with such authority, it is characterised in law as '''''intra vires''''' ("within the powers"). If it is done without such authority, it is ''ultra vires''. Acts that are ''intra vires'' may equivalently be termed "valid" and those that are ''ultra vires'' "invalid".

Legal issues relating to ''ultra vires'' can arise in a variety of contexts:
* [[Company|Companies]] and other [[legal person]]s sometimes have limited [[capacity (law)|legal capacity to act]], and attempts to engage in activities beyond their legal capacity may be ''ultra vires''.&lt;ref name=Ashbury /&gt;  Most countries have restricted the doctrine of ''ultra vires'' in relation to companies by statute.
* Similarly, statutory and governmental bodies may have limits upon the acts and activities which they legally engage in.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]'' [1992] 2 AC 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Primary and secondary legislation|Subordinate legislation]] which is purported passed without the proper legal authority may be invalid as beyond the powers of the authority which issued it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Woolwich Equitable Building Society v IRC]]'' [1993] AC 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boddington&gt;{{cite bailii |litigants=[[Boddington v British Transport Police]] |year=1998 |court=UKHL |num=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate law ==
{{see also|Corporate law}}
{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

In corporate law, ''ultra vires'' describes acts attempted by a corporation that are beyond the scope of powers granted by the corporation's [[objects clause]], [[articles of incorporation]] or in a clause in its [[Bylaws]], in the laws authorizing a corporation's formation, or similar founding documents. Acts attempted by a corporation that are beyond the scope of its charter are [[Void (law)|void]] or [[voidable]]. 

# An ''ultra vires'' transaction cannot be ratified by shareholders, even if they wish it to be ratified.
# The doctrine of [[estoppel]] usually precluded reliance on the defense of ''ultra vires'' where the transaction was fully performed by one party.
# ''[[A fortiori]]'', a transaction which was fully performed by both parties could not be attacked.
# If the contract was fully executory, the defense of ''ultra vires'' might be raised by either party.
# If the contract was partially performed, and the performance was held to be insufficient to bring the doctrine of estoppel into play, a suit for [[quasi-contract]] for recovery of benefits conferred was available.
# If an [[agent (law)|agent]] of the corporation committed a [[tort]] within the scope of his or her employment, the corporation could not defend on the ground the act was ''ultra vires''.

Several modern developments relating to corporate formation have limited the probability that ultra vires acts will occur. Except in the case of [[non-profit corporation]]s (including [[municipal corporations]]), this legal doctrine is [[Desuetude|obsolescent]]; within recent years, almost all business corporations are chartered to allow them to transact any lawful business. The [[Model Business Corporation Act]] of the United States states that: "The validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act." The doctrine still has some life among non-profit corporations or state-created corporate bodies established for a specific public purpose, such as universities or charities.

===United States===
According to American laws, the concept of ''ultra vires'' can still arise in the following kinds of activities in some states:
# Charitable or political contributions
# Guaranty of indebtedness of another
# Loans to officers or directors
# Pensions, bonuses, stock option plans, job severance payments, and other fringe benefits
# The power to acquire shares of other corporations
# The power to enter into a partnership

===United Kingdom===
{{see also| United Kingdom company law}}
Historically all companies in the United Kingdom were subject to the doctrine of ''ultra vires'' and any act which was outside of the objects specified in a company's [[memorandum of association]] would be ''ultra vires'' and [[void (law)|void]].&lt;ref name=Ashbury&gt;''[[Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche]]'' (1875) LR 7 HL 653&lt;/ref&gt;  That result was commercially unpalatable, and led to companies being formed with extremely wide and generic objects clauses permitting a company to engage in all manner of commercial activities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltd v British Steel Corp]]'' [1986] Ch 246&lt;/ref&gt;  

The position was changed by statute by the [[Companies Act 1985]] which largely abolished the doctrine in relation to commercial companies.  The position is now regulated by the [[Companies Act 2006]], sections 31 and 39, which similarly greatly reduces the applicability of ''ultra vires'' in corporate law, although it can still apply in relation to charities and a shareholder may apply for an [[injunction]], in advance only, to prevent an act which is claimed to be ''ultra vires''.

In many jurisdictions, such as Australia, legislation provides that a corporation has all the powers of a natural person&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s124.html Sn 124 Legal capacity and powers of a Company], ''Corporations Act 2001'', Commonwealth Consolidated Acts&lt;/ref&gt; plus others; also, the validity of acts which are made ultra vires is preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s125.html Sn 125 Constitution may limit powers and set out objectives], ''Corporations Act 2001'', Commonlwealth Consolidated Acts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional law==
Under [[constitutional law]], particularly in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], constitutions give federal and provincial or state governments various powers. To go outside those powers would be ''ultra vires''; for example, although the court did not use the term in striking down a federal law in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' on the grounds that it exceeded the Constitutional authority of Congress, the Supreme Court still declared the law to be ''ultra vires''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', {{Ussc|514|549|1995|pin=567}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 15.2 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]], the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) is the sole lawmaking body in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In the case of ''[[CityView Press v AnCo]]'', however, the Irish Supreme Court held that the Oireachtas may delegate certain powers to subordinate bodies through primary legislation, so long as these delegated powers allow the delegatee only to further the principles and policies laid down by the Oireachtas in primary legislation and not craft new principles or policies themselves. Any piece of primary legislation that grants the power to make public policy to a body other than the Oireachtas is unconstitutional; however, as there is a presumption in Irish constitutional law that the Oireachtas acts within the confines of the Constitution, any legislation passed by the Oireachtas must be interpreted in such a way as to be constitutionally valid where possible.

Thus, in a number of cases where bodies other than the Oireachtas were found to have used powers granted to them by primary legislation to make public policy, the impugned primary legislation was read in such a way that it would not have the effect of allowing a subordinate body to make public policy. In these cases, the primary legislation was held to be constitutional, but the subordinate or secondary legislation, which amounted to creation of public policy, was held to be ''ultra vires'' the primary legislation and was struck down.

In [[UK constitutional law]], ''ultra vires'' describes patents, ordinances and the like enacted under the [[prerogative powers]] of the Crown that contradict statutes enacted by the [[Queen-in-Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]]. Almost unheard of in modern times, ''ultra vires'' acts by the Crown or its servants were previously a major threat to the [[rule of law]].

''[[Boddington v British Transport Police]]'' is an example of an appeal heard by House of Lords that contested that a bylaw was beyond the powers conferred to it under section 67 of the Transport Act 1962.&lt;ref name=Boddington /&gt;

==Administrative law==
In [[administrative law]], an act may be [[judicial review|judicially reviewable]] for ''ultra vires'' in a narrow or broad sense. Narrow ultra vires applies if an administrator did not have the substantive power to make a decision or it was wrought with procedural defects. Broad ''ultra vires'' applies if there is an abuse of power (e.g., [[Wednesbury unreasonableness]] or bad faith) or a failure to exercise an administrative discretion (e.g., acting at the behest of another or unlawfully applying a government policy) or application of discretionary powers in irrational and wrong way.&lt;ref&gt;Örücü Esin, The Liability of administration in England and main principles applied in judicial review, in Onar Armagani, Fakulteler Matbaasi, Istanbul 1977, p.660&lt;/ref&gt; Either doctrine may entitle a claimant to various prerogative writs, equitable remedies or statutory orders if they are satisfied.

===United Kingdom===
In the seminal case of ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1969] 2 WLR 163&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Reid is accredited with formulating the doctrine of ultra vires. However, ultra vires, together with unreasonableness, was mentioned much earlier by Lord Russell in the well known case, ''[[Kruse v Johnson]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1898]&lt;/ref&gt; regarding challenging by-laws and other rules. Anisminic is better known for not depriving courts of their jurisdiction to declare a decision a nullity, even if a statute expressly prevents the decision being subject to judicial review.  Further cases such as ''[[Bromley LBC v Greater London Council]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1983] AC 768 (see Lord Wilberforce's judgment)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1985] AC 374 (see Lord Diplock's judgment)&lt;/ref&gt; have sought to refine the doctrine.

In ''[[Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council v Hazell]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 2 AC 1&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that [[interest rate swap]]s entered into by [[local authority|local authorities]] (a popular method of circumventing statutory restrictions on local authorities borrowing money at that time) were all ''ultra vires'' and [[void (law)|void]], sparking a [[local authorities swaps litigation|raft of satellite litigation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14640">In United Kingdom law, the concept of '''wrongful dismissal''' refers exclusively to dismissal contrary to the contract of employment, which effectively means premature termination, either due to insufficient notice or lack of grounds. Although [[wrongful dismissal]] is usually associated with lack of notice sometimes it can also be caused by arbitrary dismissal where no notice was required but certain grounds were specified in the contract as being the only ones available but none existed.

{{Clist wrongful dismissal}}

== Definitions ==
Wrongful dismissal does not terminate the contract - it is a [[repudiatory breach]], i.e. one entitling the employee to consider himself no longer bound on the basis of the employer no longer considering itself bound. The employer's repudiatory breach (wrongful dismissal) forces the employee to accept it as he is prevented from earning from the employer and required to mitigate by working for someone else, thus terminating the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Boyo v Lambeth London Borough Council [1994] ICR 727&lt;/ref&gt; This does not follow contract law and is an invention by judges, disliked by others, designed to reflect the reality of employment, using the dual fictions that because the right to wages depends on the obligation to work, there is no right to wages if the employer tells the employee not to work&lt;ref&gt;Gunton v Richmond upon Thames LBC [1980] ICR 755&lt;/ref&gt; (forgetting that the employer is not able to terminate the obligation to work other than in accordance with the contract) and that the employee has accepted the repudiation by not working for the employer even though he is willing and able. Otherwise the employee would be entitled to stay at home at the employer's request yet sue for unpaid wages as a debt.

An employer is only entitled to dismiss an employee without notice:
* in the first month,
* if the contract says so, or
* if the employee conducts himself so as to undermine the trust and confidence such that the employer should no longer be required to retain the employee in his employment.

The last example, trust and confidence, is commonly known as "gross misconduct", but  employment law only distinguishes between misconduct that justifies dismissal and misconduct that does not. Conduct entitling the employer to terminate the contract is conduct indicating the employee no longer considers himself bound by it and so is technically accepting the termination caused by the employee. Gross misconduct is really just a vague list of offences that could most easily justify summary dismissal for a first offence.

Dismissal for a reason contrary to statute or contrary to a statutory procedure is described as "[[unfair dismissal]]" but not all wrongful dismissals are unfair dismissals, and dismissal by forcing somebody to resign through serious breach of contract is known as [[constructive dismissal]] and constructive dismissal is usually a wrongful dismissal due to lack of notice.

===Employer loses restrictive covenants===
If an employer dismisses an employee without legally required notice then the employee is usually not bound by restrictive covenants&lt;ref&gt;General Billposting Co Ltd v Atkinson [1909] AC 118&lt;/ref&gt; (increasingly though courts treat pay in lieu of notice as curing lack of notice&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams v Performing Rights Society Ltd [1995] ICR 1028&lt;/ref&gt;). This means the employer of a senior employee privy to company secrets should be careful not to unjustifiably summarily dismiss him, or put him on garden leave or pay him in lieu of notice without a contractual provision allowing it, or even miscalculate his notice period making it a day short.

Sometimes an employer can restore such covenants in a compromise agreement by paying a nominal sum of, say, £500 for them. The employer cannot circumvent the risk of a summary dismissal turning out to have been unlawful by giving notice, as that would imply the employee's breach of contract was insufficient to justify summary dismissal.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Notice period===
The notice period will usually be in the written agreement, otherwise there are statutory minimums but a court can imply a reasonable period and often will if it thinks the employee has been treated shabbily - for example, one week can turn into a month, and one month can turn into three months. The statutory minima are one week for one month to two years' service then one extra week per year of service from two to twelve years up to a maximum of 12 weeks. The minima will also override contractual provisions if insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Employment Rights Act 1996 s86&lt;/ref&gt; Common law notice, used by courts where the contract is silent, depends on the work, seniority, length of service and payment intervals, but not on what the employer can afford;&lt;ref&gt;Clark v Fahrenheit 451 (Communications) Ltd EAT/591/99&lt;/ref&gt; senior specialists can be given six or even up to twelve months.

===Right to work===

The employee is always entitled to be paid during his employment and the required notice period; they are often also entitled to work. Requiring the employee to spend the time in leisure (IE at home, on vacation, etc.) in order to "get them out of the way" can be considered illegal, even though it may be usually considered a benefit to the employee.

If an employer wants an exiting employee out of the way and does not have the contractual right to put him on [[garden leave]], or pay him in lieu of notice, then the only options are to encourage the use of holiday and offer a compromise agreement to waive his right to sue, in return for the intentional breach of contract. Sometimes the breach turns the termination payment into compensation rather than wages, making it tax-free, so the employee may be only too happy to go along with the ruse.

===Remedies===

In a tribunal the remedy would be compensation; in court the remedy would be damages but rarely an injunction. An injunction could be awarded to enforce a contractual disciplinary procedure,&lt;ref&gt;Barros D'sa v University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust [2001] EWCA Civ 983&lt;/ref&gt; but because compensation is usually an adequate remedy for premature termination, an injunction is generally not available to keep a job going,&lt;ref&gt;Marsh v National Autistic Society [1993] ICR 453&lt;/ref&gt; even in a redundancy situation where the selection process has been circumvented.
Action for wrongful dismissal can be brought within 6 years following the breach of an employment contract.

===Compensation===

====Losses====
For the notice period the employer must pay wages (including any anticipated pay rise&lt;ref&gt;Clarke v BET plc [1997] IRLR 348&lt;/ref&gt;) and benefits&lt;ref&gt;Fosca Services (UK) Ltd v Birkett [1996] IRLR 325&lt;/ref&gt; except holiday;
for wrongful dismissal, it is only possible to claim for lost earnings&lt;ref&gt;Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909]&lt;/ref&gt; and damage to reputation,&lt;ref&gt;Malik v Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International SA [1997] ICR 606&lt;/ref&gt; not for the manner of dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull CC [2004] EWCA Civ 84, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits====
Benefits include:
* pension,
* commission accrued and owed,&lt;ref&gt;M De Luca v Longbridge International plc 2002 LTL 2 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* bonus,
* overtime,
* accrued holiday on unpaid sick leave,&lt;ref&gt;Brown v Kigass Aero Components Ltd [2002] IRLR 312&lt;/ref&gt;
* income protection benefit and personal use of company car (usually running cost or hire car).&lt;ref&gt;Shove v Downs Surgical plc [1984] 1 All ER 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Share options will often be excluded by small print.

====Bonuses====
To avoid arguments about whether these would have been earned, it may make sense to compromise by paying the usual sort of overtime or bonus the employee would have gotten if working. Courts are astute to employers trying to wriggle out of paying commission with arguments like "it was not triggered because we dismissed him before pay day".&lt;ref&gt;Brand v Compro Computer Services Ltd [2004] IDS Brief 754&lt;/ref&gt; The employer is under a duty to act in good faith,&lt;ref&gt;Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald [2003] IRLR 765&lt;/ref&gt; not to exercise discretion spitefully or in bad faith&lt;ref&gt;Midland Bank plc v McCann, EAT 1041/97&lt;/ref&gt; and not to act perversely, irrationally or capriciously.&lt;ref&gt;Manor House Healthcare v Hayes, EAT 1196/99&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deductions====
The deductions that can be made from compensation are:
* replacement earnings or what the employee should have earned had he bothered to try (failure to mitigate),&lt;ref&gt;Yetton v Eastwoods Froy Ltd [1967] 1 WLR 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy v Polk (Leeds) Ltd [2004] IRLR 420&lt;/ref&gt;
* social security actually received&lt;ref&gt;Secretary of State for Employment v Stewart [1996] IRLR 334&lt;/ref&gt; or which could have been had he bothered to apply&lt;ref&gt;Westwood v Secretary of State for Employment [1985] ICR 209&lt;/ref&gt; and
* compensation already awarded for unfair dismissal under the same heading.&lt;ref&gt;O'Laoire v Jackel International Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mitigation====
Because it is a contract claim, the employee has a duty to mitigate his loss by seeking employment, as soon as possible, for as high a wage as possible;so the tribunal or court would deduct earnings from a new job, during the correct notice period from compensation due, but if the employer attempts to do this unilaterally, it may simply trigger a claim that would not otherwise have happened, had it turned a blind eye to the employee making a couple of weeks' wages out of the situation. Due to the disproportionate cost of employment litigations, it is usually sensible for an employer to err on the side of generosity, trying to ensure the parting of ways is amicable rather than showing off how many loopholes can be found.
Pensions cannot be deducted.&lt;ref&gt;Parry v Cleaver [1970] AC 1, HL&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible for a contract to be worded so as to make the pay in lieu of notice a debt, to which the employee is entitled even if he gets a new job the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory v Wallace [1998] IRLR 387&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==

===Breaches of contract===

Wrongful dismissal is the lesser type of unlawful dismissal, costing only what it would have done to keep the employee during the notice period, but it can be slightly dangerous for the employer, due to the potential loss of restrictive covenants and due to the employee being able to start alleging all sorts of breaches of contract, to try to use up the £25,000 breach of contract allowance in a tribunal, and if he takes the employer to court instead there is no limit and it could end  with significantly high costs.

====Examples====

Breaches of contract by the employer serious enough to create a wrongful dismissal are also a constructive dismissal; wrongful dismissals not caused by insufficient notice would have been caused by another breach, such as of the duty not to destroy the mutual bond of trust, and have included failure to inform of pension rights.&lt;ref&gt;Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1991] ICR 771&lt;/ref&gt;
The employer has no duty to act what would normally be called in good faith, but must not act in bad faith or insufficiently in good faith such that it breaks the mutual bond of trust.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd [1991] ICR 524&lt;/ref&gt; The obligation is usually not to do anything bad as opposed to doing something good.

====Losses====

The employee could allege extra breaches of contract and losses including:

* loss of earnings and psychiatrist fees for psychiatric injury caused by wrongful dismissal,&lt;ref&gt;Gogay v Hertfordshire CC [2000] IRLR 703&lt;/ref&gt;
* loss of earnings for the time it would have taken to follow the correct disciplinary procedure,
* loss of earnings for unpaid sick leave caused by bullying,
* loss of earnings caused by demotion,
* loss of earnings caused by stigma of association with a corrupt employer affecting many employees (as opposed to an incident of dishonesty),
* redundancy pay lost due to being terminated just before they would have qualified for two years' service, and
* loss of health insurance.

==Defences==

Successful defences have been:
* the employer discovers that the employee was in such serious breach, that he could have been summarily dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;Boston Deep Sea Fishing and Ice Co Ltd v Ansell (1888) 39 ChD 339&lt;/ref&gt;
* the contract allowed dismissal  without disciplinary procedure, as long as notice was given or paid in lieu.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgen v American Express Bank Ltd [2000] IRLR 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to unfair dismissal==

A wrongful dismissal can be a fair or unfair dismissal, just as an unfair dismissal may or may not be a wrongful dismissal in terms of whether the correct notice was given.

If the employee had two year's service he could claim unfair dismissal if there was something wrong with the decision to dismiss as opposed to the length of notice. If the wrongfulness was the lack of grounds then is it pretty certain to also be an unfair dismissal.

The unfair dismissal claim would, if he is well advised, be in respect of the post-termination period and sue in court for wrongful dismissal in respect of the notice period, thus stretching out the statutory limits by making the unfair dismissal limit only start running from a later date to allow perhaps more loss of earnings and ignoring the breach of contract limit by using the court instead of tribunal to deal with wrongful dismissal. The burden of proving double recovery is on the employer and tribunal awards for unfair dismissal can be vague as to what and when they are for.&lt;ref&gt;O'Laoire v Jackel International Ltd (No 2) [1991] ICR 718&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to constructive dismissal==
A wrongful dismissal can be actual or constructive, but a constructive dismissal is almost certain to be a wrongful one, since the correct notice will not have been given if the dismissal was caused by a resignation, itself caused by the employer's serious breach of contract. An employee who was constructively dismissed, as well as possibly having a claim for breach of the duty not to destroy the bond of mutual trust, will usually have a claim for wrongful dismissal. As only economic loss can be claimed for breach of contract, the main loss will be earnings due to the lost notice period, as opposed to any disgruntlement about the manner or reason for dismissal, so the constructive nature of the dismissal tends to disappear into the claim for lost notice period.

'''Youth justice system in England and Wales''' comprises the organs and processes that are used to prosecute, convict and punish persons under 18 years of age who commit criminal offences. The principal aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by children and young persons.&lt;ref name="s37"&gt;[[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], {{UKStatute|1570340|s. 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal law==
===Age of criminal responsibility===
Kids is irrefutably presumed to be incapable of committing an offence.&lt;ref name = "Blackstones1888"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hooper|2008|p=1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1998, a child aged between 10 and 13 was presumed under [[Conclusive presumption|doli incapax]] to be incapable of committing an offence unless the prosecution were able to prove that the child knew the difference between right and wrong, although a range of mitigating factors particular to childhood are normally taken into account in England and Wales &lt;ref name = "Blackstones1888" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sentencing Guidelines Council, (2009), Overarching Principles – Sentencing Youths; definitive guideline, London: Sentencing Guidelines Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, children aged between 10 and 17 are capable of committing offences and it is not possible for a child to avoid liability by showing that they do not know the difference between right and wrong.&lt;ref name="s34"&gt;[[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], {{UKStatute|1570335|s. 34}}; {{cite BAILII

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a child should not be found guilty if they are [[Fitness to plead|unfit to plead]].

In exceptional circumstances, most notably the case of the murder of [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] in Liverpool in 1993, children can be tried as an adult in an adult court.

From the age of 18 onwards, individuals are then considered an adult in the eyes of the law. Therefore, all punishment given by the courts or other law enforcement agencies will rest solely upon them.

==Criminal procedure before trial==

===Arrest===
After a person aged ten to 17 has been arrested and taken to a police station, [http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-and-publications/publication/operational-policing/PACECodeCH.pdf?version=1 Code C] to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires that the custody officer ascertain the identity of a parent, guardian, Local Authority carer or any other person who has assumed responsibility for the juvenile's welfare and must inform them of the arrest. The custody officer should inform the [[appropriate adult]] (who may or may not be the same person) of the grounds for the detainee's detention and ask the adult to come to the police station to see the detainee. The juvenile should be told of the duties of the appropriate adult and that the juvenile can consult privately with the appropriate adult at any time, but warned that such conversations are not privileged.

The juvenile may not ordinarily be interviewed, be asked to provide or sign a written statement under caution, be asked to sign a record of interview without an appropriate adult being present. A superintendent may authorise an interview without an appropriate adult if:
* he is satisfied the interview would not significantly harm the person's physical or mental state; and
* delay would be likely to either
** lead to interference with, or harm to, evidence connected with an offence,
** lead to interference with, or physical harm to, other people,
** lead to serious loss of, or damage to, property,
** lead to alerting other people suspected of committing an offence but not yet arrested for it, or
** hinder the recovery of property obtained in consequence of the commission of the offence.

During an interview where an appropriate adult is present, an appropriate adult should:
* advise the person being interviewed;
* observe whether the interview is being conducted properly and fairly; and
* facilitate communication with the person being interviewed.

===Prosecution, reprimands and final warnings===
The Crown Prosecution service has produced [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/v_to_z/youth_offenders/index.html detailed guidance] on prosecuting juveniles.

A police officer may proceed by way of reprimand or (final) warning, where the following conditions are satisfied:
* a constable has evidence that a child or young person ( "the offender") has committed an offence;
* the constable considers that the evidence is such that, if the offender were prosecuted for the offence, there would be a realistic prospect of his being convicted;
* the offender admits to the constable that he committed the offence;
* the offender has not previously been convicted of an offence; and
* the constable is satisfied that it would not be in the public interest for the offender to be prosecuted.&lt;ref name="s65"&gt;[[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], {{UKStatute|1570376|s. 65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A police officer can either give the offender a ''reprimand'' or a ''final warning''. A final warning is more serious. Once a person has received one reprimand he cannot receive a second. A person may be given a final warning without a reprimand if the seriousness of the offence warrants this course. A person may exceptionally be given a second (but not a third) final warning if "the offence was committed more than two years after the date of the previous warning and the constable considers the offence to be not so serious as to require a charge to be brought".&lt;ref name="s65" /&gt;

In the case of a juvenile under the age of 17, the reprimand or final warning should be given in the presence of an [[appropriate adult]].&lt;ref name="s65" /&gt; Where a police officer gives a final warning, he should refer the offender to the  local youth offending team who should arrange for him to participate in a rehabilitation programme unless they consider it inappropriate to do so.&lt;ref name="s66"&gt;[[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], {{UKStatute|1570377|s. 66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of reprimand and final warning was replaced in 2013 by youth cautions and youth conditional cautions by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.

===First appearance===
Having been formally accused of committing an offence, a juvenile will make his first appearance in the Youth Court '''unless''':
* the juvenile is jointly charged with an adult;
* the juvenile is charged with aiding and abetting an adult (or vice versa);
* the juvenile is charged with an offence arising from the same circumstances as those in which an adult is accused of committing an offence.

===Bail===
A juvenile has a general right to [[bail]].

As for adults, the main reasons for refusing bail are that the defendant is accused of an imprisonable offence and there are '''substantial grounds for believing that''' the defendant:
#will abscond;
#will commit further offences whilst on bail; or
#will interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice whether in relation to himself or any other person.&lt;ref name="Sch1"&gt;[[Bail Act 1976]], [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1341710 Schedule 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

The court may also refuse bail for the juvenile's own protection or welfare&lt;ref name="Sch1para3"&gt;[[Bail Act 1976]], [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1341710 Schedule 1], para. 3. For adults, the courts have a power to refuse bail for the defendant's own protection, but not for his welfare.&lt;/ref&gt; or for a limited number of other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See [[bail]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A juvenile's parent may be asked to act as a surety for up to £50 for the juvenile's attendance at court and compliance with any conditions attached to bail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bail Act 1976]], {{UKStatute|1341691|s. 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detention in custody===
Where a juvenile is refused bail, he is normally remanded in local authority accommodation. He may be remanded in secure accommodation only if:
* the juvenile is over 10 years old; and
* either
** he is charged with or has been convicted of a violent or sexual offence, or an offence punishable in the case of an adult with imprisonment for a term of fourteen years or more, or
** taken together, the offences of which he has been convicted and with which he has been charged amount to a recent history of repeatedly committing imprisonable offences while remanded on bail or to local authority accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;Children and Young Persons Act 1969, {{UKStatute|390219|s. 23(5)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==

===Place of trial===
A juvenile will ordinarily be tried in the Youth Court. A juvenile may be tried in an adult Magistrates' Court only if he is charged alongside an adult.

A juvenile will be tried in the Crown Court where:

===Trial in the Youth Court===
[[Image:Balham Youth Court.jpg|thumb|Balham Youth Court]]
A Youth Court is a magistrates' court&lt;ref&gt;Children and Young Persons Act 1933, {{UKStatute|1109352|s. 45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Youth Court has jurisdiction to try juveniles where a Magistrates Court does not have a similar power to try adults. The Magistrates and District Judges who sit in the Youth Court will receive specialist training on dealing with young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Her Majesty's Courts Service
  | title = Youth Court
  | url = http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/magistrates/youth.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A youth court is presided over by either a district judge or a bench of two or three lay magistrates, which must (unless there are unforeseen circumstances) include both a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{UKStatute|3373950|The Youth Courts (Constitution of Committees and Right to Preside) Rules 2007}}, rule 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A youth court is not open to the public. The victim(s) of the crime, however, has/have the opportunity to attend the hearings of the court if they want to, but they must make a request to the court if they wish to do so. The needs and wishes of victims will always be considered by the court and, through the youth offending team (YOT), they often have the opportunity to have an input into the sentencing process.
The only other persons who may be present are:
*members and officers of the court;
*parties to the case before the court, their solicitors and counsel, and witnesses and other persons directly concerned in that case (e.g. probation officers and social workers);
*parents or guardians;
* bonâ fide representatives of newspapers or news agencies;
* such other persons as the court may specially authorise to be present.&lt;ref&gt;[[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]], {{UKStatute|1109354|s. 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s34A"&gt;[[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]], {{UKStatute|1109337|s. 34A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following reporting restrictions apply automatically:
*no report shall be published which reveals the name, address or school of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings or includes any particulars likely to lead to the identification of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings;  and
*no picture shall be published in any newspaper as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in the proceedings as aforesaid.&lt;ref name="s49"&gt;[[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]], {{UKStatute|1109356|s. 49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions may be lifted by the court:
* for the purpose of avoiding injustice to the child or young person or
*as respects a child or young person, who is charged with or has been convicted or a violent offence, a sexual offence, or an offence punishable in the case of a person aged 21 or over with imprisonment for fourteen years or more and is unlawfully at large, it is necessary to dispense with those requirements for the purpose of apprehending him and bringing him before a court or returning him to the place in which he was in custody or
* in respect of a child who has been convicted of an offence, in the public interest.&lt;ref name="s49" /&gt;

Where a child is under 16, the court '''must''' (unless it would be unreasonable) require a parent or guardian to attend court and where the child is aged 16 to 18, the court '''may''' do so.&lt;ref name="s34A" /&gt;

===Trial in the Crown Court===
Generally, the same procedures apply in the [[Crown Court]] for juveniles as for adults.&lt;ref name = "Blackstones1919"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hooper|2008|p=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no automatic restriction on reporting proceedings, unlike in the Youth Court, but the court may direct that:
*no newspaper report of the proceedings shall reveal the name, address or school, or include any particulars calculated to lead to the identification, of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings, either as being the person by or against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken, or as being a witness therein; and/or
*no picture shall be published in any newspaper as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in the proceedings as aforesaid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]], {{UKStatute|1109343|s. 39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a child is under 14, the court '''must''' (unless it would be unreasonable) require a parent or guardian to attend court and where the child is aged 14 to 18, the court '''may''' do so.&lt;ref name="s34A"/&gt;

[http://www.justice.gov.uk/criminal/procrules_fin//contents/practice_direction/pd_consolidated.htm Paragraph II.30 of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction] makes provision for the adapting the procedures in the Crown Court where a juvenile is tried, to assist in their taking part in the trial.

A defendant under the age of 18 may give evidence by live link if:
* it would be in the interests of justice to do so
* the defendant's ability to participate effectively as a witness is compromised by his level of intelligence or social functioning and that his ability to participate effectively would be improved by giving evidence via a live link.&lt;ref&gt;Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, s. 33A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court process===

====Youth Court process====
The local authority, if notified of proceedings and unless they consider it unnecessary to do so, should make such investigations and should provide the court with information relating to the home surroundings, school, record, health and character of the defendant and any other matters required by the court.&lt;ref&gt;Children and Young Persons Act 1969, {{UKStatute|1390192|s. 9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Criminal Procedure Rules state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# the relevant minor and his parent or guardian, if present, shall be given an opportunity of making a statement;
# the court shall take into consideration all available information as to the general conduct, home surroundings, school record and medical history of the relevant minor and, in particular, shall take into consideration such information as aforesaid which is provided in pursuance of section 9 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 ( (1));
# if such information as aforesaid is not fully available, the court shall consider the desirability of adjourning the proceedings for such inquiry as may be necessary;
# any written report of a probation officer, local authority, local education authority, educational establishment or registered medical practitioner may be received and considered by the court without being read aloud; and
# if the court considers it necessary in the interests of the relevant minor, it may require him/her or his/her parent or guardian, if present, to withdraw from the court.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Procedure Rules, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/criminal/procrules_fin/contents/rules/part_44.htm Part 44].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Crown Court process====
Except in homicide cases, the Crown Court shall unless satisfied that it would be undesirable to do so, remit the case to the youth court.&lt;ref&gt;Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 1999, {{UKStatute|2138857|s. 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific sentences===

====Sentences of detention====
[[Image:Reading Prison 1.JPG|thumb|Her Majesty's Prison and Young Offenders Institution Reading]]
No custodial sentence may be passed on an offender aged under 21 who is not legally represented at least at some point after he is found guilty and before sentence (unless he was granted a right to representation funded by legal aid but the right was withdrawn because of his conduct; or having been informed of his right to apply for such representation and having had the opportunity to do so, he refused or failed to apply).&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138974|s. 83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offenders aged under 21 cannot be sentenced to prison for any reason, but may be remanded in custody in prison for trial or sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138984|s. 89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant date for determining the court's powers to sentence is the date of the '''conviction'''&lt;ref&gt;''Danga'' [1992] QB 476.&lt;/ref&gt; but the court should take as the starting point the sentence that the defendant would have been likely to receive if he had been sentenced at the date of the commission of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII

|  {{UKStatute|2139000|s. 100}}. The Secretary of State may appoint a date at which the orders may be applied to offenders under 12. A court may sentence a person under 15 with a detention and training order only if it is of the opinion he is a persistent offender.&lt;ref name="s100"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2139000|s. 100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In respect of other summary-only offences, the term of an order may be 4 or 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2139001|s. 101}}. An exception is absconding under the Bail Act for which terms of 6, 8, 10 and 12 months may be passed: {{Harvnb|Hooper|2008|p=2133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In respect of indictable offences, the term of such an order may be 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months.&lt;ref name="s101"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2139001|s. 101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, the term must not exceed the maximum time that an adult could be imprisoned for the same offence.&lt;ref name="s101" /&gt; The court may not order terms between those set out in the statute (e.g. 20 months)&lt;ref&gt;''Pitt'' [2002] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and the court must pass the shorter available term if it would otherwise be minded to pass an intermediate term. Consecutive terms lawfully passed may add-up to an intermediate term.&lt;ref&gt;''Norris'' [2001] 1 Cr App R (S) 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily a detainee will be released after having served half of his term&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2139002|s. 102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and supervised for the remainder of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|213903|s. 103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If an order breaches a requirement of supervision, he may be returned to the detention for the remainder of his term (or three months if shorter) or fined up to £1000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|213904|s. 104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a person commits another offence during supervision, he may be returned to the detention for the remainder of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|213905|s. 105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Detention under Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, s. 91'''. Where a person aged under 18 is convicted in the Crown Court of one of a limited number of serious offences, and the court is of the opinion that none of the other methods in which the case may legally be dealt with is suitable, the court may sentence the offender to be detained for such period, not exceeding the maximum term of imprisonment with which the offence is punishable in the case of a person aged 21 or over (including life). The offences are:
* sexual assault;
* child sex offences committed by children;
* sexual activity with a child family member;
* inciting a child family member to engage in sexual activity;
* prohibited firearms offences (if the offender was over 16 at the time he committed the offence).&lt;ref name="s91" /&gt;
| '''Young offenders institutions.''' A person aged 18–21 may be sentenced to detention in a [[Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution|young offender institution]], for a term of between 21 days and the maximum prison term applicable to an adult convicted of the same offence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138993|s. 96-98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal practice to sentence young offenders for shorter terms than adults.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General's Reference (no. 42 of 1996)'' [1997] 1 Cr App R (S) 388; ''Howells'' [1999] 1 WLR 307.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Crown Court sentences of between 14 days and 12 months in the Magistrates' Court sentences of between 14 days and 6 months may be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], s. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Custody for life.''' Exceptionally, a person aged 18–21 may be sentenced by the Crown Court to custody for life where a person aged 21 or over would be liable to imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138989|s. 93-95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community sentences====

&lt;span style="color:#CC2200;"&gt;'''Please Note That This Section is Obsolete'''&lt;/span&gt;

If a court considers the offences serious enough to warrant a community sentence, and that a community sentence or combination thereof would be most suitable to the offender and commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, it may pass a community sentence&lt;ref name="s35"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138894|s. 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the following table:

Where a court should normally obtain a pre-sentence report, it may dispense with this requirement if it considers it unnecessary to do so. In respect of offenders under 18, it may only dispense with the report if a current offence is triable on indictment or the court has had reference to the most recent previous pre-sentence report for the offender.&lt;ref name="s36" /&gt;

====Referral orders====
Under certain circumstances, a Youth Court (or other Magistrates Court) must or may make a referral to a local youth offender panel. The panel should seek to agree a "contract", a programme of behaviour, with the young offender.&lt;ref name="s23-27"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138877|ss. 23-27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a contract cannot be agreed, the young offender panel refers the offender back to the court.&lt;ref name="s23-27" /&gt; The length of the programme is determined by the court when making the reference and must be between three months and one year.&lt;ref name="s18"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138871|s. 18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{UKStatute|2138878|Section 23}} of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]] makes the following provision about the contents of the contract:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(2)  The terms of the programme may, in particular, include provision for any of the following—
:(a) the offender to make financial or other reparation to any person who appears to the panel to be a victim of, or otherwise affected by, the offence, or any of the offences, for which the offender was referred to the panel;
:(b) the offender to attend mediation sessions with any such victim or other person;
:(c) the offender to carry out unpaid work or service in or for the community;
:(d) the offender to be at home at times specified in or determined under the programme;
:(e) attendance by the offender at a school or other educational establishment or at a place of work;
:(f) the offender to participate in specified activities (such as those designed to address offending behaviour, those offering education or training or those assisting with the rehabilitation of persons dependent on, or having a propensity to misuse, alcohol or drugs);
:(g) the offender to present himself to specified persons at times and places specified in or determined under the programme;
:(h) the offender to stay away from specified places or persons (or both);
:(i) enabling the offender's compliance with the programme to be supervised and recorded.

(3) The programme may not, however, provide—
(a) for the electronic monitoring of the offender's whereabouts; or
(b) for the offender to have imposed on him any physical restriction on his movements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Referral orders will be considered only if:
*the offender is before a Youth Court or other Magistrates' Court;
*the offender is under 18;
*the offence was not murder;
*the court is not proposing to pass a sentence absolutely discharging the offender;
*referral orders are available in the area;
*the offender has never previously been convicted in the UK; and
*the offender has never been bound over to keep the peace in England and Wales or Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="s16"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138869|s. 16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s17"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138870|s. 17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the above conditions are satisfied and the offender has pleaded guilty to all of the offences before the court and one of them is punishable by imprisonment, the court '''must''' make a referral order.&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt; If otherwise the above conditions are satisfied and the offender has pleaded guilty to at least one offence before the court and not-guilty to another (regardless of whether they are imprisonable), the court '''may''' make a referral order.&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt;

If a court has made a referral order, it may not at the same time:
*impose a community sentence on the offender;
*order him to pay a fine;
*make a reparation order in respect of him;
*discharge him conditionally;
*bind him over to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour;
*bind over a parent or guardian; or
*make a parenting order.&lt;ref name="s19"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138872|s. 19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reparation orders====
Other than in respect of a conviction for murder, and having received a report indicating the type of work suitable and the attitude of the victim(s), the offender may be ordered by the court to make reparation by making reparation to certain persons or to the community at large, so long as this does not involve more than 24 hours work.&lt;ref name="s73-75"&gt;[[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], {{UKStatute|2138953|s. 73-75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A reparation order may not be made where a community sentence or custodial sentence is passed.

The '''Zhou Yongjun incident''' was a political controversy which involved the rendition of Zhou Yongjun (周勇军), a former student activist during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], by the Hong Kong authorities to the People's Republic of China. Zhou attempted to enter Hong Kong from the United States ''via'' Macau using a forged Malaysian passport. Zhou's supporters alleged the renditioning to be illegal, and his lawyer, Democratic Party chairman [[Albert Ho]], described Zhou's case as "posing the biggest challenge to the [[one country, two systems]] principle laid down in the Basic Law." The Government of Hong Kong refused to comment on individual cases, and the People's Republic of China said Zhou was detained on several charges, including one of financial fraud.

== Background on Zhou ==

Zhou was arrested and held for two years in prison for his role in the protests. He subsequently lost his enrolment status as a student as well as his [[hukou system|family registration]] as a Beijing resident. In 1992, Zhou fled to Hong Kong and then travelled to the United States,&lt;ref name=RFA20091012/&gt; where he was granted resident's status.&lt;ref name=RFA20090904&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/trial-09042009111529.html?searchterm=None |title=Student Leader in Fraud Trial |work=[[Radio Free Asia]] |date=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first attempt to re-enter China was in 1998, but he was caught and sentenced to three years of administrative detention in a [[laogai|re-education-through-labour]] camp. After his release, he again left in 2002 for the United States,&lt;ref name=Asianewa20091013/&gt;

== The incident ==

=== Illegal entry into Hong Kong ===
Zhou made a second attempt to reenter mainland China on 28 September 2008, but he was intercepted by immigration department officials at the Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal, on suspicion of entering Hong Kong using a counterfeited travel document. He had travelled from the United States to Macao, using a Malaysian passport purchased from a travel agent in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=scmp20091013&gt;{{cite news |title=Inquiry urged into HK's role in dissident's arrest |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |first= Eva |last=Wu |date= 13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passport was in the name of Wang Xingxiang,&lt;ref name=scmp20091018/&gt; a known alias of [[Zhong Gong]] leader [[Zhang Hongbao]].&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/sgxx/sggg/sgxw/t34848.htm |title=Zhang Hongbao Is a Criminal Suspect in China |author=Beijing Public Security Bureau
|date=25 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had repeatedly been denied requests for an official permit to return to China by the Chinese authorities.&lt;ref name=RFA20090921/&gt; Zhou was on his way to Sichuan to visit his ailing father. Zhou was documented in Sichuan saying he was detained on arrival in Hong Kong and then secretly handed over to Shenzhen authorities two days later. Lawyer Li Jinjin said Zhou was initially held at the No.1 Detention Center in the southern city of Shenzhen, and later transferred to the Shenzhen Yantian Detention Center.&lt;ref name=RFA20090921/&gt; In May 2009, seven months after his arrest, Zhou's family was notified that he had been detained by Sichuan authorities on fraud charges.&lt;ref name=scmp20091013/&gt; The indictment by prosecutors in Shehong county stated Zhou used the alias of Wang Xingxiang, and attempted to transfer money from an account at Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong to two banks, in the city and in Australia.&lt;ref name=scmp20091018&gt;{{cite news |title=How HK handed over a dissident |work=South China Morning Post |first=Fox Yi |last=Hu |date= 18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lawyer, pan-democrat legislator Albert Ho, held a press conference on 12 October 2009 during which he said his client was picked up by immigration officers, put into a van and driven across the border to mainland China against his will.&lt;ref name=monsters20091013/&gt; Ho said that normal protocol would be to send him back to his place of origin, which in this case would be Macau or the United States. Furthermore, Ho noted that there was no agreement with the mainland on extradition, and demanded that the Hong Kong government explain why Zhou was handed over to Shenzhen authorities;&lt;ref name=scmp20091013/&gt; he appealed to [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] Donald Tsang to make available police records of the incident and to press for Zhou's release.&lt;ref name=monsters20091013/&gt; The Hong Kong Government, speaking only in general terms, said in an official statement that "a passenger whose travel document does not meet the entry requirements will be repatriated to his or her place of embarkation or origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.info.gov.hk:80/gia/general/200910/12/P200910120217.htm |title=Government statement on Mr Zhou Yongjun's case |date=12 October 2009 |publisher=Government of Hong Kong |quote=In response to media enquiries on the case concerning Mr Zhou Yongjun, a government spokesman said today (October&amp;nbsp;12): "We do not comment on individual cases. The Immigration Department has the responsibility to uphold effective immigration control. The department handles all entry applications in accordance with the law and immigration policy, having due regard to individual circumstances. In general, a passenger whose travel document does not meet the entry requirements will be repatriated to his or her place of embarkation or origin." |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015064502/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200910/12/P200910120217.htm |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The trial ===
Zhou was tried in Shehong, and was sentenced to nine years in jail for a fraud attempted in Hong Kong. ''The Times'' remarked that "details of the charges against Zhou are vague, as is common in China’s opaque legal system." Wang Xingxiang, the name in Zhou's bogus passport, was placed on a money laundering watch list following a complaint by the Hang Seng Bank received a suspicious request to transfer HK$6&amp;nbsp;million out of an account registered in that name. The transfer was not completed as the signature on the transfer form did not match that of the account signatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6994862.ece |title=Chinese democracy leader Zhou Yongjun jailed for fraud |first=Jane |last=Macartney |work=The Times |date=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Zhou was sentenced, Secretary for Security, Ambrose Lee, rejected accusations the government knowingly turned Zhou over to the mainland authorities. On the other hand, he also denied there had been any serious errors in the Hong Kong Government's handling of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Fanny &amp; Tsang, Phyllis (4 Feb 2010), Minister denies HK knowingly handed over dissident, ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The SCMP article on this goes on to state that "However, a person with direct knowledge of the case said immigration officers did not know Zhou's real identity when they repatriated him and that Zhou did not state that he had residency in another country when officers told him that he would be sent to the mainland."

An editorial in the ''South China Morning Post'' on 6 February 2010 said the Chinese government action appeared to be [[extra-territorial]]. it criticised the Hong Kong government for hiding behind bland statements, and urged it to defend the principle of '[[One country, two systems]]'&lt;ref&gt;Editorial (6 February), "A stain on 'two systems' that won't go away ", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;
