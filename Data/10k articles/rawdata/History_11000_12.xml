      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5670">The '''1981 Defence White Paper''' (titled "The UK Defence Programme: The Way Forward" [[Command paper|Cmnd]] 8288) was a major review of the [[United Kingdom]]'s defence policy brought about by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The main author was the then [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[John Nott]]. The aim of the review was to reduce expenditure during the [[early 1980s recession]] and to focus on supporting [[NATO]] rather than out of area operations. It was ultimately judged however to have been extremely detrimental to the Defence of the Realm, being among other things widely considered to have been one of the contributing factors that led to the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]]. 

==British Army==

The regular army was to be reduced to 135,000 men, a loss of 7,000, which was to be partly offset by the gradual expansion of the Territorial Army by a figure of 16,000. In Germany, Britain's NATO land commitment was to be reduced by about 2,000, giving a total of 55,000. This was to be achieved by the withdrawal of a divisional headquarters.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;''The Times'' (60964), p. 1: "Nott axes warships, 19,500 men and Chatham dockyard". 26 June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nott's statement, it was announced that four armoured regiments would be equipped with the [[Challenger tank]], while there would be an increase in the order of the [[MILAN]] [[anti-tank missile]].&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

==Royal Navy==
This review proposed extensive cuts to the [[Royal Navy]], including the sale of the new aircraft carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05|2}} to Australia. Under the review, the Royal Navy was focused primarily on [[anti-submarine warfare]] under the auspices of NATO. Any out-of-area amphibious operations were considered unlikely. The entire [[Royal Marine]] amphibious force was in jeopardy of being disbanded and the sale of {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|2}} and {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} was mooted.&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins: The Battle for the Falklands, chapter 5: "Task Force": "In the previous decade, the very existence of the marines had come into question." and "both the assault ships ''Fearless'' and ''Intrepid'' were at that time threatened with sale to foreign powers"&lt;/ref&gt;
Although an additional [[Type 22 frigate]] was confirmed ordered, Nott stated that nine of the navy's 59 escorts would be decommissioned, mainly from the County, Leander, and Rothesay classes. This decision was attributed to the growing cost of refitting and maintaining older warships. Alongside the proposed hull cuts, Nott revealed that the navy would incur a manpower reduction of between 8,000 and 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;
 
Nott announced an order for five nuclear-powered attack submarines, increasing the total to 17. The Royal Navy's building programme of 20 warships was to be unaffected by the cuts, as would the navy's acquisition of the [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] submarine-launched ballistic missile.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

The ice patrol ship [[HMS Endurance (1967)|''Endurance'']] was also due to be withdrawn from the South Atlantic. This was interpreted as a sign of weakness by the Argentine Government, encouraging the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]]. [[Chatham Dockyard]] was also to be closed as an operational base. Feasibility studies for the [[Type 43 destroyer|Type 43]] and [[Type 44 destroyer|Type 44]] destroyers were also cancelled, together with the [[Sea Dart (missile)|Sea Dart MkII]] surface-to-air missile.

==Royal Air Force==
Manpower losses for the Royal Air Force would amount to 2,500, but the white paper committed to retaining all of the RAF's projects, and confirmed the procurement of the [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier]] in collaboration with the United States. Two [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in UK service|F-4 Phantom]] squadrons were to be retained rather than being phased out with the introduction of the [[Panavia Tornado ADV]], while the number of refitted [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod Mk II]] maritime patrol aircraft would be increased by three to 34.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Reflecting the white paper's emphasis on air defence, the number of [[BAE Systems Hawk|Hawk]] trainers equipped with the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] air-to-air missile would be doubled to 72 with the intention of augmenting the Royal Air Force's front-line fighter squadrons.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

==Controversy==
In a 1982 live interview about the White Paper for the [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] television programme ''[[Newsnight]]'', during the interview by broadcaster [[Robin Day]], taking umbrage at a perceived insult when Day made the comment on the lines that the public might question the judgement of a "here-today, gone-tomorrow politician" on the best long term defence interests of the country, Nott stood up, took off his microphone, and walked out on the interview.

[[Image:THES-Agora East stoa.jpg|thumb|[[Stoa]] of the ancient ''agora'' of [[Thessaloniki]]]]
[[Image:TyreAlMinaAgora.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Agora of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]]]
The '''agora''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|g|ə|r|ə}}; {{lang-grc|ἀγορά}} ''agorá'') was a central [[public space ]] in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states. The literal meaning of the word is "gathering place" or "assembly". The agora was the center of the athletic, artistic, spiritual and political life of the city.&lt;ref name=InternationalDictionary&gt;{{cite book |title = International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe | last1=Ring |last2=Salkin |last3=Boda | first=Trudy |first2=Robert |first3=Sharon | publisher = Routledge|date = January 1, 1996 | pages = 66 | isbn=978-1-884964-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Agora of Athens]] was the best-known example.

==Origins==

Early in Greek history (18th century–8th century BC), free-born citizens would gather in the agora for military duty or to hear statements of the ruling king or council. Later, the Agora also served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods amid [[colonnade]]s.  This attracted [[artisan]]s who built workshops nearby.&lt;ref name="liag"&gt;{{cite book |title=Life in Ancient Greece |last=Peppas  |first=Lynn |year=2005 |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |isbn=0778720357 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WzwDfP5mIWYC |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this twin function of the agora as a political and commercial space came the two Greek verbs {{lang|grc|ἀγοράζω}}, ''agorázō'', "I shop", and {{lang|grc|ἀγορεύω}}, ''agoreúō'', "I speak in public". 

The term [[agoraphobia]] denotes a phobic condition in which the sufferer becomes anxious in environments that are unfamiliar—for instance, places where he or she perceives that they have little control. Such anxiety may be triggered by wide open spaces, by crowds, or by some public situations, and the psychological term derives from the agora as a large and open gathering place.

{{For|the Moroccan politician|Ahmed Osman (politician)}}
'''Ahmed Osman''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد عثمان}}) (born 1934) is an [[Egypt]]ian-born author.  He has put forward a number of theories, some [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] in nature, about [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[origins of Judaism]] and [[origins of Christianity|Christianity]].

==Hypotheses==
His first hypothesis was that [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] was the [[father-in-law]] of [[Amenhotep III]], Yuya. In 1987 this claim provided the basis for his first book, ''Stranger in the Valley of the Kings''.

Osman identified the [[Semitic people|Semitic]]-born Egyptian official Joseph with the Egyptian official [[Yuya]], and asserted the identification of Hebrew liberator [[Moses]] with the Egyptian pharaoh [[Akhenaten]].

Ahmed Osman has also claimed that Moses and Akhenaten were the same person, supporting his belief by interpreting aspects of biblical and Egyptian history. He alleges that [[Atenism]] can be considered [[monotheism|monotheistic]] and related to [[Judaism]], and includes other similarities, including a ban on idol worship and the similarity of the name Aten to the Hebrew Adon, or "Lord". This would mesh with Osman's other claim that Akhenaten's maternal grandfather Yuya was the same person as the Biblical Joseph.

A number of Osman's positions are in conflict with mainstream [[Egyptology]], including [[conventional Egyptian chronology]]. 
Some Egyptologists have gone as far as rejecting them as unacademic conjecture while others do not consider them worth refuting.&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325163855/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/672/profile.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly {{!}} Profile {{!}} Ahmed Osman: Beyond belief|date=2015-03-25|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20050408-051324-4388r&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2017}} [[Donald B. Redford]] wrote a scathing review of ''Stranger in the Valley of the Kings'' for ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' in which he wrote "The author treats the evidence as cavalierly as he pleases. He presents himself as a sober historian, yet when it suits him, the Biblical evidence is accepted at face value and literally... When the Biblical evidence does not suit Osman, it is discarded."&lt;ref&gt;Redford, Donald B. Review of ''Stranger in the Valley of the Kings'' by Ahmed Osman. BAR 15/2 p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  

In his ''Christianity: An Ancient Egyptian Religion'' (2005), Osman claims that Christianity did not originate in [[Judea]] but is the remnant of an Ancient Egyptian [[mystery cult]] that was suppressed and transformed by the [[Roman Egypt|Roman authorities]].

He also argues that [[Jesus]] was not Jewish but was actually the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] and that there was no [[Joshua]], just a confusion between the names Jesus and Joshua: "Up to the 16th century, when the Old Testament books were translated from the Mesoretic Hebrew text into modern European languages, Jesus was the name of the prophet who succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelites in Egypt. Since the 16th century we started to have two names, Jesus and Joshua, which confused people into the belief that they were two different characters".&lt;ref Name=Ahram/&gt;

Osman states that the reason mainstream Egyptologists do not accept his ideas is because "Egyptologists have established their careers on their interpretations" and that to accept other theories could give them less authority.&lt;ref Name=Ahram/&gt;

'''Antonio Abraham Zinny''' (October 1821 – September 1890) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] lawyer, journalist and historian originally from Gibraltar.
He was especially prominent as a popular historian of Argentina in the first half of the twentieth century and of the Governors of Argentine Provinces, 
the first serious attempt to chronicle the history of the provinces of Argentina.

==Biography==
[[File:Recoleta 134.jpg|thumb|240px|Tomb of the author in the cemetery of La Recoleta]]

Antonio Abraham Zinny was born in [[Gibraltar]] in October 1821.
He studied law in [[Spain]] and in 1842 moved to [[Buenos Aires]], where he completed his studies and received his doctorate in jurisprudence at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. 
For a while he taught at the university.
He moved to the city of [[Corrientes]], where he founded the Argentine College. He also worked as a correspondent for the daily papers ''La Tribuna'', ''La Nacion'' and ''El Nacional''. 
Curiously, these dailies had opposite political positions.

On returning the Buenos Aires, Zinny organized the External Relations archives, and then the archives of the City of Buenos Aires.
That work got him involved in history. 
During Governor [[Adolfo Alsina]]'s term of office, he was inspector general of schools in Buenos Aires province, fulfilling the duties of a minister of education. 
He co-founded the Colegio de Mayo in Buenos Aires with [[Luis José de la Peña]], [[Dardo Rocha]] and [[Eduardo Wilde]].

Antonio Abraham Zinny died in Buenos Aires in September 1890 .

==Historical works==

Antonio Abraham Zinny was noted for writing several history books, of which the best known is ''"History of the Governors of the Argentine Provinces"''. 
In this he was the first to cover the history of all the provinces, from the conquest until about 1880, singly and in one work. 
For almost all the provinces, Zinny's work provided the first history of the province.
His view was liberal, and fanatically [[Unitarian Party|Unitarian]]. 
To defend that position in an era marked by the 1853 Constitution of Argentina, inspired by [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalist]] principles,
he branded all leaders of the Federal party as "pseudo-federalist", without distinguishing between different aspects of Rio Plata federalism.

Another of Zinny's key works was ''"Efemeridología argirometropolitana hasta la caída del gobierno de Rosas"'', 
which gathered much information as possible about all the newspapers published in all provinces since the time of the viceroys until the fall of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. 
It was not a trivial task, as almost a hundred newspapers and similar works were published each year in some periods, 
especially in the era of [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] and the government of [[Juan Ramón Balcarce]]. 
In later work he followed the same procedure for journalism in the [[Banda Oriental]] and [[Uruguay]].

Zinny wrote biographical studies, singly or in individual volumes, which are now assembled in one volume with the name of ''"Estudios biográficos"''. 
Two of his other works were the ''"History of the United Provinces of the River Plate from 1816 to 1818"'' and ''"La Gaceta Mercantil de Buenos Aires. 1823–1852"''.

At various times, various parts of the region were governed by the [[Persian people|Persians]] (the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] from 550 to 330 BC, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] from 275 to 650 AD and the [[Indo-Sassanids|Indo-Sasanians]] from 345 to 450 AD), the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] (the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] from 330 to 250 BC, the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]] from 250 to 110 BC and the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greeks]] from 155 to 90 BC), [[Iranian peoples]] from [[Persia]] and Central Asia (the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] from 160 BC to 225 AD, the [[Indo-Scythians]] from 90 BC to 20 AD, the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom|Indo-Parthians]] from 20 to 225 AD and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] from 110 BC to 225 AD), the [[Xionites]] (the [[Kidarites]] from 360 to 465 AD and the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]] from 450 to 565 AD) and [[Ancient India|Indian empires]] (the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryans]] from 275 to 185 BC).

== Etymology==
The [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''Arianē'' (Latin: ''[[Wikt:Ariana|Ariana]]''),  a term found in Iranian [[Avestan]] ''Airiiana-'' (especially in [[Airyanem Vaejah]], the name of the [[Iranian peoples]]' mother country).&lt;ref name="Schmitt1986"/&gt; The modern name ''[[Iran]]'' represents a different form of the ancient name ''Ariana'' which derived from Airyanem Vaejah and implies that Iran is “the” Ariana itself – a word found in  [[Old Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-ii-pre-islamic-period |title=Iranian identity ii. Pre-Islamic Period |first=G. |last=Gnoli |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica |year=2006 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a view supported by the traditions of the country preserved in the Muslim writers of the ninth and tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period |last=Ashraf |first=A. |title=Iranian identity iii. Medieval Islamic Period |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica |year=2006 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also referred to Haroyum/Haraiva ([[Herat]]) as 'Aria', which is one of the many provinces found in Ariana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ed Eduljee |url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aria/index.htm |title=Haroyu, Aria / Airan, Herat &amp; Zoroastrianism |website=Heritageinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ed Eduljee |url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm |title=Aryan Homeland, Airyana Vaeja, Location.

Aryan lands and Zoroastrianism |website=Heritageinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names ''Ariana'' and ''Aria'', and many other ancient titles of which ''Aria'' is a component element, are connected with the Avestan term ''Airya-'', and the [[Old Persian]] term ''Ariya-'', a self designation of the peoples of [[History of India|Ancient India]] and [[History of Iran|Ancient Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/aryans |first=R. |last=Schmitt  |title=Aryans |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica |year=1987 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "noble", "excellent" and "honourable".&lt;ref name="W. Smith, 1870, 'Ariana'"/&gt;

== Extent of Ariana ==
The exact limits of Ariana are laid down with little accuracy in classical sources. It seems to have been often confused (as in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', book vi, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D23#note-link15 chapter 23]) with the small province of [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]].&lt;ref name="W. Smith, 1870, 'Ariana'"/&gt;

As a geographical term, Ariana was introduced by the [[Greeks|Greek]] geographer, [[Eratosthenes]] (c. 276 BC – c. 195 BC), and was fully described by the Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (64/63 BC – ca. AD 24).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 2.1.22f&lt;/ref&gt;

Per Eratosthenes' definition, the borders of Ariana were defined by the [[Indus River]] in the east, the sea in the south, a line from [[Carmania (satrapy)|Carmania]] to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] Gates in the west, and the so-called [[Taurus Mountains]] in the north. This large region included almost all of the countries east of [[Medes|Media]] and ancient [[Persia]], including south of the great mountain ranges up to the deserts of [[Gedrosia]] and Carmania,&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 2.5.32&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the provinces of Carmania, Gedrosia, [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], the [[Paropamisadae]]; also [[Bactria]] was reckoned to Ariana and was called "the ornament of Ariana as a whole" by [[Apollodorus of Artemita]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 11.11.1&lt;/ref&gt;

After having described the boundaries of Ariana, [[Strabo]] writes that the name Αρειανή could also be extended to part of the [[Persian people|Persians]] and the [[Medes]] and also to the northwards [[Bactrians]] and the [[Sogdians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The "Aryan" Language |first=Gherardo |last=Gnoli |publisher=Instituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente |location=Roma |year=2002 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed description of that region is to be found in Strabo's ''[[Geographica]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15B*.html Book XV – "Persia, Ariana, the Indian subcontinent", chapter 2, sections 1–9].

By [[Herodotus]] Ariana is not mentioned, nor is it included in the geographical description of [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] and [[Ptolemy]], or in the narrative of [[Arrian]].&lt;ref name="W. Smith, 1870, 'Ariana'"/&gt;

Pliny ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D23#note-link15 vi. 23]) says that some add to [[India]] four satrapies to the west of the river, – the Gedrosii, Arachosii, Arii, and Paropamisadae, as far as the river Cophes (the [[Kabul River|river Kabul]]). Pliny therefore agrees on the whole with Strabo. [[Dionysius Periegetes]] (1097) agrees with Strabo in extending the northern boundary of the Ariani to the [[Paropamisus]], and (714) speaks of them as inhabiting the shores of the [[Erythraean Sea]]. It is probable, from Strabo ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15B*.html xv. p.724]), that the term was extended to include the east Persians, Bactrians, and Sogdians, with the people of Ariana below the mountains, because they were for the most part of one speech.&lt;ref name="W. Smith, 1870, 'Ariana'"/&gt;

Rüdiger Schmitt, the [[Germans|German]] scholar of Iranian Studies, also believes that Ariana should have included other [[Iranian people]]. He writes in the ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'':
{{quote|''Eratosthenes’ use of this term (followed by [[Diodorus]] 2.37.6) is obviously due to a mistake, since, firstly, not all inhabitants of these lands belonged to the same tribe and, secondly, the term "[[Aryan]]" originally was an ethnical one and only later a political one as the name of the [[Persian Empire|Iranian empire]] (for all North Indians and Iranians designated themselves as "Aryan"; See [[Aryan]]), thus comprising still other Iranian tribes outside of Ariana proper, like Medes, Persians or Sogdians (so possibly in Diodorus 1.94.2, where [[Zarathushtra]] is said to have preached [[Ahura Mazda|Ahura Mazdā]]'s laws "among the Arianoi").''&lt;ref name="Schmitt1986"/&gt;|R. Schmitt|1986}}

==Change of era==
* '''February 11, 1804''' ({{nihongo|''Bunka gannen''|文化元年}}):  The new era name of ''Bunka'' ( meaning "Culture" or "Civilization") was created to mark the start of a new 60-year cycle of the [[Heavenly Stem]] and [[Earthly Branch]] system of the [[Chinese calendar]] which was on New Year's Day, the [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/aa_moonphases.pl?year=1804&amp;ZZZ=END new moon day] of 2 November 1804. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''[[Kyōwa]]'' 4.

{{Chinese name|[[Qian (surname)|Ch'ien (錢)]]}}

'''Ch'ien Mu''' ({{zh|t=錢穆|p='''Qián Mù'''}}; 30 July 1895 – 30 August 1990) was a Chinese historian, educator, philosopher and [[Confucian]]. He is considered to be one of the greatest historians and philosophers of 20th-century China. Ch'ien Mu ,together with [[Lü Simian]],  [[Chen Yinke]] and [[Chen Yuan (historian)|Chen Yuan]], was known as the "Four Greatest Historians" of Modern China.

==Life in China==
Ch'ien Mu was a descendant of the prestigious Ch'en family in Wuxi. His ancestor was said to be [[Qian Liu|Ch'ien Liu]] (852-932 AD), who was the founder of the Wu Yue State (907-978 AD) during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907-979 AD). He was born in Qifang Qiao Village (七房橋; "Seven Mansions Bridge Village"), in [[Wuxi|Wusih]], [[Jiangsu Province|Kiangsu]] (now Wuxi, Jiangsu) Province. His biographer Jerry Dennerlien described his childhood world as the "small peasant cosmos" of rituals, festivals, and beliefs held the family system together. He received little formal modern education, but gained his knowledge on Chinese history and culture through traditional family school education and continuous self-study.&lt;ref&gt;Pt I, Jerry Dennerline ''Qian Mu and the World of Seven Mansions'' (New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his teaching career as a primary school teacher in his hometown when he was eighteen.

Recommended and invited by another famous historian [[Gu Jiegang]] Ch'ien Mu was hired as a lecturer in [[Yenching University]] in 1930. He began his teaching career at several other universities like [[Tsinghua University]] and [[Peking University]] until 1937, when Peking was occupied by the Japanese army.

==Life in Hong Kong==
Amidst communist victory in the civil war, Ch'ien arrived in [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] at [[Chang Chi-yun]]'s suggestion in 1949. With help from the [[Yale-China Association]], along with [[Tang Chun-i]], Tchang Pi-kai and other scholars, he cofounded [[New Asia College]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.na.cuhk.edu.hk/en-us/aboutnewasia/history.aspx |title=About New Asia: History |publisher=Chinese University of Hong Kong |accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as the president of New Asia College from 1949 until 1965. This college has graduated many great scholars and outstanding members of various communities. He later received honorary doctorates from both [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="critical"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chineseupress.com/asp/c_Book_card.asp?BookID=927&amp;Lang=C|title=Traditional Government in Imperial China: A Critical Analysis|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507175459/http://www.chineseupress.com/asp/c_Book_card.asp?BookID=927&amp;Lang=C|archivedate=2009-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Malaya]] before returning to Hong Kong.

==Life in Taiwan==
[[File:Chien Mu's House outside 20130928.jpg|thumb|[[Chien Mu House]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan.]]
Ch'ien relocated to [[Taiwan]] in October 1967 after accepting an invitation from the President [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in response to the [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]].  In 1968, he was selected as a member of the [[Academia Sinica]], which remedied a little his lifelong regret for not being able to be elected as a member of this Institute in the first election in 1948.

He was given land in Waishuangxi in the [[Shilin District]] to build his home [[Chien Mu House|Sushulou]] (素書樓) while continuing as a freelance academic researching and giving lectures at universities in Taiwan.

Ch'ien retired from teaching in 1984. After becoming one of the three constituent colleges of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], in 1978 New Asia College inaugurated the Ch'ien Mu Lectures in his honor. &lt;ref&gt;[http://history.na.cuhk.edu.hk/en-us/%E7%B7%9A%E4%B8%8A%E8%A7%80%E8%B3%9E/%E7%99%BC%E5%B1%95%E4%BA%8B%E7%95%A5.aspx?udt_2179_param_detail=331 發展事略：錢穆先生任「錢賓四先生學術文化講座」首屆講者]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 1990 two [[Democratic Progressive Party]] politicians, [[Chen Shui-bian]] and [[Chou Po-lun]], accused Ch'ien of occupying public land as the nature of gifting the land for Sushulou by Chiang Kai-shek to a private citizen was deemed to be illegal. Ch'ien and his wife moved out of Sushulou and relocated to a high-rise apartment in downtown Taipei City.

Ch'ien died on August 30, 1990, a little less than three months after being forced to move out of Sushulou.  Many of Ch'ien's supporters condemned the practice Chen and Chou of using Ch'ien for scoring political points against the [[Kuomintang]].  Both Chen and Chou have since apologized for the damages of their accusations towards Ch'ien, and Sushulou is now the location of the [[Chien Mu House|Ch'ien Mu Memorial]].

==Works==
Ch'ien wrote extensively on Chinese classics, history and Confucian thought. Unlike many 20th-century Chinese intellectuals influenced by the [[New Culture Movement]] of the 1910s who were fundamentally skeptical of traditional Chinese thought and Confucianism, he insisted on the importance of traditional values of Chinese culture. By the time of his death in 1990, his objections to the rejection of tradition of Confucianism had gained wider credence, partly through the influence of his student at New Asia College, [[Yu Ying-shih]].&lt;ref&gt;Hung-yuk Ip, Tze-ki  Hon, Chiu-chun Lee, "The Plurality of Chinese Modernity: A Review of Recent Scholarship on the May Fourth Movement," ''Modern China'' 29.4  (2003):  490-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ch'ien Mu was an extremely industrious and prolific scholar who had about 76 works published during his life, which exceeded 17 000 000 words in total. After his death, his complete works were collected and edited into 54 volumes, published in 1994 by Linking Publishing Company in Taipei. In 2011, a revised edition of his complete works was published in Beijing by Jiuzhou Publishing Company in traditional Chinese characters.

Representative works:
# ''A General History of China'' (''Guoshi dagang'' 國史大綱'');''
# ''Comments on the chin wen''/''ku wen'' (''New Text/Old Text) Controversy in Han'' (''Lianghan jingxue jin gu wen ping''yi 兩漢經學今古文評議)
# ''A New Biography of Zhu Xi's Academic Life'' (''Zhuzi xin xue'an'' 朱子新學案)
# ''A Scholastic History of China in Late 300 Years'' (''Zhongguo jin sanbai nian xueshu shi'' 中國近三百年學術史)
# ''History of the Qin and Han Dynasty'' (''Qin Han shi'' 秦漢史)
# ''Neo-Confucianism during Song and Ming Dynasty'' (''Song Ming Lixue'' 宋明理學)
# ''Examining Chinese People and Culture Through Chinese History'' (''Cong Zhongguo lishi lai kan Zhongguo minzu xing ji Zhongguo wenhua'' 從中國歷史來看中國民族性及中國文化)

==Criticism==
Critics of Ch'ien's ideas, such as [[Li Ao]], tend to focus on his superficial knowledge of non-Chinese currents of thoughts when he wrote his treatises on [[cultural studies]], and his lack of objective, [[scientific method]]-based, defense of traditional Chinese culture. {{ill|Wong Young-tsu|zh|汪榮祖}} condemns Ch'ien's own bias as "19th century traditionalist" in his "A Comment on Ch'ien Mu's Treatise on Chinese Scholarships During the Qing Dynasty" (錢穆論清學史述評) for being unable to view 19th century currents of thoughts with contemporary (20th century) perspectives.  It could be argued, however, the opposition is based upon the critics' support of the New Culture Movement's legacies, which Ch'ien explicitly rejected.

Another recurring theme from Ch'ien's critics, from the 1930s onwards, concerns his defense of traditional Chinese political system, headed by a monarch but with the government filled by examinations-based mandarins, as a representative form of government, as a simplistic fantasy.

In his survey, ''Traditional Government in Imperial China: A Critical Analysis '' Ch'ien describes the basic constitutive elements of China's traditional government as it evolved. He concentrates upon those dynasties he considers China's most representative: the Han, Tang, Song, Ming and Qing; and critically analyzes and compares their governmental organization, civil service examination system, taxation and defence.

Ch'ien Mu was also criticized for having invested in too many different academic fields. For example, his research on Chinese Literature was considered as "unprofessional". His work on Daoism and ''Zhuangzi'' : ''Zhuangzi Zuan Jian'' 莊子纂箋 had also drawn him criticisms for long.

{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}

The '''coefficient of relationship''' is a measure of the [[Consanguinity|degree of consanguinity]] (or biological relationship) between two individuals. The term [[coefficient]] of relationship was defined by [[Sewall Wright]] in 1922, and was derived from his definition of the coefficient of [[inbreeding]] of 1921. The measure is most commonly used in [[genetics]] and [[genealogy]].  A [[coefficient of inbreeding]] can be calculated for an individual, and is typically one-half the coefficient of relationship between the parents.

In general, the higher the level of inbreeding the closer the coefficient of relationship between the parents approaches a value of 1, expressed as a percentage,{{efn|strictly speaking, r{{=}}1 for clones and identical twins, but since the definition of r is usually intended to estimate the suitability of two individuals for breeding, they are typically taken to be of opposite sex.}} and approaches a value of 0 for individuals with arbitrarily remote common ancestors.

The page for [[coefficient of inbreeding]] used to redirect here, but is now considered to require its own page. 

==Coefficient of relationship==

The coefficient of relationship ("r") between two individuals B and C is obtained by a summation of coefficients calculated for every line by which they are connected to their [[identical ancestors point|common ancestors]]. Each such line connects the two individuals via a common ancestor, passing through no individual which is not a common ancestor more than once. A path coefficient between an ancestor A and an offspring O separated by ''n'' generations  is given as:
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;AO&lt;/sub&gt;= 2&lt;sup&gt;−n&lt;/sup&gt;⋅((1+''f''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)/(1+''f''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;))&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;
where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; are the coefficients of inbreeding for A and O, respectively.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}

The coefficient of relationship  ''r''&lt;sub&gt;BC&lt;/sub&gt; is now obtained by summing over all path coefficients:
: ''r''&lt;sub&gt;BC&lt;/sub&gt; = Σ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;⋅''p''&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;.

By assuming that the pedigree can be traced back to a sufficiently remote population of perfectly random-bred stock (''f''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;=0){{clarify|date=January 2012}} the definition of ''r'' may be simplified to 
: ''r''&lt;sub&gt;BC&lt;/sub&gt; = Σ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;−''L''(''p'')&lt;/sup&gt;,
where ''p'' enumerates all paths connecting B and C with unique common ancestors (i.e. all paths terminate at a common ancestor and may not pass through a common ancestor to a common ancestor's ancestor), and L(p) is the length of the path ''p''.

To give an (artificial) example: 
Assuming that two individuals share the same 32 ancestors of ''n''=5 generations ago, but do not have any common ancestors at four or fewer generations ago, their coefficient of relationship would be 
:''r'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;⋅2&lt;sup&gt;−2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which is, because n = 5,
:r = 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;•2&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/32 which is approximately 0.0313 or 3%.

Individuals for which the same situation applies for their 1024 ancestors of ten generations ago would have a coefficient of ''r'' =  2&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1%.
If follows that the value of ''r'' can be given to an accuracy of a few percent if the family tree of both individuals is known for a depth of five generations, and to an accuracy of a tenth of a percent if the known depth is at least ten generations. The contribution to ''r'' from common ancestors of 20 generations ago (corresponding to roughly 500 years in human genealogy, or the contribution from common descent from a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] population) falls below one [[Parts-per notation|part-per-million]].

==Human relationships==
[[File:Coefficient of relatedness.png|thumb|Diagram of common family relationships, where the area of each colored circle is scaled according to the coefficient of relatedness. All relatives of the same relatedness are included together in one of the gray ellipses. Legal [[degree of relationship|degrees of relationship]] can be found by counting the number of solid-line connections between the self and a relative.{{efn|For instance, one's sibling connects to one's parent, which connects to one's self (2 lines) while one's aunt/uncle connects to one's grandparent, which connects to one's parent, which connects to one's self (3 lines).}}]]
The coefficient of relationship is sometimes used to express [[degrees of kinship]] in numeric terms in human [[genealogy]].

In human relationships, the value of the coefficient of relationship is usually calculated based on the knowledge of a full family tree extending to a comparatively small number of generations, perhaps of the order of three or four. As explained above, the value for the coefficient of relationship so calculated is thus a lower bound, with an actual value that may be up to a few percent higher. The value is accurate to within 1% if the full family tree of both individuals is known to a depth of seven generations.{{efn|A full family tree of seven generations (128 paths to ancestors of the 7th degree) is unreasonable even for members of high nobility. For example, the family tree of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is fully known for a depth of six generations, but becomes difficult to trace in the seventh generation.&lt;!--parents of Francis Webb. d. 1814; mother  of Mary Lister; parents of  Pierre Roland and Hyacinthe Gabrielle Varis. --&gt;}}

Most [[incest laws]] concern the relationships where ''r'' = 25% or higher, although many ignore the rare case of double first cousins. Some jurisdictions also prohibit sexual relations or marriage [[cousin marriage|between cousins]] of various degree, or individuals related only through [[adoption]] or [[affinity (law)|affinity]]. Whether there is any likelihood of conception is generally considered irrelevant.

==Kinship coefficient==
&lt;!--[[Kinship coefficient]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
The '''kinship coefficient''' is a simple measure of relatedness, defined as the [[probability]] that a pair of randomly sampled homologous [[alleles]] are [[Identity by descent|identical by descent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Kenneth|title=Mathematical and statistical methods for genetic analysis|date=2003|publisher=Springer|page=81|isbn=978-0-387-21750-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, it is the probability that an allele selected randomly from an individual, i, and an allele selected at the same [[autosomal]] locus from another individual, j, are identical and from the same ancestor.

The coefficient of relatedness is equal to twice the kinship coefficient.

===Calculation===
The kinship coefficient between two individuals, i and j, is represented as Φ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinship coefficient between a non-inbred individual and itself, Φ&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;, is equal to 1/2. This is due to the fact that humans are diploid, meaning the only way for the randomly chosen alleles to be identical by descent is if the same allele is chosen twice (probability 1/2). Similarly, the relationship between a parent and a child is found by the chance that the randomly picked allele in the child is from the parent (probability 1/2) and the probability of the allele that is picked from the parent being the same one passed to the child (probability 1/2). Since these two events are independent of each other, they are multiplied Φ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 X 1/2 = 1/4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Kenneth|title=Mathematical and statistical methods for genetic analysis|date=2003|publisher=Springer|pages=81-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacquard|first1=Albert|title=The genetic structure of populations|date=1974|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-642-88415-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cormac Ó Gráda''' or '''Cormac O'Grada''' (born 1945) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[economic history|economic historian]] and professor emeritus of [[economics]] at [[University College Dublin]]. His research has focused on the economic history of [[Ireland]], Irish demographic changes, the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] (as well as other [[famine]]s), and the [[history of the Jews in Ireland]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cormac O'Grada|url=http://www.ucd.ie/research/people/economics/professorcormaco'grada/|website=University College Dublin|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life and career==
After earning his undergraduate degree at the [[University College Dublin]], Ó Gráda earned his Ph.D. in [[economics]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1973,&lt;ref name="ias"/&gt; where he wrote his dissertation on the Irish economy before and after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].&lt;ref name="clio"/&gt; He described his early academic career as being "a kind of [[Jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]] economic historian of Ireland".&lt;ref name="pup"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liese|first1=Debra|title=A Q&amp;A with Cormac Ó Gráda, author of Eating People is Wrong|url=http://blog.press.princeton.edu/2015/05/12/a-qa-with-cormac-o-grada-author-of-eating-people-is-wrong/|accessdate=27 January 2018|work=Princeton University Press Blog|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He credits fellow economist [[Joel Mokyr]], whom he met in 1977 through Michael Edelstein, his graduate thesis advisor at Columbia, as the "greatest influence" his academic work.&lt;ref name="clio"/&gt; Mokyr also sharpened his interest in the [[Great Irish Famine]], which "led eventually to the study of famines elsewhere".&lt;ref name="pup"/&gt;

He is a member of the [[Cliometrics|Cliometric Society]], the [[Economic History Society]], the European Historical Economics Society, the Irish Economic and Social History Society, and the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He has served on the editorial boards of ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'', ''[[Explorations in Economic History]]'', and the ''[[Agricultural History Review]]'',&lt;ref name="clio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Bromhead|first1=Alan|title=An Interview with Cormac Ó Gráda|journal=The Newsletter of the Cliometric Society|date=Winter 2017|volume=31|issue=2|pages=20–23|url=http://cliometrics.org/newsletters/Volume-31/Volume-31-Number-2-Winter-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a former coeditor for the ''[[European Review of Economic History]]''.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cormac Ó Gráda|url=https://voxeu.org/users/cormacograda0|website=VoxEU.org|publisher=[[Centre for Economic Policy Research]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the President of the [[Economic History Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Economic History Association|url=https://eh.net/eha/about/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2007, he was a member at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Institute for Advanced Study]] as a member of the School of Historical Studies. In 2010, he won a Gold Medal from the [[Royal Irish Academy]],&lt;ref name="ias"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cormac Ó Gráda|url=https://www.ias.edu/scholars/cormac-%C3%B3-gr%C3%A1da|website=Institute for Advanced Study|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he has been a member since 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19227">The '''Dunning School''' refers to a [[historiographical]] [[school of thought]] regarding the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period of [[American history]] (1865–1877), supporting conservative elements against the Radical Republicans who introduced civil rights in the South. 

==Profile==
The Dunning School viewpoint favored conservative elements in the south (the [[Redeemers]], plantation owners and former Confederates) and disparaged Radical Republicans who favored civil rights for former slaves. The views of the Dunning School dominated scholarly and popular depictions of the era from about 1900 to the 1930s. [[Adam Fairclough]], a British historian whose expertise includes [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], summarized the Dunningite themes:

{{quote|All agreed that black suffrage had been a political blunder and that the Republican state governments in the South that rested upon black votes had been corrupt, extravagant, unrepresentative, and oppressive. The sympathies of the "Dunningite" historians lay with the white Southerners who resisted Congressional Reconstruction: whites who, organizing under the banner of the Conservative or Democratic Party, used legal opposition and extralegal violence to oust the Republicans from state power. Although "Dunningite" historians did not necessarily endorse those extralegal methods, they did tend to palliate them. From start to finish, they argued, Congressional Reconstruction—often dubbed "Radical Reconstruction"—lacked political wisdom and legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Fairclough, "Was the Grant of Black Suffrage a Political Error? Reconsidering the Views of John W. Burgess, William A. Dunning, and Eric Foner on Congressional Reconstruction," ''Journal of The Historical Society'' (June 2012)  12: 155&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian [[Eric Foner]], a leading specialist, said:

{{quote|The traditional or Dunning School of Reconstruction was not just an interpretation of history. It was part of the edifice of the [[Jim Crow]] System. It was an explanation for and justification of taking the right to vote away from black people on the grounds that they completely abused it during Reconstruction. It was a justification for the white South resisting outside efforts in changing race relations because of the worry of having another Reconstruction.

All of the alleged horrors of Reconstruction helped to freeze the minds of the white South in resistance to any change whatsoever. And it was only after the [[Civil Rights]] revolution swept away the racist underpinnings of that old view—i.e., that black people are incapable of taking part in American [[democracy]]—that you could get a new view of Reconstruction widely accepted. For a long time it was an intellectual straitjacket for much of the white South, and historians have a lot to answer for in helping to propagate a [[racist]] system in this country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenation.com/article/how-radical-change-occurs-interview-historian-eric-foner/ "How Radical Change Occurs: An Interview With Historian Eric Foner" by Mike Konczal, February 3, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The school was named after [[Columbia University]] professor [[William Archibald Dunning]] (1857–1922), whose writings and those of his PhD students comprised the main elements of the school.  He supported the idea that [[Southern United States|the South]] had been hurt by Reconstruction and that American values had been trampled by the use of the U.S. Army to control state politics.  He contended that [[freedmen]] had proved incapable of self-government and thus had made [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] necessary. Dunning believed that allowing [[Black (people)|blacks]] to vote and hold office had been "a serious error".&lt;ref&gt;Current pg. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  As a professor, he taught generations of scholars, many of whom expanded his views of the evils of Reconstruction.  The Dunning School and similar historians dominated the version of Reconstruction-era history in textbooks into the 1960s.  Their generalized adoption of deprecatory terms such as [[scalawags]] for southern white Republicans and [[carpetbagger]]s for northerners who worked and settled in the South, have persisted in historical works.

Explaining the success of the Dunning School, historian [[Peter Novick]] noted two forces—the need to reconcile the North and the South after the Civil War and the increase in racism as [[Social Darwinism]] appeared to back the concept with science—that contributed to a "racist historiographical consensus" around the turn of the 20th century on the "criminal outrages" of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Novick pp.&amp;nbsp;74–77. Stampp (p.&amp;nbsp;20) makes a similar point:

:"It [the Dunning interpretation of reconstruction] was written at a time when xenophobia had become almost a national disease, when numerous northern cities (among them Philadelphia and Chicago) were seriously considering the establishment of racially segregated schools, and when Negroes and immigrants were being lumped together in the category of unassimilable aliens"&lt;/ref&gt; Novick provided examples of the style of the Dunning School approach when he wrote:

{{quote|[[James Ford Rhodes]], citing [Louis] [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]], said that "what the whole country has only learned through years of costly and bitter experience was known to this leader of scientific thought before we ventured on the policy of trying to make negroes [sic] intelligent by legislative acts." [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John W. Burgess]] wrote that "a black skin means membership in a race of men which has never of itself succeeded in subjecting passion to reason." For William A. Dunning, blacks "had no pride of race and no aspiration or ideals save to be like whites." [[Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer]] quoted approvingly the southern observation that Yankees didn't understand the subject because they "had never seen a nigger except [[Frederick Douglass|Fred Douglass]]." Blacks were "as credulous as children, which in intellect they in many ways resembled."&lt;ref&gt;Novick pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even [[James Wilford Garner]]'s ''Reconstruction in Mississippi'', regarded by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] as the fairest work of the Dunning school, depicted Reconstruction as "unwise" and black politicians as liabilities to Southern administrations.&lt;ref name=Lemann&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s [[Howard K. Beale]] began to define a different approach.  Beale's analysis combined an assumption of "racial egalitarianism and an insistence on the centrality of class".  He claimed that some of the more progressive southern historians continued to propose "that their race must bar Negroes from social and economic equality."  Beale indicated other southern historians' making more positive contributions were "southern liberals" such as [[C. Vann Woodward]] and Francis Simkins.&lt;ref&gt;Novick pg. 233-234&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coulter===
While he did not study with Dunning or at Columbia University, the southern historian [[E. Merton Coulter]] represented some typical views.  According to the New Georgia Encyclopedia, he "framed his literary corpus to praise the Old South, glorify Confederate heroes, vilify northerners, and denigrate southern blacks."  He taught at the [[University of Georgia]] for six decades, founded the [[Southern Historical Association]], and edited the ''[[Georgia Historical Quarterly]]'' for 50 years, so had many avenues of influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/HistoryArchaeology/HistoriansHistoricalOrganization/Historians&amp;id=h-851 New Georgia Encyclopedia: E. Merton Coulter (1890-1981)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[John Hope Franklin]] wrote of Coulter:

{{quote|No sooner was revisionism launched, however, than E. Merton Coulter insisted that "no amount of revision can write away the grievous mistakes made in this abnormal period of American history."  He then declared that he had not attempted to do so, and with that he subscribed to virtually all of the views that had been set forth by the students of Dunning. And he added a few observations of his own, such as "education soon lost its novelty for most of the Negroes"; they would "spend their last piece of money for a drink of whisky"; and, being "by nature highly emotional and excitable…, they carried their religious exercises to extreme lengths." &lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The South during Reconstruction'', Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1947, pp. xi, 86, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/info/AHA_History/jhfranklin.htm American History Association]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eric Foner wrote in 1988:

{{quote|The fact that blacks took part in government, wrote E. Merton Coulter in the last full-scale history of Reconstruction written entirely within the Dunning tradition, was a "diabolical" development, "to be remembered, shuddered at, and execrated."  Yet while these works abounded in horrified references to "negro rule" and "negro government", blacks in fact played little role in the narratives.  Their aspirations, if mentioned at all, were ridiculed, and their role in shaping the course of events during Reconstruction ignored.  When the writers spoke of "the South" or "the people", they meant whites.  Blacks appeared either as passive victims of white manipulation or as an unthinking people whose "animal natures" threatened the stability of civilized society.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (1988), p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism of the Dunning School==

In 1935, [[W. E. B. DuBois]] attacked the premises of the Dunning School in ''[[Black Reconstruction]]'', setting forth ideas such as the active agency of blacks in the era, that the struggle over control of black labor was central to the politics of the era, and that Reconstruction was a time of great promise and many accomplishments, the overthrow of which was a tragic defeat for democracy. While the work was largely ignored by historians at the time, later revisionist scholars lauded DuBois's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://saq.dukejournals.org/content/112/3/409.abstract |title=Black Reconstruction: An Introduction | last =Foner | first =Eric |authorlink=Eric Foner | journal =South Atlantic Quarterly | volume =112 | issue =3 | pages =409–418 |date =2013 |doi =10.1215/00382876-2146368 |accessdate=2016-01-18 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Kenneth M. Stampp]] was one of the leaders of the [[historical revisionism|revisionist movement]] regarding reconstruction, which mounted a successful attack on Dunning's racially biased narrative. In putting his criticism  in proper context, Stampp wrote:

{{quote|Few revisionists would claim that the Dunning interpretation of reconstruction is a pure fabrication.  They recognize the shabby aspects of the era: the corruption was real, the failures obvious, the tragedy undeniable.  Grant is not their idea of a model President, nor were the southern carpetbag governments worthy of their unqualified praise.  They understood that the radical Republicans were not all selfless patriots, and that southern white men were not all Negro-hating rebels.  In short, they have not turned history on its head, but rather, they recognize that much of what Dunning's disciples have said about reconstruction is true.&lt;ref&gt;Stampp p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stampp then noted that "Dunningites overlooked a great deal",  and revisionists rejected "the two-dimensional characters that Dunning's disciples have painted."&lt;ref&gt;Stampp, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Stampp asserted that even in accurately identifying the corruption of many state reconstruction governments, the Dunning School fell short.  It engaged in "distortion by exaggeration, by a lack of perspective, by superficial analysis, and by overemphasis," while ignoring "constructive accomplishments" and failing to acknowledge "men who transcended the greed" of the age.&lt;ref&gt;Stampp, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jean Edward Smith]] wrote that the Dunning School "despite every intention to be fair" wrote from a white supremacist perspective.  Smith stated, " Blacks were depicted as inherently incapable of meaningful political participation while terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan were applauded for their efforts to restore the South's natural order."  Referring to "the racist rants of the Dunning school", Smith noted that the influence of the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s "consigned the Dunning school to the museum of historical artifacts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.875/article_detail.asp The Claremont Institute - A People's History of Reconstruction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2005, the influential Reconstruction historian [[Eric Foner]] analyzed the Dunning School as follows:

{{quote|Their account of the era rested, as one member of the Dunning school put it, on the assumption of "negro incapacity." Finding it impossible to believe that blacks could ever be independent actors on the stage of history, with their own aspirations and motivations, Dunning, ''et al.'' portrayed African Americans either as "children", ignorant dupes manipulated by unscrupulous whites, or as savages, their primal passions unleashed by the end of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 2005, p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Philip R. Muller]], while acknowledging the widespread charges of racism against Dr. Dunning personally, lay much of the perception on Dunning's "methodological weakness" in one particular work, ''Reconstruction, Political and Economic 1865-1877''.  Muller noted that "faulty ... generalizations" abounded.

{{quote|They are not, however, chiefly characterized by their hostility toward ethnic groups. Dunning's antipathy in Reconstruction is generously heaped on all groups, regardless of race, color, creed, or sectional origins. If, as one historian has suggested, Dunning viewed Reconstruction as "a mob run riot," the unruly crowd was biracial and bipartisan. More important, the concentration of "evidence" in this single scantily researched volume suggested that Dunning's "racist" generalizations were more unexamined than "inflexible."&lt;ref&gt;Muller pg. 337&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some historians have suggested that historians sympathetic to the [[Neo-Confederate]] movement are influenced by the Dunning School's interpretation of history.&lt;ref&gt;Hummel, Jeffrey Rogers ''Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men'',

'''Eric Jones''' (born 21 September 1936) is a British-Australian economist and historian, known for his 1981 book ''[[The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia|The European Miracle]]''.

Jones received a doctorate in [[economic history]] from the [[Oxford University]]. From 1970 to 1975, he was professor of economics at [[Northwestern University]] in United States. From 1975 to 1994 he was a professor of economics and economics history at [[La Trobe University]], in Australia. Jones has also had visiting appointments at Yale, Manchester, Princeton, University of Berlin and the Center for Economic Studies at Munich.

As of the early 2000s, he is Emeritus Professor of Economic Systems and Ideas at La Trobe University, and he holds a half-time Professorial Fellow position at the [[Melbourne Business School]] of the [[University of Melbourne]] in [[Australia]] and the part-time Professor of Economics position at the Graduate Center of International Business of the [[University of Reading]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

Jones has also acted as a consultant for businesses and international organizations such as the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=mbs&gt;[http://www.mbs.edu/go/centres-of-excellence/people/centre-for-business-and-public-policy/professor-eric-jones/ Professor Eric Jones], Melbourne Business School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Eric Jones specialized in [[economic history]], [[global economics]], [[International relations|international affairs]] and [[economic systems]], particularly in those of the Asian-Pacific region.&lt;ref name=mbs/&gt;

Eric Jones is the author of numerous articles and several books.

His most notable work is ''[[The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia]]'' book (published in 1981).  The work popularized the term [[European miracle]], but it also proved controversial, with some scholars describing his interpretation as 'Eurocentric'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blaut|first=James|title=Eight Eurocentric Historians|year=2000|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andre Gunder Frank, for example, has claimed that productivity was higher in parts of Asia than in Britain until the late eighteenth century,and that Asia was at the centre of the world economy until at least that date. The world economy, he argues, remained ‘dominated by Asian production,competitiveness, and trade’ through the eighteenth century; Europe, by contrast, was only a ‘marginal player'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Andre Gunder|title=ReOrient: The Silver Age in Asia and the World Economy|year=1998|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Why was Britain first?

In ''Growth Recurring'' (1988) Jones focused on the [[states system theory]] as the decisive factor in the development of the West.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4758">[[File:Portrait of Girolamo Benzoni Wellcome L0020190.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Girolamo Benzoni ]]

'''Girolamo Benzoni''' (born at [[Milan]] about 1519; died after 1572 in Spain) was an Italian [[conquistador]] and merchant who wrote a popular account of his travels.

==Life==
In 1541, at the age of twenty-two, Girolamo Benzoni travelled from his hometown of Milan (Italy) to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain, and then on to the New World. He claims to have been seeking adventure and fortune. He spent fifteen years in the territories conquered and being exploited by the Spaniards, travelling widely through the West Indies, Central America and South America, and visiting: the Caribbean (Greater and Lesser [[Antilles]]), [[Guatemala]], Nicaragua, Mexico, [[Panama]], Peru, and Venezuela. After losing much of the 'few thousand ducats' he had accumulated in a shipwreck on his way home, he finally arrived back in the port town of [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] (Spain) on 13 September 1556, with nothing more than his wealth of experiences.  Subsequently he returned to Italy. In the dedication of his first edition he claims to have been born of humble parentage and unable to go to college. He also says his father sent him throughout Europe, one assumes on business. He then writes a new dedication in the second Italian edition in 1572. After that nothing is known of Benzoni. 

Exactly what he was doing in the New World is not clear: he attached himself to various military expeditions though he was not by nature a fighting man; he reveals a good knowledge of political intrigue but does not apparently become involved in politics; he is informed about economics but does not discuss the commodities he traded in.

==Works==
[[File:Title page Historia del Mondo Nuovo.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Title page]] of ''Historia del Mondo Nuovo'']]
Benzoni's ''Historia del Mondo Nuovo'' was published at Venice in 1565 and was dedicated it to [[Pope Pius IV]]. The book purported to present facts and describe events that Benzoni himself had witnessed. Since there was controversy at the time, concerning treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], a work by someone who had both spent 15 years in the New World and was willing to criticize colonists, could not fail to attract attention.

Controversy came to surround that ''Historia del Mondo Nuovo'' itself. Critics claimed that: included many factual errors and often in intentional misstatements; suggested that the author had limited education and very narrow views; was motivated by hatred of the Spanish people and government, against whom it made many diatribes and accusations; had the tone of a disappointed trader, motivated by a lack of personal success, despite protections given to him by Spanish authorities and favors that he acknowledged only reluctantly;{{cn|date=June 2018}} did not faithfully report Benzoni's own experiences;{{cn|date=June 2018}} failed to notice mitigating circumstances and tended to ignore positive aspects of colonisation. In particular, it was alleged, Benzoni's book included a clumsy rehash of [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]]'s accounts of the [[Antilles]],{{cn|date=June 2018}}  and made many factual errors regarding the [[conquest of Mexico]] and [[conquest of Peru]]. The ultra-philanthropists {{vague|date=June 2018}} {{who|date=June 2018}} found in Benzoni a welcome auxiliary.{{cn|date=June 2018}} This was especially the case in countries vying with Spain to establish colonies in the Americas.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Several editions of Benzoni's writings were published in rapid succession,{{cn|date=June 2018}} including translations into languages such as English.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In 1572, the original edition of the ''Historia'' was reprinted; in 1579, translations into French and German appeared, by Eustace Vignon and Nicolaus Höniger (&lt;small&gt;German ''Wikipedia'' article: [[:de:Nicolaus Höniger|Nicolaus Höniger]]&lt;/small&gt;) respectively. An 1857 edition by Admiral [[William Henry Smyth|W. H. Smyth]], published in London by the  [[Hakluyt Society]], under the title,''History of the New World, by Girolamo Benzoni, of Milan: Shewing his Travels in America, from A.D. 1541 to 1556: with some Particulars of the Island of Canary {{sic}}'', is often considered to be the most faithful English translation.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11451">'''Gregory Atta''' born '''Michael Atta''' (born 14 April 1815 in Zahle, Lebanon - died on 3 December 1899 in Damascus, Syria) was a bishop of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Homs]], church historian and collector of antique manuscripts. He visited Europe in 1860–61 and campaigned among others for alms for the Oriental Christians in Bavaria (in the Roman Catholic dioceses of Augsburg, Wurzburg and Speyer). later served as a father of the [[First Vatican Council]] in Rome.

==Life and work==

Gregory Atta was baptized as Michael, the son of Melkite Catholic parents in Zahle, Lebanon. It is the third largest city of Lebanon, a Christian stronghold and is known in the Middle East as the "City of Wine and poet".&lt;ref name="middleeast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeast.com/zahle.htm|publisher=middleeast.com|title=Zahle|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ata sought the spiritual calling when he was ordained and became Oikonomus 1848&lt;ref name="orden-online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orden-online.de/wissen/o/oekonom/|publisher=orden-online.de|title=Ökonom – Orden-online.de|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Melkite Patriarchate of Antioch in Damascus. As Patriarch officiated at this time was [[Maximos III. Mazloum]] (1833–1855), a learned, worldly-wise man who spent nearly 20 years in exile in Europe and the Melkite Church prospered greatly. Michael Ata belonged as an economist of Patriarchate to the Curia and to his personal environment.

==Archbishop==

Already on February 20, 1849 Ata received from the hand of the Patriarch Mazloum his episcopal consecration and became the Archbishop of the newly formed [[Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Homs]], Hama and Yabroud".&lt;ref name="pgc-lb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgc-lb.org/english/Church3.shtml |publisher=web.archive.org |title=PATRIARCHATE - Eparchies &amp;amp; Orders |accessdate=2017-01-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419194326/http://www.pgc-lb.org/english/Church3.shtml#Homs |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the consecration Michael Ata took the name "Gregory".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;cd=7&amp;id=1e8NAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Ata+Oikonomos&amp;q=Oikonomos+des+Patriarchates+und+schon+wenige+Monate+]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his pastoral duties Archbishop Ata collected ancient manuscripts and explored the Christian history in the Middle East, particularly of the Melkite Catholics.

==Trip to Europe==

In 1860 anti-Christian riots raged and killed some 30,000 believers and many churches and monasteries were looted and burned, and his diocese was one of the most strongly affected. Among those killed were three bishops and 30 priests and the beatified Franciscan {{Interlanguage link multi|Engelbert Kolland|de}}. Due to the outstanding help of the Arab leader [[Abdelkader El Djezairi]], although the rest could be restored, the formerly thriving Christian communities, however, were completely devastated. Gregory Ata decided together with other Eastern prelates at a time an unusual action. He drove the shores of Europe to collect urgently needed funds for the reconstruction of his diocese. In 1860 remained Ata in Vienna and 1861 he visited in the same intention, the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Archiv für katholisches Kirchenrecht|author1=Katholischer Juristenverein|author2=von Moy de Sons, K.K.E.F.|author3=Vering, F.H.T.H.|author4=Heiner, F.X.|author5=Hilling, N.|date=1862|volume=7|publisher=Verlag Kirchheim.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BuUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA338|page=338|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; From King [[Maximilian II of Bavaria]] the bishoprics were him to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wurzburg]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer]].

The Wiener Professor Friedrich Müller reported in 1898 in the "Melanges" for Charlez de Harlez, Liège canon and Orientalist professor at the Catholic University of Leuven, about his earlier meeting with Archbishop Ata:

"When in the year 1859/60 after the massacre in Damascus Metropolitan Gregorius Ata lived in the local Dominican monastery a long time, I became acquainted with him through the mediation of a higher clergy. The Rev. Mr., who knew no language other than Arabic, asked me to help him upon the application of a short Arab-German Vocabulars."

- Professor [[Friedrich Müller (linguist)]], "The origin of Indian script", in "Melanges de Charlez de Harlez" Catholic University of Leuven, 1898, pages 217/218.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/mlangescharlesd00goog#page/n246/mode/1up|publisher=archive.org|title=Mélanges Charles de Harlez|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer]] Vicar General Johann Martin Foliot on 15 February 1861, serial no. 349 issued a circular to all parishes. In it, the then sad situation of Christians in the Middle East is portrayed again and goes on to say:

" ... we will notify all pastor and parish administrator of our diocese that the Greek uniierte Archbishop of Homs&lt;ref name="homsonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homsonline.com/EN/Citeis/Homs.htm|publisher=homsonline.com|title=Homs City - Syria (HomsOnline)|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hamah&lt;ref name="homsonline2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homsonline.com/EN/Citeis/Hama.htm|publisher=homsonline.com|title=Hama City - Syria (Homs Online)|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Syria, Gregory Ata will arrive in the next few days in Speyer and from here a series of Municipalities will be visited in our diocese to collect alms for the persecuted Christians. In our Bavarian fatherland several priests and bishops of Syria have now arrived and received from the King's Majesty the authorization personally to speak in different parts of the country for support. The reverend Archbishop Gregory Atta, preferably within whose jurisdiction the sword and fire of persecution raged, the Roman Catholic dioceses of Augsburg, Wurzburg and Speyer will be been instructed about this facts".

- Generali collection Diocese of Speyer, Circular No. 349, from 15 February 1861.

The clergy of the diocese are in the letter also invited the Oriental prelates "with word and deed at hand" to go. When visiting places Atta in the Bishopric of Speyer 18 cities were listed, namely: Speyer, Schifferstadt, Frankenthal, Forst, Deidesheim, Neustadt, Kaiserslautern, Landstuhl, St. Ingbert, Blieskastel, Zweibrücken, Maikammer, Edesheim, Landau, Herxheim, Rheinzabern, Rülzheim and Germersheim.

Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer in 1864 reported on pages 182/183 back over the visit of the Syrian princes of the Church:

" Not found little sympathy in 1861 the Christians in Syria, which had beset by enemies hard and robbed, to meet their religious needs take the charity of their co-religionists to complete. The Most Reverend Archbishop Atta of Damascus, personally for this purpose, such as in the Bishopric of Speyer raised a Collecte for his unfortunate archdiocese in Bavaria, was pleased with the kindest inclusion in the visited him more important places of the bishopric with abundant gifts of love and also adopted by immediately be delivered to the Episcopal authority donations nor the sum of 1311 guilders in receiving."

- Schematism Diocese of Speyer, 1864, pages 182/183

Gregory Ata was apparently able to return with a very high amount donated in the home and the entire company proved not least the economic efficiency of the former economists of his ecclesiastical province.

In the essay "The legal relationships of the various rites within the Catholic Church" (Archives of Catholic Canon Law, Volume 7, page 339, Mainz 1864), stated Professor Joseph Hergenröther from Würzburg, later Cardinal, that he in the Archbishop Ata's occasion of his stay in Bavaria held a conversation that he described as "some interesting notes" owe.

By Gregory Atta's visit to the Diocese of Augsburg is noted also that he gave to the local Historical Society an old Turkish silver coin.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Jahresbericht des Historischen Vereins von Schwaben und Neuburg|author=Historischer Verein für Schwaben und Neuburg, Augsburg|date=1860|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iMYBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA53|pages=2–53|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Years==

In 1870 Archbishop Gregory Ata participated at [[I Vatican Council]] as a Council Father, and in part, said he was among the minority that was against the dogma of [[Papal infallibility]] voted.

Gregory Atta ruled his archdiocese for 50 years, until his death in 1899,&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Revue de l'orient Latin|author1=de Vogüé, M.|author2=Schefer, C.H.A.|date=1899|volume=7|publisher=E. Leroux.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vrzNAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by Archbishop [[Flavien Khoury]]. Ata resided in his last years in Yabroud &lt;ref name="homsonline3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homsonline.com/EN/Citeis/Yabroud.htm|publisher=homsonline.com|title=Yabroud City - Syria (Homs Online)|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died in Damascus. In 1886 nameed the priest Sylwanos Mansour (1854–1929) as his secretary; later he emigrated to Australia, where he earned a nationwide fame of main Melkite's pastor.&lt;ref name="anu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mansour-sylwanos-sylvanous-7479|publisher=adb.anu.edu.au|title=Biography - Sylwanos (Sylvanous) Mansour - Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fame==

Gregory Atta was considered as having a profound knowledge of the Oriental Church's history and also wrote several works about it. In the "History of the Christian Arabic literature" by Georg Graf, 1953, he states that Archbishop Atta hada number of writings left behind, but of which only parts were published later. He was a "great bibliophile" "and collected many manuscripts, of which the greater number were scattered after his death"; but a part of the Atta's collection is still in Yabroud. These and Ata's writings were described by Archimandrite and church historian Joseph Nasrallah (1911–93) in 1937 as source material for his treatise "Manuscripts of the Yabroud Melkites".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FCqtPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Manuscrits+melkites+des+Yabroud+Nasrallah&amp;lr=&amp;cd=10]{{Dead link|date=January 2017}}{{Dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; 

[[Image:Guild of Saint Luke.jpg|thumb|1730s engraving of the Delft Guild of St. Luke, by an unknown artist. Today the location of the [[Vermeer Centre]]]]
For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

'''Hazārajāt''' ({{lang-fa|هزاره‌جات}}) or '''Hazāristān''' ({{lang|fa|هزارستان}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ppw7-NEsEsC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=%22hazaristan%22+hazarajat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GyRyT4DGH4bi0QG877W3AQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hazaristan%22%20hazarajat&amp;f=false – ''Some Hazara prefer to call the area Hazaristan, using the more modern [[-stan | "istan"]] ending.'']&lt;/ref&gt; is a mountainous region in the central highlands of [[Afghanistan]], among the [[Koh-i-Baba]] mountains in the western extremities of the [[Hindu Kush]]. It is the homeland of the [[Hazara people]] who make up the majority of its population. "Hazārajāt denotes an ethnic and religious zone rather than a geographical one—that of Afghanistan's [[Turko-Mongol]] [[Shi'a Islam| Shiʿites]]."&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-i |title= HAZĀRA i.

The most populous towns in Hazarajat are [[Bamyan]], [[Yakawlang]] (Bamyan), [[Nili, Afghanistan|Nili]] (Daykundi), [[Lal wa Sarjangal]] (Ghor), [[Sang-e-Masha]] (Ghazni), [[Gizab]] (Urozgan) and [[Behsud, Maidan Wardak|Behsud]] (Wardak). The [[Kabul River|Kabul]], [[Arghandab River|Arghandab]], [[Helmand River|Helmand]], [[Farah River|Farah]], [[Hari (Afghanistan)|Hari]], [[Murghab River|Murghab]], [[Balkh River|Balkh]] and [[Kunduz River|Kunduz]] rivers originate in Hazarajat.

The name "Hazarajat" first appears in the 16th-century book ''[[Baburnama]]'', written by [[Mughal Empire| Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]] (died 1530). When the famous geographer [[Ibn Battuta]] arrived in Afghanistan in 1333, he travelled across the country but did not record any place by the name of ''Hazarajat'' or any Hazara people.&lt;ref name="Battuta"/&gt; It was not mentioned by previous geographers, historians, adventurers or invaders either.

==Etymology and usage==
The name Hazarajat is used by the Hazara people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellew|first=H.W.|title=The Races of Afghanistan: Being a Brief Account of the Principal Nations Inhabiting that Country|year=1880|publisher=Thacker, Spink &amp; Co|location=Calcutta|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding peoples to identify the historic Hazara lands. The term might be linguistically compounded ''Hazara'' and the suffix ''jat''; jat is a suffix that otherwise is used to make root words associated with land like Shumali Alaqa (JAT) Northern Areas in Pakistan, Dera (JAT) Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Ismail Khan and other areas in South, central and west Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mousavi|first=S.A.|title=The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study|year=1998|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond, Surrey UK|isbn=0-7007-0630-5|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maqdesi, an Arab geographer, named Hazarajat as ''Gharj Al-Shar-Gharj'' meaning "mountain" area ruled by chiefs. The region was known as [[Gharjistan]] in the late [[Middle Ages]], though the exact locations of main cities still remain unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ḥamd-Allah Mostawfi]], Nozhat al-qolub, tr. Guy Le Strange, London 1919. pp 415–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1eaQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+hazaras+of+afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t281To_KDpO18QPskMGhDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA S. A. Mousavi, The Hazaras of Afghanistan, London, 1998, p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt; The name Hazarajat first appears in the 16th century [[Baburnama]], written by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Popular Route through Mountains of Bamiyan, September 15, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|A popular route through the mountains of Bamyan]]

===Topography===
[[File:Bamyan collage.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Bamyan Province]] of [[Afghanistan]]]]
The Hazarajat lies in the central highlands of Afghanistan, among the [[Koh-i-Baba|Koh-i Baba mountains]] and the western extremities of the [[Hindu Kush]]. "Its boundaries have historically been inexact and shifting, and in some respects Hazārajāt denotes an ethnic and religious zone rather than a geographical one–that of Afghanistan’s Turko-Mongol Shiʿites. Its physical boundaries, however, are roughly marked by the Bā-miān Basin (see BĀMIĀN ii.) to the north, the headwaters of the Helmand River (q.v.) to the south, Firuzkuh to the west, and the [[Unai Pass]] to the east. The regional terrain is very mountainous and extends to the Safid Kuh and the Siāh Kuh mountains, where the highest peaks are between 15,000 to 17,000 feet. Both sides of the Kuh-e Bābā range contain a succession of valleys. The north face of the range descends steeply, merging into low foothills and short semi-arid plains, while the south face stretches towards the Helmand Valley and the mountainous district of [[Markazi Bihsud District|Besud]]."&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Central Afghanistan 1955, pp. 313"&gt;[[Wilfred Thesiger]] "The Hazaras of Central Afghanistan," The Geographical Journal 71/3, 1955, pp. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

Northwestern Hazarajat encompasses the district of [[Ghor]], long known for its mountain fortresses. The 10th century geographer [[Estakhri]] wrote that mountainous Ghor was "the only region surrounded on all sides by Islamic territories and yet inhabited by infidels."&lt;ref&gt;W. Barthold, An Historical Geography of Iran, Princeton, 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The long resistance of the inhabitants of Ghor to the adoption of [[Islam]] provides an indication of the region's inaccessibility; according to some travelers, the entire region is comparable to a fortress raised in the upper Central Asian highlands: from every approach, tall and steep mountains have to be traversed to reach there. The language of the inhabitants of Ghor differed so much from that of the people of the plains, that communication between the two required interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;W. Barthold, An Historical Geography of Iran, Princeton, 1984, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The northeastern part of the Hazarajat, is the site of ancient Bamyan, a center of Buddhism and a key [[caravanserai]] on the [[Silk Road]]. The town is situated at a height of 7,500 feet and surrounded by the Hindu Kush to the north and Koh-i Baba to the south.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; The Hazarajat was considered part of the larger geographic region of [[Greater Khurasan|Khurasan]] ([[Kushan]]), the porous boundaries of which encompassed the vast region between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the Oxus River, thus including much of what is today Northern Iran and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

===Climate===
Hazarajat is mountainous,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfgLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=author:+%22Minorsky%22&amp;dq=author:+%22Minorsky%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JHk1TrfEDI2p8QPFzu2gDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw Anonymous, Ḥodud al-ʿālam, tr. Minorsky, London, 1937; reprinted, 1982, p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of mountain passes extend along its eastern edge. One of them, Salang Pass, is blocked by snow six months out of the year.  Another, [[Shibar Pass]], at a lower elevation, is blocked by snow only two months out of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l5JiewAACAAJ&amp;dq=geographie+de+l%E2%80%99Afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eHk1TvSGAois8QOe_7WgDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA Johannes Humlum, La geographie de l’Afghanistan, Copenhagen, 1959, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt; Bamyan is the colder part of the region; winters there are severe.&lt;ref&gt;Ebn Ḥawqal, Ke-tāb ṣurat al-arż, trs. J. H. Kramers and G. Wiet as Configuration de la terre, II, Paris, 1964, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazarajat is the source of the rivers that run through [[Kabul River|Kabul]], [[Arghandab River|Arghandab]], [[Helmand River|Helmand]], [[Hari (Afghanistan)|Hari]], [[Murghab River|Murghab]], [[Balkh River|Balkh]], and [[Kunduz River|Kunduz]], and during the spring and summer months, it has some of the greenest pastures in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ḥamd-Allah Mostawfi]], Nozhat al-qolub, tr. Guy Le Strange, London 1919, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; [[Band-e Amir|Natural lakes]], green valleys and caves are found in Bamyan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1eaQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+hazaras+of+afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t281To_KDpO18QPskMGhDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA S.

== History ==
[[File:ManWithCapProbablyScythianBamiyan3-4thCentury.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Statue of a bearded man with cap, probably [[Scythian]], 3–4th century AD.]]
{{History of Afghanistan}}
The area was ruled successively by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]]s, [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], and [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]] before the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] Islamized it and made it part of their empire. It was taken over by the [[Samanids]], followed by the [[Ghaznavids]] and [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]] before falling to the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. In the 13th century, it was invaded by [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army. In the following decades the [[Qarlughids]] emerged to create a short-lived local dynasty that offered a few decades of self-rule. Later, the area became part of the [[Timurid dynasty]], the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Durrani Empire]], successively.

When [[Alexander the Great]] travelled north into what is now Afghanistan, "his historians write that Alexander came across a strange people in the region who were more belligerent than the others. The description provided by Kent Corse about the mud houses of the people can be observed by any traveler today (Iranian Civilization, p. 422)." In the 7th century, [[Xuanzang|Hsuen Tsang]] wrote "that a swift spring gushes from Ho-sa-la and its water divides into several branches. The weather of this place is cold and it snows and hails there. Its people are happy and free, they are skilled in magic craft and their language is different from the other lands."&lt;ref name="Habibi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/E-Hazara.htm |title=Is Hazara An Ancient Word? |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]] ruled the area until they were conquered by the [[Ghaznavids]] in the 11th century.

Some contend that one of Genghis Khan's grandsons was killed by local fighters during the [[1221 siege of Bamiyan]]. The story goes that Genghis Khan, enraged, then ordered his forces to annihilate the town and surrounding region, and that the Mongols formally laid a curse on the site. Later, the region remained a colony of the [[Ilkhanate]]s, [[Chughtai]]s, and others. Until 1333, there was no mention of Hazarajat or Hazara people in the region. [[Ibn Battuta]] described the area as being inhabited mostly by Persian-speaking people.&lt;ref name="Battuta"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travels in Asia and Africa, 1325–1354|last1=|first1=Ibn Battuta|authorlink=|author2=|volume=|edition=reprint, illustrated |year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=|isbn= 978-0-415-34473-9|page=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKqn_CWTxYEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjugation of the Hazarajat, particularly the mountain fortresses of Ghor, proved difficult for the Mongols after their conquest of the region, and ultimately Mongol military detachments left behind in the region "adopted the language of the vanquished".&lt;ref&gt;W. Barthold, An Historical Geography of Iran, Princeton, 1984, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 14th century, [[Timur]]'s armies made expeditions into Hazarajat, but Hazarajat was once again free after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wzlCAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=,+Caravan+Journeys+and+Wanderings+in+Persia,+Afghanistan,+Turkestan,+and+Beloochistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W3s1TuL3OMSs8gPAlZ2hDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false J. P. Ferrier, Caravan Journeys and Wanderings in Persia, Afghanistan, Turkestan, and Beloochistan, London, 1856, p. 221]&lt;/ref&gt; During Mongolian era, majority of Hazara were pastoralists dwelling in [[yurt]]s and spoke [[Moghol language|Moghol]]. They started inhabiting the fortified villages, adopted a [[Hazaragi language|Persian dialect]], and farming in the high steppes in the early 16th century. However, they kept flocks and some, on the norther slopes of [[Koh-i-Baba]], remained nomadic and continued migrating between highland summer pastures and lowland winter pastures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l5JiewAACAAJ&amp;dq=geographie+de+l%E2%80%99Afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eHk1TvSGAois8QOe_7WgDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA Johannes Humlum, La geographie de l’Afghanistan, Copenhagen, 1959, p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, as a sense of "Afghan-ness" developed among the larger [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Pashtuns in Afghanistan, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Hazara tribes began to coalesce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d7x7QgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Hazara+Integration+into+the+Afghan+Nation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mno1TsrXGoKo8AO3pMGgDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA Robert L. Canfield, Hazara Integration into the Afghan Nation, New York, 1973, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that in the 19th century there was an emerging awareness of ethnic and religious differences among the population of [[Kabul]]. This brought about divisions along "confessional lines" that became reflected in new "spatial boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iqkiRvaDThgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=State+and+Tribe+in+Nineteenth-Century+Afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=zHo1TqXOPM7D8QO_z5zwBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Christine Noelle, State and Tribe in Nineteenth-Century Afghanistan, Richmond, 1997, p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Dost Mohammad Khan]], [[Mir Yazdanbakhsh]], a diligent chief of the [[Behsud District|Behsud]] Hazaras, consolidated many of the districts they controlled. Mir Yazdanbakhsh collected revenues and safeguarded caravans traveling on the [[Hajigak Pass|Hajigak]] route through Bamyan to Kabul through Shaikh Ali and Besud areas. The consolidation of the Hazarajat thus increasingly made the region and its inhabitants a threat to the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani state]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=og5uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Narrative+of+Various+Journeys+in+Balochistan,+Afghanistan,+and+the+Punjab&amp;dq=Narrative+of+Various+Journeys+in+Balochistan,+Afghanistan,+and+the+Punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cns1Tt-LJsSx8QOVhrShDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA C.

[[File:Hazaras of Afghanistan in 1879-80.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Behsud District|Besudi]] Hazara chieftains in 1879.]]

Until the late 19th century, the Hazarajat remained somewhat independent and only the authority of local chieftains was obeyed.&lt;ref&gt;W. Barthold, An Historical Geography of Iran, Princeton, 1984, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Pierre Ferrier, a French author who supposedly traveled through the region in the mid-19th century, described the inhabitants settled in the mountains near the rivers [[Balkh Province|Balkh]] and [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Kholm]] "The Hazara population is ungovernable, and has no occupation but pillage; they will pillage and pillage only, and plunder from camp to camp".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wzlCAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=,+Caravan+Journeys+and+Wanderings+in+Persia,+Afghanistan,+Turkestan,+and+Beloochistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W3s1TuL3OMSs8gPAlZ2hDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false J. P. Ferrier, Caravan Journeys and Wanderings in Persia, Afghanistan, Turkestan, and Beloochistan, London, 1856, pp. 219–20]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent British travelers doubted whether Ferrier had ever actually left [[Herat]] to venture into Afghanistan’s central mountains and have suggested that his accounts of the region were based on hearsay, especially since very few people dared then to enter the Hazarajat; even Pashtun nomads would not take their flocks to graze there, and few caravans would pass through.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xy0oSwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Preliminary+Notes+on+Haz%C4%81ra+Culture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4Xs1Tp7fD5DC8QOl3LChDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA Klaus Ferdinand, Preliminary Notes on Hazāra Culture, Copenhagen, 1959,p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the early 1890s, the tribes of the Hazarajat were taxed and conscripted, while thousands were massacred{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. Afghanistan's [[Kuchi people]], who are unsettled nomads who migrate between the [[Amu Darya]] and the [[Indus River]], temporarily stayed in Hazarajat during some seasons, where they overran Hazara farmlands and pastures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1eaQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+hazaras+of+afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t281To_KDpO18QPskMGhDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA S. A. Mousavi, The Hazaras of Afghanistan, London, 1998, p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly during summers, these nomads would camp in large numbers in the Hazarajat highlands.

The travels of Captains P. J. Maitland and M. G. Talbot from [[Herat]], through [[Obe, Afghanistan|Obeh]] and Bamyan, to [[Balkh]], during the autumn and winter of 1885, explored the Hazarajat proper.

During the Second [[Anglo-Afghan War]], [[Thomas Holdich|Colonel T. H. Holdich]] of the [[British India|Indian]] Survey Department referred to the Hazarajat as "great unknown highlands".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RbiPAkZra4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Indian+Borderland&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q3I1To_9DMOv8QO5vf2gDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false T.

Various members of the Afghan Boundary Commission were able to gather information that brought the geography of remote regions such as the Hazarajat further under state surveillance. In November 1884, the Commission crossed over the [[Koh-i Baba]] mountains by the Chashma Sabz Pass. General [[Peter Lumsden]] and Major C. E. Yate, who surveyed the tracts between Herat and the [[Oxus]], visited the [[Qala i Naw, Afghanistan|Qala-e Naw]] Hazaras in the [[Paropamisus]] mountain range, to the east of the [[Jamshidi (tribe)|Jamshidis]] of [[Kushk District|Kushk]]. Noting surviving evidence of terraced cultivation in times past, both described the northern Hazaras as semi-nomadic with large flocks of sheep and black cattle. They possessed an "inexhaustible supply of grass, the hills around being covered knee-deep with a luxuriant crop of pure rye".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r4_dQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22C.+E.+Yate%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EHU1TrPYDcXF8QOcw4ChDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ C.

The geographical reach of the authority of the Afghan state was extended into the Hazarajat during the reign of [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]. Caught between the strategic interests of foreign powers and disappointed by the demarcation of the [[Durand Line]] in southern Afghanistan, which cut into Pashtun territory, he set out to bring the northern peripheries of the country more firmly under his control. This policy had disastrous consequences for the Hazarajat, whose inhabitants were singled out by Abdur Rahman Khan’s regime as particularly troublesome: "The Hazara people had been for centuries past the terror of the rulers of Kabul".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh8PAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=The+Life+of+Abdur+Rahman,+Amir+of+Afghanistan+volume+2&amp;dq=The+Life+of+Abdur+Rahman,+Amir+of+Afghanistan+volume+2&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VHc1TqKTEIar8QP-9eSgDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA Mir Munshi, ed., The Life of Abdur Rahman, Amir of Afghanistan, II, London, 1900, p. 276]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st century===
[[File:Afghan farmers in Bamyan-2.jpg|thumb|Two farmers tend to a [[potato]] field near the town of Bamyan]]
In the 1920s the ancient [[Shibar Pass]] road which leads through Bamyan and east to the [[Panjshir Valley]] was paved for lorries, and it remained the busiest road across the [[Hindu Kush]] until the building of the [[Salang tunnel]] in 1964 and the opening of a winter route. The Hazarajat became increasingly depopulated as Hazaras migrated to cities and to surrounding countries, where they became laborers and undertook the hardest and lowest-paid work.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

In 1979, there were reportedly one and a half million Hazaras in the Hazarajat and Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=laG03iJF7t8C&amp;dq=The+Fragmentation+of+Afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=K3w1Tpu-KMGk8QPDqIChDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA Barnett Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, New Haven, 2002, p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt; As the Afghan state weakened, uprisings broke out in the Hazarajat, freeing the region from state rule by the summer of 1979 for the first time since the death of Amir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]. Under the inspiration of the [[Iranian Revolution]], various Hazara-Shiʿi resistance groups were formed in [[Iran]], including [[Al-Nasr (Afghanistan)|Nasr]] and Sipah-i Pasdaran, with some being "committed to the idea of a separate Hazara national identity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=laG03iJF7t8C&amp;dq=The+Fragmentation+of+Afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=K3w1Tpu-KMGk8QPDqIChDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA Barnett Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, New Haven, 2002. pp. 186, 191, 223]&lt;/ref&gt; During the war with the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], most of the Hazarajat was unoccupied and free of Soviet or state presence. The region became ruled once again by local leaders, or mirs, and a new stratum of young radical Shiʿi commanders. Economic conditions are reported to have improved in the Hazarajat during the war, when [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] ''Kuchis'' stopped grazing their flocks in Hazara pastures and fields.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=laG03iJF7t8C&amp;dq=The+Fragmentation+of+Afghanistan&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=K3w1Tpu-KMGk8QPDqIChDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA Barnett Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, New Haven, 2002, p. 246]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group ruling Hazarajat was the [[Revolutionary Council of Islamic Unity of Afghanistan]] or ''Shura-i Ettefaq'', led by [[Sayyid Ali Beheshti]], who created a ''[[de facto]]'' [[proto-state]]. The region's geographic nature and un-strategic location meant that the government and Soviets ignored it as they fought rebels elsewhere. This effectively allowed the Shura-i Ettefaq administration to rule over the region and give autonomy to the Hazaras. Their politically opposing groups were the pro-Iran ''Nasr'' and the ''Khans'', who were mostly educated, secular and left-wing.&lt;ref&gt;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.604.3516&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Nation, Ethnicity and the Conflict in Afghanistan: Political Islam and the rise of ethno-politics 1992–1996'' by Raghav Sharma, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shura wanted a return to the 19th century status quo whiereas the Nasr wanted an Iranian-style government of clerics. Between 1982 and 1984, an internal civil war caused the Shura to be overthrown by the ''Sazman-i Nasr'' and ''Sepah-i Pasdaran'' groups, which were backed by [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] of Iran in his efforts for (Shia) Iranian influence in Afghanistan. However inter-factional rivalry continued thereafter. Most of the Hazara groups united in 1987 and in 1989 formed the ''[[Hizb-i-Wahdat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Nation, Ethnicity and the Conflict in Afghanistan: Political Islam and the rise of ethno-politics 1992–1996'' by Raghav Sharma, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rule of [[Taliban]], once again, ethnic and sectarian violence struck Hazarajat. In 1997, a revolt broke out among Hazara people in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] when refused to be disarmed by Taliban; 600 Taliban were killed in subsequent fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil, and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, London and New Haven, 2000, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, the genocidal policies of Amir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]'s era was adopted by Taliban. In 1998, six thousand Hazaras were killed in the north; the intention was ethnic cleansing of Hazara.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil, and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, London and New Haven, 2000, pp. 67–74&lt;/ref&gt; At that stage, Hazarajat did not exist as an official region; the area was divided between the administrative provinces of Bamyan, Ghor, Wardak, Ghazni, Oruzgan, Juzjan, and Samangan, with the Hazaras being a minority in each.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Afghanistan is a [[multiethnic society]] with a variety of [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups. Because of poor census exact figures about the size and composition of ethnic groups are not available. According to the 2015 estimation, [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] is the largest ethnic group at 38% of the total population of the country followed by  [[Tajik people|Tajik]] at 25%, [[Hazara people|Hazara]] at 19%, [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] at 8%, [[Aimaq people|Aimaq]] at 4%, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] at 3%, [[Baloch people|Baloch]] at 4%, and other groups that make up 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/CFC_Afg_Monthly_Ethnic_Groups_Aug2011%20v1.pdf |title=Afghanistan|accessdate=2011-08 |work=[[Civil Military Fusion Centre]] |publisher=[[Wiebke Lamer and Erin Foster]] (US Department of State)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Afghan National Anthem]] mentions 14 different ethnic groups.

A research poll was conducted in Afghanistan in 2009, where 72% of the population labeled their identity as Afghan despite of being from different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="ABCBBCARD"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1083a1Afghanistan2009.pdf ABC NEWS/BBC/ARD POLL – AFGHANISTAN: WHERE THINGS STAND], February 9th, 2009, p. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Further|Languages of Afghanistan}}
The history of the language in Hazarajat has been an issue of debate. In the 16th century, when [[Babur]] came to Afghanistan, some Hazara spoke [[Mongolian language]], writers like Bacon&lt;ref&gt;Bacon E: The Hazara Mongols of Afghanistan: A study in social organization, PhD Dissertation, [[University of California]], 1951, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and Schumann&lt;ref&gt;H.F. Schurmann: The Mongols of Afghanistan: an ethnography of the Mongols and related people of Afghanistan, University of California 1962, page 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; believed the original language of Hazara people was Persian. According to Dulling, on the other hand, the Hazaras' language was a mixture of Persian and Hindi, in which Persian took over Hindi in Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Dulling G. K.: The Hazaragi Dialect of Afghan Persian, Central Asian Research Center, London 1973, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, Hazaragi, a distinct Persian dialect, began to emerge among the people of Hazarajat. It remains uncertain when Mongolian died out as a living language. Dulling writes, "they ceased to be Mongol speakers by the end of the 18th century at the latest, and were then speaking [[Tajik language|Tajik]] of a sort".&lt;ref&gt;Dulling G.K. ''The Hazaragi Dialect of Afghan Persian''. London, Central Asian Research Center 1973:13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]] is the official language in Hazarajat.

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
'''Herodian''' or '''Herodianus''' ({{lang-el|Ἡρωδιανός}}) of [[Roman Syria|Syria]], sometimes referred to as "'''Herodian of Antioch'''" (c. 170 – c. 240), was a minor Roman civil servant who wrote a colourful history in Greek titled ''History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus'' (τῆς μετὰ Μάρκον βασιλείας ἱστορία) in eight books covering the years 180 to 238. His work is not entirely reliable although his relatively unbiased account of [[Elagabalus]] is more useful than that of [[Cassius Dio]]. He was a Greek (perhaps from Antioch) who appears to have lived for a considerable period of time in Rome, but possibly without holding any public office. From his extant work, we gather that he was still living at an advanced age during the reign of [[Gordianus III]], who ascended the throne in 238. Beyond this, nothing is known of his life.

Herodian writes (i.1.§ 3, ii.15.§ 7) that the events described in his history occurred during his lifetime. [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (Codex 99) gives an outline of the contents of this work and passes a flattering [[encomium]] on the style of Herodian, which he describes as clear, vigorous, agreeable, and preserving a happy medium between an utter disregard of art and elegance and a profuse employment of the artifices and prettinesses which were known under the name of [[Atticism]], as well as between boldness and bombast. He appears to have used [[Thucydides]] as a model to some extent, both for style and for the general composition of his work, often introducing speeches wholly or in part imaginary. In spite of occasional inaccuracies in chronology and geography, his narrative is in the main truthful and impartial{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. However, some{{Who|date=August 2015}} charge him with showing too great a partiality for [[Pertinax]].

==Birth, life, and death==
The dates of the birth and death of Herodian are unknown. All available information concerning his life is derived from what he himself wrote, so the evidence is scarce. One can assume that he must have reached the age of ten by the year 180 due to the attentive detail in his descriptions of the events of that time. One notion is that Herodian must have finished writing around 240, which would have made him about 70. He mentions, “My aim is to write a systematic account of the events within a period of seventy years, covering the reigns of several [[Roman Emperor|emperors]], of which I have personal experience.” (2.15.7) This reaffirms the notion that Herodian was about 70 years of age when this was written and that the actions did indeed occur during his lifetime. However, it is possible that his history was composed at a later date. Herodian’s descriptions of Gordian III are less than flattering, and it is doubtful that he released such a negative review of a current emperor. Following this logic, his history was finished in 244 at the earliest, when Gordian III died. In his first and third books, Herodian mentions the games of [[Commodus]] in 192, and the [[Secular Games]] of [[Septimius Severus]] in 204. If Herodian did attend the games of Commodus, he must have been at least 14 at the time, which is to say that he was born in 178 at the latest.

The nationality of Herodian is also unclear. He was not from [[Italy]], for he says the [[Alps]] were bigger than anything “in our part of the world.” (2.11.8) It has been suggested that Herodian was from [[Alexandria]] since he placed such a large emphasis on [[Caracalla|Caracalla's]] massacre of this city and its inhabitants. It is also believed that he could have possibly been an eyewitness to these attacks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Herodian does refer to Alexandria as the second city of the [[Roman Empire|empire]]; however, this may be disregarded since he also applies the same title to [[Antioch]] and [[Carthage]]. It has been proposed that the Herodian was the son of [[Aelius Herodianus]], an Alexandrian grammarian. Although this does fit chronologically, there is no other evidence to support it. The popular speculation, however, is that Herodian was from Antioch. Herodian describes the character of the Syrians as quick-witted and mentions them twice more. However, there are also gaps in Herodian's knowledge of Syrian affairs which lead one to believe that he might not have been from the region at all. For example, he confuses two [[Parthia]]n kings, and his chronology and geography of the Parthian campaign in 197–198 are deeply flawed. These flaws could be mended due to a lack of knowledge of a small part of the empire; however, one would assume that an inhabitant of Syria would have had access to this knowledge. In short, unless an inscription is discovered, Herodian’s place of birth will never be known for certain.

==Occupation and social status==
Neither the occupation nor the social status of Herodian is known. Herodian mentions, “I have written a history of the events following the death of [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] which I saw and heard in my lifetime. I had a personal share in some of these events during my imperial and public service.” (1.2.5) It has been suggested that Herodian was a senator due to his knowledge of the ''senatus consultum tacitum'', which was a secret declaration by the [[Roman Senate|senate]] when they chose the emperors [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]]. However, it is also stated that news of this was leaked by some senators, and it certainly would not have remained a secret for the entirety of Herodian’s lifetime. It is possible, however, that Herodian was a freedman. This fits the profile perfectly, for he would not have cared for the larger political issues, and instead, would have concentrated on personalities and intricacies. Still yet, Herodian could have been an ''apparitor'', a scribe or an attendant to the emperor. This would be suiting, for he would have had access to senatorial documents, traveled extensively, and been knowledgeable in the field of fiscal affairs, which Herodian repetitively stressed in his history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bartolomeo Borghesi]] suggested that [http://www.edr-edr.it/edr_programmi/res_complex_comune.php?do=book&amp;id_nr=EDR137870&amp;partId=1 CIL 10, 7286], for a [[Legatus_Augusti_pro_praetore|legate]] of Sicily, may be in his honour See [https://archive.org/stream/inscriptioneslat01dessuoft#page/574/mode/2up ''ILS'' 2938].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Herodian's ''Roman History'' is a collection of eight books covering the period from the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 A.D. to the beginning of Gordian III's reign in 238. It provides a first person account of one of the most politically diverse times of the Roman Empire. The first book describes the reign of Commodus from 180 to 192, and the second discusses the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] in 193. Book Three encompasses the reign of Septimius Severus from 193 to 211, while the fourth discusses the reign of Caracalla from 211 to 217. Book five is about the reign of Elagabalus from 218 through 222, and book six deals with the reign of [[Severus Alexander]] from 222 to 235. The seventh book recounts the reign of [[Maximinus Thrax]] from 235 to 238, and the final one describes the [[Year of the Six Emperors]] in 238. Most likely, Herodian is writing for an eastern audience, for he often explains different Roman customs and beliefs that would have seemed foreign to Easterners.

Herodian has been both praised and criticized by scholars. The first person on record to review Herodian is the ninth-century [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. Of Herodian, Photius wrote “he neither exaggerates with hyperbole nor omits anything essential; in short, in all the virtues of historiography there are few men who are his superior.” [[Zosimus]] used him as a source as did [[John of Antioch]] when writing his ''World Chronicle''. An English translator of the ''Roman History'' wrote in 1705 that Herodian "still preserves a Majesty suitable to the Greatness of the Subject which he treats, and has something in him so pleasing and comely, as perhaps all the Art and Labour of other Men can never reach.” Altheim commended Herodian’s wide vision of the period, and [[Friedrich August Wolf|F.A. Wolf]] acclaimed Herodian’s lack of bias and superstition. However, not all views of Herodian are positive. For example, Wolf also charged Herodian with a deficiency in critical faculty. While the author of the [[Historia Augusta]] drew from Herodian, he also censured him for bias, and Herodian was by no means Zosimus’ first choice. Similarly, [[Joannes Zonaras]] only utilized Herodian where Cassius Dio’s history leaves off.

Herodian has long been criticized for a lack of historical accuracy, but recent studies have tended to side with him, legitimizing his historical facts{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. In the second book, Herodian states that his intention was to “narrate only the most important and conclusive…actions separately and in chronological order.” (2.15.7) Because of this, Herodian sometimes consolidates a large number of events into a single reference or two. For example, all of Caracalla’s campaign in the north during 213 through 214 is condensed into two short allusions. Similarly, a single reference to a winter in [[Sirmium]] sums up Maximinus’ battles on the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] in 236 through 238. Herodian also occasionally falls short in his descriptions of geography. He confuses Arabia Scenite with Arabia Felix and claims that [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] was where the final battle and capture of [[Darius III]] took place.

In regards to Cassius Dio, both he and Herodian admittedly make many errors in their histories. Dio is credited as the expert when it comes to the senate; however, Herodian challenges Dio on his description of the people's reaction to the proclamation of Septimius Severus as their new emperor. Dio's work is not always the more accurate of the two and must not be immediately chosen over Herodian’s.

{{Irreligion sidebar|atheism}}
[[Atheism]] (derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]] ''atheos'' meaning "without gods; godless; secular; denying or disdaining the gods, especially officially sanctioned gods"&lt;ref&gt;Modern translations of classical texts sometimes translate ''atheos'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also ''atheotēs'' ("atheism").&lt;/ref&gt;) is the absence or rejection of the belief that [[Deity|deities]] exist. The English term was used at least as early as the sixteenth century and atheistic ideas and their influence have a longer history. Over the centuries, atheists have supported their lack of belief in gods through a variety of avenues, including scientific, philosophical, and ideological notions.

In the East, a contemplative life not centered on the idea of deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and various [[atheism in Hinduism|sects]] of [[Hinduism]] in India, and of [[Taoism]] in China. Within the [[astika]] ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Samkhya]] and the early [[Mimamsa]] school did not accept a [[creator deity]] in their respective systems. The [[Vedas]] of [[Ceylon]] admitted only the possibility that deities might exist but went no further. Neither prayers nor sacrifices were suggested in any way by the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/storyofcivilizat035369mbp/storyofcivilizat035369mbp_djvu.txt The Story of Civilization]; [[Will Durant]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical atheist thought began to appear in Europe and Asia in the sixth or fifth century BCE. [[Will Durant]], in his ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', explained that certain [[pygmy]] tribes found in Africa were observed to have no identifiable cults or rites. There were no totems, no deities, and no spirits. Their dead were buried without special ceremonies or accompanying items and received no further attention. They even appeared to lack simple superstitions, according to travelers' reports.

==Indian philosophy==
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
In the East, a contemplative life not centered on the idea of deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and  [[atheism in Hinduism|various sects]] of [[Hinduism]] in India, and of [[Taoism]] in China.  These religions offered a philosophic and salvific path not involving deity worship. Deities are not seen as necessary to the salvific goal of the early Buddhist tradition, their reality is explicitly questioned and often rejected. There is a fundamental incompatibility between the notion of gods and basic Buddhist principles, at least in some interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha068.htm|website=budsas|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[astika]] ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Samkhya]] and the early [[Mimamsa]] school did not accept a creator-deity in their respective systems.

The principal text of the [[Samkhya]] school, the ''[[Samkhya Karika]]'', was written by [[Ishvara Krishna]] in the fourth century CE, by which time it was already a dominant Hindu school. The origins of the school are much older and are lost in legend. The school was both dualistic and atheistic. They believed in a dual existence of [[Prakriti]] ("nature") and [[Purusha]] ("spirit") and had no place for an [[Ishvara]] ("God") in its system, arguing that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. The school dominated Hindu philosophy in its day, but declined after the tenth century, although commentaries were still being written as late as the sixteenth century.

The foundational text for the Mimamsa school is the ''[[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]]'' of [[Jaimini]] (c. third to first century BCE). The school reached its height c. 700 CE, and for some time in the [[Early Middle Ages]] exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought. The Mimamsa school saw their primary enquiry was into the nature of [[dharma]] based on close interpretation of the [[Vedas]]. Its core tenets were [[ritual]]ism ([[orthopraxy]]), antiasceticism and antimysticism. The early Mimamsakas believed in an ''[[adrishta]]'' ("unseen") that is the result of performing [[karmas]] ("works") and saw no need for an [[Ishvara]] ("God") in their system. Mimamsa persists in some subschools of Hinduism today.

===Cārvāka===
The thoroughly [[Materialism|materialistic]] and antireligious philosophical [[Cārvāka]] school that originated in [[India]] with the [[Bārhaspatya-sūtras]] (final centuries BCE) is probably the most explicitly atheist school of philosophy in the region. The school grew out of the generic skepticism in the [[Mauryan period]]. Already in the sixth century BCE, [[Ajita Kesakambalin]], was quoted in Pali scriptures by the Buddhists with whom he was debating, teaching that "with the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cārvākan philosophy is now known principally from its [[Astika]] and [[Buddhist]] opponents. The proper aim of a Cārvākan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world. The ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' of [[Jayarashi Bhatta]] (c. 8th century) is sometimes cited as a surviving Carvaka text. The school appears to have died out sometime around the fifteenth century.

===Buddhism===
{{Main|God in Buddhism|Buddhist cosmology}}
The nonadherence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Tittha Sutta: Sectarians|year=1997|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html |authorlink=Anguttara Nikaya, 3.61|language=English|quote=Then in that case, a person is a killer of living beings because of a supreme being's act of creation... When one falls back on lack of cause and lack of condition as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't pin down as a truth or reality what should &amp; shouldn't be done, one dwells bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the notion of a [[God|supreme deity]] or a [[Primum movens|prime mover]] is seen by many as a key distinction between [[Buddhism]] and other religions. While Buddhist traditions do not deny the existence of supernatural beings (many are discussed in [[Buddhist scripture]]), it does not ascribe powers, in the typical Western sense, for creation, salvation or judgement, to the "gods", however, praying to enlightened deities is sometimes seen as leading to some degree of spiritual merit.

Buddhists accept the existence of beings in higher realms, known as [[Deva (Buddhism)|''devas'']], but they, like humans, are said to be suffering in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thirty-one planes of Existence|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=26 May 2010|author=John T Bullitt|year=2005|quote=The suttas describe thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during this long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily dark, grim, and painful hell realms all the way up to the most sublime, refined, and exquisitely blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is impermanent; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to both their past kamma and their kamma at the moment of death. When the kammic force that propelled them to that realm is finally exhausted, they pass away, taking rebirth once again elsewhere according to their kamma. And so the wearisome cycle continues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not particularly wiser than we are. In fact the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the deities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teacher of the Devas |year=1997 |publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html |author=Susan Elbaum Jootla |editor=Access To Insight |location=Kandy, Sri Lanka |chapter=II.

In point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periods.", "His proof included the fact that "many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama" (MN 95.9). Devas, like humans, develop faith in the Buddha by practicing his teachings.", "A second deva concerned with liberation spoke a verse which is partly praise of the Buddha and partly a request for teaching. Using various similes from the animal world, this god showed his admiration and reverence for the Exalted One.", "A discourse called Sakka's Questions (DN 21) took place after he had been a serious disciple of the Buddha for some time. The sutta records a long audience he had with the Blessed One which culminated in his attainment of stream-entry. Their conversation is an excellent example of the Buddha as "teacher of devas," and shows all beings how to work for Nibbana." |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204142247/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Kevaddha Sutta|year=1997|publisher=Access To Insight|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#bigbrahma|authorlink=Digha Nikaya, 11|quote=When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be... That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However, he answers it, you should take it to heart.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this they do have some enlightened Devas in the path of buddhahood.

===Jainism===
{{See also|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jains see their tradition as eternal. Organized [[Jainism]] can be dated back to [[Parshva]] who lived in the ninth century BCE, and, more reliably, to [[Mahavira]], a teacher of the sixth century BCE, and a contemporary of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Jainism is a dualistic religion with the [[universe]] made up of [[matter]] and [[souls]]. The universe, and the matter and souls within it, is eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent creator deity in Jainism. There are, however, "gods" and other spirits who exist within the universe and Jains believe that the soul can attain "godhood"; however, none of these supernatural beings exercise any sort of creative activity or have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.

==Classical Greece and Rome==
[[File:socrates.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Socrates]]]]
In Western [[classical Antiquity]], theism was the fundamental belief that supported the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state (the ''[[polis]]'', later the [[Roman Empire]]). Historically, any person who did not believe in any deity supported by the state was fair game to accusations of atheism, a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]]. For political reasons, [[Socrates]] in Athens (399 BCE) was accused of being ''atheos'' ("refusing to acknowledge the gods recognized by the state").&lt;ref&gt;Tim Whitmarsh, ''Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World''. New York 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in Rome were also considered subversive to the state religion and persecuted as atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pablo|first=Martin|title=Remaining Catholic: Six Good Reasons for Staying in an Imperfect Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1IL-xz8VrwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Christians+in+Rome+were+also+considered+subversive+to+the+state+religion+and+persecuted+as+atheists&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JdWKIatguj&amp;sig=sS6MJUymBI5ogayP5fsEdNDAN6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1o_U6vDD_bLsQT38oLABQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christians%20in%20Rome%20were%20also%20considered%20subversive%20to%20the%20state%20religion%20and%20persecuted%20as%20atheists&amp;f=false|work=p. 41|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, charges of atheism, meaning the subversion of religion, were often used similarly to charges of [[heresy]] and [[impiety]] as a political tool to eliminate enemies.

===Presocratic philosophy===
The roots of [[Western philosophy]] began in the Greek world in the sixth century BCE. The first Hellenic philosophers were not atheists, but they attempted to explain the world in terms of the processes of nature instead of by mythological accounts. Thus [[lightning]] was the result of "wind breaking out and parting the clouds",&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaximander]], ap. [[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''Refutation of all Heresies'', i. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and earthquakes occurred when "the earth is considerably altered by heating and cooling".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], ap. Hippolytus, ''Refutation of all Heresies'', i. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The early philosophers often criticized traditional religious notions. [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BCE) famously said that if cows and horses had hands, "then horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, and cows like cows".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Stromata'', v. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Anaxagoras]] (5th century BCE), claimed that the [[Sun]] was "a fiery mass, larger than the [[Peloponnese]]"; a charge of impiety was brought against him, and he was forced to flee [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ii. 6–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fully materialistic philosophy was produced by the [[Atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] (5th century BCE), who attempted to explain the formation and development of the world in terms of the chance movements of [[atom]]s moving in infinite space.

[[Euripides]] (480–406 BCE), in his play [[Bellerophon (play)|''Bellerophon'']], had the eponymous main character say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Doth some one say that there be gods above?&lt;br&gt;
There are not; no, there are not. Let no fool,&lt;br&gt;
Led by the old false fable, thus deceive you.”&lt;ref&gt;

===The Sophists===
In the fifth century BCE the [[Sophists]] began to question many of the traditional assumptions of Greek culture. [[Prodicus of Ceos]] was said to have believed that "it was the things which were serviceable to human life that had been regarded as gods",&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Protagoras]] stated at the beginning of a book that "With regard to the gods I am unable to say either that they exist or do not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late fifth century BCE, the Greek [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] [[Diagoras of Melos]] was sentenced to death in [[Athens]] under the charge of being a "godless person" (ἄθεος) after he made fun of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]],&lt;ref name="Garland2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winiarczyk|first1=Marek|title=Diagoras of Melos: A Contribution to the History of Ancient Atheism|date=2016|translator-last=Zbirohowski-Kościa|translator-first=Witold|publisher=Walther de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=978-3-11-044765-1|pages=61–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NryvDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Diagoras+of+Melos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwianNXO5c7YAhVM4oMKHfPAA2IQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Diagoras%20of%20Melos&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|date=1985|title=Greek Religion|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-36281-0|pages=311–317|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''[[Homo necans]]'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; but he fled the city to escape punishment.&lt;ref name="Garland2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"/&gt; Later writers have cited Diagoras as the "first atheist",&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen|Solmsen, Friedrich]] (1942).

Comments and English text by Richard D. McKirahan. Thomas Library, Bryn Mawr College, 1997, page 3. {{ISBN|0-929524-89-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was probably not an atheist in the modern sense of the word.&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt; Somewhat later (c. 300 BCE), the [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] is supposed to have denied that gods exist and wrote a book ''On the Gods'' expounding his views.

[[Euhemerus]] (c. 330–260 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors, and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of Euhemerus' work in Ennius' Latin translation have been preserved in [[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writings (e.g. by [[Lactantius]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]), which all rely on earlier fragments in [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] 5,41–46 &amp; 6.1. Testimonies, especially in the context of polemical criticism, are found e.g. in [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Zeus'' 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Euhemerus was later criticized for having "spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods",&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia – Isis and Osiris'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/B.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt; his worldview was not atheist in a strict and theoretical sense, because he differentiated that the [[Greek primordial gods|primordial deities]] were "eternal and imperishable".&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_02_book2.htm II.45–48] (chapter 2); Euhemerus also acknowledged that the sun, moon, and the other celestial bodies were deities (cf. also Alan Scott, ''Origen and the Life of the Stars'', Oxford 1991, p. 55), and he regarded elemental earthly phenomena such as the wind as divine, for they had "eternal origin and eternal continuance". Nevertheless he concluded that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and all next-generation deities such as the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] existed only as culturally and religiously constructed divine entities with a human past (cp. also Harry Y. Gamble, "Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: 'Contra Celsum' III 22–43", in ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (1979), pp. 12–29).&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have argued that he merely aimed at reinventing the old religions in the light of the beginning of deification of political rulers such as [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemeros", in Konrat Ziegler &amp; Walther Sontheimer, ''Der Kleine Pauly'', Bd. 2 (1979), cols. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus' work was translated into Latin by [[Ennius]], possibly to [[Mythography|mythographically]] pave the way for the planned [[Apotheosis|divinization]] of [[Scipio Africanus]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Cole, "Cicero, Ennius and the Concept of Apotheosis at Rome". In ''Arethusa'' Vol. 39 No. 3 (2006), pp. 531–548&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epicureanism===
The most important Greek thinker in the development of atheism was [[Epicurus]] ({{circa}} 300 BCE).&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt; Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention (see [[scientific determinism]]).&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ |title=Epicurus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |work=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Epicurus still maintained that the gods existed,&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs.&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; The aim of the Epicureans was to attain ''[[ataraxia]]'' ("peace of mind") and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational. The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death.&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt;

One of the most eloquent expressions of Epicurean thought is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' (1st century BCE) in which he held that gods exist but argued that religious fear was one the chief cause of human unhappiness and that the gods did not involve themselves in the world.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC: Ancient atheists|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/history/ancient.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long and Sedley|first=A.A. and D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers, vol.1|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521275563|pages=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and hence dismissed the fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]] (100–44 BCE), who leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, also rejected the idea of an afterlife, which e.g. lead to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] (cf. [[Sallust]], ''The War With Catiline'', Caesar's speech: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#51.20 51.29] &amp; Cato's reply: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#52.13 52.13]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Epicureans were not persecuted, but their teachings were controversial and were harshly attacked by the mainstream schools of [[Stoicism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The movement remained marginal, and gradually died out by the end of the [[Roman Empire]].

==The Middle Ages==
===Islamic world===
In medieval [[Islam]], Muslim scholars recognized the idea of atheism and frequently attacked [[kafir|unbelievers]], although they were unable to name any atheists.&lt;ref&gt;"Various Muslim theologians in the early Abbasid periods wrote treatises 'Against the Unbelievers,' ... the earliest extant work bearing this title is probably the ''Radd ala al-mulhid'' of the ninth-century [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] theologian al-Qasim b. Ibrahim. ... Nevertheless, in the discussions of God's existence the actual opponents are not identified as individuals. As a group they are sometimes referred to as heretics, unbelievers, materialists, or skeptics. These designations often appear together, and they do not always seem to be clearly distinguished in the authors' mind." Sarah Stroumsa, (1999), ''Freethinkers of medieval Islam: Ibn al-Rawandi, Abu Bakr al-Razi and their Impact on Islamic Thought'', pages 121–3. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals were accused of atheism, they were usually viewed as heretics rather than proponents of atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Stroumsa, 1999, ''Freethinkers of Medieval Islam: Ibn al-Rdwandi, Abu Bakr al-Razi, and their Impact on Islamic Thought'', page 123. BRILL.&lt;/ref&gt; However, outspoken rationalists and atheists existed, one notable figure being the ninth-century scholar [[Ibn al-Rawandi]], who criticized the notion of religious [[prophecy]], including that of [[Muhammad]], and maintained that religious dogmas were not acceptable to reason and must be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1971, Volume 3, page 905.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics of religion in the Islamic world include the physician and philosopher [[Abu Bakr al-Razi]] (865–925), the poet [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1057), and the scholar [[Abu Isa al-Warraq]] (fl. 9th century). Al-Maʿarri, for example, wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In the European [[Middle Ages]], no clear expression of atheism is known. The titular character of the [[Icelandic saga]] [[Hrafnkell]], written in the late thirteenth century, says, "I think it is folly to have faith in gods". After his temple to [[Freyr]] is burnt and he is enslaved, he vows never to perform another [[Blót|sacrifice]], a position described in the sagas as ''goðlauss'', "godless". [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'' observes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is remarkable that Old Norse legend occasionally mentions certain men who, turning away in utter disgust and doubt from the heathen faith, placed their reliance on their own strength and virtue. Thus in the [[Sôlar lioð]] 17 we read of Vêbogi and Râdey ''â sik þau trûðu,'' "in themselves they trusted",&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Grimm, 1882, ''Teutonic Mythology'' Part 1, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
citing several other examples, including two kings.

In Christian Europe, people were persecuted for heresy, especially in countries where the [[Inquisition]] was active. Prominent examples of dissent included the Cathers and the Waldensians. These sects, however antagonistic to the Church, are not examples of Atheism. While rebellions against the Church occurred, none could be considered exactly Atheist.&lt;ref&gt;John Arnold, ''Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon in the Middle Ages was proofs of the existence of God. Both [[Anselm of Canterbury]], and later, [[William of Ockham]] acknowledge adversaries who doubt the existence of God. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' five proofs of God's existence and Anselm's ontological argument implicitly acknowledged the validity of the question about God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bullivant, Stephen, and Michael Ruse. The Oxford Handbook of Atheism. Oxford University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Copleston]], however, explains that Thomas laid out his proofs not to counter atheism, but to address certain early Christian writers such as [[John of Damascus]], who asserted that knowledge of God's existence was naturally innate in man, based on his natural desire for happiness.&lt;ref name="copleston337"&gt;Frederick Copleston. 1950. ''A History of Philosophy: Volume II: Medieval Philosophy: From Augustine to Duns Scotus.'' London: Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne. pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas stated that although there is desire for happiness which forms the basis for a proof of God's existence in man, further reflection is required to understand that this desire is only fulfilled in God, not for example in wealth or sensual pleasure.&lt;ref name="copleston337"/&gt;

The charge of atheism was used to attack political or religious opponents. [[Pope Boniface VIII]], because he insisted on the political supremacy of the church, was accused by his enemies after his death of holding (unlikely) positions such as "neither believing in the immortality nor incorruptibility of the soul, nor in a life to come".&lt;ref&gt;John William Draper, 1864, [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/D/draper/drap3.htm ''History of the intellectual development of Europe''], page 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Arnold's ''Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe'' discusses individuals who were indifferent to the Church and did not participate in faith practices. Arnold notes that while these examples could be perceived as simply people being lazy, it demonstrates that "belief was not universally fervent". Arnold enumerates examples of people not attending church, and even those who excluded the Church from their marriage. Disbelief, Arnold argues, stemmed from boredom. Arnold argues that while some blasphemy implies the existence of God, laws demonstrate that there were also cases of blasphemy that directly attacked articles of faith. Italian preachers in the fourteenth century also warned of unbelievers and people who lacked belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Arnold|title=Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0340807866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Reformation==
During the time of the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], criticism of the religious establishment became more frequent in predominantly Christian countries, but did not amount to atheism, ''per se''.

The term ''athéisme'' was coined in France in the sixteenth century. The word "atheist" appears in English books at least as early as 1566.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contribution=English recusant literature, 1558–1640 |volume=203 |title=A Replie to Mr Calfhills Blasphemous Answer Made Against the Treatise of the Cross |page=51 |first=John |last=Martiall |authorlink=John Marshall (priest) |year=1566 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20snAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22to%20entre#v=snippet&amp;q=atheist&amp;f=false
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of atheism re-emerged initially as a reaction to the intellectual and religious turmoil of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the Reformation, as a charge used by those who saw the denial of god and godlessness in the controversial positions being put forward by others. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was used exclusively as an insult; nobody wanted to be regarded as an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen | authorlink = Karen Armstrong |title=A History of God |page=288 |year=1999 |publisher=London: Vintage |isbn=0-09-927367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although one overtly atheistic compendium known as the ''[[Theophrastus redivivus]]'' was published by an anonymous author in the seventeenth century, atheism was an epithet implying a [[Libertine|lack of moral restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Jennifer Michael (2004). ''Doubt: A History''. HarperOne. pp. 325, {{ISBN|0-06-009795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|The Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] contended in the 17th century that God did not interfere in the running of the world, but rather that natural laws explained the workings of the universe.]]

According to [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the Reformation in Europe had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches". [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia and England, and proffered belief in a noninterventionist deity, but "while some deists were atheists in disguise, most were religious, and by today's standards would be called true believers". The scientific and mathematical discoveries of such as Copernicus, Newton and Descartes sketched a pattern of natural laws that lent weight to this new outlook&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388&lt;/ref&gt; Blainey wrote that the Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era". Spinoza had been expelled from his synagogue for his protests against the teachings of its rabbis and for failing to attend Saturday services. He believed that God did not interfere in the running of the world, but rather that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''[[Short Treatise on God]]'', but he was not a popular figure for the first century following his death: "An unbeliever was expected to be a rebel in almost everything and wicked in all his ways", wrote Blainey, "but here was a virtuous one. He lived the good life and made his living in a useful way. . . . It took courage to be a Spinoza or even one of his supporters. If a handful of scholars agreed with his writings, they did not so say in public".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

How dangerous it was to be accused of being an atheist at this time is illustrated by the examples of [[Étienne Dolet]], who was [[Strangling|strangled]] and burned in 1546, and [[Giulio Cesare Vanini]], who received a similar fate in 1619. In 1689 the Polish nobleman [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], who had denied the existence of God in his philosophical treatise ''De non-existentia Dei'', was imprisoned unlawfully; despite [[Warsaw Confederation]] tradition and king Sobieski's intercession, Łyszczyński was condemned to death for atheism and beheaded in [[Warsaw]] after his tongue was pulled out with a burning iron and his hands slowly burned. Similarly in 1766, the French nobleman [[François-Jean de la Barre]], was [[torture]]d, beheaded, and his body burned for alleged [[vandalism]] of a [[crucifix]], a case that became a [[cause célèbre]] because [[Voltaire]] tried unsuccessfully to have the judgment reversed.

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) was also accused of atheism, but he denied it. His theism was unusual, in that he held god to be material. Even earlier, the British playwright and poet [[Christopher Marlowe]] (1563–1593) was accused of atheism when a tract denying the divinity of Christ was found in his home. Before he could finish defending himself against the charge, Marlowe was murdered.

In early modern times, the first explicit atheist known by name was the German-languaged Danish critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] (1646–after 1674), who published three atheist writings in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], a Polish philosopher (executed in 1689, following a hasty and controversial trial) demonstrated strong atheism in his work ''De non-existentia Dei'':
{{Quote|II – the Man is a creator of God, and God is a concept and creation of a Man. Hence the people are architects and engineers of God and God is not a true being, but a being existing only within mind, being chimaeric by its nature, because a God and a chimaera are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Człowiek jest twórcą Boga, a Bóg jest tworem i dziełem człowieka. Tak więc to ludzie są twórcami i stwórcami Boga, a Bóg nie jest bytem rzeczywistym, lecz bytem istniejącym tylko w umyśle, a przy tym bytem chimerycznym, bo Bóg i chimera są tym samym.&lt;/ref&gt;
IV –  simple folk are cheated by the more cunning with the fabrication of God for their own oppression; whereas the same oppression is shielded by the folk in a way, that if the wise attempted to free them by the truth, they would be quelled by the very people.&lt;ref&gt;IV – Prosty lud oszukiwany jest przez mądrzejszych wymysłem wiary w Boga na swoje uciemiężenie; tego samego uciemiężenia broni jednak lud, w taki sposób, że gdyby mędrcy chcieli prawdą wyzwolić lud z tego uciemiężenia, zostaliby zdławieni przez sam lud.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Nowicki, 1957{{nonspecific|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Age of Enlightenment==
{{Main|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment}}

[[File:Temple of Reason Strasbourg 1793-1794.jpg|thumb|right|Notre Dame of [[Strasbourg]] turned into a Temple of Reason]]

While not gaining converts from large portions of the population, versions of deism became influential in certain intellectual circles. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] challenged the Christian notion that human beings had been tainted by sin since the Garden of Eden, and instead proposed that humans were originally good, only later to be corrupted by civilization. The influential figure of [[Voltaire]], spread deistic notions of to a wide audience. "After the French Revolution and its outbursts of atheism, Voltaire was widely condemned as one of the causes", wrote Blainey, "Nonetheless, his writings did concede that fear of God was an essential policeman in a disorderly world: 'If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him', wrote Voltaire".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.390–391&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the first book in modern times solely dedicated to promoting atheism was written by French Catholic priest [[Jean Meslier]] (1664–1729), whose posthumously published lengthy philosophical essay (part of the original title: ''Thoughts and Feelings of Jean Meslier ... Clear and Evident Demonstrations of the Vanity and Falsity of All the Religions of the World''&lt;ref&gt;Full title: ''Mémoire des pensées et sentiments de Jean Meslier, prêtre-curé d'Etrépigny et de Balaives, sur une partie des erreurs et des abus de la conduite et du gouvernement des hommes, où l'on voit des démonstrations claires et évidentes de la vanité et de la fausseté de toutes les religions du monde, pour être adressé à ses paroissiens après sa mort et pour leur servir de témoignage de vérité à eux et à tous leurs semblables''&lt;/ref&gt;)  rejects the concept of god (both in the Christian and also in the Deistic sense), the soul, miracles and the discipline of theology.&lt;ref name="onfray"&gt;Michel Onfray (2007). ''Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam''. Arcade Publishing. {{ISBN|1559708204}}. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] states that Meslier's work marks the beginning of "the history of true atheism".&lt;ref name="onfray"/&gt;

By the 1770s, atheism in some predominantly Christian countries was ceasing to be a dangerous accusation that required denial, and was evolving into a position openly avowed by some. The first open denial of the existence of God and avowal of atheism since classical times may be that of [[Baron d'Holbach]] (1723–1789) in his 1770 work, ''[[The System of Nature]]''. D'Holbach was a Parisian social figure who conducted a famous salon widely attended by many intellectual notables of the day, including [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

In Scotland, [[David Hume]] produced a six volume history of England in 1754, which gave little attention to God. He implied that if God existed he was impotent in the face of European upheaval. Hume ridiculed miracles, but walked a careful line so as to avoid being too dismissive of Christianity. With Hume's presence, Edinburgh gained a reputation as a "haven of atheism", alarming many ordinary Britons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.392&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''culte de la Raison'' developed during the uncertain period 1792–94 (Years I and III of the Revolution), following the [[September massacres]], when Revolutionary France was rife with fears of internal and foreign enemies. Several Parisian churches were transformed into Temples of Reason, notably the Church of Saint-Paul Saint-Louis in [[Le Marais|the Marais]]. The churches were closed in May 1793 and more securely 24 November 1793, when the [[Catholic Mass]] was forbidden.

Blainey wrote that "atheism seized the pedestal in revolutionary France in the 1790s. The secular symbols replaced the cross. In the cathedral of Notre Dame the altar, the holy place, was converted into a monument to Reason..." During the [[Reign of Terror|Terror of 1792–93]], France's Christian calendar was abolished, monasteries, convents and church properties were seized and monks and nuns expelled. Historic churches were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.397–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cult of Reason]] was a creed based on atheism devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]], and their supporters. It was stopped by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a [[Deist]], who instituted the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cults were the outcome of the [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|"de-Christianization" of French society]] during the Revolution and part of the [[Reign of Terror]].

The Cult of Reason was celebrated in a [[carnival]] atmosphere of parades, ransacking of churches, ceremonious [[iconoclasm]], in which religious and royal images were defaced, and ceremonies which substituted the "martyrs of the Revolution" for Christian martyrs. The earliest public demonstrations took place ''en province'', outside Paris, notably by [[Hébertists]] in [[Lyon]], but took a further radical turn with the ''Fête de la Liberté'' ("Festival of Liberty") at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], 10 November (20 Brumaire) 1793, in ceremonies devised and organised by [[Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette]].

The pamphlet ''Answer to [[Joseph Priestley|Dr. Priestley's]] Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever'' (1782) is considered to be the first published declaration of atheism in Britain—plausibly the first in English (as distinct from covert or cryptically atheist works). The otherwise unknown William Hammon (possibly a pseudonym) signed the preface and postscript as editor of the work, and the anonymous main text is attributed to [[Matthew Turner (physician)|Matthew Turner]] (d. 1788?), a Liverpool physician who may have known Priestley. Historian of atheism David Berman has argued strongly for Turner's authorship, but also suggested that there may have been two authors.&lt;ref&gt;see Berman 1988, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
===Nineteenth century===
The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 catapulted atheistic thought into political notability in some Western countries, and opened the way for the nineteenth century movements of [[Rationalism]], [[Freethought]], and Liberalism. Born in 1792, [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], a child of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], was expelled from England's Oxford University in 1811 for submitting to the Dean an anonymous pamphlet that he wrote entitled, ''[[The Necessity of Atheism]].'' This pamphlet is considered by scholars as the first atheistic tract published in the English language. An early atheistic influence in Germany was ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–1872). He influenced other German nineteenth century atheistic thinkers like [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860), and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900).

The freethinker [[Charles Bradlaugh]] (1833–1891) was repeatedly elected to the [[British Parliament]], but was not allowed to take his seat after his request to affirm rather than take the religious oath was turned down (he then offered to take the oath, but this too was denied him). After Bradlaugh was re-elected for the fourth time, a new Speaker allowed Bradlaugh to take the oath and permitted no objections.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Humanist Association]], [http://www.humanism.org.uk/humanism/humanist-tradition/freethinkers/charles-bradlaugh ''Charles Bradlaugh (1833–91)'']&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first outspoken atheist to sit in Parliament, where he participated in amending the [[Oaths Act 1888|Oaths Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]], ''Oaths Bill 1888'', [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1888/mar/14/second-reading ''Second Reading, 14 March 1888'']; [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1888/aug/09/third-reading ''Third Reading, 9 August 1888'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Karl Marx]]
In 1844, Karl Marx (1818–1883), an atheistic political economist, wrote in his ''Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right'': "Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]." Marx believed that people turn to religion in order to dull the pain caused by the reality of social situations; that is, Marx suggests religion is an attempt at transcending the material state of affairs in a society—the pain of class oppression—by effectively creating a dream world, rendering the religious believer amenable to [[social control]] and exploitation in this world while they hope for relief and justice in [[life after death]]. In the same essay, Marx states, "[m]an creates religion, religion does not create man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karl|first=Marx|authorlink=Karl Marx|date=February 1844|title=A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|journal=Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Friedrich Nietzsche]]
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a prominent nineteenth century philosopher, is well known for coining the aphorism ''"[[God is dead]]" ''(German: "''Gott ist tot''"); incidentally the phrase was not spoken by Nietzsche directly, but was used as a dialogue for the characters in his works. Nietzsche argued that Christian theism as a belief system had been a moral foundation of the Western world, and that the rejection and collapse of this foundation as a result of modern thinking (the ''death of God'') would naturally cause a rise in [[nihilism]] or the lack of values. While Nietzsche was staunchly atheistic, he was also concerned about the negative effects of nihilism on humanity. As such, he called for a re-evaluation of old values and a creation of new ones, hoping that in doing so humans would achieve a higher state he labeled the [[Übermensch|Overman]] (''Übermensch'').

[[Atheist feminism]] also began in the nineteenth century. Atheist feminists oppose religion as a main source of female [[oppression]] and [[gender inequality]], believing that the majority of religions are [[Sexism|sexist]] and oppressive to women.&lt;ref name="newstatesman1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/07/women-god-stangroom-benson |title=Does God Hate Women? |journal=New Statesman |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
Atheism in the twentieth century found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies in the Western tradition, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Peikoff]], "The Philosophy of Objectivism" lecture series (1976), [http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/atheism.html Lecture 2].&lt;/ref&gt; [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;Overall, Christine. "Feminism and Atheism", in Martin, Michael, ed. (2007), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, pp. 233–246. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]]. [[Neopositivism]] and [[analytical philosophy]] discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[H. L. Mencken]] sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, and the idea that science is a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. "Treatise on the Gods," 2nd ed., The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. The [[structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious, denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalists]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Zdybicka, Zofia J. (2005), "Atheism", p. 16 in Maryniarczyk, Andrzej, Universal Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 1, Polish Thomas Aquinas Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.C.C. (9 March 2004). "Atheism and Agnosticism". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved 2007-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that during the twentieth century, atheists in Western societies became more active and even militant, though they often "relied essentially on arguments used by numerous radical Christians since at least the eighteenth century". They rejected the idea of an interventionist God, and said that Christianity promoted war and violence, though "the most ruthless leaders in the Second World War were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both Judaism and Christianity" and "Later massive atrocities were committed in the East by those ardent atheists, [[Pol Pot]] and [[Mao Zedong]]". Some scientists were meanwhile articulating a view that as the world becomes more educated, religion will be superseded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.543&lt;/ref&gt;

===State atheism===
[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]] with [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1949. Both leaders repressed religion and established [[state atheism]] throughout their respective Communist spheres.]]
Often, the state's opposition to religion took more violent forms. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] documents widespread persecution, imprisonments and torture of believers in his seminal work ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]''. Consequently, religious organizations, such as the Catholic Church, were among the most stringent opponents of communist regimes. In some cases, the initial strict measures of control and opposition to religious activity were gradually relaxed in communist states. Pope [[Pius XI]] followed his encyclicals challenging the new right-wing creeds of [[Italian Fascism]] (''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]'', 1931) and [[Nazism]] (''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', 1937) with a denunciation of atheistic Communism in ''[[Divini redemptoris]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="EBOPiusXI"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: ''Pius XI''; web Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]], for centuries the strongest of all Orthodox Churches, was suppressed by the Soviet government.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.494&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Soviet regime arrested the [[Patriarch Tikhon|Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="Blainey"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''A Short History of Christianity''; Viking; 2011; p.493&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], with his rejection of religious authority as a tool of oppression and his strategy of "patently explain," Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] energetically pursued the persecution of the Church through the 1920s and 1930s. Lenin wrote that every religious idea and every idea of God "is unutterable vileness... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion of the most abominable kind".&lt;ref name="MartinAmis"&gt;Martin Amis; Koba the Dread; Vintage Books; London; 2003; {{ISBN|1400032202}}; p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Many priests were killed and imprisoned. Thousands of churches were closed, some turned into hospitals. In 1925 the government founded the [[League of Militant Atheists]] to intensify the persecution. The regime only relented in its persecution following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"/&gt; Bullock wrote that "A Marxist regime was 'godless' by definition, and Stalin had mocked religious belief since his days in the Tiflis seminary". His assault on the Russian peasantry, wrote Bullock, "had been as much an attack on their traditional religion as on their individual holdings, and the defense of it had played a major part in arousing peasant resistance . . . ".&lt;ref name="Stalin pp.412"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''; Fontana Press; 1993; pp.412&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Divini Redemptoris'', Pius XI said that atheistic Communism being led by Moscow was aimed at "upsetting the social order and at undermining the very foundations of Christian civilization":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19031937_divini-redemptoris_en.html Divini Redemptoris – Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Atheistic Communism]; by Pope Pius XI; 19 March 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

The central figure in Italian Fascism was the atheist [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name="Christianity pp.495-6"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; pp.495–6&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career, Mussolini was a strident opponent of the Church, and the first [[Fascist manifesto|Fascist program]], written in 1919, had called for the secularization of Church property in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Carsten; ''The Rise of Fascism''; Methuen &amp; Co Ltd; London; 1976; p.77&lt;/ref&gt; More pragmatic than his German ally Adolf Hitler, Mussolini later moderated his stance, and in office, permitted the teaching of religion in schools and came to terms with the Papacy in the [[Lateran Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Christianity pp.495-6"/&gt; Nevertheless, ''Non abbiamo bisogno'' condemned his Fascist movement's "pagan worship of the State" and "revolution which snatches the young from the Church and from Jesus Christ, and which inculcates in its own young people hatred, violence and irreverence."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: ''Fascism – identification with Christianity''; web Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Party membership was required for civil service jobs. The majority of Nazi Party members did not leave their churches. Evans wrote that, by 1939, 95 percent of Germans still called themselves Protestant or Catholic, while 3.5 percent were ''[[gottgläubig]]'' (lit. "believing in god") and 1.5 percent atheist. Most in these latter categories were "convinced Nazis who had left their Church at the behest of the Party, which had been trying since the mid 1930s to reduce the influence of Christianity in society".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J.

Across Eastern Europe following World War II, the parts of the [[Nazi Empire]] conquered by the Soviet [[Red Army]], and Yugoslavia became one party Communist states, which, like the Soviet Union, were antipathetic to religion. Persecutions of religious leaders followed.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p.566 &amp; 568&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union ended its truce against the Russian Orthodox Church, and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc: "In [[Polish anti-religious campaign|Poland]], Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists.

During this period, Christianity in the United States retained its popular appeal, and, wrote Blainey, the country "was the guardian, militarily of the "free world" and the defender of its religion in the face of militant communism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.509&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], wrote [[Thomas Aiello]] the United States often characterized its opponents as "godless communists", which tended to reinforce the view that atheists were unreliable and unpatriotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aiello|first=Thomas|date=Spring 2005|title=Constructing "Godless Communism": Religion, Politics, and Popular Culture, 1954–1960|journal=Americana: the Journal of American Popular Culture (1900 – present)|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.americanpopularculture.com/journal/articles/spring_2005/aiello.htm|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this background, the words "under God" were inserted into the [[pledge of allegiance]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broadway|first=Bill|date=6 July 2002|title=How 'Under God' Got in There|journal=[[Washington Post]]|pages=B09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the national motto was changed from [[E Pluribus Unum]] to [[In God We Trust]] in 1956.

[[File:Ariane Sherine and Richard Dawkins at the Atheist Bus Campaign launch.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Dawkins]] with [[Ariane Sherine]] at the [[Atheist Bus Campaign]] launch]]

[[Atheist feminism]] has also become more prominent in the 2010s. In 2012 the first "Women in Secularism" conference was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|title=Women in Secularism: 2012 conference in Washington, DC|work=Women in Secularism|accessdate=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730235818/http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|archive-date=30 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Secular Woman was founded on 28 June 2012 as the first national American organization focused on non-religious women. The mission of Secular Woman is to amplify the voice, presence, and influence of non-religious women. The [[Atheist feminism|atheist feminist movement]] has also become increasingly focused on fighting [[misogyny]], [[sexism]] and [[sexual harassment]] within the atheist movement itself, especially since the upheaval following [[Michael Shermer]]'s allegations of [[sexual assault]] and coverage of his violent behavior applied by [[James Randi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenheimer/will-misogyny-bring-down-the-atheist-movement|title=Will Misogyny Bring Down The Atheist Movement?|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|first=Mark|last=Oppenheimer|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the first atheist monument on American government property was unveiled at the [[Bradford County, Florida|Bradford County]] Courthouse in Florida; it is a 1,500-pound granite bench and [[plinth]] inscribed with quotes by [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_f9a8713c-e2cf-11e2-b9d8-001a4bcf887a.html|title=First atheist monument on government property unveiled|work=The Independent Florida Alligator|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/29/atheists-unveil-monument-in-florida-and-promise-to-build-50-more/|title=Atheists unveil monument in Florida and promise to build 50 more|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Madison, Wisconsin's common council amended their city's equal opportunity ordinance, adding atheism as a protected class in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Time for Kids |url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/madison-first-in-nation-to-pass-ordinance-protecting-atheists/32125682 |title=Madison first in nation to pass ordinance protecting atheists &amp;#124; News |publisher=Channel3000.com |date=1 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Madison the first city in America to pass an ordinance protecting atheists.&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;

On 16 December 2016, [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Frank R.

[[File:Budapest, Magyar Nemzeti Múzeum.jpg|thumb|Budapest, Hungarian National Museum]]

The '''Hungarian National Museum''' (Hungarian: ''Magyar Nemzeti Múzeum'') was founded in 1802 and is the national museum for the history, art and archaeology of Hungary, including areas not within Hungary's modern borders such as [[Transylvania]]; it is not to be confused with the collection of international art of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]].  The museum is in [[Budapest]] [[Erzsébetváros|VIII]] in a purpose-built [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] building from 1837–47 by the architect [[Mihály Pollack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== History==
[[File:Main stairs of the National Museum.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The main stairway]]
The Hungarian National Museum traces its foundation to 1802 when Count [[Ferenc Széchényi]] set up the National Széchényi Library.  This would then be followed a year later by the donating of a mineral collection by Széchényi's wife.  This led to the creation of the Hungarian National Museum as a general and natural history museum, and not only a library.  In 1807, the Hungarian National Parliament passed legislation on the new institution and asked the nation to help donate to the museum.

The Hungarian Parliament of 1832–1834 helped with the growth of the museum as well.  The parliament voted in favor of giving half a million forint to help with the construction of a new building for the museum. During this time the Hungarian National History Museum was officially set up under the Hungarian National Museum.  Later in 1846, the museum moved to its current location of VIII. Múzeum krt. 14–16.  Here the museum resides in a neo-classical style building designed by [[Mihály Pollack]].

In 1848 the Hungarian National Museum played a major role in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution]]. The Revolution was partially spurred by the reading of [[Sándor Petőfi]]'s [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] and the famous poem [[Nemzeti dal]] on the front steps of the museum.  This helped give the museum an identification as a major national identity for Hungary.  In remembrance of the revolution two statues were added to the museum.  The first is a statue of [[János Arany]] which was unveiled in 1883. Later in 1890 there was a statue next to the stairs of the museum of a memorial tablet to Sándor Petőfi. In addition during this time the Upper House of the parliament held its sessions in the Cereminial of the museum. This continued until the new [[Hungarian Parliament Building|house of Parliament]] was built. Today in remembrance festivities for National Commemorations Day of 1848 are held in front of the museum.  

In 1949, an act mandated that the ethnographic and natural history part of the Hungarian National Museum had to split off of the main museum, and are now the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] and Ethnographic Museum.  This also helped with the setting up of the modern day [[National Széchényi Library]].  All of these separate museums are still interconnected and other museums and monuments have become affiliated with them over time.  The most recent addition was the [[Esztergom castle|Castle Museum]] in [[Esztergom]] that joined in 1985.

== Exhibitions ==

The Hungarian National Museum has seven permanent displays.  The general [[history of Hungary]] is covered in two sections: the archaeology from prehistory to the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] period ending in 804 AD on the first (ground) floor ("On the East-West frontier"), and the history from 804 to modern times on the first floor.  This display covers topics such as the age of the [[Árpád dynasty|Arpads]], the long Turkish occupation, [[Transylvania]] and royal Hungary.  More modern and Contemporary history covered begins with the Rákóczi War of Independence, showing different sections of his military attire and various coins.  The history section then ends with the rise and fall of the communist system in Hungary.  In another hall on the second floor one can find out about the Scholar Hungarians who made the twentieth century.  A room on the first floor displays the medieval Hungarian Coronation Mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The coronation mantle|url=http://hnm.hu/en/exhibitions/coronation-mantle|website=Hungarian National Museum|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The ground floor's permanent exhibit is focused on Medieval and Early Modern stone inscriptions  and carvings.  This exhibit looks at various stone relics and the carvings that have been made into them.  The majority of the items in this collection were discovered during the 1960s and 1970s, since they looked for more relics post World War II.  The final permanent exhibit is placed in the basement of the museum.  This is the Roman Lapidary exhibit, which is a collection of ancient Roman stone inscriptions and carvings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Lapidary|url=http://hnm.hu/en/exhibitions/roman-lapidary|website=Hungarian National Museum|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building ==
[[File:Mihály Pollack (portrait).jpg|thumb|left|150px|The architect, Mihály Pollack (1773–1855), with the elevation of the Museum]]
The building where the Hungarian National Museum is currently located was built from 1837–1847. The style of the main building was laid out in a neo-classical style and was added onto by other artists in the form of statues, paintings and other architecture.  The statues of the Portico were done by Raffael Monti of Milan.  One of these is a famous statue of the allegoric figure of Hungary, holding a shield with the Hungarian coat of arms on it.  On the sides of this figure there is Science on one and Art on the other.  In addition the paintings that have been in the staircase and on the ceiling since 1875 were done by [[Károly Lotz]] and [[Mór Than]].  There has also been a garden that is used primarily for various concerts.  Various artists have performed here including Ferenc Liszt.  Today the garden is the venue of the Museum Festival.

Scenes from the movie [[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]], starring [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] were filmed on the steps leading in. The scenes depicted the coffin of [[Eva Peron]] being carried into a 'Buenos Aires' government building to lay in State.

The '''Institute of Archaeology and Art History''' is an academic research institution in [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]].

== History ==
In the early days of 1990 began the process of rebirth of the [[Romanian Academy]], a national institution of reference for Romanian culture and science, founded in 1866. Former  Romanian Academy research institutes, temporarily affiliated with universities, have returned to the  original jurisdiction.

The Institute of Archaeology and Art History of the Romanian Academy, established on March 3, 1990 through a government decision, together with the [[Institute of History "George Bariț"]] is continuing  the traditions of scientific and research developed in 1920s by the
[[Romanian National Historical Institute]], the [[Romanian Institute of Classical Studies]] and the [[Romanian Art History Seminar]].

[[Image:Worcester.dream.jpg|thumb|right|''King Henry I's Dream'' in the Chronicle.]]
'''John of Worcester''' (died c. 1140) was an English [[monk]] and [[English historians in the Middle Ages|chronicler]] who worked at [[Worcester Cathedral#Library|Worcester Priory]]. He is usually held to be the author of the '''''Chronicon ex chronicis'''''.

==''Chronicon ex chronicis''==
John of Worcester wrote at the year 1066

The ''Chronicon ex chronicis'' is a world wide history which begins with the [[creation myth|creation]] and ends in 1140. The chronological framework of the ''Chronicon'' was presented by the chronicle of [[Marianus Scotus]] (d. 1082). A great deal of additional material, particularly relating to English history, was grafted onto it.

===Authorship===

The greater part of the work, up to 1117 or 1118, was formerly attributed to the man '''[[Florence of Worcester]]''' on the basis of the entry for his death under the annal of 1118, which credits his skill and industry for making the chronicle such a prominent work.&lt;ref&gt;''[...] huius subtili scienta et studiosi laboris industria, preeminet cunctis haec chronicarum chronica.''&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the other Worcester monk, John, merely wrote the final part of the work. However, there are two main objections against the ascription to Florence. First, there is no change of style in the ''Chronicon'' after Florence's death, and second, certain sections before 1118 rely to some extent on the ''Historia novorum'' of [[Eadmer of Canterbury]], which was completed sometime in 1121 – 1124.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, ''Historical Writing'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalent view today is that John of Worcester was the principal author and compiler. He is explicitly named as the author of two entries for 1128 and 1138, and two manuscripts (CCC MS 157 and the ''chronicula'') were written in his hand. He was seen working on it at the behest of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester]], when the Anglo-Norman chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] visited Worcester:

:{|
|''Ioannes Wigornensis a puero monachus, natione Anglicus, moribus et eruditione uenerandus, in his quæ Mariani Scotti cronicis adiecit, de rege Guillelmo et de rebus quæ sub eo uel sub filiis eius Guillelmo Rufo et Henrico usque hodie contigerunt honeste deprompsit. [...] Quem prosecutus Iohannes acta fere centum annorum contexuit, iussuque uenerabilis Wlfstani pontificis et monachi supradictis cronicis inseruit in quibus multa de Romanis et Francis et Alemannis aliisque gentibus quæ agnouit [...].''
|"John, an Englishman by birth who entered the monastery of Worcester as a boy and won great repute for his learning and piety, continued the chronicle of [[Marianus Scotus]] and carefully recorded the events of [[William the Conqueror|William]]'s reign and of his sons [[William Rufus]] and Henry up to the present. [...] John, at the command of the venerable [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan bishop and monk]] [d. 1095], added to these chronicles [i.e. of Marianus Scotus] events of about a hundred years, by inserting a brief and valuable summary of many deeds of the Romans and Franks, Germans and other peoples whom he knew [...]."&lt;ref&gt;Orderic Vitalis, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Book III, ed. and tr. Chibnall, p. 186-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

===Manuscripts===
The ''Chronicon'' survives in five manuscripts (and a fragment on a single leaf):
[[Image:John of Worcester sunspot drawing 1128.png|thumb|widthpx|Sunspot drawing in 1128, by John of Worcester.&lt;ref name=John1128&gt;{{cite book|last1=John of Worcester|title=The Chronicle of John of Worcester|date=1128|publisher=John of Worcester|location=Corpus Christi College, Oxford|page=380|edition=MS 157}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
*MS 157 (Oxford, [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]]). The principal manuscript, working copy used by John.
*MS 502 (Dublin, [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]]).
*MS 42 ([[Lambeth Palace#Lambeth Palace Library|Lambeth Palace Library]]).
*MS Bodley 297 (Oxford, [[Bodleian Library]]).
*MS 92 (Cambridge, [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]]).

In addition, there is the ''chronicula'', a minor chronicle based on the ''Chronicon'' proper: MS 503 (Dublin, [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]]), written by John up to 1123.

===Sources for English history===

For the body of material dealing with early English history, John is believed to have used a number of sources, some of which are now lost:

*unknown version(s) of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', possibly in Latin translation. John may have shared a lost source with [[William of Malmesbury]], whose ''Gesta regum anglorum'' includes similar material not found in other works.
*[[Bede]], ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (up to 731)
*[[Asser]], ''Vita Ælfredi''
*Hagiographical works on tenth/eleventh-century saints
**''Lives'' of [[St Dunstan]] by author 'B', [[Adelard of Ghent|Adelard]] and [[Osbern of Canterbury|Osbern]]
**[[Byrhtferth]], ''Life'' of [[Oswald of Worcester|St. Oswald]]
**[[Osbern of Canterbury]], ''Life'' of [[Alphege|St Ælfheah]]
*[[Eadmer]] of Canterbury, ''Historia novorum'' (1066–1122)
*accounts by contemporaries and local knowledge.

Aside from his academic achievements, Dr. Poon has studied and practiced [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese Calligraphy]] for more than fifty years.  At the age of 18, he won the First prize in the Hong Kong Chinese Calligraphy Open Competition in 1967. Between 1986-88,  Dr. Poon held his first series of Chinese Calligraphy exhibitions in Hong Kong and in Toronto.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 潘國鍵書法展覽 (1986)|url = http://www.blessedden.com/Dad_Calligraphy_1/Calligraphy_1/book_index_1.html|website = www.blessedden.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 潘國鍵師生書法展覽 (1987)|url = http://www.blessedden.com/Dad_Calligraphy_2/Calligraphy_2/book_index_2.html|website = www.blessedden.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucius Cornelius Sisenna''' (c.&amp;nbsp;120 – 67 BC) was a Roman soldier, historian, and [[annalists|annalist]]. He was killed in action during [[Pompey]]'s campaign against [[pirate]]s after the [[Third Mithridatic War]]. Sisenna had been commander of the forces on the coast of Greece.

He was the author of a history in twenty-three books, all of which have been lost, save a few fragments. [[Sallust]] is said to have begun historical work as a continuation of Sisenna's.

Sisenna is said to have a colourful use of language and was of interest for ancient [[grammar]]ians.&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, F.R.D. Goodyear - The Cambridge History of Classical Literature&lt;/ref&gt; His histories are said to have covered specific sections of Roman history as compared to historians such as [[Livy]], whose works cover Roman history as a whole.

Sisenna also translated a collection of [[erotic]] and [[picaresque]] tales by [[Aristides of Miletus]] entitled ''Milesiae fabulae'', which was said to have served as a model for [[Petronius]]' ''Satyricon''.

'''Martín de Murúa, [[Mercedarian Order|O. de M.]]''', (c. 1525 in [[Gipuzkoa]], Spain – c. 1618 in Spain) was a [[Basque people|Basque]] [[Mercedarian]] [[friar]] and chronicler of the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas]]. He is primarily known for his work ''Historia general del Piru'' (written c.1580-1616), which is considered the earliest illustrated history of Peru.

==Murúa's career in Peru==
Murúa volunteered to serve in the missions of [[New Spain]], where he was sent by his superiors and arrived in Peru in the early 1580s. He is known to have lived in the [[Curahuasi District|Curahuasi Valley]] around that period. He later traveled throughout the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] as a missionary, serving in the proximities of [[Lake Titicaca]] and [[Cusco Region|Cuzco]], where he came to know some features of the inhabitants of the former [[Inca Empire]] well. From about 1595 to 1601 his residence was at the Mercedarian Monastery of [[St. John Lateran]] in [[Arequipa]].

In addition to his missionary work, Murúa gathered data to write a history of the Andean past. He was assisted in his translation of the date from the [[Quechua language]] by a native Inca nobleman [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]] (also known as Guaman Poma), who provided over 100 illustrations of great historical significance for the work, but who was later highly critical of Murúa's depiction of Inca history in his own writings.

In 1611, Murúa made the decision to return to Spain. He chose, however, not to take the usual route, by way of Panama. Instead, he traveled across the [[Amazon Forest]], crossing the [[Andes]], arriving in [[La Plata]]. After a lengthy stay, from there he went on to [[Potosí]] and then to the [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán region]]. All along the way, he took the opportunity to have the local religious and government authorities review his work for comment and correction. He eventually passed through [[Cordoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and arrived in [[Buenos Aires]], from which he set sail for Spain in 1615.

The following year, while living in Madrid, Murúa received the necessary authorizations from both his Order and  the king to publish his chronicle,  entitled ''Historia general del Piru''. The work covers Peru's [[pre-Columbian]] and early [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish colonial]] history. In his ''Historia'', Murúa wrote of the presence of a number of mythological creatures in South America, such as [[Amazons]] and giants, which gave rise to the names of many geographical landmarks of the continent.

==The Galvin and Getty manuscripts==
There exist two versions of the ''Historia general del Piru'': the Galvin Murúa (also known as the "Loyola Murúa") and the Getty Murúa (also known as the "Wellington Murúa"). The former is kept in a private collection in Ireland while the latter is at the [[Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]], California. The original as well as a facsimile of the Galvin Murúa are available at the [[Getty Center]] for consultation by qualified scholars.

The Galvin Murúa dates from the 1580s and was completed around 1600. This first version of the chronicle was compiled in Peru by Murúa with the assistance of local scribes and Indigenous artists (one of whom was [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]]). By the 18th century, the Galvin Murúa ended up in the possession of the Jesuit College in [[Alcalá de Henares]], Spain. Between 1879-1900, the manuscript was housed in a Jesuit enclave in [[Poyanne]], France. Its association with the Jesuits gave the manuscript its title the "Loyola Murúa" (after St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Jesuit Order]]). In the 1950s, the manuscript was bought by a rare bookseller in San Francisco, California and resold to the late John Galvin (d. 1996), a European aristocrat and private collector. The text remains in the hands of the Galvin family in [[County Meath]], Ireland.

The Getty Murúa dates from 1615–16 and was the second version of the chronicle. Most of the text was compiled in Peru and present-day Bolivia, although it was most likely re-edited in Spain. This version received the final approbation for printing, however for unknown reasons it remained unpublished during the seventeenth century. Once in Spain, the manuscript was somehow acquired by Castilian statesman and bibliophile Lorenzo Ramirez de Prado. After Ramirez's death in 1658, it was incorporated into the library of the Colegio Mayor de Cuenca in [[Salamanca]] and finally the private library of King [[Charles IV of Spain]] in 1802. As a result of the [[Peninsular War]], it came into the possession of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. Thus the manuscript acquired the title the "Wellington Murúa." It was later sold at auction to a collector in [[Cologne]], Germany, changing hands once more before its "rediscovery" by Manuel Ballesteros Gaibrois in the early 1950s. Ballesteros Gaibrois published a two volume edition of ''Historia general del Piru'' in 1962 and 1964. In 1983, the manuscript was sold to the Getty Research Institute. Since then it has been known as the "Getty Murúa."

Research has proven that several images (including two by Guaman Poma) from the Galvin Murúa were removed and pasted into the Getty Murúa, although overall the Galvin Murúa contains more images than its counterpart. The images in both manuscripts were colored using paints, dyes, and silver from the Americas and Europe. An exhaustive study of both manuscripts was funded by the Getty Research Institute in 2007-2008.

==Murúa's ''Historia general del Piru'' (1616)==

Murúa's chronicle is divided into three books. The following is the complete title of the work:

&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''Historia General del Pirú. Origen y descen''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''dencia de los Incas, donde se trata de las guerras''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''civiles Ingas como de la entrada de los españoles''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''Descripción de las ciudades y lugares del, con''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''otras cosas notables, compuesto por el Muy rdo''.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''Fr. Martín de Murúa, elector genl. del orden de nra. Sa''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''de las mds. Rra de captious, comor y cura de Hunata''.&lt;/div&gt;

The first book is divided into 92 chapters and contains the following:

&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''(I) Libro del Origen y descendencia de los'' &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''Ingas. Señores deste Reyno del Pirú donde se''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''ponen las conquistas que hizieron de differentes probinc''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''ias Y Naciones y Guerras civiles hasta la entra''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''da De los Españoles, con su modo de governar cond''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''ción y trato y la descripción de las más prinsi''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''pales Ciudades y Villas de''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''esta amplisima provincia.''&lt;/div&gt;

The second book has 40 chapters and includes the following:

&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''(II) Libro segundo, del gobierno que los Yngas''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''tubieron en este reino y ritos y ce''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''remonias que gardaban.'&lt;/div&gt;

Finally, the third book contains the following in 31 chapters:

&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''(III) Libro tersero, donde se trata, en''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''general, y particular deste reino''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''del Pirú, y las ciudades prins''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;''ipales y villas.''&lt;/div&gt;

Murúa worked closely with indigenous peoples in compiling his text, incorporating their testimonies and oral accounts of Inca culture and political history into ''Historia general del Piru''. The most striking feature of the chronicle is its numerous illustrations, which include portraits of Inca nobility and depictions of traditional ceremonies. These images blend European and indigenous artistic traditions.

==Murúa and Guaman Poma==
Twentieth-century scholars had often speculated that there existed some relationship between [[Guaman Poma]]'s [[Nueva Crónica y Buen Gobierno]] and Fray Martín de Murúa's ''Historia general del Piru'' (1616), assuming that Guaman Poma served as an informant or coauthor to Murúa. In 1967, Condarco Morales performed a comparative study of the texts and concluded that Guaman Poma followed Murúa's work. A direct relationship between Guaman Poma and Murúa was confirmed by the Getty research project (2007–2008). The project's principal scholars included Juan de Ossio, Thomas Cummins, and Barbara Anderson, with collaboration by [[Rolena Adorno]] and Ivan Boserup. After comparing the Getty Murúa and Galvin Murúa, these scholars proved that the chronicle does in fact include illustrations by Guaman Poma. They concluded that Guaman Poma was one of a team of scribes and artists that worked for Murúa while he was in Peru. While Murúa's project began sometime in the 1580s, Guaman Poma became involved only as an illustrator and only shortly before 1600. These findings were the basis of an exhibition and symposium at the Getty Center in October 2008.

Guaman Poma notably attacks Murúa in his ''Corónica'', even depicting the friar striking and kicking an indigenous woman seated at a loom. This image is entitled "The Mercedarian friar Martín de Murúa abuses his parishioners and takes justice into his own hands." According to Rolena Adorno, "...&amp;nbsp;when he became an author after 1600, [Guaman Poma] was highly critical of a work by Murúa that he had recently illustrated. Guaman Poma was prompted to write his own account against what he understood to be Murúa's limited perspective, which he had encountered in the Galvin Murúa. Guaman Poma extended Andean history back in time of the era predating the Inca, and he also elaborated a long and highly critical survey of colonial society such as no other chronicle of his time produced. Guaman Poma's artistic repertoire, which was displayed in his own work in the creation of nearly four hundred drawings, drew upon the formative experience he had gained while working with Murúa, but it also developed in new directions to reveal a strong polemical and satirical bent that was directed against the abuses perpetrated under colonial rule&amp;nbsp;... Although the evidence suggests that they worked independently after 1600, the efforts of Murúa and Guaman Poma can never be separated, and their talents, individually and together, produced three distinctive testimonies to the interaction between missionary author and indigenous artist-cum-author in early colonial Peru."

'''Mary Downing Sheldon Barnes''' (September 15, 1850{{spaced ndash}}August 27, 1898) was an American educator and historian. Her teaching style and publications were considered ahead of their time. She used a method that encouraged students to develop their own research skills utilizing primary sources and their own problem solving skills. Sheldon was teacher of and major influence on author and socialist [[Anna Strunsky]].&lt;ref name="NYTAnna"&gt;{{cite web | author=James Boylan | year=1998 | title=Revolutionary Lives | work=Books | publisher=[[New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/boylan-revolutionary.html | accessdate=13 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Mary Downing Sheldon was born in [[Oswego, New York]], the oldest of five children, to Frances Stiles and [[Edward Austin Sheldon]]. Her father was the founder of the [[State University of New York at Oswego|Oswego State Normal and Training School]], known for its [[Pestalozzian]] principles. Her upbringing drastically deviated from traditional nineteenth-century norms, as both her parents encouraged scholarly education and fostered her inquisitive spirit. Sheldon attended Oswego public schools and a dual program at Oswego Normal, graduating in 1869 as a certified teacher with specialized training in classical studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

After graduation, she taught there for two years, before becoming enrolled in the first coeducational class at [[University of Michigan]] in 1871. Sheldon was a founding member of the Quadrantic Circle, a precursor to sororities. While at Michigan, she studied extensively under the direction of [[Moses Coit Tyler]], a professor of English language and literature within historical and political contexts. She also studied under [[Charles Kendall Adams]], a proponent of the German seminar method of teaching history However, she also took particular interest in the natural sciences. She graduated with an AB in [[classical studies]] in 1874.&lt;ref name="Findingaid"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2001 | title=Mary Sheldon Barnes Papers | work=Sophia Smith Collection | publisher=Smith College | url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss2_bioghist.html | accessdate=13 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching and career===
Sheldon returned to Oswego State Normal after her graduation to teach [[history]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[botany]]. In January 1877 she began teaching at [[Wellesley College]] in the [[English studies|English]] and history departments for two and a half years. Her teaching style was considered [[Orthodoxy|unorthodox]] at the time, using the [[case method]] process introduced by her father in the [[Oswego Movement]]. Drawing from the teachings of Pestalozzi and [[Leopold von Ranke]], Sheldon encouraged helping students build problem-solving skills while learning historical inquiry. She encouraged her students to move beyond rote memorization. Rather than a textbook, she used a collection of primary source reproductions. With firsthand reading of powerful documents of history, students could generate a dialogue about history’s biggest questions. However, faculty at Wellesley disapproved of her methods. In 1879 she resigned due to poor health and internal conflicts at the college, leaving behind teaching to travel abroad and rest. In 1882 she returned to Oswego Normal to write her work ''Studies in General History'', which was published in 1885 for secondary-school students.&lt;ref name="Findingaid"/&gt;

On August 6, 1885 she married Earl Barnes, a former student, who was eleven years her junior. While Barnes taught at various universities, Sheldon concentrated on her writing and collaboration with historian [[Andrew Dickson White]]. In 1891 Barnes was appointed head of the department of education at [[Stanford University]], where he implemented her method studies of educational history and child development. In March 1892 Sheldon joined the department of history at Stanford as the first female faculty member. As an assistant professor, she taught 19th-century European and [[Pacific Slope]] history. The couple collaborated on ''Studies in American History'' which was published in 1891 for eighth-grade students. However, Sheldon owned the copyright to the text. She also conducted research in four California school districts regarding the source method and educational philosophy, through which she designed a history curriculum that accounted for developmental changes. Sheldon would go on to publish ''Studies in Historical Method'', which was directed towards teachers and [[layman]] historians interested in learning about [[historical method]]. In 1897, the couple resigned from Stanford to travel and write in Europe.&lt;ref name="Findingaid" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Sheldon's health had always been of serious concern, and her chronic illness worsened while abroad. She underwent an unsuccessful new medical procedure to treat an organic [[heart disease]]. On August 27, 1898 she died in London. Per her request, Barnes buried her in a Protestant cemetery in Rome.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C|title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary|last=James|first=Edward T.|last2=James|first2=Janet Wilson|last3=Boyer|first3=Paul S.|last4=College|first4=Radcliffe|date=1971-01-01|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674627345|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her teaching method encouraged students to "study the primary sources in an 'independent and solitary' way using her questions as guides to problem solving...in order to develop the students abilities to observe, weigh evidence, to generalize and to exercise creative historical imagination." This approach was described as progressive for the time, utilizing a case method that "hastened the improvement of more conventional history [[textbooks]]."&lt;ref name="Findingaid" /&gt;  ''Studies in General History'' incited debate among leading historians and educators. The [[American Historical Association|American Historical Association's Committee of Seven]] issued a report in 1899, rejecting Sheldon's approach to teaching. The panel, chaired by [[Andrew C. McLaughlin]], recommended "limited contact with a limited body of materials, an examination of which may show the child the nature of the historical process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monteverde|first1=Frances|title=Bending the Future to Their Will: Civic Women, Social Education, and Democracy|date=1999|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though largely ignored in print, her teaching philosophy, especially in relation to critical thinking for students, influenced the curricular structure of general education courses in the mid-twentieth century. However, modern critics of Sheldon's work note her limited sociocultural views and blinding patriotism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mesoamerican chronology''' divides the history of [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] [[Mesoamerica]] into several periods: the Paleo-Indian (first human habitation&amp;ndash;3500 BCE), the Archaic (before 2600 BCE), the Preclassic or Formative (2500 BCE&amp;ndash;250 CE), the Classic (250&amp;ndash;900CE), and the Postclassic (900&amp;ndash;1521 CE), Colonial (1521&amp;ndash;1821), and Postcolonial (1821&amp;ndash;present). The periodization of Mesoamerica is based on archaeological, ethnohistorical, and modern cultural anthropology research.  The endeavor to create cultural histories of Mesoamerica dates to the early twentieth century, with ongoing work by archeologists, ethnohistorians, historians, and cultural anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |first = Ruben G. |last = Mendoza| year = 2001 |title = Mesoamerican Chronology: Periodization | journal = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture |volume = 2 | pages = 222-226 | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Paleo-Indian period===
10,000&amp;ndash;3500 BCE
{{Main|History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)}}

The '''Paleo-Indian''' (less frequently, '''''[[Lithic stage|Lithic]]''''') period or era is that which spans from the first signs of human presence in the region, to the establishment of [[agriculture]] and other practices (e.g. [[pottery]], permanent settlements) and [[list of subsistence techniques|subsistence techniques]] characteristic of proto-[[civilization]]s. In Mesoamerica, the termination of this phase and its transition into the succeeding Archaic period may generally be reckoned at between 10,000 and 8000 BCE, although this dating is approximate only and different timescales may be used between fields and sub-regions.

===Archaic Era===
{{main|Mesoamerican Archaic Period}}
Before 2600 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Richard S. |last = MacNeish| year = 2001 |title = Mesoamerican Chronology: Early Development and the Archaic Period (before 2600 BCE)| journal = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture |volume = 2 | pages = 226-236| isbn = 0-19-510815-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During the '''Archaic Era''' [[agriculture]] was developed in the region and permanent villages were established. Late in this era, use of [[pottery]] and [[loom]] [[weaving]] became common, and class divisions began to appear. Many of the basic technologies of Mesoamerica in terms of stone-grinding, drilling, pottery etc. were established during this period.

===Preclassic Era or Formative Period===
2000 BCE&amp;ndash;250 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = David G. |last = Grove| year = 2001 |title = Mesoamerican Chronology:  Formative (Preclassic) Period (2000 BCE-250 CE)| journal = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture |volume = 2 | pages = 236-243| isbn = 0-19-510815-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the '''Preclassic Era''', or '''Formative Period''', large-scale ceremonial architecture, [[writing]], cities, and states developed. Many of the distinctive elements of Mesoamerican civilization can be traced back to this period, including the dominance of corn, the building of pyramids, human sacrifice, [[jaguar-worship]], the complex calendar, and many of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Lynn V.|title=Handbook to Life in the Ancient Maya World|year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195183634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Olmec]] civilization developed and flourished at such sites as [[La Venta]] and [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]]. The [[Zapotec civilization]] arose in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], the [[Teotihuacan]] civilization arose in the [[Valley of Mexico]], and the [[Maya civilization]] began to develop in the [[Mirador Basin]] (in modern-day [[Guatemala]]) and the Epi-Olmec culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (in modern-day [[Chiapas]]), later expanding into [[Guatemala]] and the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coe|first=Michael D.|title= Breaking the Maya Code|year=1999|edition=revised|publisher=Thames and Hudson, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28133-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guernsey|first=Julia|title=Ritual and Power in Stone: The Performance of Rulership in Mesoamerican Izapan Style Art|year=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press, Austin, TX|isbn=978-0-292-71323-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pool|first=Christopher|title=Olmec Archaeology and Early Mesoamerica|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78882-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic Period===
250&amp;ndash;900 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Geoffrey G. |last = McCafferty| author2 = David Carrasco| year = 2001 |title = Mesoamerican Chronology: Classic Period (250-900)| journal = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture |volume = 2 | pages = 243-248| isbn = 0-19-510815-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Classic Period''' was dominated by numerous independent city-states in the Maya region and also featured the beginnings of political unity in central Mexico and the Yucatán.  Regional differences between cultures grew more manifest. The city-state of [[Teotihuacan]] dominated the Valley of Mexico until the early 8th century, but we know little of the political structure of the region because the Teotihuacanos left no written records. The city-state of [[Monte Albán]] dominated the Valley of Oaxaca until the late Classic, leaving limited records in [[Zapotec writing|their mostly undeciphered script]]. Highly sophisticated arts such as stuccowork, architecture, sculptural reliefs, mural painting, pottery, and lapidary developed and spread during the Classic era.

In the Maya region, under considerable military influence by Teotihuacan after the "arrival" of [[Siyaj K'ak']] in 378 CE, numerous city states such as [[Tikal]], [[Uaxactun]], [[Calakmul]], [[Copán]], [[Quirigua]], [[Palenque]], [[Cobá]], and [[Caracol]] reached their zeniths.  Each of these polities was generally independent, although they often formed alliances and sometimes became vassal states of each other.  The main conflict during this period was between Tikal and Calakmul, who fought a series of wars over the course of more than half a millennium.  Each of these states declined during the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic]] and were eventually abandoned.

===Postclassic Period===
900&amp;ndash;1521&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Michael E. |last = Smith| year = 2001 |title = Mesoamerican Chronology: Postclassic Period (900-1521)| journal = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture |volume = 2 | pages = 248-257| isbn = 0-19-510815-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the '''Postclassic Period''' many of the great nations and cities of the Classic Era collapsed, although some continued, such as in [[Oaxaca]], [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], and the Maya of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], such as at [[Chichen Itza]] and [[Uxmal]]. This is sometimes seen as a period of increased chaos and warfare.

The Postclassic is often viewed as a period of cultural decline. However, it was a time of technological advancement in architecture, engineering, and weaponry. Metallurgy (introduced c.&amp;nbsp;800) came into use for jewelry and some tools, with new alloys and techniques being developed in a few centuries. The Postclassic was a period of rapid movement and population growth—especially in Central Mexico post-1200—and of experimentation in governance. For instance, in Yucatán, 'dual rulership' apparently replaced the more theocratic governments of Classic times, whilst oligarchic councils operated in much of Central Mexico. Likewise, it appears that the wealthy ''pochteca'' (merchant class) and military orders became more powerful than was apparently the case in Classic times. This afforded some Mesoamericans a degree of social mobility.

The [[Toltec]] for a time dominated central Mexico in the 9th&amp;ndash;10th century, then collapsed. The northern Maya were for a time united under [[Mayapan]], and Oaxaca was briefly united by [[Mixtec]] rulers in the 11th&amp;ndash;12th centuries.

The [[Aztec]] Empire arose in the early 16th century and appeared to be on a path to asserting dominance over the Valley of Mexico region not seen since Teotihuacan. Spain was the first European power to contact Mesoamerica, however, and its [[conquistador]]es and a large number of native allies conquered the Aztecs.

By the 15th century, the Mayan 'revival' in Yucatán and southern Guatemala and the flourishing of Aztec imperialism evidently enabled a renaissance of fine arts and science. Examples include the 'Pueblan-Mexica' style in pottery, codex illumination, and goldwork, the flourishing of Nahua poetry, and the botanical institutes established by the Aztec elite.

===Colonial Period===
1521-1821&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = William B. |last = Taylor| authorlink = William B. Taylor (historian)| year = 2001 |title = Mesoamerican Chronology: Colonial Period (1521-1821)| journal = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture |volume = 2 | pages = 257-264 | isbn = 0-19-510815-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Colonial Period''' was initiated with [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|Spanish conquest]]  (1519-1521), which ended the hegemony of the [[Aztec Empire]]. It was accomplished with Spaniards' strategic alliances with enemies of the empire, most especially [[Tlaxcala]], but also Huexotzinco, Xochimilco, and even [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], a former partner in the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]]. Although not all parts of Mesoamerica were brought under control of the [[Spanish Empire]] immediately, it was the most dramatic beginning of an inexorable process of conquest in Mesoamerica and incorporation that was completed in the mid-seventeenth century.  Indigenous peoples did not disappear, although their numbers were greatly reduced in the sixteenth century by epidemic diseases brought by the Spanish invaders. The fall of [[Tenochtitlan]] marked the beginning of the three-hundred-year colonial period and the imposition of Spanish rule.

==Cultural horizons of Mesoamerica==
Mesoamerican civilization was a complex network of different cultures. As seen in the time-line below, these did not necessarily occur at the same time. The processes that gave rise to each of the cultural systems of Mesoamerica were very complex and not determined solely by the internal dynamics of each society. External as well as endogenous factors influenced their development. Among these factors, for example, were the relations between human groups and between humans and the environment, human migrations, and natural disasters.

Historians and archaeologists divide [[Pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] Mesoamerican history into three periods. The [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]] (1519-1521) marks the end of indigenous rule and the incorporation of indigenous peoples as subjects of the [[Spanish Empire]] for the 300 year [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|colonial period]]. The postcolonial period began with Mexican independence in 1821 and continues to the present day. European conquest did not end the existence of Mesoamerica's indigenous peoples, but did subject them to new political regimes. In the chart below of prehispanic cultures, it is important to note that the dates mentioned are approximations, and that the transition from one period to another did not occur at the same time nor under the same circumstances in all societies.

===Preclassic Era===
[[File:Vasija capacha.jpg|thumb|upright|Vessel from the [[Capacha]] culture, found in Acatitan, [[Colima]].]]

The Preclassic period ran from 2500 BCE to 200 CE. Its beginnings are marked by the development of the first ceramic traditions in the West, specifically at sites such as [[Matanchén]], [[Nayarit]], and Puerto Marqués, in [[Guerrero]]. Some authors hold that the early development of pottery in this area is related to the ties between South America and the coastal peoples of Mexico. The advent of ceramics is taken as an indicator of a sedentary society, and it signals the divergence of Mesoamerica from the hunter-gatherer societies in the desert to the north.

The Preclassic Era (also known as the Formative Period) is divided into three phases: the Early (2500&amp;ndash;1200 BCE), Middle (1500&amp;ndash;600 BCE), and Late (600 BCE&amp;ndash;200 CE). During the first phase, the manufacture of ceramics was widespread across the entire region, the cultivation of maize and other vegetables became well-established, and society started to become socially stratified in a process that concluded with the appearance of the first hierarchical societies along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the early Preclassic period, the [[Capacha]] culture acted as a driving force in the process of civilizing Mesoamerica, and its pottery spread widely across the region.

By 2500 BCE, small settlements were developing in Guatemala's Pacific Lowlands, places such as Tilapa, [[La Blanca]], Ocós, El Mesak, [[Ujuxte]], and others, where the oldest ceramic pottery from Guatemala have been found. From 2000 BCE heavy concentration of pottery in the Pacific Coast Line has been documented. Recent excavations suggest that the Highlands were a geographic and temporal bridge between Early Preclassic villages of the Pacific coast and later [[Petén Basin|Petén lowlands]] cities.  In Monte Alto near La Democracia, [[Escuintla]], in the Pacific lowlands of [[Guatemala]] some giant stone heads and "[[Potbelly sculpture|potbellies]]" (Barrigones) have been found, dated at c. 1800 BCE, of the so-named [[Monte Alto Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/M-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Formative Era sites.svg|thumb|left|Several of the most prominent Formative Period sites in the central Mexican plateau and [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] regions.]]
Around 1500 BCE, the cultures of the West entered a period of decline, accompanied by an assimilation into the other peoples with whom they had maintained connections. As a result, the [[Tlatilco culture]] emerged in the [[Valley of Mexico]], and the [[Olmec]] culture in the Gulf. Tlatilco was one of the principal Mesoamerican population centers of this period. Its people were adept at harnessing the natural resources of [[Lake Texcoco]] and at cultivating maize. Some authors posit that Tlatilco was founded and inhabited by the ancestors of today's [[Otomi people]].

The Olmecs, on the other hand, had entered into an expansionist phase that led them to construct their first works of monumental architecture at [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán|San Lorenzo]] and [[La Venta]]. The Olmecs exchanged goods within their own core area and with sites as far away as [[Guerrero]] and [[Morelos]] and present day [[Guatemala]] and [[Costa Rica]]. [[San José Mogote]], a site that also shows Olmec influences, ceded dominance of the Oaxacan plateau to [[Monte Albán]] toward the end of the middle Preclassic Era. During this same time, the [[Chupícuaro]] culture flourished in [[Bajío]], while along the Gulf the Olmecs entered a period of decline.
[[File:Acróbata de Tlatilco.JPG|thumb|282x282px|A typical Pre-Classic figurine from central Mexico, [[Tlatilco culture]].]]
One of the great cultural milestones that marked the Middle Preclassic period is the development of the first writing system, by either the [[Maya Script|Maya]], the [[Cascajal Block|Olmec]], or the [[Zapotec civilization#Writing|Zapotec]]. During this period, the Mesoamerican societies were highly [[social stratification|stratified]]. The connections between different centers of power permitted the rise of regional elites that controlled natural resources and peasant labor. This social differentiation was based on the possession of certain technical knowledge, such as [[astronomy]], writing, and commerce. Furthermore, the Middle Preclassic period saw the beginnings of the process of urbanization that would come to define the societies of the Classic period. In the [[Preclassic Maya|Maya]] area, cities such as [[Nakbe]] c. 1000 BCE, [[El Mirador]] c. 650 BCE, [[Cival]] c. 350 BCE, and [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] show the same monumental architecture of the Classic period. In fact, El Mirador is the largest Maya city. It has been argued that the Maya experienced a [[Preclassic Maya#Preclassic .22Collapse.22|first collapse]] c. 100 CE, and resurged c. 250 in the Classic period. Some population centers such as [[Tlatilco]], [[Monte Albán]], and [[Cuicuilco]] flourished in the final stages of the Preclassic period. Meanwhile, the Olmec populations shrank and ceased to be major players in the area.

Toward the end of the Preclassic period, political and commercial hegemony shifted to the population centers in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Around [[Lake Texcoco]] there existed a number of villages that grew into true cities: Tlatilco and Cuicuilco are examples. The former was found on the northern bank of the lake, while the latter was on the slopes of the mountainous region of [[Ajusco]]. Tlatilco maintained strong relationships with the cultures of the West, so much so that Cuicuilco controlled commerce in the Maya area, Oaxaca, and the Gulf coast. The rivalry between the two cities ended with the decline of Tlatilco. Meanwhile, at Monte Albán in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], the Zapotec had begun developing culturally independent of the Olmec, adopting aspects of that culture but making their own contributions as well. On the southern coast of Guatemala, [[Kaminaljuyú]] advanced in the direction of what would be the Classic Maya culture, even though its links to Central Mexico and the Gulf would initially provide their cultural models. Apart from the West, where the tradition of the [[Tumbas de tiro]] had taken root, in all the regions of Mesoamerica the cities grew in wealth, with monumental constructions carried out according to urban plans that were surprisingly complex. The circular pyramid of Cuicuilco dates from this time, as well as the central plaza of Monte Albán, and the [[Pyramid of the Moon]] in [[Teotihuacan]].

Around the start of the common era, Cuicuilco had disappeared, and the hegemony over the Mexican basin had passed to Teotihuacan. The next two centuries marked the period in which the so-called ''City of the gods'' consolidated its power, becoming the premier Mesoamerican city of the first millennium, and the principal political, economic, and cultural center for the next seven centuries.

====The Olmec====
{{Main|Olmec}}
[[File:Olmec Heartland Overview 4.svg|thumb|The [[Olmec heartland]].]]

For many years, the Olmec culture was thought to be the 'mother culture' of Mesoamerica, because of the great influence that it exercised throughout the region. However, more recent perspectives consider this culture to be more of a process to which all the contemporary peoples contributed, and which eventually crystallized on the coasts of [[Veracruz]] and [[Tabasco]]. The ethnic identity of the Olmecs is still widely debated. Based on linguistic evidence, archaeologists and anthropologists generally believe that they were either speakers of an [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] language, or (more likely) the ancestors of the present-day [[Zoque people]] who live in the north of [[Chiapas]] and [[Oaxaca]]. According to this second hypothesis, Zoque tribes emigrated toward the south after the fall of the major population centers of the Gulf plains. Whatever their origin, these bearers of Olmec culture arrived at the leeward shore some eight thousand years BCE, entering like a wedge among the fringe of proto-Maya peoples who lived along the coast, a migration that would explain the separation of the [[Huastecs]] of the north of Veracruz from the rest of the Maya peoples based in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and [[Guatemala]].

The Olmec culture represents a milestone of Mesoamerican history, as various characteristics that define the region first appeared there. Among them are the state organization, the development of the 260-day ritual calendar and the 365-day secular calendar, the first writing system, and urban planning. The development of this culture started 1600 to 1500 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmecs : America's First Civilization|authorlink= Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|pages=9–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it continued to consolidate itself up to the 12th century BCE. Its principal sites were [[La Venta]], [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán|San Lorenzo]], and [[Tres Zapotes]] in the core region. However, throughout Mesoamerica numerous sites show evidence of Olmec occupation, especially in the [[Balsas River|Balsas]] river basin, where [[Teopantecuanitlan]] is located. This site is quite enigmatic, since it dates from several centuries earlier than the main populations of the Gulf, a fact which has continued to cause controversy and given rise to the hypothesis that the Olmec culture originated in that region.
[[File:Olmeca head in Villahermosa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec head]], '''La Venta''']]
Among the best-known expressions of Olmec culture are giant stone heads, sculptured monoliths up to three metres in height and several tons in weight. These feats of Olmec stonecutting are especially impressive when one considers that Mesoamericans lacked iron tools and that the heads are at sites dozens of kilometers from the quarries where their [[basalt]] was mined. The function of these monuments is unknown. Some authors propose that they were commemorative monuments for notable players of the ballgame, and others that they were images of the Olmec governing elite.

The Olmec are also known for their small carvings made of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] and other [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstones]]. So many of the Olmec figurines and sculptures contain representations of the [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|were-jaguar]], that, according to [[José María Covarrubias]], they could be forerunners of the worship of the rain god, or maybe a predecessor of the future [[Tezcatlipoca]] in his manifestation as Tepeyolohtli, the "Heart of the Mountain"

The exact causes of the Olmec decline are unknown.

In the Pacific lowlands of the Maya Area, [[Takalik Abaj]] c. 800 BCE, [[Izapa]] c. 700 BCE, and [[Chocola]] c. 600 BCE, along with [[Kaminaljuyú]] c. 800 BCE, in the central Highlands of Guatemala, advanced in the direction of what would be the Classic Maya culture. Apart from the West, where the tradition of the [[Tumbas de tiro]] had taken root, in all the regions of Mesoamerica the cities grew in wealth, with monumental constructions carried out according to urban plans that were surprisingly complex. La Danta in [[El Mirador]], the [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] murals, and the circular pyramid of Cuicuilco date from this time, as do the central plaza of Monte Albán and the Pyramid of the Moon in [[Teotihuacan]].

Toward the end of the Preclassic period, political and commercial hegemony shifted to the population centers in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Around [[Lake Texcoco]] there existed a number of villages that grew into true cities: Tlatilco and Cuicuilco are examples. The former was found on the northern bank of the lake, while the latter was on the slopes of the mountainous region of [[Ajusco]]. Tlatilco maintained strong relationships with the cultures of the West, so much so that Cuicuilco controlled commerce in the Maya area, Oaxaca, and the Gulf coast. The rivalry between the two cities ended with the decline of Tlatilco. Meanwhile, at Monte Albán in Oaxaca, the Zapotec had begun developing culturally independent of the Olmec, adopting aspects of that culture and making their own contributions as well.
In Peten, the great Classic Maya cities of [[Tikal]], [[Uaxactun]], and [[Seibal]], began their growth at c. 300 BCE.

Cuicuilco's hegemony over the valley declined in the period 100 BCE to 1 CE. As Cuicuilco declined, Teotihuacan began to grow in importance. The next two centuries marked the period in which the so-called ''City of the gods'' consolidated its power, becoming the premier Mesoamerican city of the first millennium, and the principal political, economic, and cultural center in Central Mexico for the next seven centuries.

===Classic period===
[[File:Classic sites 1.png|thumb|Important Classic Era settlements, circa 500 CE]]
[[File:Monte Alban.jpg|thumb|Central Plaza of [[Monte Albán]], a city constructed on a hill that dominates the Central Valley of Oaxaca]]
[[File:Tikal.jpg|thumb|Temple 2, [[Tikal]], Guatemala]]

The Classic period of Mesoamerica includes the years from 250 to 900 CE. The end point of this period varied from region to region: for example, in the center of Mexico it is related to the fall of the regional centers of the late Classic (sometimes called Epiclassic) period, towards the year 900; in the Gulf, with the decline of [[El Tajín]], in the year 800; in the Mayan area, with the abandonment of the highland cities in the 9th century; and in Oaxaca, with the disappearance of Monte Albán around 850. Normally, the Classic period in Mesoamerica is characterized as the stage in which the arts, science, urbanism, architecture, and social organization reached their peak. This period was also dominated by the influence of [[Teotihuacan]] throughout the region, and the competition between the different Mesoamerican states led to continuous warfare.

This period of Mesoamerican history can be divided into three phases. Early, from 250 to 550 CE; Middle, from 550 to 700; and Late, from 700 to 900. The early Classic period began with the expansion of Teotihuacan, which led to its control over the principal trade routes of northern Mesoamerica. During this time, the process of urbanization that started in the last centuries of the early Preclassic period was consolidated. The principal centers of this phase were [[Monte Albán]], [[Kaminaljuyu]], [[Seibal|Ceibal]], [[Tikal]], and [[Calakmul]], and then Teotihuacan, in which 80 percent of the 200,000 inhabitants of the [[Lake Texcoco]] basin were concentrated.

The cities of this era were characterized by their multi-ethnic composition, which entailed the cohabitation in the same population centers of people with different languages, cultural practices, and places of origin. During this period the alliances between the regional political elites were strengthened, especially for those allied with Teotihuacan. Also, social differentiation became more pronounced: a small dominant group ruled over the majority of the population. This majority was forced to pay tribute and to participate in the building of public structures such as irrigation systems, religious edifices, and means of communication. The growth of the cities could not have happened without advances in agricultural methods and the strengthening of trade networks involving not only the peoples of Mesoamerica, but also the distant cultures of [[Oasisamerica]].

The arts of Mesoamerica reached their high-point in this era. Especially notable are the Mayan [[stelae]] (carved pillars), exquisite monuments commemorating the stories of the Royal families, the rich corpus of polychrome ceramics, mural painting, and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_art.htm Maya Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005004644/http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_art.htm |date=2007-10-05 }}, authenticmaya.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Teotihuacan, architecture made great advances: the Classic style was defined by the construction of pyramidal bases that sloped upward in a step-wise fashion. The Teotihuacan architectural style was reproduced and modified in other cities throughout Mesoamerica, the clearest examples being the Zapotec capital of Monte Alban and [[Kaminal Juyú]] in Guatemala. Centuries later, long after Teotihuacan was abandoned c. 700 CE, cities of the Postclassic era followed the style of Teotihuacan construction, especially [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]], [[Tenochtitlan]], and [[Chichén Itzá]].

Many scientific advances were also achieved during this period. The Maya refined their calendar, script, and [[mathematics]] to their highest level of development. Writing came to be used throughout the Mayan area, although it was still regarded as a noble activity and practiced only by noble scribes, painters, and priests. Using a similar system of writing, other cultures developed their own scripts, the most notable examples being those of the [[Cerro de las Minas#Ñuiñe Phase|Ñuiñe]] culture and the Zapotecs of Oaxaca, although the Mayan system was the only fully developed writing system in Precolumbian America. Astronomy remained a matter of vital significance because of its importance for agriculture, the economic basis of Mesoamerican society, and to predict events in the future such as lunar and solar eclipses, an important feature for the rulers, proving to the commoners their links with the heavenly world.

The Middle Classic period ended in Northern Mesoamerica with the decline of Teotihuacan. This allowed other regional power centers to flourish and compete for control of trade routes and natural resources. In this way the late Classic era commenced. Political fragmentation during this era meant no city had complete hegemony. Various population movements occurred, caused by the incursion of groups from [[Aridoamerica]] and other northern regions, who pushed the older populations of Mesoamerica south. Among these new groups were the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], who would later found the cities of Tula and Tenochtitlan, the two most important capitals of the Postclassic era. In addition, southern peoples established themselves in the center of Mexico, including the Olmec-Xicalanca, who came from the Yucatán Peninsula and founded [[Cacaxtla]] and [[Xochicalco]].
[[File:Pinturas 3.JPG|thumb|Mural of the Portic A, in Cacaxtla, Tlaxcala]]
In the Maya region, [[Tikal]], an ally of Teotihuacan, experienced a decline, the so-called Tikal Hiatus, after being defeated by [[Dos Pilas]], and [[Caracol]], ally of [[Calakmul]], lasted about another 100 years. During this hiatus, the cities of Dos Pilas, [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], [[Caracol]], Calakmul, [[Palenque]], [[Copán]], and [[Yaxchilán]] were consolidated. These and other city-states of the region found themselves involved in bloody wars with changing alliances, until Tikal defeated, in order, Dos Pilas, Caracol, with the help of [[Yaxha]] and [[Naranjo|El Naranjo]], [[El Perú, Guatemala|Waka]], Calakmul's last ally, and finally Calakmul itself, an event that took place in 732 with the sacrifice of Yuknom Cheen's son in Tikal. That led to construction of monumental architecture in Tikal, from 740 to 810; the last date documented there was 899. The ruin of the Classic Maya civilization in the northern lowlands, begun at La Passion states such as Dos Pilas, [[Aguateca]], [[Seibal|Ceibal]] and [[Cancuen]], c. 760, followed by the [[Usumacinta]] system cities of Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, and Palenque, following a path from south to north.

Toward the end of the late Classic period, the Maya stopped recording the years using the Long Count calendar, and many of their cities were burned and abandoned to the jungle. Meanwhile, in the Southern Highlands, [[Kaminal Juyú]] continued its growth until 1200. In Oaxaca, Monte Alban reached its apex c. 750 and finally succumbed toward the end of the 9th century for reasons that are still unclear. Its fate was not much different from that of other cities such as [[La Quemada]] in the north and Teotihuacan in the center: it was burned and abandoned. In the last century of the Classic era, hegemony in the valley of Oaxaca passed to [[Lambityeco]], several kilometers to the east.

====Teotihuacan====
{{Main|Teotihuacan}}
[[File:Mexico0047.jpg|thumb|View of the Calzada de los Muertos (''Avenue of the Dead'') from the Pyramid of the Moon, Teotihuacan, Mexico]]

Teotihuacan ("The City of the Gods" in [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]) originated toward the end of the Preclassic period, c. 100 CE. Very little is known about its founders, but it is believed that the [[Otomi people|Otomí]] had an important role in the city's development, as they did in the ancient culture of the Valley of Mexico, represented by [[Tlatilco]]. Teotihuacan initially competed with [[Cuicuilco]] for hegemony in the area. In this political and economic battle, Teotihuacan was aided by its control of the [[obsidian]] deposits in the [[Navaja]] mountains in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. The decline of Cuicuilco is still a mystery, but it is known that a large part of the former inhabitants resettled in Teotihuacan some years before the eruption of [[Xitle]], which covered the southern town in lava.

Once free of competition in the area of the Lake of Mexico, Teotihuacan experienced an expansion phase that made it one of the largest cities of its time, not just in Mesoamerica but in the entire world. During this period of growth, it attracted the vast majority of those then living in the Valley of Mexico.

Teotihuacan was completely dependent on agricultural activity, primarily the cultivation of [[maize]], [[bean]]s, and [[calabaza|squash]], the Mesoamerican agricultural trinity. However, its political and economic hegemony was based on outside goods for which it enjoyed a monopoly: Anaranjado ceramics, produced in the Poblano-Tlaxcalteca valley, and the mineral deposits of the Hidalgan mountains. Both were highly valued throughout Mesoamerica and were exchanged for luxury merchandise of the highest caliber, from places as far away as [[New Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. Because of this, Teotihuacan became the hub of the Mesoamerican trade network. Its partners were Monte Albán and Tikal in the southeast, [[Matacapan]] on the Gulf coast, [[Altavista (Zacatecas)|Altavista]] in the north, and [[Tingambato]] in the west.

Teotihuacan refined the Mesoamerican [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of deities, whose origins dated from the time of the Olmec. Of special importance were the worship of [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Tláloc]], agricultural deities. Trade links promoted the spread of these cults to other Mesoamerican societies, who took and transformed them. It was thought that Teotihuacan society had no knowledge of writing, but as Duverger demonstrates, the writing system of Teotihuacan was extremely pictographic, to the point that writing was confused with drawing.

The fall of Teotihuacan is associated with the emergence of city-states within the confines of the central area of Mexico. It is thought that these were able to flourish due to the decline of Teotihuacan, though events may have occurred in the opposite order: the cities of [[Cacaxtla]], [[Xochicalco]], [[Teotenango]], and [[El Tajín]] may have first increased in power and then were able to economically strangle Teotihuacan, trapped as it was in the center of the valley without access to trade routes. This occurred around 600 CE, and even though people continued to live there for another century and a half, the city was eventually destroyed and abandoned by its inhabitants, who took refuge in places such as [[Pueblo Culhuacán|Culhuacán]] and [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]], on the shores of Lake Texcoco.

====The Maya in the Classic period====
{{Main|Maya civilization}}
[[File:Mayas en.PNG|thumb|Location of the Mayan people and their principal cities]]

The Maya created one of the most developed and best-known Mesoamerican cultures. Although authors such as Michael D. Coe believe that the Mayan culture is completely different from the surrounding cultures, many elements present in Maya culture are shared by the rest of Mesoamerica, however, including the use of two calendars, the base 20 number system, the cultivation of corn, [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]], and certain myths, such as that of the fifth sun and cultic worship, including that of the [[Quetzalcoatl|Feathered Serpent]] and the rain god, who in the [[Yucatec Maya language]] is called [[Chaac]].

The beginnings of Mayan culture date from the development of [[Kaminaljuyu]], in the Highlands of Guatemala, during the middle Preclassic period. According to [[Richard D. Hansen]] and others researchers, the first true political states in Mesoamerica consisted of [[Takalik Abaj]], in the Pacific Lowlands, and the cities of [[El Mirador]], [[Nakbe]], [[Cival]] and [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], among others, in [[the Mirador Basin]] and [[Petén Basin|Peten]]. Archaeologists believe that this development happened centuries later, around the 1st century BCE, but recent research in the Petén basin and [[Belize]] have proven them wrong. The archaeological evidence indicates that the Maya never formed a united empire; they were instead organized into small chiefdoms that were constantly at war. López Austin and López Luján have said that the Preclassic Maya were characterized by their bellicose nature. They probably had a greater mastery of the art of war than Teotihuacan, yet the idea that they were a peaceful society given to religious contemplation, which persists to this day, was particularly promoted by early- and mid-20th century [[Mayanist]]s such as [[Sylvanus G. Morley]] and [[J. Eric S. Thompson]]. Confirmation that the Maya practiced human sacrifice and ritual [[cannibalism]] came much later (e.g. by the murals of [[Bonampak]]).

[[File:Palenque Relief.jpg|thumb|upright|Bas-relief in the museum of Palenque, Chiapas]]

Writing and the [[Maya calendar]] were quite early developments in the great Maya cities, c. 1000 BCE, and some of the oldest commemorative monuments are from sites in the Maya region. Archaeologists once thought that the Maya sites functioned only as ceremonial centers and that the common people lived in the surrounding villages. However, more recent excavations indicate the Maya sites enjoyed urban services as extensive as those of Tikal, believed to be as large as 400,000 inhabitants at its peak, circa 750, [[Copan]], and others. Drainage, aqueducts, and pavement, or Sakbe, meaning "white road", united major centers since the Preclassic. The construction of these sites was carried out on the basis of a highly stratified society, dominated by the noble class, who at the same time were the political, military, and religious elite.

The elite controlled agriculture, practiced by means of mixed systems of ground-clearing, and intensive platforms around the cities. As in the rest of Mesoamerica, they imposed on the lowest classes taxes&amp;mdash;in kind or in labor&amp;mdash;that permitted them to concentrate sufficient resources for the construction of public monuments, which legitimized the [[Political power|power]] of the elites and the social hierarchy. During the Early Classic Period, c. 370, the Mayan political elite sustained strong ties to Teotihuacan, and it is possible that Tikal may have been an important ally of Teotihuacan that controlled commerce with the Gulf coast and highlands. Finally, it seems the great drought that ravaged Central America in the 9th century, internal wars, ecological disasters, and famine destroyed the Mayan political system, which led to popular uprisings and the defeat of the dominant political groups. Many cities were abandoned, remaining unknown until the 19th century, when descendants of the Maya led a group of European and American archaeologists to these cities, which had been swallowed over the centuries by the jungle.

===Postclassic period===
[[File:Vessel with Codex-Style Scene LACMA M.2000.86 (1 of 13).jpg|thumb|Codex vessel of the Mixtec culture, in the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]]]]
The Postclassic period is the time between the year 900 and the conquest of Mesoamérica by the Spaniards, which occurred between 1521 and 1697. It was a period in which [[military]] activity became of great importance. The political elites associated with the priestly class were relieved of power by groups of warriors. In turn, at least a half century before the arrival of the Spaniards, the warrior class was yielding its positions of privilege to a very powerful group that were unconnected to the nobility: the ''[[pochtecas]]'', merchants who obtained great political power by virtue of their economic power.

The Postclassic period is divided into two phases. The first is the early Postclassic, which includes the 10th to the 13th century, and is characterized by the Toltec hegemony of Tula. The 12th century marks the beginning of the late Postclassic period, which begins with the arrival of the [[Chichimec]], linguistically related to the Toltecs and the [[Mexica]], who established themselves in the Valley of Mexico in 1325, following a two-century pilgrimage from [[Aztlán]], the exact location of which is unknown. Many of the social changes of this final period of Mesoamerican civilization are related to the migratory movements of the northern peoples. These peoples came from Oasisamerica, Aridoamerica, and the northern region of Mesoamerica, driven by climate changes that threatened their survival. The migrations from the north caused, in turn, the displacement of peoples who had been rooted in Mesoamerica for centuries; some of them left for Centroamerica.

There were many cultural changes during that time. One of them was the expansion of metallurgy, imported from South America, and whose oldest remnants in Mesoamerica come from the West, as is the case also with ceramics. The Mesoamericans did not achieve great facility with metals; in fact, their use was rather limited (a few copper axes, needles, and above all jewellery). The most advanced techniques of Mesoamerican metallurgy were developed by the [[mixteca|mixtecos]], who produced fine, exquisitely handcrafted articles. Remarkable advances were made in architecture as well. The use of nails in architecture was introduced to support the sidings of the temples, mortar was improved, the use of columns and stone roofs was widespread &amp;mdash; something that only the Maya had used during the Classic period. In agriculture, the system of irrigation became more complex; in the Valley of Mexico especially, [[chinampa]]s were used extensively by the Mexica, who built a city of 200,000 around them.
[[File:Xochimilco.jpg|right|thumb|Present day view of the chinampas of [[Xochimilco]], in the Federal District]]

The political system also underwent important changes. During the early Postclassic period, the warlike political elites legitimized their position by means of their adherence to a complex set of religious beliefs that López Austin called ''zuyuanidad''. According to this system, the ruling classes proclaimed themselves the descendants of [[Quetzalcoatl]], the Plumed Serpent, one of the creative forces, and a cultural hero in Mesoamerican mythology. They likewise declared themselves the heirs of a no less mythical city, called [[Tollan]] in Nahuatl, and Zuyuá in Maya (from which López Austin derives the name for the belief system). Many of the important capitals of the time identified themselves with this name (for example, Tollan Xicocotitlan, [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Tollan Chollollan]], [[Teotihuacan|Tollan Teotihuacan]]). The Tollan of myth was for a long time identified with Tula, in Hidalgo state, but Enrique Florescano and López Austin have claimed that this has no basis. Florescano states that the mythical Tollan was Teotihuacan; López Austin argues that Tollan was simply a product of the Mesoamerican religious imagination. Another feature of the ''zuyuano'' system was the formation of alliances with other city-states that were controlled by groups having the same ideology; such was the case with the [[League of Mayapán]] in Yucatán, and the Mixtec confederation of [[Eight Deer Jaguar Claw|Lord Eight Deer]], based in the mountains of Oaxaca. These early Postclassic societies can be characterized by their military nature and multi-ethnic populations.

[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|[[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Pillars of Tula]], in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]]]
However, the fall of Tula checked the power of the ''zuyuano'' system, which finally broke down with the dissolution of the League of Mayapán, the Mixtec state, and the abandonment of Tula. Mesoamerica received new immigrants from the north, and although these groups were related to the ancient Toltecs, they had a completely different ideology than the existing residents. The final arrivals were the Mexica, who established themselves on a small island on Lake Texcoco under the dominion of the Texpanecs of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]]. This group would, in the following decades, conquer a large part of Mesoamerica, creating a united and centralized state whose only rivals were the [[Tarascan state]] of [[Michoacán]]. Neither one of them could defeat the other, and it seems that a type of non-aggression pact was established between the two peoples. When the Spaniards arrived many of the peoples controlled by the Mexica no longer wished to continue under their rule. Therefore, they took advantage of the opportunity presented by the Europeans, agreeing to support them, thinking that in return they would gain their freedom, and not knowing that this would lead to the subjugation of all of the Mesoamerican world.

====Aztec====
{{Main|Aztec|Mexica}}
[[File:Mesoamérica y Centroamerica prehispanica siglo XVI.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Mesoamerica and Central America in the 16th century before the arrival of the Spanish.]]
Of all [[Pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] Mesoamerican cultures, the best-known is the [[Mexica]] of the [[altepetl|city-state]] of [[Tenochtitlan]], also known as the [[Aztec]]s. The [[Aztec Empire]] dominated central Mexico for close to a century before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]] (1519-1521). 

The Mexica people came from the north or the west of Mesoamerica. The Nayaritas believed that the mythic [[Aztlán]] was located on the island of [[Mexcaltitán]]. Some hypothesize that this mythical island could have been located somewhere in the state of the [[Zacatecas]], and it has even been proposed that it was as far north as New Mexico. Whatever the case, they were probably not far removed from the classic Mesoamerican tradition. In fact, they shared many characteristics with the people of central Mesoamerica. The Mexicas spoke [[Nahuatl]], the same language spoken by the Toltecs and the Chichimecs who came before them.

The date of the departure from Aztlán is debated, with suggested dates of 1064, 1111 and 1168.&lt;ref name="Miner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miner|first1=Dylan|title=Creating Aztlán: Chicano Art, Indigenous Sovereignty, and Lowriding Across Turtle Island|date=2014|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0816530038|page=223|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QNBjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=departure+from+Aztl%C3%A1n+i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiekJrvnorZAhVOSsAKHVc3CycQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=departure%20from%20Aztl%C3%A1n%20i&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After much wandering, the Mexicas arrived at the basin of the [[Valley of Mexico]] in the 14th century. They established themselves at various points along the bank of the river (for example, [[Pueblo Culhuacán|Culhuacán]] and Tizapán), before settling on the Islet of Mexico, protected by [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozómoc]], king of the Texpanecas. The city of Tenochtitlan was founded in 1325 as an ally of Azcapotzalco, but less than a century later, in 1430, the Mexicas joined with [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlacopan]] to wage war against Azcapotzalco and emerged victorious. This gave birth to the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] that replaced the ancient confederation ruled by the Tecpanecas (which included [[Coatlinchan]] and Culhuacán).

In the earliest days of the Triple Alliance, the Mexica initiated an expansionist phase that led them to control a good part of Mesoamerica. During this time only a few regions retained their independence: [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] (Nahua), Meztitlán (Otomí), Teotitlán del Camino ([[Cuicatec]]), [[Tututepec]] ([[Mixtec]]), [[Tehuantepec]] ([[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]]), and the northwest (ruled at that time by their rivals, the [[Tarascan state|Tarascan]]s). The provinces controlled by the Triple Alliance were forced to pay a tribute to [[Tenochtitlan]]; these payments are recorded in another codex known as the Matrícula de los tributos (Registry of Tribute). This document specifies the quantity and type of every item that each province had to pay to the Mexicas.

The Mexica state was conquered by the Spanish forces of [[Hernán Cortés]] and their [[Tlaxcala]]n and [[Totonac]]an allies in 1521. The defeat of Mesoamerica was complete when, in 1697, [[Tayasal]] was burned and razed by the Spanish.

==Postconquest era==

===Colonial Period, 1521-1821===
With the destruction of the superstructure of the Aztec Empire in 1521, central Mexico was brought under the control of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Over the course of the succeeding decades, virtually all of Mesoamerica was brought under Spanish control, which resulted in a fairly uniform policies toward indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = William B. |last = Taylor| authorlink = William B.

MacLeod|year=2000|title=Mesoamerica since the Spanish Invasion: An Overview|journal = The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas| volume=2|pages=1-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spaniards' established the fallen Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] as [[Mexico City]], the seat of government for the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. The great initial project for Spanish conquerors was converting the indigenous peoples to [[History of the Catholic Church in Mexico|Christianity]], the only permitted religion. This endeavor was undertaken by Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian friars immediately after conquest. Divvying up of the spoils of the war was of key interest to the Spanish conquerors. The major ongoing benefit to conquerors after the obvious material plunder was to appropriate the existing system of tribute and obligatory labor to the Spanish victors. This was done by the establishment of the ''[[encomienda]]'', which awarded the tribute and labor from individual indigenous polities to particular Spanish conquerors. In that way, the economic and political arrangements at the level of the indigenous community were largely kept intact. The indigenous polity (''[[altepetl]]'') in the [[Nahua]] area, ''cah'' in the Maya region was the key to cultural survival of indigenous under Spanish rule, while at the same time also providing the structure for their economic exploitation.  Spaniards classified all [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous peoples]] as "Indians" (''indios''), a term that the indigenous peoples never embraced. They were classified legally as being under the jurisdiction of the ''[[:es:República de indios en la Nueva España|República de Indios]]''. They were legally separated from the ''República de Españoles'', which comprised Europeans, Africans, and mixed-race [[castas]]. In general, indigenous communities in Mesoamerica kept much of their prehispanic social and political structures, with indigenous elites continuing to function as leaders in their communities. These elites acted as intermediaries with the Spanish crown, so long as they remained loyal.  There were significant changes in Mesoamerican communities during the colonial era, but during the entire colonial period Mesoamericans were the largest single non-Hispanic group in the colonial Mexico, far larger than the entire Hispanic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Ida|last=Altman|author-link=Ida Altman| year=2003|title=The Early History of Greater Mexico|publisher=Prentice Hall|pages=143-161|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Spanish colonial system imposed many changes on Mesoamerican peoples, they did not force the acquisition of Spanish and [[Mesoamerican_languages#Colonial_period_(1521–1821)|Mesoamerican languages]] continued to flourish to the present day.

===Postcolonial Period, 1821-present===
Mexico became independent from Spain in 1821, with some participation of indigenous in decade-long political struggles, but for their own motivations. With the fall of colonial government, the Mexican state abolished distinctions between ethnic groups, that is the separate governance for indigenous populations in the ''República de Indios''. The new sovereign country made, in theory at least, all Mexicans citizens of the independent nation-state rather than vassals of the Spanish crown, with different legal standing. A long period of political chaos in the post-independence period among white elites largely did not affect indigenous peoples and their communities.  Mexican conservatives were largely in charge of the national government and kept in place practices from the old colonial order. However, in the 1850s, Mexican liberals gained power and attempted to formulate and implement reforms that did affect indigenous communities, as well as the Catholic Church.  The [[Mexican Constitution of 1857]] abolished the ability of corporations to hold land, which aimed at taking assets out of the hands of the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]] and forcing indigenous communities to divide their community-held lands. Liberals' aimed at turning indigenous community members pursuing subsistence farming into yeoman farmers holding their own land. Mexican conservatives repudiated the [[La Reforma|liberal reform laws]] since they attacked the Catholic Church, but indigenous communities also participated in a three-year [[War of the Reform|civil war]]. In the late nineteenth century, liberal army general [[Porfirio Díaz]], a [[Mestizo]] did much for modernizing Mexico and integrating it into the world economy, but there were renewed pressures on indigenous communities and their lands.  These exploded in certain areas of Mexico during the ten-year long civil war, the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1920). In the aftermath of the Revolution, the Mexican government attempted simultaneously shore up indigenous culture, while at the same time also attempting to integrate the indigenous as citizens of the nation, turning indigenous into peasants (''campesinos'').  This has proved more difficult than policy planners imagined, with resilient indigenous communities continuing to struggle for rights within the nation.

[[File:Muhajir.jpg|thumb|250px|Muhacirs arriving in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], in 1912.]]
'''Muhacir''' or '''Muhajir''', is a term used to refer to an estimated 10 million [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Muslim]] citizens, and their descendants born after the onset of the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, (including [[Albanian people|Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Greeks]], [[Circassians]], [[Crimean Tatars]] and [[Pomaks]]) who emigrated to [[Thrace]] and [[Anatolia]] from the late 18th century until the end of the 20th century, mainly to escape ongoing [[Persecution of Ottoman Muslims|persecution in their homelands]]. Today, between a third and a quarter of Turkey's population of almost 80 million have ancestor from among these Muhacirs.&lt;ref name="Bosma et al 2012 loc=17"/&gt;

Approximately 5-7 million Muslim migrants from the Balkans (from Bulgaria 1,150-1,500; Greece 1.2 million; Romania, 400,000, Yugoslavia, 800,000), Russia (500,000), the Caucasus (900,000 of whom 2/3 remained the rest going to Syrian, Jordan and Cyprus) and Syria (500,000 mostly as a result of the Syrian Civil War) arrived in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Anatolia]] and modern Turkey from 1783 to 2016 of whom 4 million came by 1924, 1.3 million came post-1934 to 1945 and more than 1.2 million before the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War (not counting 2 million Iranians). 170,000 Muslims were expelled from the part of Hungary taken by the Austrians from the Turks in 1699.

The influx of migration during the late 19th century and early 20th century was due to the loss of almost all Ottoman territory during the [[First Balkan War|Balkan War of 1912-13]] and [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Karpat 2004 loc=612"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karpat|2004|loc=612}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These Muhacirs, or refugees, saw the Ottoman Empire, and subsequently the [[Republic of Turkey]], as a protective "[[motherland]]".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 2012 loc=134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Armstrong|2012|loc=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Muhacir escaped to Anatolia as a result of the widespread [[persecution of Ottoman Muslims]] that occurred during the last years of the Ottoman Empire.

Thereafter, with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, a large influx of [[Turkish people|Turks]], as well as other Muslims, from the [[Balkans]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Caucasus]], the [[Aegean islands]], the island of [[Cyprus]], the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]] (İskenderun), the [[Middle East]], and the [[Soviet Union]] continued to arrive in the region, most of which settled in urban north-western Anatolia.&lt;ref name="Çaǧatay 2006 loc=82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Çaǧaptay|2006|loc=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bosma et al 2012 loc=17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosma|Lucassen|Oostindie|2012|loc=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 more than half a million ethnic Muslims of various nationalities arrived from Greece as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey (the population exchange was not based on ethnicity but religious affiliation). After 1925, Turkey continued to accept Turkic-speaking Muslims as immigrants and did not discourage the emigration of members of non-Turkic minorities. More than 90 percent of all immigrants arrived from the Balkan countries.  From 1934 till 1945, 229,870 refugees and immigrants came to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Secularism and Nationalism in Modern Turkey: Who is a Turk, Soner Cagaptay, page 1824,  2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1935 and 1940, for example, approximately 124,000 Bulgarians and Romanians of Turkish origin immigrated to Turkey, and between 1954 and 1956 about 35,000 Muslim Slavs immigrated from Yugoslavia. In the fifty-five-year period ending in 1980, Turkey admitted approximately 1.3 million immigrants; 36 percent came from Bulgaria, 25 percent from Greece{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, 22.1 percent from Yugoslavia, and 8.9 percent from Romania. These Balkan immigrants, as well as smaller numbers of Turkic immigrants from Cyprus and the Soviet Union, were granted full citizenship upon their arrival in Turkey. The immigrants were settled primarily in the [[Marmara Region|Marmara]] and [[aegean Region|Aegean]] regions (78 percent) and in [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolia]] (11.7 percent).

From the 1930s to 2016 migration added two million Muslims in Turkey. The majority of these immigrants were the [[Balkan Turks]] who faced harassment and discrimination in their homelands.&lt;ref name="Çaǧatay 2006 loc=82"/&gt; New waves of Turks and other Muslims expelled from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Yugoslavia]] between 1951 and 1953 were followed to Turkey by another exodus from Bulgaria in 1983-89, bringing the total of immigrants to nearly ten million people.&lt;ref name="Karpat 2004 loc=612"/&gt; 

More recently, [[Meskhetian Turks]] have emigrated to Turkey from the former [[Soviet Union]] states (particularly in [[Ukraine]] - after the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] in 2014), and many [[Iraqi Turkmen]] and [[Syrian Turkmen]] have taken refuge in Turkey due to the recent [[Iraq War]] (2003-2011) and [[Syrian Civil War]] (2011–present).

Initially, the first wave of migration occurred in 1830 when many [[Turks in Algeria|Algerian Turks]] were forced to leave the region once the French took control over Algeria; approximately 10,000 Turks were shipped off to [[Izmir]], in [[Turkey]], whilst many others also migrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Arabia]], and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Kateb 2001 loc=50-51"&gt;{{citation |last=Kateb|first=Kamel|year=2001|title=Européens: "Indigènes" et juifs en Algérie (1830-1962) : Représentations et Réalités des Populations|publisher=[[INED]]|isbn=273320145X|pages=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wave of immigrants from [[Bulgaria]] occurred during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]] when around 30,000 [[Bulgarian Turks]] arrived in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Heper|Criss|2009|loc=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave of about 750,000 immigrants left Bulgaria during  the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]], but approximately one-fourth of them died on the way.&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=92"/&gt; More than 200,000 of the rest remained inside the present borders of Turkey whilst the others were sent to other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=92"/&gt; The aftermath of the war led to major demographic restructuring of the ethnic and religious make-up of [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eminov|1997|loc=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these migrations, the percentage of Turks in Bulgaria was reduced from more than one-third of the population immediately after the Russo-Turkish War to 14.2% in 1900.&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eminov|1997|loc=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial numbers of Turks continued to emigrate to [[Turkey]] during, and following, the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], in accordance with compulsory exchange of population agreements between [[Greece]], Bulgaria, and Turkey. By 1934 the Turkish population fell to 9.7% of Bulgaria’s total population and continued to fall during the subsequent decades.&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=78"/&gt;

Communist rule after the [[Second World War]] ended most emigration from Bulgaria, but further bilateral agreements were negotiated in the early 1950s and late 1960s to regulate the outflow of Bulgarian Turks.&lt;ref name="van He 1998 loc=113"&gt;{{Harvnb|van He|1998|loc=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy taxation, nationalisation of private minority schools, and measures against the Turkish culture in the name of the  modernisation of Bulgaria, built up great pressure for the Turkish minority to emigrate and, when exit restrictions were relaxed in 1950, many ethnic Turks applied to leave. In August 1950 the Bulgarian government announced that 250,000 ethnic Turks had made applications to emigrate and pressured Turkey to accept them within three months.&lt;ref name="van He 1998 loc=113"/&gt; However, the Turkish authorities declared that the country could not accept these numbers in such a short time and closed its borders over the following year. In what was tantamount to an expulsion, pressure for ethnic Turks to leave continued, and by late 1951 some 155,000 Turks left Bulgaria. Most had abandoned their property or sold it at well below its value; most of these emigrants settled successfully primarily in the [[Marmara Region|Marmara]] and [[Aegean Region|Aegean]] regions, helped by the distribution of land and the provision of housing.&lt;ref name="van He 1998 loc=113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=208"&gt;{{Harvnb|Markova|2010|loc=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 another agreement was reached between the two countries, which allowed the departure of relatives of those who had left up to 1951 to unite with their divided families, and another 115,000 people left Bulgaria for Turkey between 1968-78. .&lt;ref name="van He 1998 loc=113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Markova|2010|loc=209}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest wave of Turkish emigration began with the mass exodus in 1989, known as the "[[big excursion]]", when the Bulgarian Turks fled to Turkey in order to escape a campaign of forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=78"/&gt; This marked a dramatic culmination of years of tension among the Turkish community, which intensified with the Bulgarian government's assimilation campaign in the winter of 1985 that attempted to make ethnic Turks change their names to Bulgarian Slavic names. The campaign began with a ban on wearing traditional Turkish dress, and speaking the [[Turkish language]] in public places, followed by the forced name-changing campaign.&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=209"/&gt; By May 1989, the Bulgarian authorities began to expel the Turks; when the Turkish government's efforts to negotiate with Bulgaria for an orderly migration failed, Turkey opened its borders to Bulgaria on 2 June 1989. However, on 21 August 1989, Turkey reintroduced immigration visa requirements for Bulgarian Turks. It was estimated that about 360,000 ethnic Turks had left for Turkey, though more than a third subsequently returned to Bulgaria once the ban on Turkish names had been revoked in December 1989.&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=209"/&gt; Nonetheless, once the Bulgarian communist regime fell, and Bulgarian citizens were allowed freedom of travel again, some 218,000 Bulgarians left the country for Turkey. The subsequent emigration wave was prompted by continuously deteriorating economic conditions; furthermore, the first democratic elections in 1990 won by the renamed communist party resulted in 88,000 people leaving the country, once again, most of them being Bulgarian Turks.&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=211"&gt;{{Harvnb|Markova|2010|loc=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, emigration to Turkey resumed at a greater rate. However, this time they were pushed by economic reasons since the country’s economic decline affected especially ethnically mixed regions.&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=212"&gt;{{Harvnb|Markova|2010|loc=212}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian Turks were left without state subsidies or other forms of state assistance and experienced deep recession.&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=212"/&gt; According to the 1992 census, some 344,849 Bulgarians of Turkish origin had migrated to Turkey between 1989 and 1992, which resulted in significant demographic decline in southern Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="Markova 2010 loc=212"/&gt;

==Caucasus==
Approximately 900,000 [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]] immigrated to [[Anatolia]] due to intermittent Russian attacks from 1768 to 1917; about two-thirds of them remained, and the rest were sent to [[Amman]], [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], and [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Heper|Criss|2009|loc=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimea==

From 1771 until the beginning of the 19th century approximately 500,000 [[Crimean Tatars]] arrived in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=91"/&gt;

==Cyprus==
{{see also|Turkish Cypriots}}
[[File:Türkiye’ye göç eden bir Kıbrıslı Türk ailesi (1930).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Turkish Cypriot]] family who migrated to Turkey in 1935.]]
The first wave of immigration from [[Cyprus]] occurred in 1878 when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] were obliged to lease the island to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]; at that time, 15,000 [[Turkish Cypriots]] moved to [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=92"/&gt; The flow of Turkish Cypriot emigration to [[Turkey]] continued in the aftermath of the [[First World War]], and gained its greatest velocity in the mid-1920s, and continued, at fluctuating speeds during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Nevzat 2005 loc=276"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish Cypriot migration has continued since the [[Cyprus conflict]].

Economic motives played an important part in the Turkish Cypriot migration wave as conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh. Enthusiasm to emigrate to Turkey was inflated by the euphoria that greeted the birth of the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land.&lt;ref name="Nevzat 2005 loc=276"/&gt; The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Nevzat 2005 loc=280"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The press in Turkey reported in mid-1927 that of those who had opted for Turkish nationality, 5,000–6,000 Turkish Cypriots had already settled in Turkey. However, many Turkish Cypriots had already emigrated even before the rights accorded to them under the Treaty of Lausanne had come into force.&lt;ref name="Nevzat 2005 loc=281"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. John-Jones tried to accurately estimate the true demographic impact of Turkish Cypriot emigration to Turkey between 1881-1931. He supposed that:
{{Quotation|"[I]f the Turkish-Cypriot community had, like the Greek-Cypriots, increased by 101 per cent between 1881 and 1931, it would have totalled 91,300 in 1931 – 27,000 more than the number enumerated. Is it possible that so many Turkish-Cypriots emigrated in the fifty-year period? Taken together, the considerations just mentioned suggest that it probably was. From a base of 45,000 in 1881, emigration of anything like 27,000 persons seems huge, but after subtracting the known 5,000 of the 1920s, the balance represents an average annual outflow of some 500 – not enough, probably, to concern the community’s leaders, evoke official comment, or be documented in any way which survives today".&lt;ref name="St. John-Jones 1983 loc=56"&gt;{{Harvnb|St. John-Jones|1983|loc=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Ali Suat Bilge, taking into consideration the mass migrations of 1878, the First World War, the 1920s early Turkish Republican era, and the Second World War, overall, a total of approximately 100,000 Turkish Cypriots had left the island for Turkey between 1878-1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bilge|first=Ali Suat|year=1961|title= Le Conflit de Chypre et les Chypriotes Turcs|page=5|publisher=Ajans Türk}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 31, 1955, a statement by Turkey's Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister, [[Fatin Rüştü Zorlu]], at the London Conference on Cyprus, stated that: 
{{Quotation|Consequently, today [1955] as well, when we take into account the state of the population in Cyprus, it is not sufficient to say, for instance, that 100,000 Turks live there. One should rather say that 100,000 out of 24,000,000 Turks live there and that 300,000 Turkish Cypriots live in various parts of Turkey.&lt;ref name=OPSI&gt;{{cite journal |journal=H.M.

By 2001 the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey.&lt;ref name=TRNCInfo&gt;{{cite web|author=TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs|title=Briefing Notes on the Cyprus Issue|url=http://www.trncinfo.com/tanitma/en/index.asp?sayfa=cms&amp;dmid=0&amp;cmsid=214&amp;ssid=556095671|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mübadil GENCER Ailesi-(1923).jpg|thumb|250px|A Turkish family from [[Crete]] settled in [[Izmir]], 1923.]]
The immigration of the [[Turkish people|Turks]] from [[Greece]] started in the early 1820s upon the establishment of an independent Greece in 1829. By the end of [[World War I]] approximately 800,000 Turks had immigrated to Turkey from Greece.&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=92"/&gt; Then, in accordance with the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]], under the 1923 [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] agreed to the compulsory [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|exchange of ethnic populations]]. The term "[[Mübadil]]" was used to refer specifically to this migration. Between 350,000 and 500,000 [[Muslim]] "[[Turkish people|Turks]]" emigrated from Greece to Turkey, and about 1.3 million [[Orthodox Christian]] "[[Greeks]]" from Turkey moved to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chenoweth|Lawrence|2010|loc=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Greek" and "Turkish" was defined by religion rather than linguistically or culturally.&lt;ref name="Corni &amp; Stark 2008 loc=8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Corni|Stark|2008|loc=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Article 1 of the Convention "…There shall take place a compulsory exchange of Turkish nationals of the Greek Orthodox religion established in Turkish territory, and of Greek nationals of the Muslim religion established in Greek territory. These persons shall not return to live in Turkey or Greece without the authorization of the Turkish government or of the Greek government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations|1923|loc=Article 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''[[The Times]]'' on December 5, 1923, stated that:  
{{Quotation|"…This transfer of populations is made especially difficult by the fact that few if any of the Turks in Greece desire to leave and most of them will resort to every possible expedient to avoid being sent away. A thousand Turks who voluntarily emigrated from [[Crete]] to [[Smyrna]] have sent several deputations to the Greek government asking to be allowed to return. Groups of Turks from all parts of Greece have submitted petitions for exemption. A few weeks ago, a group of [[Cretan Turks|Turks from Crete]] came to [[Athens]] with a request that they be [[baptized]] into the [[Greek church]] and thus be entitled to consideration as Greeks. The government however declined to permit this evasion."&lt;ref name="Clark 2007 loc=158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2007|loc=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The only exclusions from the forced transfer were the Greeks living in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and the [[Turks of Western Thrace]].&lt;ref name="Corni &amp; Stark 2008 loc=8"/&gt; The remaining Turks living in Greece have since continuously emigrated to [[Turkey]], a process which has been facilitated by Article 19 of the [[Greek Nationality Law]] which the Greek state has used to deny re-entry of Turks who leave the country, even for temporary periods, and deprived them of their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Poulton|1997|loc=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1923, between 300,000 and 400,000 [[Turks of Western Thrace]] left the region, most of the went to [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration from [[Romania]] to [[Anatolia]] dates back to the early 1800s when the Russian armies made advances into the region. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, the greatest waves of immigration took place in 1826 when approximately 200,000 people arrived in [[Turkey]] and then in 1878-1880 with 90,000 arrivals.&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=92"/&gt; Following the Republican period, an agreement made, on September 4, 1936, between Romania and Turkey allowed 70,000 [[Romanian Turks]] to leave the [[Dobruja]] region for Turkey.&lt;ref name="Corni &amp; Stark 2008 loc=55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Corni|Stark|2008|loc=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, inhabitants living in the Turkish [[exclave]] of [[Ada Kaleh]] were forced to leave the island when it was destroyed in order to build the [[Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station]], which caused the extinction of the local community through the migration of all individuals to different parts of Romania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="Bercovici 2012 loc=169"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bercovici|2012|loc=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration from [[Yugoslavia]] started in the 1800s as a consequence of the Russian-supported Serb rebellions. Approximately 150,000 Turks immigrated to [[Anatolia]] in 1826, and then, in 1867, a similar number of Turks moved to Anatolia.&lt;ref name="Heper &amp; Criss 2009 loc=92"/&gt; In 1862–67 Muslim exiles from the [[Principality of Serbia]] settled in the [[Bosnia Vilayet]].&lt;ref&gt;Bandžović, Safet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Nathaniel Mtui''' was a [[Tanzanian]] historian of Chagga origin born in 1892 in the mtaa of Mshiri in [[Marangu]], [[Kilimanjaro Region]], [[Tanzania]]. He was a teacher at the Colonial German Lutheran mission in Marangu. He is known for being the first person of Chagga origin to write history of the [[Chagga people]]. He wrote the Chaggan history in [[Kichagga]], [[German language|German]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] from 1913-1916. During the German occupation he wrote for German Lutheran pastors, Johannes Raum and Bruno Gutmann, who then used Mtui's notes for their own books on the Chagga people. During the British occupation Nathaniel was hired by Major Dundas, paying him 16 shillings for each full note book wrote about the Chaggan people. No one knows how many note books Mtui wrote for the 3 men, as many are missing, Gutmann preserved 9 of Mtui's note books. These 9 of Mtui's notebooks focus more on the histories of the central and eastern [[Chaggaland]]. Mtui died in 1927 at the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, Kathleen Mary (1964).

The '''Parliament of Navarre and Béarn''' ''(French: "Parlement de Navarre et de Béarn", alias "Parlement de Navarre séant à Pau", alias "Parlement de Pau")'' was created in 1620 out of the merger of the ''Conseil Souverain of Béarn'' and the ''Chancery of Navarre'', with its subordinated offices,&lt;ref name="Expilly (1763), p. 500"&gt;Expilly (1763), p. 500 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9lg_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA499 (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Louis XIII of France]], following the incorporation of [[Viscountcy of Béarn|Béarn]] and [[Lower Navarre]] into the crown lands of [[France]].

It was composed of a first president ''(French: premier président)'' appointed by the king, seven ''présidents à mortier'', forty-six counsellors ''(French: conseillers)'', two attorneys general ''(French: avocat général)'', one prosecutor general ''(French: procureur général)''. It was initially divided into three ''Chambres'' called the First Bureau ''(French: Premier Bureau)'', Second Bureau ''(French: Second Bureau)'' and the ''Tournelle''.&lt;ref name="Expilly (1763), p. 500" /&gt;

The ''Edict of 1691'' further merged the [[Chambre des Comptes of Navarre]] and the subordinated Royal [[Mint of Navarre and Béarn]], creating a fourth ''Chambre'' called the ''Chambre des Comptes''.&lt;ref name="Expilly (1763), p. 500" /&gt; The same edict also folded in the ''Pays de Soule'', previously under the ''Parliament of Guyenne'' in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name="Expilly (1763), p. 500" /&gt; The new entity was called the '''Cour de Parlement, Comptes, Aides et Finance de Navarre'''.&lt;ref name="Blanchet (1893), p. 3"&gt;Blanchet (1893), p. 3 [https://archive.org/stream/numismatiquedub00schlgoog#page/n21/mode/2up (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Parliament of Navarre and Béarn'' was politically and judicially responsible for five [[seneschals]] ''(French: sénéchaussées)'' in [[Béarn]], Pau, Oloron, Orthez, Morlaàs and Sauveterre, as well as all of the [[merindad]] of [[Lower Navarre]] and the ''Pays de [[Soule]]''.&lt;ref name="Expilly (1763), p. 500" /&gt;

It was housed in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau's]] old courthouse, the ''Palais de Justice'', built in 1585 by order of [[Henry III of Navarre]], on the prior location of the house of the [[Bishop of Lescar]] and St. Martin's Cemetery. The main building was destroyed by fire 1716. Despite a reconstruction project planned on the edge of the ''Place Royale'', it was rebuilt on its original site in 1722.

The ''Parliament of Navarre and Béarn'' was disbanded in 1789 as a result of the [[French Revolution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2540">'''Postanalytic philosophy''' describes a detachment from the mainstream philosophical movement of [[analytic philosophy]], which is the predominant school of thought in [[English-speaking countries]]. Postanalytic philosophy derives mainly from contemporary American thought, especially from the works of philosophers [[Richard Rorty]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], and [[Stanley Cavell]]. The term is closely associated with the much broader movement of contemporary [[American pragmatism]], which, loosely defined, advocates a detachment from the definition of 'objective truth' given by modern philosophers such as Descartes. Postanalytic philosophers emphasize the contingency of human thought, [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[utility]], and [[social progress]].

==On "postanalytic philosophy"==
The term "postanalytic philosophy" itself has been used in a vaguely descriptive sense and not in the sense of a concrete philosophical movement. Many postanalytic philosophers write along an analytic vein and on traditionally analytic topics. Richard Rorty said: "I think that analytic philosophy can keep its highly professional methods, the insistence on detail and mechanics, and just drop its transcendental project. I'm not out to criticize analytic philosophy as a style. It's a good style. I think the years of superprofessionalism were beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Mendieta, ''Take Care of Freedom and Truth Will Take Care of Itself'', 2005, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Rorty says the goal of postanalytic philosophy is not to oppose analytic philosophy or its methods, but to dispute its hope to make philosophy the penultimate form of knowledge from which every other knowledge claim must be derived. 

Postanalytic philosophy may also be known as '''post-philosophy''',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Voparil, Richard J. Bernstein, ''The Rorty Reader'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; a term used by Rorty, to emphasize the notion that the project of philosophy as conceived by Enlightenment philosophers no longer serves the role it used to in society and that this role has been replaced by other media.

{{use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}

The '''cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact''' is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems resulting from contact with an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[civilization]]. It is closely related to the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), which attempts to locate intelligent life as opposed to analyzing the implications of contact with that life.

The potential changes from extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, based on the extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity.&lt;ref name=ptrsa-2010 /&gt; The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.

The implications of extraterrestrial contact, particularly with a technologically superior civilization, have often been likened to the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth, a historical precedent being the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Such meetings have generally led to the destruction of the civilization receiving contact (as opposed to the "contactor", which initiates contact), and therefore destruction of human civilization is a possible outcome.&lt;ref name=daily-galaxy-1/&gt; Extraterrestrial contact is also analogous to the numerous encounters between non-human native and invasive species occupying the same ecological niche.&lt;ref name=The-Space-Review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3240/1|title=Stranger Danger|publisher=The Space Review|archivedate=16 May 2017|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the absence of verified public contact to date means tragic consequences are still largely speculative.&lt;!--All lead material is supported by sources within the body of the article.--&gt;&lt;!--This page does not deal with UFOlogy, conspiracy theories, exopolitics (whose page here was deleted), or anything similar.--&gt;

Telescopes capable of this include the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Allen Telescope Array]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Terdiman, Daniel|author-link=Daniel Terdiman|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10121889-52.html|title=SETI's large-scale telescope scans the skies|date=12 December 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=27 March 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4H7tDj}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hat Creek, California]] and the new [[Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope]] in China. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. [[Project Cyclops]] was commissioned by [[NASA]] in the 1970s to investigate the most effective way to search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources,&lt;ref name=phys-imp-1&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Physics of the Impossible|Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel]]|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|author=Kaku, Michio|date=2009|isbn=0-307-27882-4|chapter=Extraterrestrials and UFOs|pages=126–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of [[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.&lt;ref name=seti-funding&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seti.org/center-for-seti-research|title=Center for SETI Research|publisher=SETI Institute|work=SETI Institute website|accessdate=31 May 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4OysyU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the discovery in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of numerous [[extrasolar planets]], some of which may be [[planetary habitability|habitable]], governments have once more become interested in funding new programs. In 2006 the [[European Space Agency]] launched [[COROT]], the first spacecraft dedicated to the search for exoplanets,&lt;ref name=ESAPR2006&gt;{{cite press release|title=Europe goes searching for rocky planets|publisher=ESA|date=26 October 2006|accessdate=26 March 2012|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=21129|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4RiP0Q|archivedate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 NASA launched the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' space observatory for the same purpose.&lt;ref Name="BBC7March"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC Staff|title=Nasa launches Earth hunter probe|work=[[BBC News]]|date=7 March 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7926277.stm|accessdate=27 March 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4YY4Q2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2013 ''Kepler'' had detected 105&lt;ref name=keplersite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kepler.nasa.gov|title=Kepler: A Search for Habitable Planets|work=kepler.nasa.gov|accessdate=7 July 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4dwrNn}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the {{extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} confirmed exoplanets,&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of them, [[Kepler-22b]], is potentially habitable.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-planet-found-in-habitable-zone-111205.html|title=Alien Planet Could Host Life|work=[[Discovery News]]|author=Klotz, Irene|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=27 March 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4pNrRP}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was discovered, the [[SETI Institute]] resumed the search for an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization, focusing on ''Kepler''{{'}}s candidate planets,&lt;ref name="SETI exoplanets"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://news.discovery.com/space/seti-to-hunt-for-aliens-on-keplers-worlds.html|title=SETI to Hunt for Aliens on Kepler's Worlds|date=5 December 2011|author=Ian O'Neill|publisher=[[Discovery News]]|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4rcwSt }}&lt;/ref&gt; with funding from the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref name=cnet-2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57338719-1/kepler-22-b-a-top-target-in-restarted-SETI-alien-search/|title=Kepler 22-b a top target in restarted SETI alien search|publisher=CNET|work=CNET News Crave|date=7 December 2011|accessdate=27 March 2012|author=Mack, Eric|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4tkAnu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly discovered planets, particularly ones that are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for [[communication with extraterrestrial intelligence]]. In 2009 [[A Message From Earth]] (AMFE) was sent toward the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]], which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed [[Gliese 581d]] and the more habitable but unconfirmed [[Gliese 581g]].&lt;ref name=astronow&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1005/03seti6a/|title=SETI: Cosmic Call|work=Astronomy Now|date=3 May 2010|accessdate=27 March 2012|author=Cooper, Keith |archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA4zknN8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[SETILive]] project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial [[radio interference]].&lt;ref name=space-12&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/14723-seti-live-search-extraterrestrials-public.html|title=New Site Lets you Search for Extraterrestrial Life|work=Space.com|date=29 February 2012|agency=Space.com|accessdate=27 March 2012|author=Moskowitz, Clara |archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA51bMmB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data for the study is obtained by observing ''Kepler'' target stars with the radio telescope.&lt;ref name="SETI exoplanets" /&gt;

In addition to radio-based methods, some projects, such as [[SEVENDIP]] (Search for Extraterrestrial Visible Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], are using other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to search for extraterrestrial signals.&lt;ref name=seti-berkeley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seti.berkeley.edu/|title=The Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence at Berkeley|publisher=University of California at Berkeley| accessdate=5 April 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA5Amk04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other projects are not searching for coherent signals, but want to rather use electromagnetic radiation to find other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, such as [[megascale engineering|megascale]] [[astroengineering]] projects.&lt;ref name=DYSON&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seti.berkeley.edu/IR_Excess_Search|title=DYSON/IR Excess|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|work=The Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence at UC Berkeley|accessdate=7 July 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA5GR61r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact assessment===
{{Anchor|Systems for the assessment of the potential impact of extraterrestrial contact}}

The implications of extraterrestrial contact depend on the method of discovery, the nature of the extraterrestrial beings, and their location relative to the Earth.&lt;ref name=almar-2011&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2011AcAau..68..358A|title=The discovery of ETI as a high-consequence, low-probability event|author1=Almár|first1=Iván|last2=Tarter|first2=Jill|volume=68|date=2011|pages=358–361|journal=Acta Astronautica|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.07.007|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these factors, the [[Rio Scale]] has been devised in order to provide a more quantitative picture of the results of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;ref name=almar-2011 /&gt; More specifically, the scale gauges whether communication was conducted through radio, the information content of any messages, and whether discovery arose from a deliberately beamed message (and if so, whether the detection was the result of a specialized SETI effort or through general astronomical observations) or by the detection of occurrences such as radiation leakage from astroengineering installations.&lt;ref name=almar-1995&gt;{{cite conference|bibcode=1995ASPC...74..499A|title=The Consequences of a Discovery: Different Scenarios|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995ASPC...74..499A|author=Almár, Iván|orig-year=1993|date=1995|conference=''Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life''|series=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series|editor=Seth Shostak|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|isbn=0-937707-93-7|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA5bFScR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether or not a purported extraterrestrial signal has been confirmed as authentic, and with what degree of confidence, will also influence the impact of the contact.&lt;ref name=almar-1995 /&gt; The Rio Scale was modified in 2011 to include a consideration of whether contact was achieved through an interstellar message or through a physical extraterrestrial artifact, with a suggestion that the definition of ''artifact'' be expanded to include "[[technosignature]]s", including all indications of intelligent extraterrestrial life other than the interstellar radio messages sought by traditional SETI programs.&lt;ref name=almar-2011-2&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.05.036|author=Almár, Iván|volume=69|date=2011|pages=899–904|title=SETI and astrobiology: The Rio Scale and the London Scale|journal=Acta Astronautica|issue=9–10|bibcode = 2011AcAau..69..899A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by astronomer [[Steven J. Dick]] at the [[United States Naval Observatory]] considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar significance in the [[history of science]].&lt;ref name=dick-1993&gt;{{cite conference|bibcode=1995ASPC...74..521D|title=Consequences of Success in SETI: Lessons from the History of Science|author1=Dick|first1=S.|volume=74|date=1995|pages=521–532|series=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series|conference=A New Era in Bioastronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any.&lt;ref name=dick-1993 /&gt; It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact.&lt;ref name=dick-1993 /&gt; Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of [[European colonization of the Americas]] as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] and [[History of evolutionary thought|Darwinian]] revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.&lt;ref name=dick-1993 /&gt;

The physical distance between the two civilizations has also been used to assess the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005 /&gt; Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, is likely to be the most disruptive and negative for humanity.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005 /&gt; On a smaller scale, people close to the epicenter of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005 /&gt; Space scientists [[Martin Dominik]] and [[John Zarnecki]] state that in the absence of any data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence, one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history.&lt;ref name=dominik-zarnecki-2011&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dominik, Martin|author2=John C. Zarnecki|last-author-amp=yes|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1936/499|title=The detection of extra-terrestrial life and the consequences for science and society|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0236|date=2011|volume=369|issue=1936|pages=499–507|bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369..499D }} ([http://royalsociety.org/events/2010/extra-terrestrial-life/ audio supplement])&lt;/ref&gt;

The beliefs of the general public about the effect of extraterrestrial contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides [[factor analysis]] of responses to questions about, ''[[wikt:inter alia|inter alia]]'', the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it.&lt;ref name=vakoch-2000&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reactions to Receipt of a Message from Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Cross-Cultural Empirical Study|author=Vakoch, D.A.|author2=Y. S. Lee|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=2000|volume=46|issue=10–12|pages=737–744|doi=10.1016/S0094-5765(00)00041-2|bibcode = 2000AcAau..46..737V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants{{which|date=September 2015}} took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.&lt;ref name=vakoch-2000 /&gt;

Psychologists [[Douglas Vakoch]] and Yuh-shiow Lee conducted a survey to assess people's reactions to receiving a message from extraterrestrials, including their judgments about likelihood that extraterrestrials would be malevolent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vakoch|first=D.

===Post-detection protocols===
{{main|Post-detection protocol}}

Various protocols have been drawn up detailing a course of action for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post-detection protocols must address three issues: what to do in the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; and analyzing the long-term consequences of the message received.&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1&gt;{{cite conference| bibcode=1993ASPC...47..417B| title=SETI Post-Detection Protocols: What Do You Do After Detecting a Signal?| publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific| author=Billingham, John| editor=Shostak, Seth| booktitle=ASP Conference Series|date=August 1991| conference=Third Decennial US-USSR Conference on SETI| location=University of California, Santa Cruz| pages=417–426}}&lt;/ref&gt; No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law,&lt;ref name=dominik-zarnecki-2011 /&gt; and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs.&lt;ref name=dominik-zarnecki-2011 /&gt;

One of the first post-detection protocols, the "Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence", was created by the SETI Permanent Committee of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] (IAA).&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1 /&gt; It was later approved by the Board of Trustees of the IAA and by the International Institute of Space Law,&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1 /&gt; and still later by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), the [[Committee on Space Research]], the [[International Union of Radio Science]], and others.&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1 /&gt; It was subsequently endorsed by most researchers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,&lt;ref name=norris-2004&gt;{{cite conference|title=Bioastronomy 2002: Life Among the Stars|publisher=International Astronomical Union|author=Norris, Ray|editor=Norris, R|editor2=F.

The Declaration of Principles contains the following broad provisions:&lt;ref name=setileague-1997&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/protocol.htm|title=Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence|publisher=The SETI League, Inc.|work=setileague.org|date=17 August 1997|author=Permanent SETI Committee, International Academy of Astronautics|accessdate=2 July 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA5kpSkW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Any person or organization detecting a signal should try to verify that it is likely to be of intelligent origin before announcing it.
# The discoverer of a signal should, for the purposes of independent verification, communicate with other signatories of the Declaration before making a public announcement, and should also inform their national authorities.
# Once a given astronomical observation has been determined to be a credible extraterrestrial signal, the astronomical community should be informed through the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]] of the IAU. The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] and various other global scientific unions should also be informed.
# Following confirmation of an observation's extraterrestrial origin, news of the discovery should be made public. The discoverer has the right to make the first public announcement.
# All data confirming the discovery should be published to the international scientific community and stored in an accessible form as permanently as possible.
# Should evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence take the form of electromagnetic signals, the Secretary-General of the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) should be contacted, and may request in the next ITU Weekly Circular to minimize terrestrial use of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic frequency bands]] in which the signal was detected.
# Neither the discoverer nor anyone else should respond to an observed extraterrestrial intelligence; doing so requires international agreement under separate procedures.
# The SETI Permanent Committee of the IAA and Commission 51 of the IAU should continually review procedures regarding detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and management of data related to such discoveries. A committee comprising members from various international scientific unions, and other bodies designated by the committee, should regulate continued SETI research.

A separate "Proposed Agreement on the Sending of Communications to Extraterrestrial Intelligence" was subsequently created.&lt;ref name=michaud-1991&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009457659290114X|title=An international agreement concerning the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence|author=Michaud, Michael A.

==Contact scenarios and considerations==
Scientific literature and [[science fiction]] have put forward various models of the ways in which extraterrestrial and human civilizations might interact. Their predictions range widely, from sophisticated civilizations that could advance human civilization in many areas to imperial powers that might draw upon the forces necessary to subjugate humanity.&lt;ref name=ptrsa-2010&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0229|accessdate=5 April 2012|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1936/656.full.pdf+html|title=Fear, pandemonium, equanimity and delight: Human responses to extra-terrestrial life|date=2011|last1=Harrison|first1=A.

Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; In contrast to these views, however, [[Paolo Musso]], a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] (IAA) and the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least ''some'' extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.&lt;ref name=musso-2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Musso|first=Paolo|title=The problem of active SETI: An overview|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=September–October 2012|volume=78|pages=43–54|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.12.019|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576511003791|accessdate=8 December 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6DSeQ3|bibcode = 2012AcAau..78...43M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|250px|An advanced, friendly extraterrestrial civilization might help humanity to eliminate risks that could destroy its fledgling civilization.|alt=An image of the explosion of the nuclear bomb Ivy Mike.]]Futurist [[Allen Tough]] suggests that an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization, recalling its own past of war and plunder and knowing that it possesses superweapons that could destroy it, would be likely to try to help humans rather than to destroy them.&lt;ref name=tough-1986&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieti.org/articles/future.pdf|title=What Role will Extraterrestrials Play in Humanity's Future?|author=Tough, Allen|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=1986|volume=39|pages=491–498|bibcode=1986JBIS...39..491T|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6J12kR}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies three approaches that a friendly civilization might take to help humanity:&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;
* Intervention only to avert catastrophe: this would involve occasional limited intervention to stop events that could destroy human civilization completely, such as nuclear war or asteroid impact.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;
* Advice and action with consent: under this approach, the extraterrestrials would be more closely involved in terrestrial affairs, advising world leaders and acting with their consent to protect against danger.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;
* Forcible corrective action: the extraterrestrials could require humanity to reduce major risks against its will, intending to help humans advance to the next stage of civilization.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;

Tough considers advising and acting only with consent to be a more likely choice than the forceful option. While coercive aid may be possible, and advanced extraterrestrials would recognize their own practices as superior to those of humanity, it may be unlikely that this method would be used in cultural cooperation.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt; Lemarchand suggests that instruction of a civilization in its "technological adolescence", such as humanity, would probably focus on [[morality]] and ethics rather than on science and technology, to ensure that the civilization did not destroy itself with technology it was not yet ready to use.&lt;ref name=lemarchand-2006&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0807.4518|first1=Guillermo A.|last1=Lemarchand|title=Counting on Beauty: The role of aesthetic, ethical, and physical universal principles for interstellar communication|bibcode = 2008arXiv0807.4518L|volume=0807|date=2008|pages=4518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tough, it is unlikely that the avoidance of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt; However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a [[space probe]] in the Solar System, as radio waves could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;

Even if an ancient and advanced extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could suffer from a loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization.&lt;ref name=tough-ff-2000&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.futurefoundation.org/documents/hum_pro_wrk1.pdf|booktitle=When SETI Succeeds: The Impact of High-Information Contact|date=July 2000|editor=Tough, Allen|author=Tough, Allen|title=An Extraordinary Event|pages=1–6|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA64QjzG}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity in such a way as to minimize unintended consequences.&lt;ref name=ras-paper /&gt; Michael A.

===Hostile civilizations===

Deardorff speculates that a small proportion of the intelligent life forms in the galaxy may be aggressive, but the actual aggressiveness or benevolence of the civilizations would cover a wide spectrum, with some civilizations "policing" others.&lt;ref name=ras-paper&gt;{{cite journal|title=Possible Extraterrestrial Strategy for Earth|author=Deardorff, James W.|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1986|bibcode=1986QJRAS..27...94D|volume=27|page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The paper states in its abstract that any communication by extraterrestrials via radio telescope would be censored by governments initially, though at the time it was written, the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the former Soviet Union was still ongoing.--&gt; According to Harrison and Dick, hostile extraterrestrial life may indeed be rare in the Universe, just as belligerent and autocratic nations on Earth have been the ones that lasted for the shortest periods of time, and humanity is seeing a shift away from these characteristics in its own sociopolitical systems.&lt;ref name=harrison-dick-ff-2000 /&gt; In addition, the causes of war may be diminished greatly for a civilization with access to the galaxy, as there are prodigious quantities of natural resources in space accessible without resort to violence.&lt;ref name=phys-imp-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000 /&gt;

SETI researcher [[Carl Sagan]] believed that a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war to be able to avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would have no choice but to reciprocate.&lt;ref name=hufpo-sci&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/space-alien-encounter_n_1389896.html|title=Space Alien Encounter Scenario Has Scientists Saying How We Will React|work=HuffPost Science|date=30 March 2012|agency=Huffington Post|accessdate=30 March 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6WHGEV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seth Shostak]], an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive.&lt;ref name=space-2012&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.space.com/15721-battleship-movie-alien-life-seti.html|title=When Aliens Attack: 'Battleship' Strategy with SETI Astronomer Seth Shostak|work=Search for Life|date=17 May 2012|agency=Space.com| accessdate=19 May 2012|author=Chow, Denise|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6aMzLp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Ragbir Bhathal]] claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonists did to [[Aboriginal Australians]].&lt;ref name=bhathal-ff-2000&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.futurefoundation.org/documents/hum_pro_wrk1.pdf|booktitle=When SETI Succeeds: The Impact of High-Information Contact|date=July 2000|editor=Tough, Allen|author=Bhathal, Ragbir|title=Human Analogues May Portend ET Conduct Toward Humanity|page=57|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA64QjzG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputing these analyses, [[David Brin]] states that while an extraterrestrial civilization may have an imperative to act for no benefit to itself, it would be naïve to suggest that such a trait would be prevalent throughout the galaxy.&lt;ref name=brin-2009&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.davidbrin.com/SKEPTICcontactperils.pdf |title=The Dangers of First Contact: The Moral Nature of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and a Contrarian Perspective on Altruism | author=Brin, David| journal=Skeptic Magazine | date=2009 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brin points to the fact that in many moral systems on Earth, such as the Aztec or Carthaginian one, non-military killing has been accepted and even "exalted" by society, and further mentions that such acts are not confined to humans but can be found throughout the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=brin-2009 /&gt;

Baum ''et al.'' speculate that highly advanced civilizations are unlikely to come to Earth to enslave humans, as the achievement of their level of advancement would have required them to solve the problems of labor and resources by other means, such as creating a sustainable environment and using mechanized labor.&lt;ref name=baum-2011/&gt; Moreover, humans may be an unsuitable food source for extraterrestrials because of marked differences in biochemistry.&lt;ref name=phys-imp-1/&gt; For example, the [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] of molecules used by terrestrial biota may differ from those used by extraterrestrial beings.&lt;ref name=baum-2011/&gt; Douglas Vakoch argues that transmitting intentional signals does not increase the risk of an alien invasion, contrary to concerns raised by British cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vakoch|first=Douglas A.|date=2016-10-01|title=In defence of METI|url=http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v12/n10/full/nphys3897.html|journal=Nature Physics|language=en|volume=12|issue=10|pages=890|doi=10.1038/nphys3897|issn=1745-2473|bibcode = 2016NatPh..12..890V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/stephen-hawking-wants-to-find-aliens-before-they-find-us/|title=Stephen Hawking wants to find aliens before they find us|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=2016-09-22|work=CBS News|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; because "any civilization that has the ability to travel between the stars can already pick up our accidental radio and TV leakage.”&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/02/12/should-we-beam-greetings-to-alien-civilizations-even-though-they-might-be-klingons-or-just-bad-company/|title=Should we beam greetings to alien civilizations even though they might be Klingons, or just bad company?|last=Achenbach|first=Joel|date=2015-02-12|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/28632-active-seti-search-alien-life.html|title=Should Humanity Try to Contact Alien Civilizations?|last=Wall|first=Mike|date=2015-02-24|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians have also commented on the likely human reaction to contact with hostile species.

===Equally advanced and more advanced civilizations===
[[File:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svg|thumb|250px|It is suggested that technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization would probably be ethically advanced as well and would not attempt projects with severe ecological implications for other species, like the construction of a [[Dyson sphere]].|alt=A Dyson sphere]] [[Robert Freitas]] speculated in 1978 that the technological advancement and energy usage of a civilization, measured either relative to another civilization or in absolute terms by its rating on the [[Kardashev scale]], may play an important role in the result of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-1&gt;{{cite book |title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization |publisher=Xenology Research Institute |author=Freitas Jr., Robert A. |orig-year=1975–1979 |date=2008 |location=Sacramento, California, United States |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm |chapter=Encounters Between Equals: The 0/0 Contact |chapterurl= http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/25.3.1.htm |archivedate=24 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6h2df2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the infeasibility of interstellar space flight for civilizations at a technological level similar to that of humanity, interactions between such civilizations would have to take place by radio. Because of the long transit times of radio waves between stars, such interactions would not lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations, nor any significant future interaction at all, between the two civilizations.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-1 /&gt;

According to Freitas, direct contact with civilizations significantly more advanced than humanity would have to take place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-2/&gt; Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-2&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute| author=Freitas Jr., Robert A.|orig-year=1975–1979|date=2008|location=Sacramento, California, United States|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapter=Gods and Primitives: The 11/0 Contact|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/25.3.2.htm|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6ifo7b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-2 /&gt;

However much planning an extraterrestrial civilization may do before contacting humanity, the humans may experience great shock and terror on their arrival, especially as they would lack any understanding of the contacting civilization. Ben Finney compares the situation to that of the tribespeople of [[New Guinea]], an island that was settled fifty thousand years ago during the [[last glacial period]] but saw little contact with the outside world until the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The huge difference between the indigenous stone-age society and the Europeans' technical civilization caused unexpected behaviors among the native populations known as [[cargo cult]]s: to coax the gods into bringing them the technology that the Europeans possessed, the natives created wooden "radio stations" and "airstrips" as a form of [[sympathetic magic]]. Finney argues that humanity may misunderstand the true meaning of an extraterrestrial transmission to Earth, much as the people of New Guinea could not understand the source of modern goods and technologies. He concludes that the results of extraterrestrial contact will become known over the long term with rigorous study, rather than as fast, sharp events briefly making newspaper headlines.&lt;ref name=doa-2003/&gt;

Billingham has suggested that a civilization which is far more technologically advanced than humanity is also likely to be culturally and ethically advanced, and would therefore be unlikely to conduct astroengineering projects that would harm human civilization.

Whether an advanced extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message is a matter of debate in itself.

===Interstellar groups of civilizations===
{{Anchor|Interstellar groupings of civilizations}}
Given the age of the galaxy, Harrison surmises that there exist several "galactic clubs", groupings of multiple civilizations from across the galaxy.&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.futurefoundation.org/documents/hum_pro_wrk1.pdf|booktitle=When SETI Succeeds: The Impact of High-Information Contact|date=July 2000|editor=Tough, Allen|author=Harrison, Albert|title=Networking with Our Galactic Neighbors|pages=107–114|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA64QjzG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such clubs could begin as loose confederations or alliances, eventually developing into powerful unions of many civilizations.&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000 /&gt; If humanity could enter into a dialogue with one extraterrestrial civilization, it might be able to join such a galactic club. As more extraterrestrial civilizations, or unions thereof, are found, these could also become assimilated into such a club.&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000/&gt; Sebastian von Hoerner has suggested that entry into a galactic club may be a way for humanity to handle the culture shock arising from contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials |publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A.

Whether a broad spectrum of civilizations from many places in the galaxy would even be able to cooperate is disputed by Michaud, who states that civilizations with huge differences in the technologies and resources at their command "may not consider themselves even remotely equal".&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-4&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials|publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A.

When two Canadian astronomers argued that they potentially discovered 234 extraterrestrial civilizations through analysis of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] database, [[Douglas Vakoch]] doubted their explanation for their findings, noting that it would be unusual for all of these stars to pulse at exactly the same frequency unless they were part a coordinated network: "If you take a step back," he said, "that would mean you have 234 independent stars that all decided to transmit the exact same way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/22876-234-pulsing-stars-aren-t-aliens-still-mysterious|title=Those 234 Pulsing Stars Probably Aren’t Aliens, But They're Still a Complex Mystery|last=Patel|first=Neel V.|date=2016-10-28|work=Inverse|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michaud suggests that an interstellar grouping of civilizations might take the form of an empire, which need not necessarily be a force for evil, but may provide for peace and security throughout its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-5&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials|publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A. G.|date=2007|location=New York, New York, United States|url=http://www.radio-astronomy.org/library/Contact-With-Alien-Civilizations.pdf|isbn=978-0-387-28598-6|pages=317–322|chapter=Assumptions: After Contact: Interstellar Empires Do Not Exist|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6MEvc2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the distances between the stars, such an empire would not necessarily maintain control solely by military force, but may rather tolerate local cultures and institutions to the extent that these would not pose a threat to the central imperial authority.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-5 /&gt; Such tolerance may, as has happened historically on Earth, extend to allowing nominal self-rule of specific regions by existing institutions, while maintaining that area as a puppet or client state to accomplish the aims of the imperial power.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-5 /&gt; However, particularly advanced powers may use methods, including [[faster-than-light]] travel, to make centralized administration more effective.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-5 /&gt;

In contrast to the belief that an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008 /&gt; In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0805.1821|author=Ćirković, Milan M.|title=Against the Empire|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2008.61.246|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=61|pages=246–254|date=2008|bibcode = 2008JBIS...61..246C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008/&gt; According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008/&gt;

===Extraterrestrial artifacts===
{{see also|Bracewell probe}}
[[File:Interstellar robotic probe.gif|thumb|Robotic probes may be preferable to radio waves or microwaves as a means of interstellar communication.|left|alt=An extraterrestrial robotic spacecraft]]An extraterrestrial civilization may choose to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may take a long time to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2 /&gt; Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2 /&gt;

Although faster-than-light travel has been seriously considered by physicists such as [[Miguel Alcubierre]],&lt;ref name="Christopher Pike"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alcubierre, Miguel|title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]|date=1994|volume=11|pages=L73–L77|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001|arxiv=gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode=1994CQGra..11L..73A|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tough speculates that the enormous amount of energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2/&gt; 2013 research at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]], however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the [[Alcubierre drive]] requires dramatically less energy than previously thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html | title=Warp Drive May Be More Feasible Than Thought, Scientists Say | work=Space.com | date=17 September 2012 | agency=Space.com | accessdate=27 October 2012 | author=Moskowitz, Clara}}&lt;/ref&gt; needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/1105voyager_facts.html | title=NASA - Voyager Facts | publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration | date=23 February 2008 | accessdate=27 October 2012 | author=Jenner, Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The original article stated that the mass-energy required would be roughly equal to that of the Voyager 1 spacecraft, and the mass of that spacecraft itself is, according to NASA, currently about 733 kg. Therefore, "about one metric ton" was used in the text.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tough, an extraterrestrial civilization might want to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an ''Encyclopædia Galactica'', containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=Small Smart Interstellar Probes|author=Tough, Allen|volume=51|pages=167–174|date=1998
|url=http://www.ieti.org/tough/articles/jbis51.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A civilization that sees itself on the brink of decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that these may not die along with the civilization itself.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2 /&gt;

Freitas finds numerous reasons why interstellar probes may be a preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing to make contact with Earth. A civilization aiming to learn more about the distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials |publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A.

Freitas points out that probes, unlike the interstellar radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales,&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a [[UFO]] or a natural phenomenon.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which would be impossible for a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=The Case for Interstellar Probes|volume=36|date=November 1983|pages=490–495|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm|author=Freitas, Robert|bibcode = 1983JBIS...36..490F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983/&gt; Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt;

Given the age of the Milky Way galaxy, an ancient extraterrestrial civilization may have existed and sent probes to the Solar System millions or even billions of years before the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt; Thus, a probe sent may have been nonfunctional for millions of years before humans learn of its existence.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt; Such a "dead" probe would not pose an imminent threat to humanity, but would prove that interstellar flight is possible.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt; However, if an active probe were to be discovered, humans would react much more strongly than they would to the discovery of a probe that has long since ceased to function.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt;

The confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence could have a profound impact on [[religion|religious]] doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries.&lt;ref name=space-2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/10670-extraterrestrial-life-religious-beliefs.html|title=Could Extraterrestrial Intelligence Sway Religious Beliefs?|work=Space.com|date=24 January 2011|agency=Space.com|accessdate=30 March 2012|author=Choi, Charles Q. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of people with many different [[religious belief]]s indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence,&lt;ref name=space-2 /&gt; and another study, conducted by [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it.&lt;ref name=peters-2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0234|title=The implications of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life for religion|date=2011|last1=Peters|first1=T.|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=369|issue=1936|pages=644–655|bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369..644P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion.&lt;ref name=elsevier&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2011.08.031|title=Astrosociology and the Capacity of Major World Religions to Contextualize the Possibility of Life Beyond Earth|date=2011|last1=McAdamis|first1=E.M.|journal=Physics Procedia|volume=20|pages=338–352|bibcode = 2011PhPro..20..338M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the [[Vatican Observatory]] and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the [[Catholic Church]] would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.&lt;ref name=keim-2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2008/06/alien_religion|title=Christian Theologians Prepare for Extraterrestrial Life|work=Wired|date=13 June 2008|agency=Condé Nast|accessdate=20 May 2012|author=Keim, Brandon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would not be completely inconsequential for religion. The Peters study showed that most non-religious people, and a significant minority of religious people, believe that the world could face a religious crisis, even if their own beliefs were unaffected.&lt;ref name=peters-2011 /&gt; Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would be most likely to cause a problem for western religions, in particular traditionalist Christianity, because of the geocentric nature of western faiths.&lt;ref name=kaufman-2012&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_l4cNtcxpcC | title=First Contact: Scientific Breakthroughs in the Hunt for Life Beyond Earth]|publisher=Simon and Schuster|author=Kaufman, Marc|date=2012|isbn=978-1-4391-0901-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of extraterrestrial life would not contradict basic conceptions of God, however, and seeing that science has challenged established dogma in the past, for example with the [[theory of evolution]], it is likely that existing religions will adapt similarly to the new circumstances.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas Jr., Robert A.|orig-year=1975–1979|date=2008|location=Sacramento, California, United States|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapter=The Religiou Response Contact|chapterurl= http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.4.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Vakoch argues that it is not likely that the discovery of extraterrestrial life will impact religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/16285-alien-life-discovery-religion-impact.html|title=Religion Would Likely Survive Alien Life Discovery|last=Wall|first=Mike|date=2012-06-25|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of Musso, a global religious crisis would be unlikely even for Abrahamic faiths, as the studies of himself and others on Christianity, the most "anthropocentric" religion, see no conflict between that religion and the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt; In addition, the cultural and religious values of extraterrestrial species would likely be shared over centuries if contact is to occur by radio, meaning that rather than causing a huge shock to humanity, such information would be viewed much as archaeologists and historians view ancient artifacts and texts.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt;

G.|date=2007|location=New York, New York, United States|url=http://www.radio-astronomy.org/library/Contact-With-Alien-Civilizations.pdf|isbn=978-0-387-28598-6|page=253 |chapter=Mixed Emotions: Political Reactions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes,&lt;ref name=othman-2011 /&gt; which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a [[Voyager Golden Record|golden record]] in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name=voyager-jpl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/|title=Voyager – The Interstellar Mission|author=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|author-link=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.&lt;ref name=othman-2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Othman | first1 = M. | title = Supra-Earth affairs | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0311 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 369 | issue = 1936 | pages = 693–699 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369..693O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Luca Codignola of the University of Genoa, contact with a powerful extraterrestrial civilization is comparable to occasions where one powerful civilization destroyed another, such as the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Hernán Cortés]] into the Americas and the subsequent destruction of the indigenous civilizations and their ways of life.&lt;ref name=daily-galaxy-1/&gt; However, the applicability of such a model to contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, and that specific interpretation of the arrival of the European colonists to the Americas, have been disputed.&lt;ref name=wired-anthropologist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/space-anthropology/|title=Q&amp;A: The Anthropology of Searching for Aliens|publisher=Wired|work=Wired Science|date=4 April 2012|accessdate=21 April 2012|author=Mann, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, any large difference between the power of an extraterrestrial civilization and our own could be demoralizing and potentially cause or accelerate the collapse of human society.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Being discovered by a "superior" extraterrestrial civilization, and continued contact with it, might have psychological effects that could destroy a civilization, as is claimed to have happened in the past on Earth.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosociology.com/Library/PDF/Contributions/SETIandConsequences_ENG.pdf|title=SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and the Consequences: Futurological Reflections on the Confrontation of Mankind with an Extraterrestrial Civilization|publisher=Astrosociology.com|orig-year=7 January 2005|date=1 July 2005|accessdate=20 May 2012|author=Schetsche, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the absence of close contact between humanity and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3 /&gt; Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3 /&gt; The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3 /&gt;

===Legal===
{{see also|Metalaw}}
Contact with extraterrestrial civilizations would raise legal questions, such as the rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Legal Issues of First Contact|date=1978 |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied [[human rights]], so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3-1&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute |author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Alien Animals|date=1978 |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3-2&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Legal Standards of Personhood|date=1978|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freitas considers that even if an extraterrestrial being were to be afforded legal personhood, problems of nationality and immigration would arise. An extraterrestrial being would not have a legally recognized earthly citizenship, and drastic legal measures might be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Extraterrestrial Persons|date=1978 |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If contact were to take place through electromagnetic signals, these issues would not arise. Rather, issues relating to patent and copyright law regarding who, if anyone, has rights to the information from the extraterrestrial civilization would be the primary legal problem.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3 /&gt;

===Scientific and technological===
The scientific and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Impact on Science and Technology|date=1978|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm |chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.4.4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the message contains a large amount of information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the formation of the Solar System, which may greatly advance our technology and science.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt; A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt;

On the other hand, extraterrestrial civilizations with malicious intent could send information that could enable human civilization to destroy itself,&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt; such as powerful computer viruses or information on how to make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use on the part of the extraterrestrials.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt; According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt; Even a [[virtual machine]] on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt; In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the ''Encyclopædia Galactica'' until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt;

Extraterrestrial technology could have profound impacts on the nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet for a wide variety of political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002&gt;{{cite book|title=After Contact: The Human Response To Extraterrestrial Life|publisher=Basic Books|author=Harrison, Albert A.|date=2002|isbn=978-0-7382-0846-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7BnvJMbPrsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002 /&gt; He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the [[Industrial Revolution]], which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002 /&gt; Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002 /&gt;

Michaud suggests that humanity could be impacted by an influx of extraterrestrial science and technology in the same way that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-10&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials |publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A. G.|date=2007|location=New York, New York, United States|url=http://www.radio-astronomy.org/library/Contact-With-Alien-Civilizations.pdf|isbn=978-0-387-28598-6|pages=232–233|chapter=Fears: The End of Hubris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-10 /&gt;

The discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and [[astrobiology]]. The discovery of extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater insight into the nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] is organized.&lt;ref name=mckay-2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McKay | first1 = C. P. | title = The search for life in our Solar System and the implications for science and society | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0247 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 369 | issue = 1936 | pages = 594–606 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369..594M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial [[hypothetical types of biochemistry|biochemistry]] and observe how it differs from that found on Earth.&lt;ref name=mckay-2011/&gt; This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.&lt;ref name=mckay-2011/&gt;

===Ecological and biological-warfare impacts===
{{see also|Planetary protection}}
An extraterrestrial civilization might bring to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms that do not harm its own biosphere.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt;

On the other hand, pathogens and invasive species of extraterrestrial origin might differ enough from terrestrial organisms in their biology to have no adverse effects.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Furthermore, pathogens and parasites on Earth are generally suited to only a small and exclusive set of environments,&lt;ref name=loker-2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0010038|pmc=1291355|title=Can Specialized Pathogens Colonize Distantly Related Hosts? Schistosome Evolution as a Case Study|date=2005|last1=Brant|first1=Sara V.|last2=Loker|first2=Eric S.|journal=PLoS Pathogens|volume=1|issue=3|pages=28–31|pmid=16322771}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which extraterrestrial pathogens would have had no opportunity to adapt.

If an extraterrestrial civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient knowledge of terrestrial biology and weaknesses in the immune systems of terrestrial biota, it might be able to create extremely potent biological weapons.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Even a civilization without malicious intent could inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt;

According to Baum, even if an extraterrestrial civilization were to communicate using electromagnetic signals alone, it could send humanity information with which humans themselves could create lethal biological weapons.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt;

'''Randal Mathews Burdon''' (4 August 1896 &amp;ndash; 29 November 1965) was an English-born New Zealand historian with several works published from the 1930s to 1960s. He also served in the [[British Army]] in the [[First World War]].

==Early life==
Burdon was born in [[North Ambersham]], [[Sussex]], England on 4 August 1896 to Mildred and Cotsford Mathews Burdon. He emigrated to New Zealand with his family when he was six years old. His parents began sheep farming in Woodbury, in the [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] region of the [[South Island]]. Educated at schools in or near [[Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch]], he was in England intending to study law when the [[First World War]] broke out.&lt;ref name="DNZB Burdon"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Randal Mathews Burdon|first= Richard L. N.|last= Greenaway|id=4b49|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
Joining the [[British Army]], he was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]]. Posted to the [[Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment]], he served on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] and later in the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Campaign]]. Wounded twice in the course of his war service,&lt;ref name="DNZB Burdon"/&gt; he was the recipient of a gallantry award, the [[Military Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30036|supp=y|page=3933|date=24 April 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1918 he transferred to the [[British Indian Army]] as a probationary lieutenant and was posted to a [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]] unit the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Army List, January 1919&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to the [[13th Duke of Connaught's Lancers]], which served on the north-west frontier of India,&lt;ref name="DNZB Burdon"/&gt; in June 1919 and received a promotion to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] in January 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Army List, April 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
In 1922, Burdon, having married Jean Stewart Bowden two years prior,&lt;ref name="DNZB Burdon"/&gt; retired from the Indian Army, still as a captain,&lt;ref&gt;Indian Army List, April 1923&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to New Zealand. He took up sheep farming in Woodbury, where his family farmed after their arrival from England in 1902. He started writing history books in the 1930s and his first work, a history of farming in the Canterbury region, was published in 1938. A series of short accounts of notable New Zealanders, in three volumes, followed by a biography of Sir [[Julius Vogel]]. He also wrote ''Outlaw's Progress'', a work of fiction published in 1943, which he later disavowed,&lt;ref name="DNZB Burdon"/&gt; describing it as a "damn bad novel."{{sfn|Stevens|1966|p=64}}

With his health in decline, in 1948 Burdon moved from his farm to [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]]. He was contracted by the War History Branch, the section of the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]] tasked with the production of a history of New Zealand's contribution to the [[Second World War]], to produce an account of the [[24th Battalion (New Zealand)|24th Battalion]]. One of several volumes of the ''[[Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45]]'', his book was published in 1953 and was followed two years later with a biography of [[Richard Seddon]]. A study of the Christchurch academic, [[Alexander Bickerton]], was produced the next year. Having already had to resort to walking with the assistance of a cane for several years, his research abilities were becoming compromised by his physical condition, which affected his abilities to undertake serious archival work. In 1965, he produced ''The New Dominion'', a social history of New Zealand from 1919 to 1939, but critics noted it was heavily based on newspapers and secondary sources.&lt;ref name="DNZB Burdon"/&gt;

In his later years, Burdon contributed to a number of journals and was a book reviewer for the weekly ''[[New Zealand Listener]]''. He was a contributor to the publication ''[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]'', which was printed after his death at home from coal gas poisoning on 28–29 November 1965. Although it produced two children, both of which survived him, his marriage to Jean Bowden had ended in a divorce in 1932.&lt;ref name="DNZB Burdon"/&gt;

'''Ricardo de la Cierva y Hoces''' (9 November 1926 – 19 November 2015) was a Spanish historian and politician.

A native of Madrid, de la Cierva served the constituency of [[Murcia (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Murcia]] in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]  and [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] from 1977 to 1982. He was the [[Ministry of Culture (Spain)|Minister of Culture]] for nine months in 1980. Originally a member of the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]], de la Cierva switched to the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance]] in February 1982, then stepped down from the [[Cortes Generales]] upon the end of his term in August of that year. De la Cierva won the second prize of the 1988 [[Premio Planeta de Novela]], and also wrote for the magazine ''[[Época (Spanish magazine)|Época]]''. He died in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2015/11/19/actualidad/1447950708_710699.html Muere el historiador franquista Ricardo de la Cierva] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roman Republican currency''' refers to the gold and silver [[Coin]]age struck by the various magistrates of the [[Roman Republic]], to be used as legal tender. In modern times, the abbreviation RRC, "Roman Republican Coinage" originally the name of a reference work on the topic by Michael H. Crawford, has come to be used as an identifying tag for coins assigned a number in that work, such as RRC 367.

Coins came late to the Republic compared with the rest of the [[Mediterranean]], especially [[Ancient Greek coinage|Greece and Asia Minor]] where coins were invented in the 7th century BC. The [[currency]] of central [[Italy]] was influenced by its natural resources, with [[bronze]] being abundant (the [[Etruscans]] were famous metal workers in bronze and iron) and [[silver]] ore being scarce. The coinage of the Roman Republic started with a few silver coins apparently devised for trade with the Greek colonies in Southern Italy, and heavy [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] bronze pieces for use in Central Italy.

During the Second [[Punic wars|Punic war]] a flexible system of coins in bronze, silver and (occasionally) gold was created. This system was dominated by the silver [[denarius]], a denomination which remained in circulation for 450 years. The coins of the republic (especially the denarii) are of particular interest because they were produced by "mint magistrates", junior officials who choose the designs and legends. This resulted in the production of coins advertising the officials' families for political purposes; most of the messages on these coins can still be understood today.

==Before coinage==
Before the introduction of coinage in Italy the two important forms of value in the economy were sheep (''pecus''), from which the [[Latin]] word for money (''pecunia'') is derived, and irregularly shaped pieces of bronze known as '''[[aes rude]]''' (''rough bronze'') which needed to be weighed for each transaction. It is unclear when money became commonly used, but Roman tradition recorded that pay of the army began during the siege of Veii in 406 BC and it appears that Aes rude was the currency well before this.  Toward the end of the 4th century BC bronze began to be cast in flat bars which are known today, without any historical authority, as '''[[aes signatum]]''' (''signed bronze''). These bars were heavily leaded, of varying weights although generally on the order of five [[Roman pound]]s, and usually had a design on one and later both sides. The actual function of aes signatum has been variously interpreted; although a form of currency they were not coins since they did not adhere to a weight standard. Rome produced its own aes signatum around 300 BC which are distinguished by the inscription "ROMANOM" (of the Romans) and production continued to about the end of the first Punic war in 240 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow-Vecchi 1979:17,18, Plates 11–23&lt;/ref&gt; overlapping some of the developments described below.

According to Pomponius, a lawyer who lived during the 2nd century AD, the group of three mint magistrates [[tresviri monetales]] was established in 289 BC, but this date seems to be far too early, and if they did not come into existence during the Second Punic War, the formation of a formal college may not have occurred until some time after 200 BC The three members of this committee were officially known as the "tres viri aere argento auro flando feriundo" ("the three men responsible for casting and striking bronze, silver and gold"), a lengthy title that was almost always abbreviated to "III.V.A.A.A.F.F.". Julius Caesar briefly raised their number to four.

According to [[the Suda|Suidas]], the [[Mint (coin)|mint]] was located in (or at least near) the temple of Juno Moneta on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. By this time Rome was familiar with coinage, as it had been introduced to Italy in the Greek colonies of Metapontum, Croton, and Sybaris before 500 BC and Neapolis ca 450 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 2001:10,68&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had conquered a large portion of central Italy, giving it large quantities of bronze, but little silver.

A system of heavy cast leaded bronze coinage was introduced; these issues are known as '''[[aes grave]]''' (heavy bronze) by numismatists. Stylistically the coins were distinctly Roman and, due to both their size and their being cast rather than struck, crude compared to the coinage elsewhere around the Mediterranean at the time. The standard coin was the ''[[as (coin)|as]]''; the word ''as'' referred to a coin and also to a unit of weight – in fact, ''as'' could also mean any unit – of length, area, and sometimes just the number one.&lt;ref&gt;Willis 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronze coinage was initially a more or less [[full value currency]] rather than a token currency, based on the "[[libral standard]]" where the ''as'' weighed one Roman pound ([[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]) with fractions in units of Roman ounces ([[Ancient Roman units of measurement|unciae]]), with 12 unciae in a libra. The "uncia" was thus also both a weight and a coin of the same weight. This changed when the weight of the aes grave was decreased to approximately 10 unciae ca 270 BC (the "light [[libral standard]]", remaining at that level until 225 BC, then suddenly to 5 unciae (the "semi-libral standard") c. the start of the second Punic war in 218 BC, finally falling to 1.5–1 unciae around 211 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1974:131–236&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''as'' and its fractions, multiples of the ''as'' were also produced. Fractions were much more common than ''asses'' and their multiples during the period of aes grave.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1985:23,60&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the semi-[[libral]] standard, the smaller denominations such as the uncia and semuncia were struck rather than cast. A variety of less common denominations were minted over time; those found in Crawford (1974) are listed here.

== Introduction of Greek-style silver coinage ==
Greek-style struck bronze coins were produced in small quantity with the inscription ΡΩΜΑΙΩΝ around 300 BC; only a handful of examples exist today. They are believed to have been produced on behalf of Rome by [[History of Naples|Neapolis]], based on the similar style and weight with Neapolis' own coinage, and used to facilitate trade in the wake of the construction of the [[Appian Way]], started in 312 BC.

Rome entered into a war against [[History of Taranto|Tarentum]] in 281 BC; the Tarentines enlisted the support of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]. It was in this context that Rome produced its first Greek-style silver di[[drachma|drachm]] (Crawford 13/1) with the head of Mars wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] on one side and the head of a horse with the inscription ROMANO (worn off on the example shown) and a grain ear behind.  This coinage may have predated the aes grave discussed above, but was minted and used largely in [[Magna Graecia]] and [[Campania]]. It was clearly part of a broader trend; payment of Roman and allied troops fighting in the Pyrrhic war appears to have been crucial in spreading the use of Greek-style coinage throughout the southern Apennine areas of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1985:36&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is today thought to have been minted in Neapolis because it was minted on that weight standard (7.3 g), not that of [[Metapontum]], Tarentum, and other South Italian cities (which was 7.9 g at the start of the war but fell to 6.6 g during its course).&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 2001:8,44&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was thought earlier to have been minted in Metapontum because the grain-ear is the most common type on Metapontine coins and the Mars head is very similar to the head of Leucippus (a local hero, the Messenian king who re-founded Metapontum, not the [[Leucippus|philosopher]]) on an earlier coin produced there.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 1997:93&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of different coins were minted in increasing volumes over the next few years, but the first silver coin now thought to have been minted in Rome itself is the Hercules/She-wolf didrachm (Crawford 20/1). The date of this issue is likely 269 BC, as the devices on this coin refer to that year's [[Roman consul|consuls]] [[Quintus Ogulnius Gallus|Q. Ogulnius L.f  A.n. Gallus]] and [[Gaius Fabius Pictor (consul 269 BC)|C. Fabius C.f. M.n. Pictor]]. Hercules, shown on the obverse his club (shown undersized above his shoulder) and a lion skin tied around his neck, was the divine patron of the [[Fabii]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen 1974:III:119&lt;/ref&gt; Quintus and his brother Cnaeus Ogulnius had, as [[aedile|curule aediles]], prosecuted moneylenders; part of the proceeds were used to set up near the [[Ficus Ruminalis]] a statue of [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by the she-wolf as shown on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen 1974:III:117,153&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe that these coins were valued at 10 ''asses'' making them denarii, this assertion is based on the account of Pliny in the 1st century AD, where he states that the denarius was introduced in 269 BC. Most historians today, however, do not see this as a denarius, but another didrachm.

This last and most other Roman coins were produced in small numbers until the introduction of the didrachm we refer to as the [[quadrigatus]]. The quadrigatus, produced in large quantity starting around 235 BC, was named after the reverse image of Victory driving a [[quadriga]] and was produced for about 2 decades, becoming more and more debased (to as little as 30% silver) during the second Punic war.

== The denarius system ==

The [[denarius]], which became the main silver coin of Rome for over four centuries, was introduced in 211 BC or a few years earlier, and produced in enormous quantity from the silver captured in the sack of Syracuse. The denarius (Crawford 44/5), valued at 10 ''asses'' as indicated by the mark '''X''' and weighing about 4.5&amp;nbsp;grams (72 to a Roman pound), was introduced as part of a complex multi-metallic coinage. Also in silver was the half denarius, the [[quinarius]] (Crawford 44/6, marked '''V'''), and the quarter denarius, the [[sestertius]] (Crawford 44/7, marked '''IIS''' and shown on the left), all bearing a head of Roma on the obverse and a reverse of the [[dioscuri]] riding with their capes behind (a reference to their supposed assistance to Rome at the battle of [[Lake Regillus]]).

Bronze ''asses'' and their fractions (all now struck rather than cast) continued to be produced to a standard of about 55&amp;nbsp;grams; this was very quickly reduced to a sextantal standard and finally an uncial standard of roughly 32 gms. By this time, ''asses'' outnumbered their fractions, perhaps because legionary pay was increased to the point where the ''as'' could become the principal component.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1985:60&lt;/ref&gt;

In gold, there were three pieces worth 60 ''asses'' (Crawford 44/2, marked '''ↆX'''), 40 ''asses'' (Crawford 44/3, marked '''XXXX''') and 20 ''asses'' (Crawford 44/4, marked '''XX'''). All featured a head of Mars on the obverse and an eagle with outspread wings standing on a thunderbolt on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1974:154&lt;/ref&gt;  The eagle is somewhat reminiscent of the eagle that had consistently been a symbol on Ptolemaic coinage since the very beginning of the century, and it has been suggested that [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] may have provided gold for this issue to act as a counterweight to the involvement of [[Philip V of Macedon]] on the side of [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;Meadows 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[victoriatus]], another silver coin (Crawford 44/1), was also introduced in large quantity at the same time. It seems to have been quite separate from the denarius system proper as X-ray fluorescence spectrometry has shown that these were produced to an entirely different standard of fineness. While an analysis of 52 early denarii, quinarii, and sestertii showed a silver concentration of 96.2 ± 1.09%, 19 victoriati from the same period have highly variable fineness ranging from 72 to 93%.&lt;ref&gt;Walker 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Early finds of victoriati are primarily in Southern Italy and Sicily and it is thought that the victoriati with a weight of 3/4 of a denarius were used to pay non-citizens with experience of the Greek coinage system in the drachma format to which they were accustomed, but with debased/overvalued coins. The quadrigatus didrachm, which had been retariffed to 15 ''asses'' (1.5 denarii), was removed from circulation almost immediately.

===Evolution: weights and fineness===
Over the next 40 years, the denarius slowly lost weight. The reason for this is unclear, but in the early days it may have been the ongoing pressure of the Second Punic War. Afterwards the Roman state had a debt equivalent to 25 years direct taxation on Roman citizens (~1 million denarii); this was not fully repaid until [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso|Cn. Manlius Vulso]] returned with the spoils of Asia after the [[Treaty of Apamea]], (188 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1979:70&lt;/ref&gt; The weight was officially changed from 72 to the pound (6 scruples) to 84 to the pound at that time; it remained relatively stable thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1974:594–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The silver content during republican times remained well above 90%, usually above 95% with the exception of [[Marcus Antonius]]'s later coinage, especially the massive "legionary" issue of coinage of 32–31 BC just prior to the [[Battle of Actium]] (an example is shown on the right), rumored to be silver from Egypt provided by [[Cleopatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1974:570–1&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 140 BC (the exact date is unclear) the denarius was retariffed to 16 ''asses'', indicated by XVI on the obverse of the denarius. This appears first on the coinage marked L.IVLI (Crawford 224/1), commonly dated to 141 BC. The clear marking with the number XVI was soon again replaced with an X, but often now with a horizontal bar through the centre as shown in the second example on the left (Crawford 243/1); this is sometimes read as a monogram of XVI with all the letters superimposed. The re-tariffing is thought to have been a recognition of a relationship that had developed because of decreased ''as'' weights, both due to wear of old ''asses'' and to decreasing mint weights of newer ones. This meant that the quinarius was worth eight ''asses'', and the sestertius four ''asses''. The new denarius-to-''as'' ratio lasted for hundreds of years. At about the same time the [[unit of account]] changed from ''asses'' to sestertii (HS). This may well be an indicator of inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1985:143–151&lt;/ref&gt;

The victoriatus continued to circulate well into the 2nd century BC. Victoriati were later popular in places such as Cisalpine Gaul where they circulated alongside drachmae of Massalia ([[Marseille]]).

===Evolution: gold===
The gold 60, 40, and 20 ''as'' coins were only minted for only a few years; gold in general appears to have been used at first only as an emergency coinage. Gold coins reappeared in 82 BC when [[Sulla]] was gathering funds for the war against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] immediately after the financial strains of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]]. Sulla's coinage is commonly considered the first for which the name (denarius) [[aureus]] was used. Aureii were minted in large numbers by [[Julius Caesar]] in preparation for a proposed war against [[Parthia]] and issuing of the aureus continued to increase after the fall of the republic.

==Coinage and political messages==
[[File:Crawford 187-1-Reverse.jpg|thumb|left|150px|New denarius reverse design: Luna driving a biga, 169–158 BC. Crawford 187/1]]
Eventually a new reverse appeared, first [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]] driving a ''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]'' (two horse chariot) in 194–190 BC, and then [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] driving a biga in 157 BC – thought to refer to the final defeat of [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] of [[Macedon]] at the [[battle of Pydna]] by [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus|Lucius Aemilius Paulus]] in 168 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett 1987:22&lt;/ref&gt; These Victory "bigati" became the most common type of denarius. Denarii were marked with special symbols (such as a star or an anchor) from very shortly after their introduction and soon monograms indicating the tresviri monetales (mint masters, often called moneyers, that were responsible for the issue) were on the coins. In some cases the symbols are "punning". The example reverse shown to the left (Crawford 187/1 showing Luna driving a biga) is one such; a shell symbol appears above the horses along with the letters "PVR" below. The shell is thought to be a [[murex]] shell; this was the source of [[Tyrian purple]] (in Latin: purpureo) and this, along with the letters, is thought to refer to a Furius Purpureo.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1974:238&lt;/ref&gt; This type of reference to the moneyers became more and more explicit, and eventually developed into self-advertising to further the political career of the moneyers.

[[File:Crawford 268-1b-Reverse.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Denarius reverse celebrating ancestor of N. Fabius Pictor, Crawford 268/1b]]
Families who had already had members in the Senate were more likely to have further family members elected to political office (and thus become senators). This was so much more likely that only a few consular [[novi homines]] (new men) are known to history. Advertising on coins was thus often about the moneyer's family. In the coin reverse shown on the right (Crawford 268/1b), the legend around the outside indicates that moneyer was N. Fabius Pictor. The seated individual is wearing a [[cuirass]], holding a spear in his left hand and an [[apex (hat)|apex]], the characteristic hat worn by the [[flamen|flamines]], in his right. At his side there is a shield inscribed QUIRIN. This is taken to refer to Q. Fabius Pictor (probably the son of [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]] the [[annalist]]) who was elected [[praetor]] in 189 BC and assigned the province of Sardinia by lot (Livy 37.50.8). He was also the [[flamen Quirinalis]] and because of this, P. Licinius Crassus, the [[pontifex maximus]] of the day did not allow him to take the Sardinian office because of various taboos surrounding the flamen's person, and the need for the flamen to perform certain rites in Rome (Livy 37.51.3–7).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Flamen.html Smith 1875:Flamen]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sardinian praetorship was exchanged for both the urban and peregrine praetorships, and N. Fabius Pictor remained in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Feig Vishnia 1996:118–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton 1951:I:361&lt;/ref&gt; The entire incident was part of the political manoeuvring of [[Scipio Africanus]] against his attackers, which included the Fabii.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard 1973:136–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the politics of the day became more and more visible in the coinage. In 54 BC, the [[first triumvirate]] had control of Rome, and [[Pompey]] was its preeminent member. There were rumours that Pompey was to be made [[dictator]]. In this context, the coin on the left (Crawford 433/2) was a powerful political message. The moneyer, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], placed on the coin two figures from Roman history that he claimed as ancestors: 
** [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] of the [[Junius (gens)|Junius Gens]], who was made the first consul of the republic of Rome in 509 BC after he expelled [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], the last of the Roman kings, and
** [[Gaius Servilius Ahala]], who killed [[Spurius Maelius]] – a knight who endeared himself to the populace of Rome by providing free grain during a famine – reputedly in a bid for seeking kingship – in 439 BC. Marcus Brutus was also known as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus, as he had been adopted into the [[Servilia (gens)|gens Servilia]], from which he was descended on his mother's side.

In the face of famine in 57 BC Pompey had been made a special commissioner to control the supply of grain; this included the control of all ports and trading centres for five years. There was earlier bad blood between them; Pompey had put down an earlier insurrection by [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 78 BC)|Marcus Aurelius Lepidus]] in which Brutus's father had been involved; Pompey had had him executed. It was the opposition of [[Cato the Younger]], Brutus's half brother on his adopted family's side, to Pompey's requests for land for his veterans of the war against Mithradates that gave Pompey the incentive to be part of the triumvirate. M. Brutus was clearly making a pointed, uncompromising statement of opposition to Pompey and the triumvirate while praising his ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Harlan 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In 44 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] was preparing for war with [[Parthia]] to avenge the defeat inflicted by the Parthians on [[Crassus]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. To this end, an enormous variety of denarii and aureii were being minted in large numbers. The coin on the right is from January–February 44 BC. The Venus holding Victory and a sceptre on the reverse was a reference to the claim of the  [[Julius|gens Julia]] to descend from [[Aeneas]] and thus [[Anchises]] and the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. This was innocuous to Romans, but the obverse showing Caesar himself wearing the gold laurel wreath that the Senate had voted for him was an enormous departure from tradition and deeply offensive. While the coinage had been used to show ancestors, this is the first time that the head of a living Roman had been displayed on Roman coinage.  It was widely perceived as part of a larger series of moves by Caesar to make himself king – and kings were anathema in Rome ever since the foundation of the republic. Other coins minted at the same time bore the text "DICT QVART", indicating that Caesar had been dictator for four years running. A later version (Crawford 480/10, February–March 44 BC) showed "DICT PERPET"; Caesar had been made dictator for life.&lt;ref&gt;Sear 1998:72–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alföldi 1985&lt;/ref&gt; He was assassinated, by Brutus among others, on the [[Ides of March]], 44 BC.

The assassination could not revive the republic. Two years later, just prior to the [[Battle of Philippi (42 BC)|Battle of Philippi]], Brutus produced a coin (Crawford 508/3, modern forgery shown to the left) celebrating the freeing of the republic from Caesar's tyranny. The reverse showed two daggers flanking a [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]] (a cap used in the ceremony freeing slaves) and the legend "EID MAR". On the obverse, Brutus, the "noblest Roman", had placed his own head. The republic survived, by convention more than reality, until Octavian, Caesar's nephew and heir was declared [[Augustus]] in 27 BC.

==Sources of evidence==
The dates on all the coins mentioned above can not be known with absolute certainty. Sometimes particular coins can be linked to a well defined event in history, e.g. the "dict perpet" denarii of Caesar can be dated very closely to his assassination, but this is rarely the case. Much dating of the coinage is based on evidence from coin hoards. The hoarding of coins, especially by burial, was a "banking system" often used in ancient times, particularly in times of crisis; hoarding during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey was so extensive that it resulted in a [[liquidity crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Burnett 1991:52&lt;/ref&gt; Hoards can present evidence in several ways
* The location of the hoard can speak to where the coins in question circulated.
* The archaeological context of a coin hoard can set an approximate date for the production of the coinage. As an example, excavations of the [[Temple of Artemis in Ephesus]] uncovered coins beneath the temple; the date the temple was built is known and so a [[terminus ante quem]] for the period of their production can be deduced.
* The differential wear of coins in a hoard can be used to establish a relative chronology. Coins that had circulated longer prior to burial should show more wear.
* The composition of the hoard in terms of coin types can speak to what sorts of coins circulated in the same place at the same time and their relative abundance. From this, relative chronologies can sometimes be extracted.
* Comparison of multiple coin hoards can help to establish relative chronologies; if a series of coins is well represented in one large coin hoard and some are missing from a second large hoard, it is likely that they were minted after that hoard was buried.

Despite all of this, the evidence remains unclear. In this case, numismatic scholars attempt to make their best estimate of the absolute and relative chronology. In English, the current standard work is Crawford 1974 which built on and superseded the work of Sydenham 1952, Grueber 1910, [[Ernest Babelon|Babelon]] 1886, and [[Mommsen]] 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Kroh 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The chronology used by this article and the identification of coins by the label Crawford xx/yy (or Crxx/yy) identifies a particular item in that catalogue. There is however newer evidence, particularly in the period 170–149 BC, where analysis of the recently discovered Mesagne hoard has led to the alternate chronologies of Hersh &amp; Walker 1984, and Harlan 1995. An alternate naming of the coinage of the form "gens ##" (e.g. "Fabia 11" for the 11th coin minted by a moneyer of the gens Fabia; i.e. Cr268/1) is also sometimes still used. This was devised by Babelon and used by Grueber, Sydenham, and many newer books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''sacred–profane dichotomy''' is an idea posited by [[France|French]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]], who considered it to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The elementary forms of Religious Life'', ed. and trans. by Karen E. Fields. (New York: The Free Press, 1995), p. 35.[http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mbaker/cshs503/durkheimreligiouslife.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or ''[[totems]]''. The [[profanum|profane]], on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the sacred–profane dichotomy was not equivalent to [[good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be good or evil, and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's claim of the universality of this dichotomy for all religions/[[cult]]s has been criticized by scholars such as British [[anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p35161/mobile/ch06s03.html|title=The sacred-profane distinction is not universal|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-10|work=}} quote: "neither do the [[Lo Dagaa]] [group in Gonja, ''editor note''] appear to have any concepts at all equivalent to the vaguer and not unrelated dichotomy between the sacred and the profane"&lt;/ref&gt; Goody also noted that "many societies have no words that translate as sacred or profane and that ultimately, just like the distinction between natural and supernatural, it was very much a product of [[European religious thought]] rather than a universally applicable criterion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tomoko Masuzawa explains in ''The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism'', this system of comparative religion privileged Christianity at the expense of non-Christian systems (2005). Any cosmology without a sacred/profane binary was rendered invisible by the field of religious studies, because the binary was supposed to be 'universal'.

'''Shire Jama Ahmed''' ({{lang-so|Shire Jaamac Axmed}}, {{lang-ar|شيري جامع أحمد}}) was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[linguist]] notable for his contribution to the creation of the modern [[Somali alphabet|Latin script]] for transcribing the [[Somali language]].

==Early years==
Shire was born in the [[Galgadud]] region of Somalia to a [[Marehan]] family. He grew up in [[Dhuusamareeb]] and [[Abudwak]], two of the region's more prominent cities.

==Education==
In 1940, at about the age of five (the usual age when children first start [[Qur'an]]ic studies), Shire began learning the Qur'an at his nearby ''dugsi'' or [[madrasah]]. He continued his religious studies up until 1945. It is widely reported that he attained ''Kabir'' or student head. One attains the Kabir designation when one succeeds at memorizing scripture at an above average pace. Here, Shire quickly attained complete knowledge of the Qur'an, which consists of 30 chapters of roughly equal number of verses or volume. 
  
Jama Ahmed, Shire's father, then decided to move his family to [[Mogadishu]], the capital of Somalia. Shire subsequently experienced a considerably different kind of schooling. He started attending local language schools where his peers were learning [[Arabic]] and [[English language|English]]. While in Mogadishu, he also took up some [[Italian language|Italian]] language studies. As it was his character to excel at most tasks put before him, Shire thrived in all of his academic work.

From 1951 to 1954, Shire matriculated at a college run by former graduates of the prestigious [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. His studies focused on Arabic and [[Islamic Law]]. Later, in 1955, he was part of a group of students who received scholarships to study at Egyptian institutions of higher learning.

===High School Years at Mogadishu's Jamal Abdinasir Secondary School===

Shire Jama Ahmed graduated from '''Jamal Abdinasir Secondary School''' in downtown Mogadishu. The school was also known to Mogadishu residents as Allahi Secondary and Arabic Grammar School.

Teachers and administrators at Jamal Abdinasir Secondary School, a fixture in Mogadishu for more than six decades up until the late 1980s, helped secure for Shire and several dozen other highly motivated students trips to Egypt for further studies in advanced Arabic. Shire eventually earned a degree from Al-Azhar.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Laitin, ''Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience'', (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies Abroad in Egypt and in Russia===
After having successfully completed his studies in Egypt, Shire again found himself among a group of students selected for scholarships to study abroad, albeit this time in the [[Soviet Union]]. He subsequently graduated from a [[Russia]]n university in 1967, though his first intention was apparently to attend [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]].

==Career==
Shire was the first president of the [[Somali National Academy of Culture]], as well as the founder of the first Somali national magazine, ''The Light of Knowledge and Education''.

In addition, he was one of the main organizers and administrators of the [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL), a nationalist and youth-oriented political movement that existed in the 1930s through to the late 1960s. Between 1967 and 1969, he also took up the post of Chief Presidential Protocol in the [[Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke|Sharmarke]] government.

==Language issue==
For about a decade, there was an effort to find a common orthography for the Somali language, with many Somali scholars working hard to introduce new writing scripts.

Shire, a linguist by training, was a proponent of the use of Latin for transcribing the Somali language, but this preference didn't stop at merely favoring one script over another; Shire also printed many books based on Somali oral culture using a modified Latin script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK6SBJIckIsC&amp;pg=PR20-IA9&amp;lpg=PR20-IA9&amp;dq=shire+jama+ahmed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mM76R-nJlt&amp;sig=q7EQuv1URNpVzeD5kjgOntJU_DQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fhUwSq37LZfCMrLHtIIK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPR20-IA8,M1|title=A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa|last=Lewis|first=I. M.|date=1999|publisher=James Currey Publishers|isbn=9780852552803|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two successive governments, from 1960–1967 and 1967–1969, could not settle the debate over what script to use: Arabic, a script which most Somalis had used for centuries and which is featured in the Qur'an, or Latin, a script that only really came to the attention of the Somali people during the late 18th century upon contact with the British and Italian European administrations.

Shire campaigned for the Latin script, while [[Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur]], Osman Yusuf Kenadid and [[Muse Haji Ismail Galal]] each favored different writing systems for transcribing the Somali language. Originally, there were 18 different scripts that were brought before the newly established Somali Language Committee. Of these 18 proposed orthographies, 11 were new inventions, while 4 were derived from the Arabic script and 3 were Latin.

Anything less than choosing an Arabic alphabet was equated with being a non-[[Muslim]]. In fact, a common taunt designed to cast a bad light on those supporting the Latin script was the expression "Latin, laa diin", which translates as "Latin, no religion" (''Laa'' in Arabic means "no" and the word "diin" refers to religion). Shire, on the other hand, was more pragmatic in his arguments. He pointed out that the printing presses and other machines that were then in use in most other parts of the world were mostly set to the Latin alphabet, as were the machines and typewriters already extant within Somalia.

===Official introduction of the Af-Soomaali script===
In the late 1960s, Shire and a few other Somali linguists presented before the Somali Language Committee, an organization in charge of settling [[Somalia]]'s outstanding language issue, and eventually deciding between several prospective [[orthography|orthographies]]. These scripts ranged from [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] to some resembling [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]], an ancient [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethio-Semitic]] writing system. Among those proposed was the [[Osmanya script]], an orthography invented in the early twentieth century by the [[Majeerteen]] poet and ruler, [[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]], which had enjoyed a strong following. Shire's competing orthography, for its part, was derived from Latin characters, and it omitted a few letters (''p'', ''v'' and ''z'') to accommodate the unique sounds of the Somali language. Shire also introduced combination letters (''kh'', ''dh'' and ''sh''), which were in many ways exclusive to the language.

The military government, which came to power in October 1969 under the aegis of General [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], took up the agenda. Within a year, the new administration elected to use Shire's refined Latin script as the official writing method for transcribing the Somali language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marehansade.blogspot.com/2007/07/inventor-of-somali-script-aqoonyahanki.html|title=Blogger|website=marehansade.blogspot.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, Barre's government began printing more books in ''Af Soomaali'' using the new script for primary and high schools alike.

All civil servants were also ordered to learn the Somali language within six months from January of that year. It was further decided that documents in government offices would feature Shire's Latin script.

Although Shire himself was not against the Arabic script, having personally studied the Arabic language while in Mogadishu as well as during his time in Egypt, he did not think it was the most practical solution for solving the nation's lingering language issue.

===Somali Rural Literacy Campaign{{anchor|Somali_Rural_Literacy_Campaign}}===
After the Somali national script was introduced, the government undertook a massive literacy campaign in villages and rural settlements across the country from 1974 to 1975. This effort was termed in the Somali language ''Ol Olaha Waxbarashada Reer Miyiga'' or ''Somali Countryside Literacy Campaign''. The national campaign was carried out by young people, mostly elementary school teachers as well as high school students. This was a relatively easy undertaking as there was now an alphabet to learn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doollo.com/mainpage/Axmed/olole.htm National Mass Literacy Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many consider the initial introduction of Shire's Somali orthography and the subsequent literacy campaign to be one of the most significant achievements in Somalia's post-colonial administration. Because of this vital decision, decades later, Somali immigrants around the globe are having better luck in learning new languages compared to people coming from countries which use non-Latin writing scripts.

The outside world took note of Somalia's progress in educating the masses in terms of literacy. [[Julius Nyerere]], then Tanzania's president, asserted that "[t]he Somalis are practicing what we in Tanzania preach."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaallesiyaad.com/english/the-revolutionary-government-s-achievements|title=The Revolutionary Government’s Achievements {{!}} Somali President Jaalle Maxamed Siyaad Barre|last=MohammedIbrahimShire|website=www.jaallesiyaad.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2010}}

==Publications==
Shire wrote many works dealing with literacy and Somali culture. All of these publications were produced in either his own [[printing press]] or through other printing outfits in Mogadishu.

He published a number of books and pamphlets, with early publications also including periodicals. Shire Jama Ahmed's works include:
*''Iftiinka Aqoonta'' ("The Light of Knowledge") - magazine-format periodical
*''Elementary Education Drill Book''
*''Somali Education and Legal Assistance'' - prepared for [[Peace Corps|US Peace Corps]] volunteers

The '''Singapore strategy''' was a naval defence policy of the [[British Empire]] that evolved in a series of [[Military operation plan|war plans]] from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the [[Empire of Japan]] by providing for a base for a fleet of the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Far East]], able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base; [[Singapore]], at the eastern end of the [[Strait of Malacca]], was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base; work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades.

The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the [[Japanese home islands]] to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware of the impact of a blockade on an island nation at the heart of a maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.

The Singapore strategy was the cornerstone of British Imperial defence policy in the Far East during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1937, according to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Stephen Roskill]], "the concept of the 'Main Fleet to Singapore' had, perhaps through constant repetition, assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of financial, political and practical difficulties ensured that it could not be successfully implemented. During the 1930s, the strategy came under sustained criticism in Britain and abroad, particularly in Australia, where the Singapore strategy was used as an excuse for parsimonious defence policies. The strategy ultimately led to the despatch of [[Force Z]] to Singapore and the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of the ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] by Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941. The subsequent ignominious [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] was described by [[Winston Churchill]] as "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history".&lt;ref name="Churchill, p. 81"&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1950|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
After the First World War, the [[Imperial German Navy]]'s [[High Seas Fleet]] that had challenged the Royal Navy for supremacy was [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled in Scapa Flow]], but the Royal Navy was already facing serious challenges to its position as the world's most powerful fleet from the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Callahan|1974|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' determination to create what [[Admiral of the Navy]] [[George Dewey]] called "a navy second to none" presaged a new maritime [[arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/12/22/105049851.pdf |title=Urges Navy Second to None: Admiral Dewey and Associates Say Our Fleet Should Equal the Most Powerful in the World |date=22 December 1915 |accessdate=25 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|right|300px|The British Empire in 1921. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa were self-governing dominions.|alt=Map of the world indicating the extent of the British Empire]]

The [[U.S. Navy]] was smaller than the Royal Navy in 1919, but ships laid down under its wartime construction program were still being launched, and their more recent construction gave the American ships a technological edge.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 19-23" /&gt; The "[[Two-Power Standard|two-power standard]]" of 1889 called for a Royal Navy strong enough to take on any two other powers. In 1909, this was scaled back to a policy of 60% superiority in [[dreadnought]]s.&lt;ref name="Callahan, p. 74"&gt;{{harvnb|Callahan|1974|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rising tensions over the U.S. Navy's building program led to heated arguments between the [[First Sea Lord]], [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] Sir [[Rosslyn Wemyss]], and the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William S. Benson]] in March and April 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Callahan|1974|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, as far back as 1909, the government directed that the United States was not to be regarded as a potential enemy. This decision was reaffirmed by [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] in August 1919 in order to preclude the U.S. Navy's building program from becoming a justification for the [[Admiralty]] initiating one of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] Sir [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] announced a "one-power standard", under which the policy was to maintain a navy "not&amp;nbsp;... inferior in strength to the Navy of any other power".&lt;ref name="Callahan, p. 74" /&gt; The one-power standard became official when it was publicly announced at the [[1921 Imperial Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 reinforced this policy.

The Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the [[Dominion]]s met at the 1921 Imperial Conference to determine a unified international policy, particularly the relationship with the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tate|Foy|1959|p=539}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most urgent issue was that of whether or not to renew the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], which was due to expire on 13 July 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brebner|1935|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one side were the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Billy Hughes]] and the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[Bill Massey]], who strongly favoured its renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brebner|1935|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither wanted their countries to be caught up in a war between the United States and Japan, and contrasted the generous assistance that Japan rendered during the First World War with the United States' disengagement from international affairs in its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tate|Foy|1959|pp=535–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The British Empire", declared Hughes, "must have a reliable friend in the Pacific".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tate|Foy|1959|p=543}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were opposed by the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Arthur Meighen]], on the grounds that the alliance would adversely affect the relationship with the United States, which Canada depended upon for its security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brebner|1935|pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, no decision to renew was reached, and the alliance was allowed to expire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brebner|1935|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] in 1922 provided for a 5:5:3 ratio of capital ships of the British, United States and Japanese navies.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 30-32"&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1920s, the Royal Navy remained the world's largest navy, with a comfortable margin of superiority over Japan, which was regarded as the most likely adversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Naval Treaty also prohibited the fortification of islands in the Pacific, but Singapore was specifically excluded.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 30-32" /&gt; The provisions of the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930, however, restricted naval construction, resulting in a serious decline in the British shipbuilding industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's willingness to limit the size of its navy led to the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. This was seen as signalling a sincere desire to avoid conflict with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|pp=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Ernle Chatfield]], began  to press for a new naval build-up sufficient to fight both Japan and the strongest European power. He intended to accelerate construction to the maximum capacity of the shipyards,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|pp=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Treasury soon became alarmed at the potential cost of the program, which was costed at between £88 and £104 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, the Treasury was losing its fight to stop [[Rearmament (UK, 1930s)|rearmament]]; politicians and the public were more afraid of being caught unprepared for war with Germany and Japan than of a major financial crisis in the more distant future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plans ==
[[File:Queen Mary in Singapore Gaving Dock Aug 1940.jpg|thumb|300px|The troopship [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] in Singapore Graving Dock, August 1940|alt=A massive ocean liner, viewed from aft and above, sits in a dry dock.]]

The Singapore strategy was a series of war plans that evolved over a twenty-year period in which the basing of a fleet at Singapore was a common but not a defining aspect. Plans were crafted for different contingencies, both defensive and offensive. Some were designed to defeat Japan, while others were merely to deter aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1918, the Australian [[Minister for Defence (Australia)#Ministers for the Navy|Minister for the Navy]], Sir [[Joseph Cook]], had asked Admiral [[John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] to draw up a scheme for the Empire's naval defence. Jellicoe set out on a tour of the Empire in the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|New Zealand|1911|6}} in February 1919.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 4-5" /&gt; He presented his report to the Australian government in August 1919. In a section of the report classified as secret, he advised that the interests of the British Empire and Japan would inevitably clash. He called for the creation of a British Pacific Fleet strong enough to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy, which he believed would require 8 battleships, 8 battlecruisers, 4 [[aircraft carrier]]s, 10 [[cruiser]]s, 40 [[destroyer]]s, 36 [[submarines]] and supporting auxiliaries.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 19-23" /&gt;

Although he did not specify a location, Jellicoe noted that the fleet would require a major dockyard somewhere in the Far East. A paper entitled "The Naval Situation in the Far East" was considered by the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] in October 1919. In this paper the naval staff pointed out that maintaining the Anglo-Japanese Alliance might lead to war between the British Empire and the United States. In 1920, the Admiralty issued ''War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920'', a series of instructions in the event of a war with Japan. In it, the defence of Singapore was described as "absolutely essential".&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 19-23"&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy was presented to the Dominions at the [[1923 Imperial Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennis|2010|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of ''War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920'' divided a war with Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the garrison of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet made its way from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms.&lt;ref name="Bell, pp. 608-612" /&gt;

Most planning focused on the first phase, which was seen as the most critical. This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second phase, a naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a [[Drydock#Graving|graving dock]] capable of taking battleships at [[Pearl Harbor]] between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy had no such base east of [[Malta]].&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 19-23" /&gt; In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific in case of a war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while [[Sydney]] was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 4-5"&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:War Memorandum (Eastern) the Route to the East-EN.svg|thumb|left|600px|War Memorandum (Eastern), The Route to the East]]
The estimate of how long it would take for the fleet to reach Singapore after the outbreak of hostilities varied. It had to include the time required to assemble the fleet, prepare and provision its ships, and then  sally to Singapore. Initially, the estimate was 42 days, assuming reasonable advance warning. In 1938, it was increased to 70 days, with 14 more for reprovisioning. It was further increased in June 1939 to 90 days plus 15 for reprovisioning, and finally, in September 1939, to 180 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paterson|2008|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate this movement, a series of oil storage facilities were constructed at [[Gibraltar]], Malta, [[Port Said]], [[Port Sudan]], [[Aden]], [[Colombo]], [[Trincomalee]], [[Rangoon]], Singapore, and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complicating factor was that the battleships could not traverse the [[Suez Canal]] fully laden, so they would have to refuel on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore was to have storage for {{convert|1250000|LT}} of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secret bases were established at [[Kamaran|Kamaran Bay]], [[Addu Atoll]] and [[Nancowry Island|Nancowry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that the fleet would require {{convert|110000|LT}} of oil per month, which would be transported in 60 [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil would be shipped in from the [[oil refinery|refineries]] at [[Abadan Refinery|Abadan]] and Rangoon, supplemented by buying up the entire output of the Netherlands East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third phase received the least consideration, but naval planners were aware that Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become.&lt;ref name="Bell, pp. 608-612" /&gt; If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of [[Manila]] being used as a forward base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation at the heart of a maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.&lt;ref name="Bell, pp. 608-612"&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2001|pp=608–612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Warship inside Admiralty IX Floating Doc Sept 1941.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A British warship inside the Admiralty IX floating dry dock at Singapore Naval Base in September 1941|alt=A view of a large warship from the floor of a dry dock]]
Japan's vulnerability to blockade was studied. Using information supplied by the [[Board of Trade]] and the [[naval attaché]] in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber,&lt;ref name="Bell, pp. 76-77"&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2000|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with enforcing a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering off the coast of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the [[East Indies]] or the [[Panama Canal]]. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.&lt;ref name="Bell, pp. 76-77" /&gt;

Rear Admiral Sir [[Herbert Richmond]], the Commander in Chief, [[East Indies Station]], noted that the logic was suspiciously circular:{{quote|
*We are going to force Japan to surrender by cutting off her essential supplies.
*We cannot cut off her essential supplies until we defeat her fleet.
*We cannot defeat her fleet if it will not come out to fight.
*We shall force it to come out to fight by cutting off her essential supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1919 plans incorporated a Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation (MNBDO) which could develop and defend a forward base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MNBDO had a strength of 7,000 and included a [[brigade]] of [[antiaircraft artillery]], a brigade of [[coastal artillery]] and a [[battalion]] of infantry, all drawn from the [[Royal Marines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|1996|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one paper exercise, the Royal Marines occupied [[Nakagusuku Bay]] unopposed and the MNBDO developed a major base there from which the fleet blockaded Japan. Actual fleet exercises were conducted in the Mediterranean in the 1920s to test the MNBDO concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|pp=159–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Royal Marines were not greatly interested in [[amphibious warfare]], and lacking organisational backing, the techniques and tactics of amphibious warfare began to atrophy. By the 1930s the Admiralty was concerned that the United States and Japan were well ahead of Britain in this field and persuaded the Army and RAF to join with it in establishing the [[Inter-Service Training and Development Centre]], which opened in July 1938. Under its first commandant, Captain [[Loben Edward Harold Maund]], it began investigating the problems of amphibious warfare, including the design of [[landing craft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|1996|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor was this the only field in which the Royal Navy was lagging in the 1930s. In the 1920s, Colonel the [[Master of Sempill]] led the semi-official [[Sempill Mission]] to Japan to help the Imperial Japanese Navy establish an air arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1380539/The-Highland-peer-who-prepared-Japan-for-war.html |accessdate=11 May 2011 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |last=Phillips |first=Pearson |title=The Highland peer who prepared Japan for war |date=6 January 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Royal Navy was the world leader in naval aviation. The Sempill mission taught advanced techniques such as carrier deck landing, conducted training with modern aircraft, and provided engines, ordnance and technical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferris|2010|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade, Japan had overtaken Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferris|2010|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy pioneered the armoured flight deck, which enabled carriers to absorb damage, but resulted in limiting the number of aircraft that a carrier could operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Till|1996|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy had great faith in the ability of ships' antiaircraft batteries, and so saw little need for high performance fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Till|1996|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; To maximise the benefit of the small numbers of aircraft that could be carried, the Royal Navy developed multi-role aircraft such as the [[Blackburn Roc]], [[Fairey Fulmar]], [[Fairey Barracuda]], [[Blackburn Skua]] and [[Fairey Swordfish]]. As a result, the Royal Navy's aircraft were no match for their Japanese counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of Japan taking advantage of a war in Europe was foreseen. In June 1939, the [[Tientsin Incident]] demonstrated another possibility: that Germany might attempt to take advantage of a war in the Far East.&lt;ref name="McIntyre 1979 156–161"&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=156–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of a worst-case scenario of simultaneous war with Germany, Italy and Japan, two approaches were considered. The first was to reduce the war to one against Germany and Japan only by knocking Italy out of the conflict as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2001|pp=613–614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former First Sea Lord, Sir [[Reginald Drax]], who was brought out of retirement to advise on strategy, called for a "flying squadron" of four or five battleships, along with an aircraft carrier, some cruisers and destroyers, to be sent to Singapore. Such a force would be too small to fight the Japanese main fleet, but could protect British trade in the Indian Ocean against [[commerce raiders]]. Drax argued that a small, fast force would be better in this role than a large, slow one. When more ships became available, it could become the nucleus of a full-sized battle fleet. Chatfield, now [[Minister for Coordination of Defence]], disagreed with this concept. He felt that the flying squadron would become nothing more than a target for the Japanese fleet. Instead, he put forward a second approach, namely that the Mediterranean be abandoned and the fleet sent to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Field|2004|pp=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Base development ==
{{Main|Singapore Naval Base}}
[[File:Coastal defence gun at Singapore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|200px|One of Singapore's 15-inch coastal defence guns elevated for firing|alt=A large calibre gun fires, creating a cloud of smoke]]

Following surveys, a site at [[Sembawang]] was chosen for a naval base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Straits Settlements]] made a free gift of {{convert|2845|acres}} of land for the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a sum of £250,000 for construction of the base was donated by Hong Kong in 1925. That exceeded the United Kingdom's contribution that year of £204,000 towards the floating dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another £2,000,000 was paid by the [[Federated Malay States]], while New Zealand donated another £1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=61–65, 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract for construction of the naval dockyard was awarded to the lowest bidder, Sir John Jackson Limited, for £3,700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{convert|6000000|cuyd}} of earth were moved to level the ground, and {{convert|8000000|cuyd}} of marsh was filled in. The floating dock was constructed in England and towed to Singapore by Dutch tugboats. It was {{convert|1000|ft}} long and {{convert|1300|ft}} wide, making it one of the largest in the world. There would be {{convert|5000|ft}} of deep water quays, and supporting infrastructure including warehouses, workshops and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42251612 |title=Strong gateway. |newspaper=[[The Cairns Post]] |location=Qld. |date=19 July 1940 |accessdate=3 November 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To defend the naval base, heavy [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch naval guns]] (381.0&amp;nbsp;mm) were stationed at [[Johore battery]], [[Changi]], and at [[Buona Vista]] to deal with battleships. Medium [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX–X|BL 9.2 inch guns]] (233.7&amp;nbsp;mm) were provided for dealing with smaller attackers. Batteries of smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns and guns for dealing with raids were located at [[Fort Siloso]], [[Fort Canning]] and [[Fort Pasir Panjang|Labrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five 15-inch guns were all surplus Navy guns, manufactured between 1903 and 1919.&lt;ref name="guns" /&gt; Part of their cost was met from a gift of £500,000 from [[Sultan Ibrahim of Johor]] for the Silver Jubilee of the coronation [[King George V]]. Three of the guns were given an all-round (360°) traverse and subterranean magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation was not neglected. Plans called for an air force of 18 [[flying boat]]s, 18 reconnaissance [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], 18 [[torpedo bomber]]s and 18 single-seat fighters to protect them. [[Royal Air Force]] airfields were established at [[RAF Tengah]] and [[RAF Sembawang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Air Marshal]] [[Lord Trenchard]], argued that 30 torpedo bombers could replace the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]], did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, but the issue was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=75–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and [[Portsmouth]] in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns were to have a chance of hitting a battleship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King George VI dry dock was formally opened by the [[List of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor of the Straits Settlements]], Sir [[Shenton Thomas]], on 14 February 1938. Two squadrons of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] provided a [[flypast]]. The 42 vessels in attendance included three US Navy cruisers. The presence of this fleet gave an opportunity to conduct a series of naval, air and military exercises. The aircraft carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}} was able to sail undetected to within {{convert|135|mi}} of Singapore and launch a series of surprise raids on the RAF airfields. The local air commander, [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Arthur William Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]], was greatly embarrassed. The local land commander, [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] Sir [[William Dobbie]], was no less disappointed by the performance of the anti-aircraft defences. Reports recommended the installation of [[radar]] on the island, but this was not done until 1941. The naval defences worked better, but a landing party from {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} was still able to capture the [[Raffles Hotel]]. What most concerned Dobbie and Tedder was the possibility of the fleet being bypassed entirely by an overland invasion of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] from [[Thailand]]. Dobbie conducted an exercise in southern Malaya which demonstrated that the jungle was far from impassable. The [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] concluded that the Japanese would most likely land on the east coast of Malaya and advance on Singapore from the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
In Australia the conservative [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] government of [[Stanley Bruce]] latched onto the Singapore strategy, which called for reliance on the British navy, supported by a naval squadron as strong as Australia could afford. Between 1923 and 1929, £20,000,000 was spent on the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN), while the [[Australian Army]] and the munitions industry received only £10,000,000 and the fledgling [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) just £2,400,000.&lt;ref name="Long, pp. 8-9" /&gt; The policy had the advantage of pushing responsibility for Australian defence onto Britain. Unlike New Zealand, Australia declined to contribute to the cost of the base at Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In petitioning a parsimonious government for more funds, the Australian Army had to refute the Singapore strategy, "an apparently well-argued and well-founded strategic doctrine that had been endorsed at the highest levels of imperial decision-making".&lt;ref name="Peter Dennis"&gt;{{harvnb|Dennis|2010|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:8th Div Troops.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Troops of the ill-fated Australian [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]] disembark at Singapore Harbour 15 August 1941.|alt=Men in shorts and slouch hats with rifles slung, carrying duffel bags march along a wharf. In the background is a cruise ship.]]

An alternative policy was put forward in 1923 by the [[Australian Labor Party]], which was in [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] for all but two years of the 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence to be a powerful air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William Freeland Fullam]], who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, [[naval mine]]s and [[submarine]]s. The Labor Party's [[Albert Green (Australian politician)|Albert Green]] noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost £7,000,000 while an aircraft cost £2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gill|1957|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position.&lt;ref name="Long, pp. 8-9" /&gt;

In September 1926, Lieutenant Colonel [[Henry Wynter]] gave a lecture to the [[Royal United Services Institute|United Services Institute]] of Victoria entitled "The Strategical Inter-relationship of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force: an Australian View", which was published in the April 1927 edition of ''British Army Quarterly''. In this article Wynter argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe, which would prevent Britain from sending sufficient resources to Singapore. He contended that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and the air, and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN.&lt;ref name="Long, pp. 8-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Henceforward", wrote Australian official historian Lionel Wigmore, "the attitude of the leading thinkers in the Australian Army towards British assurances that an adequate fleet would be sent to Singapore at the critical time was (bluntly stated): 'We do not doubt that you are sincere in your beliefs but, frankly, we do not think you will be able to do it.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick Shedden]] wrote a paper putting the case for the Singapore strategy as a means of defending Australia. He argued that since Australia was also an island nation, it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade. If Australia could be defeated without an invasion, the defence of Australia had to be a naval one. Colonel [[John Lavarack]], who had attended the [[Imperial Defence College]] class of 1928 with Shedden, disagreed. Lavarack responded that the vast coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult, and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist economic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennis|2010|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Richmond attacked the Labor Party's position in an article in ''British Army Quarterly'' in 1933, Lavarack wrote a rebuttal.&lt;ref name="Long, pp. 19-20" /&gt; In 1936, the [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|leader of the opposition]] [[John Curtin]] read an article by Wynter in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Wynter's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his transfer to a junior post.&lt;ref name="Long, pp. 19-20"&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] appointed a British officer, Lieutenant General [[Ernest Squires]], to replace Lavarack as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]]. Within months, the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] was replaced with a British officer as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Zealand ==
Successive New Zealand governments—the  [[Reform Government of New Zealand|Reform Government]] of 1912–1928,  [[United Government of New Zealand|United Government]] in 1928–1931,  [[United–Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|United-Reform Coalition Government]] of 1931–1935, and the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] in 1935–1949—all supported the Singapore Strategy. The New Zealand financial contribution was eight annual payments of £125,000, a million pounds in total,{{sfn|McGibbon|1981|pp=168,224}} rather than the £225,000 annually proposed by the Admiralty.{{sfn|McGibbon|1981|p=165}} Expansion of the New Zealand [[Devonport Naval Base]] was also proposed, and in 1926 the alternative of a third cruiser was considered. Labour, on coming to power in 1935, gave more importance to a local air force,{{sfn|McGibbon|1981|p=256}} though later [[Walter Nash]] accepted the need to keep sea lanes open.{{sfn|McGibbon|1981|pp=275–276}} There was little liaison with Australia; in 1938 New Zealand Chiefs of Staff papers were sent to London but not Australia.{{sfn|McGibbon|1981|pp=310–311}} But by 1936 New Zealand military confidence in the Singapore Strategy was waning; with the possibility of Italy as well as Germany and Japan as enemies, in seemed likely that Britain would also be committed in the Mediterranean.{{sfn|McGibbon|1981|pp=279,292}}

== Second World War ==
[[File:HMS Prince of Wales Singapore (041562).jpg|thumb|300px|{{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} leaves Singapore on 8 December 1941|alt=a warship]]

With war with Germany now a reality, Menzies sent [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Richard Casey]] to London to seek reassurances about the defence of Australia in the event that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Day|1988|pp=23–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Australia and New Zealand were given reassurances that Singapore would not be allowed to fall, and that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take priority over the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Paterson, p. 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Paterson|2008|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seemed possible as the [[Kriegsmarine]], the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally.&lt;ref name="McIntyre 1979 156–161" /&gt; Bruce, now [[List of Australian High Commissioners to the United Kingdom|Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]], and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left with the impression that, despite the reassurances, the Royal Navy was not strong enough to deal with simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Day|1988|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1940, the situation slowly but inexorably slid towards a worst-case scenario. In June, Italy joined the war on Germany's side and France was knocked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chiefs of Staff Committee now reported:
{{quote|The security of our imperial interests in the Far East lies ultimately in our ability to control sea communications in the south-western Pacific, for which purpose adequate fleet must be based at Singapore. Since our previous assurances in this respect, however, the whole strategic situation has been radically altered by the French defeat. The result of this has been to alter the whole of the balance of naval strength in home waters. Formerly we were prepared to abandon the Eastern Mediterranean and dispatch a fleet to the Far East, relying on the French fleet in the Western Mediterranean to contain the Italian fleet. Now if we move the Mediterranean fleet to the Far East there is nothing to contain the Italian fleet, which will be free to operate in the Atlantic or reinforce the German fleet in home waters, using bases in north-west France. We must therefore retain in European waters sufficient naval forces to watch both the German and Italian fleets, and we cannot do this and send a fleet to the Far East. In the meantime the strategic importance to us of the Far East both for Empire security and to enable us to defeat the enemy by control of essential commodities at the source has been increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There remained the prospect of American assistance. In secret talks in Washington, D.C., in June 1939, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] raised the possibility of an American fleet being sent to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1940, the American naval attaché in London, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Alan Kirk]], approached the [[List of senior officers of the Royal Navy#Vice Chiefs of the Naval Staff|Vice Chief of the Naval Staff]], [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] Sir [[Thomas Phillips (Naval officer)|Thomas Phillips]], to ask if, in the event of the [[United States Fleet]] being sent to the Far East, the docking facilities at Singapore could be made available, as those at [[Subic Bay]] were inadequate. He received full assurances that they would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopes for American assistance were dashed at the [[U.S.–British Staff Conference (ABC–1)|staff conference]] in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. The U.S. Navy was primarily focused on the Atlantic. The American chiefs envisaged relieving British warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean so a British fleet could be sent to the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Repulse leaving Singapore.jpg|thumb|left|300px| {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} leaves Singapore on 8 December 1941|alt=a warship]]

In July 1941, the Japanese occupied [[Cam Ranh Bay]], which the British fleet had hoped to use on its northward drive. This put the Japanese uncomfortably close to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; As diplomatic relations with Japan worsened, in August 1941, the Admiralty and the Chiefs of Staff began considering what ships could be sent. The Chiefs of Staff decided to recommend sending {{HMS|Barham|04|6}} to the Far East from the Mediterranean, followed by four {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship}}s that were  refitting at home and in the United States, but ''Barham'' was sunk by a German [[U-boat]] in November 1941. Three weeks later the remaining two battleships at Alexandria, {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and  {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} were [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|seriously damaged by Italian human torpedoes]]. While no more destroyers or cruisers were available, the Admiralty decided that an aircraft carrier, the small HMS ''Eagle'' could be sent.&lt;ref name="Roskill, pp. 553-559" /&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]], now the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], noted that since the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']] was tying up a superior British fleet, a small British fleet at Singapore might have a similar disproportionate effect on the Japanese. The [[Foreign Office]] expressed the opinion that the presence of modern battleships at Singapore might deter Japan from entering the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2001|pp=620–623}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1941, the Admiralty therefore ordered {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} to depart for Singapore, where it would be joined by {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}}.&lt;ref name="Roskill, pp. 553-559"&gt;{{harvnb|Roskill|1954|pp=553–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} was to join them, but it ran aground off [[Jamaica]] on 3 November, and no other carrier was available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1940, the Chiefs of Staff Committee reported that the force necessary to hold Malaya and Singapore in the absence of a fleet was 336 first-line aircraft and a garrison of nine brigades. Churchill then sent reassurances to the prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand that, if they were attacked, their defence would be a priority second only to that of the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Callahan|1974|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defence conference was held in Singapore in October 1940. Representatives from all three services attended, including Vice-Admiral Sir [[Geoffrey Layton]] (Commander in Chief, [[China Station]]); the General Officer Commanding [[Malaya Command]], Lieutenant General [[Lionel Bond]]; and Air Officer Commanding the RAF in the Far East, Air Marshal [[John Tremayne Babington]]. Australia was represented by its three deputy service chiefs, Captain [[Joseph Burnett]], Major General [[John Northcott]] and Air Commodore [[William Bostock]]. Over ten days, they discussed the situation in the Far East. They estimated that the air defence of Burma and Malaya would require a minimum of 582 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillison|1962|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 7 December 1941, there were only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and all the fighters were the obsolete [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillison|1962|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land forces situation was not much better. There were only 31 battalions of infantry of the 48 required, and instead of two tank regiments, there were no tanks at all. Moreover, many of the units on hand were poorly trained and equipped. Yet during 1941 Britain had sent 676 aircraft and 446 tanks to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese were aware of the state of the Singapore defences. There were spies in Singapore, such as [[Captain (Land)|Captain]] [[Patrick Stanley Vaughan Heenan|Patrick Heenan]], and a copy of the Chiefs of Staff's August 1940 appreciation was among the secret documents captured by the German [[Merchant raider|surface raider]] ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' from the {{SS|Automedon}} on 11 November 1940. The report was handed over to the Japanese, and the detailed knowledge of Singapore's defences thus obtained may have encouraged the Japanese to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hack|Blackburn|2003|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 1941, the Japanese occupied the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. A couple of hours later, landings began at [[Kota Bharu]] in Malaya. An hour after that, the Imperial Japanese Navy [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December, ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'', sailing to meet the Malaya invasion force, [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|were sunk by Japanese air attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the disastrous [[Malayan Campaign]], Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=382, 507}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the final stages of the campaign, the 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns had bombarded targets at [[Johore Bahru]], [[RAF Tengah]] and [[Bukit Timah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Fall of Singapore ===
The [[fall of Singapore]] was described by Winston Churchill as "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history".&lt;ref name="Churchill, p. 81" /&gt; It was a profound blow to the prestige and morale of the British Empire. The promised fleet had not been sent, and the fortress that had been declared "impregnable" had been quickly captured.&lt;ref name="Paterson, p. 32" /&gt; Nearly 139,000 troops were lost, of whom about 130,000 were captured. The 38,000 British casualties included most of the [[18th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 18th Infantry Division]], which had been ordered to Malaya in January. There were also 18,000 Australian casualties, including most of the [[8th Division (Australia)|Australian 8th Division]], and 14,000 local troops; but the majority of the defenders—some 67,000 of them—were from [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=182–183, 189–190, 382}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40,000 of the Indian prisoners of war subsequently joined the Japanese-sponsored [[Indian National Army]].&lt;ref name="McIntyre 1979 230"&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surrender Singapore.jpg|thumb|300px|Lieutenant General [[Arthur Percival]] (right) goes to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore on 15 February 1942; the Japanese officer in the centre is Lieutenant Colonel [[Ichiji Sugita]].|alt=Four British soldiers in shorts and steel helmets, and three Japanese soldiers, one wearing a steel helmet. The British are carrying a Union Flag and a white flag.]]

Richmond, in a 1942 article in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'', charged that the loss of Singapore illustrated "the folly of not providing adequately for the command of the sea in a two-ocean war".&lt;ref name="b605606" /&gt; He now argued that the Singapore strategy had been totally unrealistic. Privately he blamed politicians who had allowed Britain's sea power to be run down.&lt;ref name="b605606"&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2001|pp=605–606}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resources provided for the defence of Malaya were inadequate to hold Singapore, and the manner in which those resources were employed was frequently wasteful, inefficient and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=214–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster had both political and military dimensions. In Parliament, Churchill suggested that an official inquiry into the disaster should be held after the war.&lt;ref name="Churchill, p. 81" /&gt; When this wartime speech was published in 1946, the Australian government asked if the British government still intended to conduct the inquiry. The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no inquiry be held, as it would not be possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it would inevitably have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] accepted this advice, and no inquiry was ever held.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2010|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia and New Zealand, after years of reassurances, there was a sense of betrayal.&lt;ref name="Paterson, p. 32" /&gt; According to one historian, "In the end, no matter how you cut it, the British let them down".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murfett|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat would affect politics for decades. In a speech in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in 1992, Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] cited the sense of betrayal:
{{quote|I was told that I did not learn respect at school. I learned one thing: I learned about self-respect and self-regard for Australia—not about some [[cultural cringe#Australia|cultural cringe]] to a country which decided not to defend the Malayan peninsula, not to worry about Singapore and not to give us our troops back to keep ourselves free from Japanese domination. This was the country that you people wedded yourself to, and even as it walked out on you and joined the [[European Economic Community|Common Market]], you were still looking for your [[MBE]]s and your [[knighthood]]s, and all the rest of the regalia that comes with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia | house=House of Representatives | date = 27 February 1992 |speaker=Paul Keating |position=Prime Minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A fleet was necessary for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the [[British Pacific Fleet]], did go to the Far East,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntyre|1979|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it fought alongside the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|2010|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore Naval Base suffered little damage in the fighting and became the Imperial Japanese Navy's most important facility outside of the Japanese home islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cate|1953|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 15-inch guns were sabotaged by the British before the fall of Singapore, and four of them were deemed beyond repair and scrapped by the Japanese.&lt;ref name="guns"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.navyhistory.org.au/the-fate-of-singapores-guns-japanese-report/ |date=June 1977 |last=Bogart |first=Charles H. |title=The Fate of Singapore's Guns&amp;nbsp;– Japanese Report |publisher=Naval Historical Society of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floating dry dock was scuttled by the British, but raised by the Japanese. It was damaged beyond repair by a raid by [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es in February 1945, and ultimately towed out to sea and dumped in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46167130 |title=Largest Floating-Dock To Be Dumped |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth  |date=2 September 1946 |accessdate=3 November 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy retook possession of the Singapore base in 1945.&lt;ref name="McIntyre 1979 230" /&gt;

=== Operation Mastodon ===
In 1958, the Singapore strategy was revived in the form of [[Operation Mastodon]], a plan to deploy [[V bomber]]s of [[RAF Bomber Command]] equipped with [[nuclear weapon]]s to Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the V&amp;nbsp;bombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at [[RAF Gan]] in the [[Maldives]]. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for V&amp;nbsp;bombers, so [[RAF Butterworth]] had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran into political complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2003|pp=316–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mastodon called for the deployment of two squadrons of eight [[Handley Page Victor]]s to Tengah and one of eight [[Avro Vulcan]]s to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, most of which were of the old [[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|Blue Danube]] type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter [[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons]] to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each V&amp;nbsp;bomber could carry two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2003|pp=320–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the V&amp;nbsp;bomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2000/12/31/stinwenws02015.html|title=Britain Kept Secret Nuclear Weapons In Singapore &amp; Cyprus|last=Tom|first=Rhodes|date=31 December 2000|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=15 September 2012|location=United Kingdom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010610212649/http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2000/12/31/stinwenws02015.html|archivedate=31 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the Royal Navy deployed the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} with Red Beards and nuclear-capable [[Supermarine Scimitar]]s to the Far East in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the original Singapore strategy, there were doubts as to whether 24 V&amp;nbsp;bombers could be spared in the event of a crisis dire enough to require them,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after China's acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] heated up in 1963, Bomber Command sent detachments of Victors and Vulcans to the Far East. Over the next three years, four V&amp;nbsp;bombers were permanently stationed there, with squadrons in the United Kingdom rotating detachments. In April 1965, [[No. 35 Squadron RAF]] carried out a rapid deployment of its eight Vulcans to RAAF Butterworth and RAF Tengah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wynn|1994|pp=444–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Chief Marshal Sir [[John Grandy]] reported that the V&amp;nbsp;bombers "provided a valuable [[Deterrence theory|deterrent]] to confrontation being conducted on a large scale".&lt;ref name="Wynn, p. 448"&gt;{{harvnb|Wynn|1994|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, racial, political, and personal tensions led to [[Singapore in Malaysia|Singapore seceding from Malaysia]] and becoming an independent country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|1997|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the confrontation, the last V&amp;nbsp;bombers were withdrawn in 1966.&lt;ref name="Wynn, p. 448" /&gt; The following year, the British government announced its intention to withdraw its forces from [[East of Suez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|1997|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore Naval Base was handed over to the [[government of Singapore]] on 8 December 1968, and [[SembCorp Marine|Sembawang Shipyard]] subsequently became the basis of a successful ship repair industry.&lt;ref name="McIntyre 1979 230" /&gt; The Red Beards were returned to the UK via the US in 1971.{{sfn|Stoddart|2014|p=130}}

[[File:N. jamban and N. lingulata.jpg|thumb|Sympatric [[pitcher plant]]s, ''[[Nepenthes jamban]]'' (left) and ''[[Nepenthes lingulata]]'' (right) in [[Sumatra]]n upper montane forest]]
In biology, two related [[species]] or [[populations]] are considered '''sympatric''' when they exist in the same geographic area and thus frequently encounter one another.{{Sfn|Futuyma|2009|pp=448, G-9}} An initially interbreeding population that splits into two or more distinct species sharing a common range exemplifies [[sympatric speciation]]. Such speciation may be a product of [[reproductive isolation]]&amp;nbsp;– which prevents hybrid offspring from being viable or able to reproduce, thereby reducing [[gene flow]]&amp;nbsp;– that results in genetic divergence.{{Sfn|Futuyma|2009|p=241}} Sympatric speciation does not imply secondary contact, which is [[speciation]] or divergence in [[allopatry]] followed by range expansions leading to an area of sympatry. Sympatric species or taxa in secondary contact may or may not [[hybrid (biology)|interbreed]].

==Types of populations==
Four main types of population pairs exist in nature. Sympatric populations (or species) contrast with [[parapatric]] populations, which contact one another in adjacent but not shared ranges and do not interbreed; peripatric species, which are separated only by areas in which neither organism occurs; and [[allopatric]] species, which occur in entirely distinct ranges that are neither adjacent nor overlapping.{{Sfn|Futuyma|2009|pp=487–490}} Allopatric populations isolated from one another by geographical factors (e.g., mountain ranges or bodies of water) may experience genetic—and, ultimately, phenotypic—changes in response to their varying environments. These may drive [[allopatric speciation]], which is arguably the dominant mode of speciation.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}

==Evolving definitions and controversy==
The lack of geographic isolation as a definitive barrier between sympatric species has yielded controversy among ecologists, biologists, and zoologists regarding the validity of the term. As such, researchers have long debated the conditions under which sympatry truly applies, especially with respect to [[parasitism]]. Because parasitic organisms often inhabit multiple hosts during a life cycle, evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] stated that internal parasites existing within different hosts demonstrate allopatry, not sympatry. Today, however, many biologists consider parasites and their hosts to be sympatric (see examples below). Conversely, zoologist [[Michael J. D. White]] considered two populations sympatric if genetic interbreeding was viable within the habitat overlap. This may be further specified as sympatry occurring within one [[Deme (biology)|deme]]; that is, reproductive individuals must be able to locate one another in the same population in order to be sympatric.

Others question the ability of sympatry to result in complete speciation: until recently, many researchers considered it nonexistent, doubting that selection alone could create disparate, but not geographically separated, species. In 2003, biologist Karen McCoy suggested that sympatry can act as a mode of speciation only when "the probability of mating between two individuals depend[s] [solely] on their genotypes, [and the genes are] dispersed throughout the range of the population during the period of reproduction".{{sfn|McCoy|2003}} In essence, sympatric speciation does require very strong forces of [[natural selection]] to be acting on heritable traits, as there is no geographic isolation to aid in the splitting process. Yet, recent research has begun to indicate that sympatric speciation is not as uncommon as was once assumed.

==Syntopy==

Syntopy is a special case of sympatry. It means the joint occurrence of two [[species]] in the same [[habitat]] at the same time. Just as the broader term sympatry, "syntopy" is used especially for close species that might [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridise]] or even be [[sister species]]. ''Sympatric'' species occur together in the same region, but do not necessarily share the same localities as ''syntopic'' species do. Areas of syntopy are of interest because they allow to study how similar species may coexist without [[competition (biology)|outcompeting]] each other.

As an example, the two bat species ''[[Myotis auriculus]]'' and ''[[Myotis evotis|M. evotis]]'' were found to be syntopic in North America.&lt;ref name="Gannon1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gannon |first1=William L. |title=Syntopy between two species of long-eared bats (''Myotis evotis'' and ''Myotis auriculus'') |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=43 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=394–396 |jstor=30055386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[marbled newt]] and the [[northern crested newt]] have a large sympatric range in western France, but differ in their habitat preferences and only rarely occur syntopically in the same breeding ponds.&lt;ref name="SchoorlZuiderwijk1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schoorl |first1=Jaap |last2=Zuiderwijk |first2=Annie |title=Ecological isolation in ''Triturus cristatus'' and ''Triturus marmoratus'' (Amphibia: Salamandridae) |journal=Amphibia-Reptilia |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=1980 |pages=235–252 |issn=0173-5373 |doi=10.1163/156853881X00357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sympatric speciation==
[[File:Speciation modes.svg|thumb|360px|Different modes of [[speciation]]]]
{{Main|Sympatric speciation}}
The lack of geographic constraint in isolating sympatric populations implies that the emerging species avoid interbreeding via other mechanisms. Before speciation is complete, two diverging populations may still produce viable offspring. As speciation progresses, [[isolating mechanisms]]&amp;nbsp;– such as gametic incompatibility that renders fertilization of the egg impossible&amp;nbsp;– are selected for in order to increase the reproductive divide between the two populations.

===Species discrimination===
Sympatric groups frequently show a greater ability to discriminate between their own species and other closely related species than do allopatric groups. This is shown in the study of [[hybrid zone]]s. It is also apparent in the differences in levels of prezygotic isolation (by factors that prevent formation of a viable [[zygote]]) in both sympatric and allopatric populations. There are two main theories regarding this process: 1) differential fusion, which suggests that only populations with a keen ability to discriminate between species will persist in sympatry; and 2) [[character displacement]], which implies that distinguishing characteristics will be heightened in areas where the species co-occur in order to facilitate discrimination.

====Reinforcement====
Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection reinforces reproductive isolation. In sympatry, reinforcement increases species discrimination and sexual adaptation in order to avoid maladaptive [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and encourage speciation. If hybrid offspring are either sterile or less-fit than non-hybrid offspring, mating between members of two different species will be selected against. Natural selection decreases the probability of such hybridization by selecting for the ability to identify mates of one's own species from those of another species.

====Reproductive character displacement====
Reproductive character displacement strengthens the reproductive barriers between sympatric species by encouraging the divergence of traits that are crucial to reproduction. Divergence is frequently distinguished by [[assortative mating]] between individuals of the two species.{{sfn|Dieckmann|Doebeli|1999}} For example, divergence in the mating signals of two species will limit hybridization by reducing one's ability to identify an individual of the second species as a potential mate. Support for the reproductive character displacement hypothesis comes from observations of sympatric species in overlapping habitats in nature. Increased prezygotic isolation, which is associated with reproductive character displacement, has been observed in cicadas of genus ''[[Magicicada]]'', [[stickleback]] fish, and the flowering plants of the genus ''[[Phlox]]''.

====Differential fusion====
An alternative explanation for species discrimination in sympatry is differential fusion. This hypothesis states that of the many species have historically come into contact with one another, the only ones that persist in sympatry (and thus are seen today) are species with strong mating discrimination. On the other hand, species lacking strong mating discrimination are assumed to have fused while in contact, forming one distinct species.

Differential fusion is less widely recognized than character displacement, and several of its implications are refuted by experimental evidence. For example, differential fusion implies greater postzygotic isolation among sympatric species, as this functions to prevent fusion between the species. However, Coyne and Orr found equal levels of postzygotic isolation among sympatric and allopatric species pairs in closely related ''[[Drosophila]]''.{{sfn|Coyne|Orr|1989}} Nevertheless, differential fusion remains a possible, though not complete, contributor to species discrimination.{{sfn|Noor|1999}}

==Examples==
Sympatry has been increasingly evidenced in current research. Because of this, [[sympatric speciation]]&amp;nbsp;– which was once highly debated among researchers&amp;nbsp;– is progressively gaining credibility as a viable form of speciation.

Several distinct types of [[killer whale]] (''Orcinus orca''), which are characterized by an array of morphological and behavioral differences, live in sympatry throughout the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Antarctic oceans. In the North Pacific, three whale [[population]]s&amp;nbsp;– called "transient", "resident", and "offshore"&amp;nbsp;– demonstrate partial sympatry, crossing paths with relative frequency. The results of recent genetic analyses using [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] indicate that this is due to secondary contact, in which the three types encountered one another following the bidirectional migration of "offshore" and "resident" whales between the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Partial sympatry in these whales is, therefore, not the result of speciation. Furthermore, killer whale populations that consist of all three types have been documented in the Atlantic, evidencing that interbreeding occurs among them. Thus, secondary contact does not always result in total [[reproductive isolation]], as has often been predicted.{{sfn|Foote|Morin|Durban|Willerslev|2011}}

===Great spotted cuckoo and magpie: brood parasitism===
The parasitic [[great spotted cuckoo]] (''Clamator glandarius'') and its [[magpie]] host, both native to Southern Europe, are completely sympatric species. However, the duration of their sympatry varies with location. For example, great spotted cuckoos and their magpie hosts in Hoya de Gaudix, southern Spain, have lived in sympatry since the early 1960s, while species in other locations have more recently become sympatric. Great spotted cuckoos, when in South Africa, are sympatric with at least 8 species of starling and 2 crows, [[pied crow]] and [[Cape crow]].{{sfn|Roberts|Tarboton|2011}}

The great spotted cuckoo exhibits [[brood parasite|brood parasitism]] by laying a mimicked version of the magpie egg in the magpie's nest. Since cuckoo eggs hatch before magpie eggs, magpie hatchlings must compete with cuckoo hatchlings for resources provided by the magpie mother. This relationship between the cuckoo and the magpie in various locations can be characterized as either recently sympatric or anciently sympatric. The results of an experiment by Soler and Moller (1990) showed that in areas of ancient sympatry (species in cohabitation for many generations), magpies were more likely to reject most of the cuckoo eggs, as these magpies had developed [[counter-adaptations]] that aid in identification of egg type. In areas of recent sympatry, magpies rejected comparatively fewer cuckoo eggs. Thus, sympatry can cause [[host-parasite coevolution|coevolution]], by which both species undergo genetic changes due to the selective pressures that one species exerts on the other.{{sfn|Soler|Moller|1990}}

===''Acromyrmex'' ant: isolation of fungal gardens===
[[Leafcutter ant]]s protect and nourish various species of fungus as a source of food in a system known as [[ant-fungus mutualism]]. Leafcutter ants belonging to the genus ''[[Acromyrmex]]'' are known for their mutualistic relationship with [[Basidiomycete]] fungi. Ant colonies are closely associated with their fungus colonies, and may have [[coevolution|co-evolved]] with a consistent vertical lineage of fungi in individual colonies. Ant populations defend against the [[horizontal transmission]] of foreign fungi to their fungal colony, as this transmission may lead to competitive stress on the local fungal garden.  Invaders are identified and removed by the ant colony, inhibiting competition and fungal interbreeding. This active isolation of individual populations helps maintain the genetic purity of the fungal colony, and this mechanism may lead to [[sympatric speciation]] within a shared habitat.{{sfn|Bot|Rehner|Boomsma|2001}}

He was the first of [[Genghis Khan]]'s retainers to formulate policy during the [[Mongol conquests]], and he also introduced many administrative reforms in [[North China]] during the reign of Genghis Khan and his successor [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]].

==Biography==
Yelü Chucai was a Confucian scholar who was born close to Beijing, during the Jin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Well versed in [[Buddhist scriptures]] and a practitioner in [[Taoism]], Yelü Chucai has become best known for his service as the chief adviser to [[Genghis Khan]]. Yelü Chucai's father [[Yelu Lu]], served with the Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], which defeated the Liao Dynasty in 1125. When the unified Mongolian army under Genghis Khan began a war of conquest against the Jin dynasty in 1211, both Jurchen and Khitan rebels joined the Mongols in the fight against the Jin dynasty. Yelü Chucai then joined Genghis Khan's administration in the year 1218 at the age of 28.

The Khitans and Mongols, as well as the [[Southern Song]], were united by their common enemy in the Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]. This is shown in the well-known words spoken by Genghis Khan, when at the end of July, he met Yelü Chucai for the first time at [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] in the Sāri Steppe (west of the great bend of the Kerulen River): "Liao and Jin have been enemies for generations; I have taken revenge for you."  To which Yelü Chucai replied, "My father and grandfather have both respectfully served the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]].  How can I, as a subject and a son, be so insincere in heart as to consider my sovereign and my father as enemies?" The Mongol is said to have been impressed by this frank reply, as well as by Yelü Chucai’s looks (he was a very tall man with a magnificent beard reaching to his waist) and sonorous voice.  He gave him the nickname "Urtu Saqal" (Long Beard) and placed him in his retinue as an adviser. Because he was experienced in writing and knew the laws of other settled societies, Yelü Chucai was useful to the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford, ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World'' (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2004), 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

He did his best to convince the Mongols to tax rather than slaughter conquered peoples.  In [[René Grousset|Grousset]]'s ''Empire of the Steppes,'' it is reported that [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]] would mock him, asking "Are you going to weep for the people again?". The wise chancellor had the great words to temper the barbaric leanings of Mongol practices, stating to Genghis Khan's son and successor to the throne, that while empires may be conquered on horseback, they could not be ruled on horseback. Yelü Chucai used his office to save other fellow Confucian scholars from punishment and mistreatment by Mongol rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern TImes'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 143.&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped them gain offices as bureaucrats and tutors to the Mongol princes.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern TImes'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[North China|Northern China]] was capitulating to the Mongol onslaught, Yelü Chucai instituted several administrative reforms, like separating civil and military powers and introducing numerous taxes and levies.  In response to the tough resistance the Mongol army faced while trying to conquer the Jurchen Jin's southern capital of [[Kaifeng]], some Mongol officers in high command recommended the complete razing of Kaifeng and the deaths of all its occupants.  But Yelü Chucai convinced Genghis Khan to rule and tax the people, and make use of their extraordinary talents instead of killing all of them in order to further their own riches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/yeh-lu-chu-tsai/ Biography of Yelü Chucai]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was six-foot eight-inches tall and had a waist-length beard.&lt;ref&gt;John Man, ''Genghis Khan'', Chapter 8: "The Muslim Holocaust", published 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried by [[Kunming Lake]] in Beijing, and a temple constructed in his memory stood until 1966, when it was razed during the looting of the Summer Palace by communist Red Guards as part of the “Cultural Revolution”.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, ‘’Chinese Shadows’’, (New York: Penguin Books, 1979), 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Yelü Chucai was the last recorded person to be able to speak the [[Khitan language]] and read and write the [[Khitan script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kane | first=Daniel | authorlink=Daniel Kane (linguist) | title=The Kitan Language and Script | year=2009 | publisher=Brill | isbn=978-90-04-16829-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnsZjpIa-cYC | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
