'''Analysis of Functional NeuroImages''' ('''AFNI''') is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] environment for processing and displaying [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] data—a technique for mapping human brain activity.

AFNI is an agglomeration of programs that can be used interactively or flexibly assembled for [[batch processing]] using [[shell script]]. The term ''AFNI'' refers both to the entire suite and to a particular interactive program often used for visualization. AFNI is actively developed by the NIMH Scientific and Statistical Computing Core and its capabilities are continually expanding.

AFNI runs under many [[Unix-like]] operating systems that provide [[X11]] and [[Motif (software)|Motif]] libraries, including [[IRIX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[OS X]]. Precompiled binaries are available for some platforms. AFNI is available for research use under the [[GNU General Public License]]. AFNI now comprises over 300,000 lines of [[C (programming language)|C source code]], and a skilled C programmer can add interactive and batch functions to AFNI with relative ease.

==History and development==
AFNI was originally developed at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] beginning in 1994, largely by Robert W. Cox. Cox brought development to the NIH in 2001 and development continues at the NIMH Scientific and Statistical Computing Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mriquestions.com/best-fmri-software.html|title=Magnetism|website=Questions and Answers in MRI|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 paper describing the rationale for development of the software, Cox wrote of fMRI data: "The volume of data gathered is very large, and it is essential that easy-to-use tools for visualization  and  analysis  of  3D  activation  maps  be  available  for  neuroscience  investigators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1996-06-01|title=AFNI: Software for Analysis and Visualization of Functional Magnetic Resonance Neuroimages|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010480996900142|journal=Computers and Biomedical Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=162–173|doi=10.1006/cbmr.1996.0014|issn=0010-4809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, AFNI has become one of the more commonly used analysis tools in fMRI research, alongside [[Statistical parametric mapping|SPM]] and [[FMRIB Software Library|FSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2016/07/07/new-research-suggests-that-tens-of-thousands-of-fmri-brain-studies-may-be-flawed/#2a3e005c3ed4|title=Tens Of Thousands Of FMRI Brain Studies May Be Flawed|last=Murnane|first=Kevin|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although AFNI initially required extensive shell scripting to execute tasks, pre-made batch scripts and improvements to the [[Graphical user interface|graphical user interface (GUI)]] have since made it possible to generate analyses with less user scripting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://andysbrainblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/afnis-ubersubjectpy.html|title=Andy's Brain Blog: AFNI's uber_subject.py|last=Jahn|first=Andrew|date=2012-12-28|website=Andy's Brain Blog|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

=== Visualization ===
One of AFNI's initial offerings improved the approach to transforming scans of individual brains onto a shared standardized space. Since each person's individual brain is unique in size and shape, comparing across a number of brains requires warping (rotating, scaling, etc.) individual brains into a standard shape. Unfortunately, functional MRI data at the time of AFNI's development was too low resolution for effective transformations. Instead, researchers use the higher resolution anatomical brain scans, often acquired at the beginning of an imaging session.

AFNI allows researchers to overlay a functional image to the anatomical, providing tools for aligning the two into the same space. Processes engaged to warp an individual anatomical scan to standard space are then applied also to the functional scan, improving the transformation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1996-06-01|title=AFNI: Software for Analysis and Visualization of Functional Magnetic Resonance Neuroimages|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010480996900142|journal=Computers and Biomedical Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=162–173|doi=10.1006/cbmr.1996.0014|issn=0010-4809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature available in AFNI is the SUMA tool, developed by Ziad Saad. This tool allows users to project the 2D data onto a 3D cortical surface map. In this way researchers can view activation patterns while more easily taking into account physical cortical features like gyri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://andysbrainblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/afni-bootcamp-day-1.html|title=Andy's Brain Blog: AFNI Bootcamp: Day 1|last=Jahn|first=Andrew|date=2012-03-26|website=Andy's Brain Blog|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Image Pre-processing ===
"afni_proc.py" is a pre-made script that will run fMRI data from a single subject through a series of pre-processing steps, starting with the raw data. The default settings will perform the following pre-processing steps and finish with a basic regression analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/afni_proc.py.html|title=AFNI program:  afni_proc.py|website=afni.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Slice timing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dTshift.html|title=AFNI program:  3dTshift|website=afni.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Each 3D brain image is composed of multiple 2D images, "slices". Although acquired at approximately the same time, up to several seconds could separate the first slice acquired from the last. Through interpolation, the slices are aligned to the same time point. Generally, any introduced noise from interpolation errors is thought to be outweighed by improvements in signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindhive.mit.edu/node/109|title=Slice Timing FAQ {{!}} mindhive|website=mindhive.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Motion correction: Head movements can create sources of error in the analysis. Each 3D acquisition in a scan is collected on a 3D grid, with each small cube of grid space, "[[voxel]]", representing a single image intensity value. Ideally, voxels will always represent the same part of the brain in each acquisition, rather than vary from one 3D image to the next. To correct small motion artifacts, AFNI's motion correction tool employs a linear least squares algorithm that attempts to align each 3D image acquired to the first image acquired in the scan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dvolreg.html|title=AFNI program:  3dvolreg|website=afni.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# Smoothing: To account for random noise in the image, a smoothing kernel is applied. While smoothing can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the image, it reduces image resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~stuart/thesis/chapter_6/section6_2.html|title=Chapter 6 - The Analysis of fMRI Data|website=users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dmerge.html|title=AFNI program:  3dmerge|website=afni.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Mask: Removes any non-brain areas, such as skull, from the fMRI image. 
# Scale: Scale each voxel so that changes in intensity represent percentage of signal change over the course of the scan. The default sets the mean of each voxel equal to 100.

The '''Atwater system''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authors=D.A.T. Southgate, A.R.C. Food Research Institute, Norwich, UK|date=October 1981| url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2847E/M2847E00.HTM| accessdate=2006-03-09| title=The Relationship Between Food composition and Available Energy| work=Provisional Agenda Item 4.1.3, Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements, Rome, 5 to 17 October 1981| publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, [[World Health Organization]], The [[United Nations University]]| id=ESN: FAO/WHO/UNU EPR/81/41 August 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]], or derivatives of this system are used for the calculation of the available energy of foods. The system was developed largely from the experimental studies of Atwater and his colleagues in the later part of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th at [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. Its use has frequently been the cause of dispute, but no real alternatives have been proposed. As with the calculation of protein from total nitrogen, the Atwater system is a convention and its limitations can be seen in its derivation.

==Derivation==
Available energy (as used by Atwater) is equivalent to the modern usage of the term [[Metabolisable Energy|metabolisable energy]] (ME).

&lt;math&gt;{\text{Metabolisable Energy}} = \left(\text{Gross Energy in Food}\right) - \left(\text{Energy lost in Faeces, Urine, Secretions and Gases}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In most studies on humans, losses in secretions and gases are ignored. The gross energy (GE) of a food, as measured by [[Calorimeter#Bomb calorimeters|bomb]] [[calorimetry]] is equal to the sum of the [[Heat of combustion|heats of combustion]] of the components – [[protein]] (GE&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), fat (GE&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbohydrate]] (GE&lt;sub&gt;cho&lt;/sub&gt;) (by difference) in the proximate system.

&lt;math&gt;{GE} = {{GE}_p + {GE}_f + {GE}_{cho}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Atwater considered the energy value of feces in the same way.

&lt;math&gt;{GE}^F = {{GE}_p^F + {GE}_f^F + {GE}_{cho}^F}  \,&lt;/math&gt;

By measuring [[coefficients of availability]] or in modern terminology [[apparent digestibility]], Atwater derived a system for calculating faecal energy losses.

&lt;math&gt;\text{Digestible energy} = {{GE}_p(D_p)} + {{GE}_f(D_f)} + {{GE}_{cho}(D_{cho})}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''D&lt;sub&gt;cho&lt;/sub&gt;'' are respectively the digestibility coefficients of protein, fat and carbohydrate calculated as

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{intake}-\text{faecal excretion}}{\text{intake}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the constituent in question.

Urinary losses were calculated from the energy to nitrogen ratio in urine. Experimentally this was 7.9 kcal/g (33 kJ/g) urinary nitrogen and thus his equation for metabolisable energy became

&lt;math&gt;{ME} = \left ( {GE}_p - \frac {7.9} {6.25} \right ) D_p + {GE}_f D_f + {GE}_{cho} D_{cho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Gross energy values===
Atwater collected values from the literature and also measured the heat of combustion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. These vary slightly depending on sources and Atwater derived weighted values for the gross heat of combustion of the protein, fat and carbohydrate in the typical mixed diet of his time. It has been argued that these weighted values are invalid for individual foods and for diets whose composition in terms of foodstuffs is different from those eaten in the USA in the early 20th century.

===Apparent digestibility coefficients===
Atwater measured a large number of digestibility coefficients for simple mixtures, and in substitution experiments derived values for individual foods. These he combined in a weighted fashion to derive values for mixed diets. When these were tested experimentally with mixed diets they did not give a good prediction, and Atwater adjusted the coefficients for mixed diets.

===Urinary correction===
The energy/nitrogen ratio in urine shows considerable variation and the energy/organic matter is less variable, but the energy/nitrogen value provided Atwater with a workable approach although this has caused some confusion and only applies for subjects in nitrogen balance.

==Modified system==
Based on the work of Atwater, it became common practice to calculate energy content of foods using 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins and 9 kcal/g for [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bijal Trivedi|title=The calorie delusion: Why food labels are wrong|journal=New Scientist|date=Jul 15, 2009|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327171-200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was later improved by [[Annabel Merrill]] and [[Bernice Watt]] of the [[USDA]], who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabel Merrill|author2=Bernice Watt|title=Energy Values of Food ... basis and derivation|date=1973|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122060858/https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archivedate=Nov 22, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This takes cognizance of the fact that first the gross energy values of the protein, fats and carbohydrates from different food sources are different, and second, that the apparent digestibility of the components of different foods is different.

This system relies on having measured heats of combustion of a wide range of isolated proteins, fats and carbohydrates. It also depends on data from digestibility studies, where individual foods have been substituted for basal diets in order to measure the apparent digestibility coefficients for those foods. This approach is based on the assumption that there are no interactions between foods in a mixture in the intestine, and from a practical view point, such studies with humans are difficult to control with the required accuracy.

==Assumptions based on the use of carbohydrates by difference and the effects of dietary fibre==
The carbohydrate by difference approach presents several problems. First, it does not distinguish between sugars, starch and the unavailable carbohydrates (roughage, or "[[dietary fibre]]").

This affects first the gross energy that is assigned to carbohydrate—sucrose has a heat of combustion of 3.95&amp;nbsp;kcal/g (16.53&amp;nbsp;kJ/g) and starch 4.15&amp;nbsp;kcal/g (17.36&amp;nbsp;kJ/g).

Secondly it does not provide for the fact that sugars and starch are virtually completely digested and absorbed, and thus provide metabolisable energy equivalent to their heat of combustion.

The unavailable carbohydrates (dietary fibre) are degraded to a variable extent in the large bowel. The products of this microbial digestion are fatty acids, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide), methane and hydrogen. The fatty acids (acetate, butyrate and propionate) are absorbed in the large intestine and provide some metabolisable energy. The extent of degradation depends on the source of the dietary fibre (its composition and state of division), and the individual consuming the dietary fibre. There is insufficient data to give firm guidance on the energy available from this source.

Finally dietary fibre affects faecal losses of nitrogen and fat. Whether the increased fat loss is due to an effect on small intestinal absorption is not clear. The increased faecal nitrogen losses on high fibre diets are probably due to an increased bacterial nitrogen content of the faeces. Both these effects however lead to reductions in apparent digestibility, and therefore  the Atwater system warrants small changes in the proper energy conversion factors for those diets.

==Theoretical and practical considerations relating to the calculation of energy values==

===Variations in heats of combustion of food constituents===

====Proteins====
The experimental evidence for the magnitude of this variation is very limited, but as the heats of combustion of the individual amino-acids are different it is reasonable to expect variations between different proteins. An observed range of from 5.48 for conglutin (from blue lupin) to 5.92 for Hordein (barley) was reported, which compares with Atwaters’ range of 5.27 for gelatin to 5.95 for wheat gluten. It is difficult to calculate expected values for a protein from amino-acid data, as some of the heats of combustion are not known accurately. Preliminary calculations on cow's milk suggest a value of around 5.5 kcal/g (23.0 kJ/g).

====Fats====
Analogously the experimental evidence is limited, but since the fatty acids differ in their heats of combustion one should expect fats to vary in heats of combustion. These differences are, however, relatively small – for example, breast milk fat has a calculated heat of combustion of 9.37 kcal/g (39.2 kJ/g) compared with that of cow milk fat of 9.19 kcal/g (38.5 kJ/g).

====Carbohydrates====
Monosaccharides have heats of combustion of around 3.75 kcal/g (15.7 kJ/g), disaccharides 3.95 kcal/g (16.5 kJ/g) and ''polysaccharides 4.15 to 4.20 kcal/g (17.4 to 17.6 kJ/g)''. The heat of hydrolysis is very small and these values are essentially equivalent when calculated on a monosaccharide basis. Thus 100 g sucrose gives on hydrolysis 105.6 g monosaccharide and 100 g starch gives on hydrolysis 110 g glucose.

===Apparent digestibility coefficients===
The human digestive tract is a very efficient organ, and the faecal excretion of nitrogenous material and fats is a small proportion (usually less than 10%) of the intake. Atwater recognised that the faecal excretion was a complex mixture of unabsorbed intestinal secretions, bacterial material and metabolites, sloughed mucosal cells, mucus, and only to a small extent, unabsorbed dietary components. This might be one reason why he chose to use ''availability'' rather than ''digestibility''. His view was that these faecal constituents were truly unavailable and that his apparent disregard of the nature of faecal excretion was justifiable in a practical context.

The ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{intake}-\text{faecal excretion}}{ \text{intake}},&lt;/math&gt; wherever faecal excretion is small, will approximate to unity and thus these ''coefficients'' have a low variance and have the appearance of constants. This is spurious since faecal excretion is variable even on a constant diet, and there is no evidence to suggest that faecal excretion is in fact related to intake in the way implied by these coefficients.

===Practical considerations in calculations of energy value of foods and diets===
The calculation of energy values must be regarded as an alternative to direct measurement, and therefore is likely to be associated with some inaccuracy when compared with direct assessment. These inaccuracies arise for a number of reasons

* Variations in [[food composition]]: Foods are biological mixtures and as such show considerable variation in composition, particularly in respect of water and fat content. This means that compositional values quoted for representative samples of foods in [[food composition table]]s do not necessarily apply to individual samples of foods. In studies where great accuracy is required, samples of the food consumed must be analysed.
* Measurements of food intake: In estimating energy intakes, measurements of food intake are made, and these are known to be subject to considerable uncertainty. Even in studies under very close supervision the errors in weighing individual food items are rarely less than ±5%. A certain degree of pragmatism must therefore be used when assessing procedures for calculating energy intakes, and many authors impute greater accuracy to quoted calculated energy intakes than is justifiable.
* Individual variation: Variations in individuals are seen in all human studies, and these variations are not allowed for in most calculations.

The theoretical and physiological objections to the assumptions inherent in the Atwater system are likely to result in errors much smaller than these practical matters. Conversion factors were derived from experimental studies with young infants, but these produced values for metabolisable energy intake that were insignificantly different from those obtained by direct application of the modified Atwater factors.

'''BCSWomen''' is a Specialist Group of the [[British Computer Society]] The Chartered Institute for IT that provides networking opportunities for all BCS professional women working in IT around the world, as well as mentoring and encouraging girls and women to enter or return to IT as a career.. BCSWomen was founded by Dr [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]]. Dr Black was the first Chair of BCSWomen, followed by Dr [[Karen Petrie]] with Dr [[Hannah Dee]] as Deputy Chair. The current Chair of BCSWomen is Gillian Arnold of Tectre. BCSWomen has the aim of supporting women working in and considering a career in [[Information Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/46/1/34 Spotlight: BCSWomen Specialist Group], ''[http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/ IT Now]'', 46(1):34, January 2004. {{doi|10.1093/combul/46.1.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was founded in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Richards, [http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2006/04/04/215212/bcswomen-celebrates-five-years.htm BCSWomen celebrates five years], ''[[Computer Weekly]]'', 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It has more than a thousand members and an active mailing list. Activities include meetings, networking, and mentoring. They organise the Undergraduate Lovelace Colloquium for undergraduate women in computing, a one-day conference which started in Leeds in 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/bcswomen/ The BCSWomen Undergraduate Lovelace Colloquium], [[University of Leeds]], UK, 16 June 2008, 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and now moves around the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/BCSWomen/ The BCSWomen Undergraduate Lovelace Colloquium], [[Cardiff University]], UK, 8 April 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223141140/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/BCSWomen/ |date=23 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/BCSWomenLovelace2011/index.php The BCSWomen Undergraduate Lovelace Colloquium], [[University of Birmingham]], UK, 14 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/43741 The BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium, Bath] [[University of Bath]], UK, 12 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/events/bcswomen-lovelace-colloquium-2013.aspx The BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium, Nottingham], [[University of Nottingham]], UK, 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/lovelace-colloquium/ Lovelace Colloquium, Aberystwyth] [[Aberystwyth University]], UK, 16 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; named in honour of [[Ada Lovelace]], often regarded as the first computer programmer. The colloquium is for U.K. university women students studying Computing and related subjects. It was started by Dr [[Hannah Dee]], who continues to play a key role in its organisation every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.aber.ac.uk/hmd1/bcs.html|title=BCSWomen &amp; other BCS stuff from Hannah's Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many BCSWomen also participate in the annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215219/http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/women/LondonHopper.php London Hopper Colloquium], which showcases exciting work of women in computing research and enables new PhD researchers to meet with each other as well as with senior women computer scientists. [[Grace Hopper]] was a pioneering American computer scientist.
BCSWomen organise other events for women in computing both technical and social, such as day trips to computer-related sites such as [[Bletchley Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">A '''Bindstone''' is a special type of [[carbonate rock]] in the [[Dunham classification]]. The term Bindstone did not appear in the original Dunham classification from 1962 and was introduced by Embry and Klovan 1971 in the modified Dunham classification.

== Description ==
[[File:DunhamBindstone.jpg|thumb|A [[thin section]] of a Bindstone in the modified Dunham classification by Embry and Klovan (width of image is 9 mm) ]]
Embry and Klovan(1971)&lt;ref name="EmbryKlovan1971" /&gt; define Bindstones as rocks that "[...] contain in situ, tabular or lamellar fossils which encrusted and bound sediment during deposition. [...] The matrix, not the in situ fossils, forms the supporting framework of the rock, and the fossils may form as little as 15 percent of the constituents of the rock."&lt;ref name="EmbryKlovan1971736" /&gt;

Wright (1991)&lt;ref name="Wright1991"/&gt; uses Bindstone as a synonym for Boundstone, which is defined as a rock "[...] where the
structure reflects the encrusting and binding action of plants or animals"&lt;ref name="Wright1991181"/&gt;

Lokier and Al Nunaibi (2016)&lt;ref name="LokierAlJunaibi2016" /&gt; define Bindstones as "autochthonous carbonate-dominated rock in which the original components of the supporting matrix were organically bound through stabilization of the sediment at the time of deposition."&lt;ref name="LokierAlJunaibi20161880" /&gt;

== Problems ==
One problem in the classification is that the term Bindstone is easy to confuse with the term Boundstone. Additionally the exact relation of the two terms changes depending on the classification used. For Embry and Klovan (1971), a Boundstone is used for autochthonous carbonates if there is a lack of evidence for the more precise classifications as [[Bafflestone]], Bindstone or [[Framestone]]. In contrast to that, Wright (1991) uses Boundstone and Bindstone synonymously, which is not consistent with other authors.&lt;ref name="LokierAlJunaibi20161880" /&gt;

'''Bonestell''' is a crater in the Northern hemisphere in the [[Mare Acidalium quadrangle]] of [[Mars]], located at 42.37° North and 30.57° West.&lt;ref&gt;https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/images/mc4_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is 42.4&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Chesley Bonestell]], a famous American space artist (1888-1986), whose drawings inspired many young people to study sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/814?__fsk=-2126208231/ Bonestell]. ''Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature'', retrieved June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Impact crater]]s generally have a rim with [[ejecta]] around them.  In contrast, volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits.  As craters get larger (greater than 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/&lt;/ref&gt; The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H. Kieffer|title=Mars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoDvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=1992|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If one measures the diameter of a crater, the original depth can be estimated with various ratios.  Because of this relationship, researchers have found that many Martian craters contain a great deal of material; much of it is believed to be ice deposited when the climate was different.&lt;ref&gt;Garvin, J., et al.  2002.  Global geometric properities of martian impact craters.  Lunar Planet Sci. 33.  Abstract @1255.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes craters expose layers that were buried.   Rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface.  Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.

'''Canopy interception''' is the [[rainfall]] that is intercepted by the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of a tree and successively evaporates from the leaves. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] that is not intercepted will fall as [[throughfall]] or [[stemflow]] on the forest floor.

Many methods exist to measure canopy interception. The most often used method is by measuring rainfall above the canopy and subtract throughfall and stem flow (e.g., Helvey and Patric [1965]&lt;ref&gt;Helvey, J. D., Patric, J. H., 1965. Canopy and litter interception of rainfall by [[hardwood]]s of Eastern United States. Water Resources Research 1 (2), 193–206.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the problem with this method is that the canopy is not homogeneous, which causes difficulty in obtaining representative throughfall data.

Another method that tried to avoid this problem is applied by e.g., Shuttleworth et al. [1984],&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, W. J., Gash, J. H. C., Lloyd, C. R., Moore, C. J., Roberts, J. M., et.al, 1984. Eddy correlation measurements of energy partition for [[Amazonian forest]]. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 110, 1143–1162.&lt;/ref&gt; Calder et al. [1986],&lt;ref&gt;Calder, I. R., 1986. A stochastic model of rainfall interception. Journal of Hydrology 89, 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; and Calder [1990].&lt;ref&gt;Calder, I. R., 1990. Evaporation in the uplands. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; They covered the forest floor with plastic sheets and collected the throughfall. The disadvantage of this method is that it is not suitable for long periods, because in the end the trees will dry due to water shortage, and the method is also not applicable for snow events.

The method by Hancock and Crowther [1979]&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, N. H., Crowther, J. M., 1979. A technique for the direct measurement of water storage on a forest canopy. [[Journal of Hydrology]] 41, 105–122.&lt;/ref&gt; avoided these problems by making use of the cantilever effect of branches. If leaves on a branch hold water, it becomes more heavy and will bend. By measuring the displacement, it is possible to determine the amount intercepted water. Huang et al.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Y. S., Chen, S. S., Lin, T. P., 2005. Continuous monitoring of water loading of trees and canopy rainfall interception using the strain gauge method. Journal of Hydrology 311, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; refined this method later in 2005 by making use of strain gauges. However, the disadvantages of these methods are that only information about one single branch is obtained and it will be quite laborious to measure an entire tree or forest.

[[David Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] discovered that [[mammal]]ian [[brain]]s contained specific neural [[Cortical column|cortical columns]] which were attuned to specific spatial frequencies, specific colors, specific shapes, specific motions (up and down, left and right, inward and outward, etc.). Thus the brain could be viewed as a collection of '''tuned filters'''.

Their discovery occurred accidentally. In 1962, Hubel and Wiesel were attempting to discover that triggered neurophysiological activity in a cat's brain. The cat they were testing showed no results until they displayed a ''crack'' to the cat, whereupon the cat's brain starting reacting to the stimulus. This began a long series of discoveries which continues to the present day. Hubel and Wiesel received the Nobel Prize for their discovery.

[[Primate]] [[brain]]s like our own display even more arcane forms of tuning, which are occasionally discovered by [[fMRI]] or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans of impaired patients. These range from the recognition of faces, to the recognition of emotions, to other social, cultural, linguistic skills, etc.

The '''Community Earth System Model''' ('''CESM''') is a fully coupled [[Mathematical model|numerical]] [[Computer simulation|simulation]] of the [[Earth system science|Earth system]] consisting of [[Atmospheric model|atmospheric]], ocean, ice, land surface, carbon cycle, and other components. CESM includes a [[climate model]] providing state-of-art simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future.&lt;ref name="CESM"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Hurrell |first = James W. |author2=M. M.

'''Conamara Chaos''' is a region of [[chaos terrain|chaotic terrain]] on [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. It is named after [[Connemara]] ({{lang-ga|Conamara}}) in [[Ireland]] due to its similarly rugged landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pappalardo|first=Robert|title=Europa|year=2009|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=978-0-8165-2844-8|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jpcz2UoXejgC&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conamara Chaos is a landscape produced by the disruption of the icy crust of Europa. The region consists of rafts of ice that have moved around and rotated. Surrounding these plates is a lower matrix of jumbled ice blocks which may have been formed as water, slush, or warm ice rose up from below the surface. The region is cited as evidence for a liquid ocean below Europa's icy surface.

In [[chemistry]], a '''Controlled Lab Reactor''' or '''CLR''' is any reaction system where there is an element of [[automated]] control. Generally these devices refers to a [[jacketed glass]] vessel where a circulating [[chiller]] unit pumps a [[thermal control]] fluid through the jacket to accurately control the temperature of the vessel contents. Additional to this, it is common to have a series of sensors (temperature, pH, pressure) measuring and recording parameters about the reactor contents. It is additionally possible to control pumps to act on the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=EireChrom|first1=Lab Reactor|title=Controlled Lab Reactor: Best results on reproducibility from lab to production|publisher=Eirechrom|date=2015|url=https://www.eirechrom.ie/downloads/jacketed-lab-reactors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==

The first controlled lab reactors were derived from the control systems used in [[chemical plant]]s. These were generally dedicated to specific tasks as reprogramming was difficult. These first systems were often home built and used hardware that was adapted rather than designed for the task

==Current systems==

Modern CLR systems take a wide range of forms with the ability to work on a range of different volume reactors (and indeed reactor styles). Data is usually transmitted back to a [[Personal Computer|PC]] to be recorded (and indeed complex recipe based control is usually performed here too) though other systems may use off-line data logging.

==Embedded sensors==

In the most sophisticated systems that exist, analytical instruments such as [[raman spectrometer]]s and [[FTIR probes]] can also be integrated with the reactor. These more sophisticated systems also allow the [[Control theory|closed loop control]] of the reactor as a result of taking readings from the sensors and analytical instruments concerned.

==Reaction calorimeters==

Most reaction [[calorimeters]] can be used as controlled lab reactors (indeed some calorimeters are based on CLR's).

'''Corona poling''' is a technique in [[optoelectronics]].  

[[Corona discharge]] is a partial breakdown of [[air]], usually at [[atmospheric pressure]], and is initiated by a discharge in an [[inhomogeneous]] [[electric field]] (see Figure 1). Corona discharge has been used to [[Poling (piezoelectricity)|pole]] films of electro-optic materials to enhance their electro-optic properties. 

Although corona poling can be performed at [[room temperature]], poling at elevated temperature has several advantages. For example, raising the temperature in a [[polymer]] guest-host system close to its glass-rubber [[transition temperature]] before poling increases the mobility of the guest molecules and allows rotation to occur during poling. If during poling the temperature is lowered well below the transition temperature, the guest molecules are fixed in their new orientation.

Oxford Dictionaries. April 2010. Oxford Dictionaries. April 2010.

The work of engineers forms the link between [[scientific discoveries]] and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.&lt;ref name="bls" /&gt;

==Definition==
In 1961
, the Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe and the United States of America defined "professional engineer" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Steen Hyldgaard Christensen, Christelle Didier, Andrew Jamison, Martin Meganck, Carl Mitcham, and Byron Newberry
Springer. {{Google books|BFnACQAAQBAJ|Engineering Identities, Epistemologies and Values: Engineering Education and Practice in Context, Volume 2|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=A professional engineer is competent by virtue of his/her fundamental education and training to apply the scientific method and outlook to the analysis and solution of engineering problems. He/she is able to assume personal responsibility for the development and application of engineering science and knowledge, notably in research, design, construction, manufacturing, superintending, managing and in the education of the engineer. His/her work is predominantly intellectual and varied and not of a routine mental or physical character. It requires the exercise of original thought and judgement and the ability to supervise the technical and administrative work of others. His/her education will have been such as to make him/her capable of closely and continuously following progress in his/her branch of engineering science by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis, assimilating such information and applying it independently. He/she is thus placed in a position to make contributions to the development of engineering science or its applications. His/her education and training will have been such that he/she will have acquired a broad and general appreciation of the engineering sciences as well as thorough insight into the special features of his/her own branch. In due time he/she will be able to give authoritative technical advice and to assume responsibility for the direction of important tasks in his/her branch. }}

==Roles and expertise==

===Design===
Engineers develop new technological solutions. During the [[engineering design process]], the responsibilities of the engineer may include defining problems, conducting and narrowing research, analyzing criteria, finding and analyzing solutions, and making decisions. Much of an engineer's time is spent on researching, locating, applying, and transferring information.&lt;ref&gt;A. Eide, R. Jenison, L. Mashaw, L. Northup. Engineering: Fundamentals and Problem Solving. New York City: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,2002&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, research suggests engineers spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.&lt;ref name="Robinson (2010) JASIST"/&gt;

Engineers must weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements and needs. Their crucial and unique task is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result.

===Analysis===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-23805-1665, Ingenieure mit Konstruktionsplan.jpg|thumb|Engineers conferring on prototype design, 1954]]

Engineers apply techniques of [[engineering analysis]] in testing, production, or maintenance. Analytical engineers may supervise production in factories and elsewhere, determine the causes of a process failure, and test output to maintain quality. They also estimate the [[time and motion study|time and cost required to complete projects]]. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects. Engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system, device or mechanism under study.  Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and recombining the components. They may [[Risk analysis (engineering)|analyze risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baecher | first1 = G.B. | last2 = Pate | first2 = E.M. | last3 = de Neufville | first3 = R. | year = 1979 | title = Risk of dam failure in benefit/cost analysis | url = | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 449–456 | doi=10.1029/wr016i003p00449 | bibcode=1980WRR....16..449B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartford, D.N.D. and Baecher, G.B.

Many engineers use computers to produce and analyze designs, to simulate and test how a machine, structure, or system operates, to generate specifications for parts, to monitor the quality of products, and to control the efficiency of processes.

===Specialization and management===
[[Image:Firing Room -2 During Apollo 12 CDDT - GPN-2000-000632.jpg|300px|left|thumb|NASA Launch Control Center Firing Room 2 as it appeared in the Apollo era]]
Most engineers specialize in one or more [[List of engineering branches|engineering disciplines]].&lt;ref name="bls" /&gt; Numerous specialties are recognized by professional societies, and each of the major branches of engineering has numerous subdivisions. Civil engineering, for example, includes structural and transportation engineering and materials engineering include ceramic, metallurgical, and polymer engineering. Mechanical engineering cuts across just about every discipline since its core essence is [[applied physics]].  Engineers also may specialize in one industry, such as motor vehicles, or in one type of technology, such as turbines or semiconductor materials.&lt;ref name="bls" /&gt;

Several recent studies have investigated how engineers spend their time; that is, the work tasks they perform and how their time is distributed among these.

Amongst other more detailed findings, a recent [[work sampling]] study&lt;ref name="Robinson (2012) DS"/&gt; found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.

Engineering is also an information-intensive field, with research finding that engineers spend 55.8% of their time engaged in various different information behaviours, including 14.2% actively seeking information from other people (7.8%) and information repositories such as documents and databases (6.4%).&lt;ref name="Robinson (2010) JASIST"/&gt;

The time engineers spend engaged in such activities is also reflected in the competencies required in engineering roles. In addition to engineers’ core technical competence, research has also demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to success in the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M.

==Types of engineers==
{{Main|List of engineering branches}}

There are many branches of engineering, each of which specializes in specific technologies and products. Typically engineers will have deep knowledge in one area and basic knowledge in related areas. For example, mechanical engineering curricula typically includes introductory courses in electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, metallurgy, mathematics, and software engineering.

When developing a product, engineers typically work in interdisciplinary teams. For example, when building robots an engineering team will typically have at least three types of engineers. A mechanical engineer would design the body and actuators. An electrical engineer would design the power systems, sensors, electronics, embedded software in electronics, and control circuitry. Finally, a software engineer would develop the software that makes the robot behave properly.  Engineers that aspire to management engage in further study in business administration, project management and organizational or business psychology.  Often engineers move up the management hierarchy from managing projects, functional departments, divisions and eventually CEO's of a multi-national corporation.

==Ethics==
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]] is held as a case study of [[engineering ethics]].]]
Engineers have obligations to the public, their clients, employers, and the profession. Many [[engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. Each engineering discipline and professional society maintains a code of ethics, which the members pledge to uphold. Depending on their specializations, engineers may also be governed by specific statute, whistleblowing, product liability laws, and often the principles of [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = American Society of Civil Engineers | authorlink = American Society of Civil Engineers | year = 2006 | title = Code of Ethics | publisher = ASCE Press | location = Reston, Virginia, USA | url = http://www.asce.org/Leadership-and-Management/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/ | accessdate = 2011-06-11 | origyear = 1914 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110214054231/http://www.asce.org/Leadership-and-Management/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/ | archivedate = 14 February 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Institution of Civil Engineers | authorlink = Institution of Civil Engineers | year = 2009 | title = Royal Charter, By-laws, Regulations and Rules | url = http://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/c0b1371e-5179-49da-8e5f-62a6abe0b9fd/ICE-Royal-Charter,-By-laws,-Regulations-and-Rules.aspx | accessdate = 2011-06-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110103162741/http://ice.org.uk/getattachment/c0b1371e-5179-49da-8e5f-62a6abe0b9fd/ICE-Royal-Charter,-By-laws,-Regulations-and-Rules.aspx | archive-date = 3 January 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = National Society of Professional Engineers | authorlink = National Society of Professional Engineers | year = 2007 | title = Code of Ethics | publisher = NSPE | location = Alexandria, Virginia, USA | url = http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/Ethics/CodeofEthics/Code-2007-July.pdf | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | origyear = 1964 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202180723/http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/Ethics/CodeofEthics/Code-2007-July.pdf | archive-date = 2 December 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Engg Ringing CU.jpg|thumb|left|An engineer receiving his [[Order of the Engineer]] ring|215x215px]]

Some graduates of engineering programs in North America may be recognized by the [[iron ring]] or [[Engineer's Ring]], a ring made of iron or stainless steel that is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand. This tradition began in 1925 in Canada with [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]], where the ring serves as a symbol and reminder of the engineer's obligations to the engineering profession. In 1972, the practice was adopted by several colleges in the United States including members of the [[Order of the Engineer]].

==Education==
{{Main|Engineering education}}

Most engineering programs involve a concentration of study in an engineering specialty, along with courses in both mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Many programs also include courses in general engineering and applied accounting. A design course, often accompanied by a computer or laboratory class or both, is part of the curriculum of most programs. Often, general courses not directly related to engineering, such as those in the social sciences or humanities, also are required.

[[Educational accreditation|Accreditation]] is the process by which engineering programs are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met. The [[Washington Accord]] serves as an international accreditation agreement for academic engineering degrees, recognizing the substantial equivalency in the standards set by many major national engineering bodies. In the United States, post-secondary degree programs in engineering are accredited by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]].

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation and licensure in engineering}}
In many countries, engineering tasks such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, industrial equipment, machine design and chemical plants, must be approved by a licensed professional engineer. Most commonly titled [[professional engineer]] is a license to practice and is indicated with the use of [[post-nominal letters]]; PE or P.Eng.  These are common in North America, as is [[European Engineer|European engineer (EUR ING)]] in Europe. The practice of engineering in the UK is not a regulated profession but the control of the titles of [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer (CEng)]] and [[Engineering technologist#United Kingdom|incorporated engineer (IEng)]] is regulated. These titles are protected by law and are subject to strict requirements defined by the Engineering Council UK.  The title CEng is in use in much of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:TacomaNarrowsBridgeCollapse in color.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse]] --&gt;
Many skilled / semi-skilled trades and [[engineering technician]]s in the UK call themselves engineers. A growing movement in the UK is to legally protect the title 'Engineer' so that only professional engineers can use it; a petition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/6271|title=Make 'Engineer' a protected title – Petitions|work=Petitions – UK Government and Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; was started to further this cause.

In the United States, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law. Licensure is generally attainable through combination of education, pre-examination ([[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]), examination (professional engineering exam),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/] NCEES is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing professional licensure for engineers and surveyors.&lt;/ref&gt; and engineering experience (typically in the area of 5+ years). Each state tests and licenses professional engineers. Currently, most states do not license by specific engineering discipline, but rather provide generalized licensure, and trust engineers to use professional judgment regarding their individual competencies; this is the favoured approach of the professional societies. Despite this, at least one of the examinations required by most states is actually focused on a particular discipline; candidates for licensure typically choose the category of examination which comes closest to their respective expertise. In the United States, an "industrial exemption" allows businesses to employ employees and call them an "engineer", as long as such individuals are under the direct supervision and control of the business entity and function internally related to manufacturing (manufactured parts) related to the business entity, or work internally within an exempt organization. Such person does not have the final authority to approve, or the ultimate responsibility for, engineering designs, plans, or specifications that are to be: (A) incorporated into fixed works, systems, or facilities on the property of others; or (B) made available to the public. These individuals are prohibited from offering engineering services directly to the public and/or other businesses, and/or engage in practice of engineering; unless the business entity is registered with the state's board of engineering, and the practice is carried on/supervised directly only by engineers licensed to engage in the practice of engineering.&lt;ref&gt;https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/lawrules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, some positions, such as a “sanitation engineer”, does not have any basis in engineering sciences. 

In Canada, engineering is a self regulated profession.  The profession in each province is governed by its own engineering association. For instance, in the Province of British Columbia an engineering graduate with four or more years of post graduate experience in an engineering-related field and passing exams in ethics and law will need to be registered by the Association for Professional Engineers and Geoscientists ([[APEGBC]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apeg.bc.ca/|title=APEGBC – Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to become a Professional Engineer and be granted the professional designation of P.Eng allowing one to practice engineering.

In [[Continental Europe]], Latin America, Turkey, and elsewhere the title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree and the use of the title by others is illegal. In Italy, the title is limited to people who both hold an engineering degree and have passed a professional qualification examination (''Esame di Stato''). In Portugal, professional engineer titles and accredited engineering degrees are regulated and certified by the ''[[Ordem dos Engenheiros]]''. In the Czech Republic, the title "engineer" (Ing.) is given to people with a (masters) degree in chemistry, technology or economics for historical and traditional reasons. In Greece, the academic title of "Diploma Engineer" is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course and the title of "Certified Engineer" is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies at a Technological Educational Institute (TEI).

==Perception==
{{Original research section|date=July 2014}}
The perception and definition of the term 'engineer' varies across countries and continents.[[File:Brunel.jpg|thumb|right|19th-century engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] by the launching chains of the [[SS Great Eastern]]]]

=== UK ===
British school children in the 1950s were brought up with stirring tales of "the Victorian Engineers", chief amongst whom were [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]], [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]], [[Thomas Telford|Telford]], and their contemporaries. In the UK, "engineering" has more recently been styled as an industry sector consisting of employers and employees loosely termed "engineers" who included semi-skilled trades. However, the 21st-century view, especially amongst the more educated members of society, is to reserve the term "engineer" to describe a university-educated practitioner of ingenuity represented by the Chartered (or Incorporated) Engineer qualifications.  However, a large proportion of the UK public still thinks of "engineers" as skilled tradespeople or even semi-skilled tradespeople with a high school education.  Also, UK skilled and semi-skilled tradespeople style themselves as "engineers".  This has created confusion in the eyes of some members of the public (particularly the less well educated) to understand what professional engineers actually do, from fixing car engines, television sets and refrigerators to designing and managing the development of aircraft, spacecraft, power stations, infrastructure, and other complex technological systems.

=== France ===
In France, the term 'ingénieur" (engineer) is not a protected title and can be used by anyone, even by those who do not possess an academic degree.

However, the title "Ingénieur Diplomé" (Graduate Engineer) is an official academic title that is protected by the government and is associated with the "[[Diplôme d'Ingénieur]]", which is one of the most prestigious academic degrees in France. Anyone misusing this title in France can be fined a large sum and jailed, as it is reserved for graduates of French engineering ''[[grandes écoles]]'' that provide highly intensive training in science and engineering. Among such institutions, the most renown (and hardest to gain admission) are [[École Centrale Paris|Ecole Centrale Paris (Centrale)]], [[Mines ParisTech|Ecole des Mines de Paris (Mines Paristech)]], [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers]], [[École Polytechnique|Ecole Polytechnique]], and [[Ecole des Ponts ParisTech]]. Engineering schools which were created during the French revolution have a special reputation among the French people, as they helped to make the transition from a mostly agricultural country of late 18th century to the industrially developed France of the 19th century. A great part of 19th-century France's economic wealth and industrial prowess was created by engineers that have graduated from [[École Centrale Paris|Ecole Centrale Paris]], [[Mines ParisTech|Ecole des Mines de Paris]], or [[École Polytechnique|Ecole Polytechnique]]. This was also the case after the WWII when France had to be rebuilt.

Before the "réforme [[René Haby]]" in the 70's, it was very difficult to be admitted to such schools, and the French ''ingénieurs'' were commonly perceived as the nation's elite (hence the term  "faire les [[Grandes écoles]]" in language of older people). However, after the Haby reform and a string of further reforms ([[Modernization plans of French universities]]), several engineering schools were created which can be accessed with relatively lower competition, and this reputation as being part of the French elite now applies to those from 'top' engineering schools for engineers, [[École nationale d'administration|École Nationale d'Administration (ENA)]] for managers or politicians and [[École normale supérieure|École Normale Supérieure (ENS)]] for researchers in science and humanities. Engineers are less highlighted in current French economy as industry provides less than a quarter of the GDP.

=== North America ===
In the US and Canada, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law.  Licensed professional engineers in Canada and the USA are referred to as P.Eng (Canada) and PE (USA).  A 2002 study by the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers revealed that engineers are the third most respected professionals behind doctors and pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, 2002, [http://www.ospe.on.ca/pdf/Newsletter-Feb-2002.pdf Engineering: One of Ontario's most respected professions]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Auto Rice Milling Plants.jpg|thumb|left|180x180px|Auto rice milling machinery in Bangladesh]]
In Ontario, and all other Canadian provinces, the "title" Engineer is protected by law and any non-licensed individual or company using the title is committing a legal offense, and can get fined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90p28 Professional Engineers Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.28]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies usually prefer not to use the title except for license holders because of liability reasons, for instance, if the company filed a lawsuit and the judge, investigators, or lawyers found that the company is using the word engineer for non-licensed employees this could be used by opponents to hinder the company's efforts.

=== Asia and Africa ===
In the [[Indian subcontinent]], Russia, Middle East, Africa, and China, engineering is one of the most sought after undergraduate courses, inviting thousands of applicants to show their ability in highly competitive entrance examinations.

In Egypt, the educational system makes engineering the second-most-respected profession in the country (after medicine); engineering colleges at [[Egyptian universities]] require extremely high marks on the General Certificate of Secondary Education ({{lang-ar|الثانوية العامة}} ''al-Thānawiyyah al-`Āmmah'')—on the order of 97 or 98%—and are thus considered (along with the colleges of medicine, natural science, and pharmacy) to be among the "pinnacle colleges" ({{lang|ar|كليات القمة}} ''kullīyāt al-qimmah'').

In the Philippines and [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino communities overseas]], engineers who are either Filipino or not, especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as ''Engineer'', rather than ''Sir/Madam'' in speech or ''Mr./Mrs./Ms.'' (''G./Gng./Bb.'' in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.

===Corporate culture===
In companies and other organizations, there is sometimes a tendency to undervalue people with advanced technological and scientific skills compared to celebrities, fashion practitioners, entertainers, and managers. In his book, ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, p119 (see also p242), Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2nd ed. 1995, pub. Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Brooks Jr says that managers think of senior people as "too valuable" for technical tasks and that management jobs carry higher prestige. He tells how some laboratories, such as Bell Labs, abolish all job titles to overcome this problem: a professional employee is a "member of the technical staff." IBM maintain a dual ladder of advancement; the corresponding managerial and engineering or scientific rungs are equivalent. Brooks recommends that structures need to be changed; the boss must give a great deal of attention to keeping his managers and his technical people as interchangeable as their talents allow.

'''Eudoxa''' is a Swedish [[think tank]], formed in 2000.  Eudoxa has a [[transhumanist]], and [[Liberalism|liberal]] political profile, with a focus on promoting [[wikt:dynamism|dynamism]], [[emerging technologies]], [[harm reduction]] policy and discussing the challenges of the [[Natural environment|environment]] and the [[future]]. It is independent from political parties and other political and religious interest groups.

Eudoxa organizes seminars and conferences about these subjects, produces reports for corporations and organizations and promotes public debate.

It has a staff consisting both of scientist and humanists, in order to bridge the rift between [[The Two Cultures]] on evaluating the effects of emerging technologies, and give a better analysis. Its intellectual inspiration derives much from the book [[The Future and Its Enemies]] by [[Virginia Postrel]]. 

Eudoxa has discussed [[biotechnology]], [[harm reduction]], [[health care]], [[nanotechnology]], [[RFID]], and [[intellectual property]]. 

Eudoxa is the Swedish partner in the [[International Property Rights Index]].

The think tank currently consists of: [[Waldemar Ingdahl]], [[Alexander Sanchez (Eudoxa)|Alexander Sanchez]], and [[Anders Sandberg]].

According to the ''2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report'' ([[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]], [[University of Pennsylvania]]), Eudoxa is rated number 25 (of 45) in the "Top Science and Technology Think Tanks" of the world.&lt;ref name="Global Go To"&gt;{{cite web| author=James G.

'''Eugène Eudes-Deslongchamps''' (10 March 1830&amp;nbsp;– 21 December 1889) was a French [[paleontologist]] and [[naturalist]] born in [[Caen]], the son of paleontologist [[Jacques Amand Eudes-Deslongchamps]] (1794–1867). He died at Château Matthieu, [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]].

Around 1856 he succeeded his father as professor of [[zoology]] at the faculty of sciences at the [[University of Caen]], later becoming a professor of [[geology]] and [[Dean (education)|dean]] (1861). After the death of his father in 1867, he devoted himself to the completion of a memoir on the [[Teleosauridae|teleosaurs]], the joint labours being embodied in his ''Prodrome des Téléosauriens du Calvados''. He contributed several of his memoirs to the Société Linnéenne de Normandie.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Deslongchamps, Jacques Amand Eudes-|display=Deslongchamps, Jacques Amand s.v.

[[File:Alison Richard Building, Cambridge university.jpg|thumb|Alison Richard Building]]
The '''Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science''' at the [[University of Cambridge]] was created in 2011 out of a merger of the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology and the Faculty of Politics, Psychology, Sociology and International Studies. Many Cambridge HSPS students go on to work in politics and government in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and China. Other graduate destinations include the United Nations, World Bank, World Economic Forum, and various NGO-groups.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsps.cam.ac.uk/ Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty houses 3 departments: Department of Archaeology and Anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archanth.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Archaeology and Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge|Department of Politics and International Studies]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Politics and International Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; and Department of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Sociology]&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these departments has a worldwide reputation for teaching and research, and the undergraduate curriculum (Tripos) is designed to serve both students who have a clear disciplinary commitment at the time of application as well as those who want a broader multidisciplinary degree. Students with a passion for politics can take advantage of links with such departments as Economics and History, those with interests in Sociology can draw on Anthropology and Geography, while those dedicated to pursuing an archaeology career can specialise from the first year or combine this with Biological and Social Anthropology.

Undergraduate students study several disciplines in their first year and then specialise in one or two disciplines in their second and third years. Clearly specified tracks (Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Politics, Psychology, Social Anthropology, Sociology, or a combination of disciplines) ensure that students graduate with appropriate intellectual and professional skills. Assyriology and Egyptology are also possible specialisations, within the Archaeology track.

At the postgraduate level, there are established one-year M.Phils in Archaeology (including Assyriology and Egyptology), Biological Anthropology, International Studies, Social Anthropology and Sociology. A new M.Phil in Politics was launched in 2008. Ph.D students conduct research within a wide range of subjects within Archaeology, Assyriology, Egyptology, Biological and Social Anthropology, Politics &amp; International Studies and Sociology.

The Faculty is currently spread across several sites. The SPS Library (now affiliated with the University Library) and the Department of Sociology are on Free School Lane at the [[New Museums Site]]. The Department of Politics &amp; International Studies is currently located at the Alison Richard Building on the [[Sidgwick Site]]. The Department of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology is spread across the Downing Site, New Museums Site, and Henry Wellcome Building.

==Teaching==
'''Tripos (BA)'''

An Archaeology and Anthropology Tripos has been taught at Cambridge for more than a century. A Politics, Psychology and Sociology [[Tripos]] (previously known as Social and Political Sciences, "SPS") has been running at [[Cambridge University]], in some form, since 1970.  From 2013, the PPS and A&amp;A Triposes will be replaced by the Human, Social, and Political Sciences Tripos (HSPS), which will offer students the opportunity to explore a wide range of multi-disciplinary options before specialising in one or two subjects, or to specialise from the first year, according to their interests. 

'''Postgraduate (MPhil/PhD)'''

The Faculty teaches seven masters programmes in  Politics, International Studies, Sociology, Social Anthropology, Social and Developmental Psychology, Archaeology (including Assyriology and Egyptology), Biological Anthropology. The Faculty also has around 200 students studying for doctorates at any one time. Many graduate students go on to work in politics and government in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and China. Other graduate destinations include the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]], and various NGO-groups.

==Applications==
The number of applicants per place for Politics, Psychology and Sociology has traditionally been one of the highest in Cambridge. On average, there are six applications per offered place, though this ratio is better at some colleges such as Murray Edwards. Colleges with particular teaching strength in Human, Social, and Political Science include [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]], [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens']], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]], [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/statistics/subjects.html#pps http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics ;]&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers of applications for the new HSPS BA course remain high across all colleges. Typical offers for the course are A*AA at A Level, or 40–42 points out of 45 with 776 or 777 at Higher Level in the International Baccalaureate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsps.cam.ac.uk/prospective-students/hsps-leaflet&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008-2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdp.cam.ac.uk/annual_report/sdp_annual_report_2008_2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; the MPhil in Social and Developmental Psychology received 66 applications, with 7 starting the course in October 2008. The MPhil in Modern Society and Global Transformations saw 99 applicants, with 26 starting the course in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.cam.ac.uk/annual_report/sociology_annual_report_2008-09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fleming's Right-hand Rule'''  (for [[Electric generator|generators]]) shows the direction of [[induced current]] when a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] attached to a circuit moves in a [[magnetic field]].  It can be used to determine the direction of current in a generator's windings.

When a conductor such as a wire attached to a circuit moves through a magnetic field, an [[electric current]] is induced in the wire due to [[Faraday's law of induction]].  The current in the wire can have two possible directions.  Fleming's right-hand rule gives which direction the current flows.

The right hand is held with the [[thumb]], [[index finger]] and [[middle finger]] mutually perpendicular to each other (at right angles), as shown in the diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hughes Electrical &amp; Electronic Technology|last=Hughes|first=Edward|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=|isbn=978-1-292-09304-8|edition=12th|location=|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The thu'''m'''b is pointed in the direction of the '''m'''otion of the conductor relative to the magnetic field.
* The '''f'''irst finger is pointed in the direction of the magnetic '''f'''ield. (north to south)
* Then the se'''c'''ond finger represents the direction of the induced or generated '''c'''urrent within the conductor (from the terminal with lower [[electric potential]] to the terminal with higher electric potential, as in a voltage source)

The bolded letters in the directions above give a mnemonic way to remember the order. Another mnemonic for remembering the rule is the initialism "FBI", standing for '''F'''orce (or otherwise motion), '''B''' the symbol for the magnetic field, and '''I''' the symbol for current. The subsequent letters correspond to subsequent fingers, counting from the top. Thumb -&gt; F; First finger -&gt; B; Second finger -&gt; I

There is also a [[Fleming's left hand rule]] (for [[electric motors]]). The appropriately handed rule can be recalled from the letter "'''g'''", which is in "ri'''g'''ht" and "'''g'''enerator".

These [[mnemonic]]s are named after British engineer [[John Ambrose Fleming]], who invented them.

The field of [[psychology]] has been greatly influenced by the study of [[genetics]]. Decades of research has demonstrated that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in a variety of behaviors in humans and animals (e.g. Grigorenko &amp; Sternberg, 2003). The genetic basis of [[aggression]], however, remains poorly understood. Aggression is a multi-dimensional concept, but it can be generally defined as behavior that inflicts pain or harm on another.

Genetic-developmental theory states that individual differences in a continuous [[phenotype]] result from the action of a large number of [[genes]], each exerting an effect that works with environmental factors to produce the trait.&lt;ref name="Tremblay05"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tremblay, Richard E., Hartup, Willard W. and Archer, John (eds.) |year=2005 |title=Developmental Origins of Aggression |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=1-59385-110-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of trait is influenced by multiple factors making it more complex and difficult to study than a simple [[Mendelian]] trait (one [[gene]] for one [[phenotype]]).

==History==
Past thought on genetic factors influencing aggression tended to seek answers from [[chromosomal abnormalities]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Specifically, four decades ago, the [[XYY]] genotype was (erroneously) believed by many to be correlated with aggression. In 1965 and 1966, researchers at the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]] Clinical &amp; Population Cytogenetics Research Unit led by Dr. Court Brown at [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]] reported finding a much higher than expected nine XYY men (2.9%) averaging almost 6&amp;nbsp;ft. tall in a survey of 314 patients at the [[State Hospital]] for [[Scotland]]; seven of the nine XYY patients were mentally retarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Court Brown, W.M. |year=1967 |title=Human Population Cytogenetics |location=Amsterdam |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their initial reports published before examining the XYY patients, the researchers suggested they might have been hospitalized because of aggressive behavior. When the XYY patients were examined, the researchers found their assumptions of aggressive behavior were incorrect. Unfortunately, many science and medicine textbooks quickly and uncritically incorporated the initial, incorrect assumptions about XYY and aggression—including psychology textbooks on aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johnson, Roger N. |year=1972 |title=Aggression in Man and Animals |location=Philadelphia |publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |isbn=0-7216-5160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The XYY genotype first gained wide notoriety in 1968 when it was raised as a part of a defense in two murder trials in [[Australia]] and [[France]]. In the [[United States]], five attempts to use the XYY genotype as a defense were unsuccessful—in only one case in 1969 was it allowed to go to a jury—which rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Denno, Deborah H. |year=1996 |chapter=Legal implications of genetics and crime research |editor=Bock, Gregory R. |editor2=Goode, Jamie A. |title=Genetics of Criminal and Antisocial Behavior |pages=248–264 |location=Chichester |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn= 0-471-95719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results from several decades of long-term follow-up of scores of unselected XYY males identified in eight international newborn chromosome screening studies in the 1960s and 1970s have replaced pioneering but [[ascertainment bias|biased]] studies from the 1960s (that used only institutionalized XYY men), as the basis for current understanding of the XYY genotype and established that XYY males are characterized by increased height but are not characterized by aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allanson, Judith E. |author2=Graham, Gail E. |year=2002 |chapter=Sex chromosome abnormalities |editor1=Rimoin, David L. |editor2=Connor, J. Michael. |editor3=Pyeritz, Reed E. |editor4=Korf, Bruce R. |title=Emery and Rimoin's Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics |edition=4th |pages=1184–1201 |location=London |publisher=Churchill-Livingstone |isbn= 0-443-06434-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Milunsky, Jeff M. |year=2004 |chapter=Prenatal Diagnosis of Sex Chromosome Abnormalities |editor=Milunsky, Aubrey |title= Genetic Disorders and the Fetus: Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment |edition=5th |pages=297–340 |location=Baltimore |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-7928-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the link currently between genetics and aggression has turned to an aspect of genetics different from chromosomal abnormalities, it is important to understand where the research started and the direction it is moving towards today.

==Heritability==
[[Aggression]], as well as other behavioral traits, is studied genetically based on its [[heritability]] through generations. Heritability models of aggression are mainly based on animals due to the ethical concern in using humans for [[genetics|genetic]] study. Animals are first selectively bred and then placed in a variety of environmental conditions, allowing researchers to examine the differences of [[Selection (biology)|selection]] in the aggression of animals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Research methods===
As with other topics in [[behavioral genetics]], aggression is studied in three main experimental ways to help identify what role [[genetics]] plays in the [[behavior]]:
* [[Heritability]] studies – studies focused to determine whether a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]], such as aggression, is heritable and how it is inherited from parent to offspring. These studies make use of genetic linkage maps to identify [[genes]] associated with certain behaviors such as aggression.
* Mechanism experiments – studies to determine the biological mechanisms that lead certain genes to influence types of behavior like aggression.
* Genetic behavior [[correlation]] studies – studies that use scientific data and attempt to correlate it with actual human behavior. Examples include [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]].

These three main experimental types are used in [[animal studies]], studies testing heritability and [[molecular genetics]], and gene/environment interaction studies. Recently, important links between aggression and genetics have been studied and the results are allowing scientists to better understand the connections.&lt;ref name="Nelson06"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nelson, Randy Joe (ed.) |year=2006 |title=Biology of Aggression |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-516876-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective breeding===
The [[heritability]] of aggression has been observed in many animal strains after noting that some strains of birds, dogs, fish, and mice seem to be more [[aggressive]] than other strains. [[Selective breeding]] has demonstrated that it is possible to select for genes that lead to more aggressive behavior in animals.&lt;ref name="Nelson06"/&gt; Selective breeding examples also allow researchers to understand the importance of [[developmental]] timing for genetic influences on aggressive behavior. A study done in 1983 (Cairns) produced both highly aggressive male and female strains of mice dependent on certain developmental periods to have this more aggressive behavior expressed. These mice were not observed to be more aggressive during the early and later stages of their lives, but during certain periods of time (in their middle-age period) were more violent and aggressive in their attacks on other mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brain, Paul F. and Benton, David (eds.) |year=1981 |title=The Biology of Aggression |location= Alphan aan den Rijn, The Netherlands |publisher=Sijthoff and Noordhoff |isbn=90-286-2851-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selective breeding is a quick way to select for specific [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] and see those selected traits within a few generations of [[reproduction|breeding]]. These characteristics make selective breeding an important tool in the study of genetics and aggressive behavior.

===Mouse studies===
[[Mice]] are often used as a model for human [[genetics|genetic]] behavior since mice and humans have [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[genes]] coding for homologous [[proteins]] that are used for similar functions at some biological levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Southwick, Charles H. |year=1970 |title=Animal Aggression: Selected Readings |location=London |publisher=Litton Educational Publishing Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice aggression studies have led to some interesting insight in human aggression. Using [[reverse genetics]], the [[DNA]] of genes for the receptors of many [[neurotransmitter]]s have been [[cloned]] and [[sequenced]], and the role of neurotransmitters in rodent aggression has been investigated using [[pharmacological]] manipulations. [[Serotonin]] has been identified in the offensive attack by male mice against intruder male mice. Mutants were made by manipulating a receptor for serotonin by deleting a gene for the serotonin receptor. These mutant male mice with the knockout [[alleles]] exhibited normal behavior in everyday activities such as eating and exploration, but when prompted, attacked intruders with twice the intensity of normal male mice. In offense aggression in mice, males with the same or similar [[genotype]]s were more likely to fight than males that encountered males of other genotypes. Another interesting finding in mice dealt with mice reared alone. These mice showed a strong tendency to attack other male mice upon their first exposure to the other animals. The mice reared alone were not taught to be more aggressive; they simply exhibited the behavior. This implicates the natural tendency related to biological aggression in mice since the mice reared alone lacked a parent to model aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name="Bock96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bock, Gregory R. and Goode, Jamie A. (eds.) |year=1996 |title=Genetics of Criminal and Antisocial Behavior |location=Chichester |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-471-95719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxidative stress]] arises as a result of excess production of reactive oxygen species in relation to defense mechanisms, including the action of [[antioxidant]]s such as superoxide dismutase 1 ([[SOD1]]).  Knockout of the Sod1 gene was experimentally introduced in male mice leading to impaired [[antioxidant]] defense.&lt;ref name="pmid25524980"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garratt M, Brooks RC |title=A genetic reduction in antioxidant function causes elevated aggression in mice |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |volume=218 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=223–7 |date=January 2015 |pmid=25524980 |doi=10.1242/jeb.112011 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These mice were designated (''Sod1-/-'').   The ''Sod1-/-'' male mice proved to be more aggressive than both [[zygosity|heterozygous]] knockout males (''Sod1+/-'') that were 50% deficient in SOD1, and wild-type males (''Sod1+/+'').&lt;ref name="pmid25524980" /&gt;  The basis for the association of oxidative stress with increased aggression has not yet been determined.

==Biological mechanisms==
Experiments designed to study biological mechanisms are utilized when exploring how [[aggression]] is influenced by [[genetics]]. [[Molecular genetics]] studies allow many different types of behavioral traits to be examined by manipulating [[genes]] and studying the effect(s) of the manipulation.

===Molecular genetics===
A number of [[molecular genetics]] studies have focused on manipulating candidate aggression [[genes]] in mice and other animals to induce effects that can be possibly applied to humans. Most studies have focused on [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] of [[serotonin]] receptors, [[dopamine]] receptors, and [[neurotransmitter]] metabolizing [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name="Tremblay05"/&gt; Results of these studies have led to [[linkage analysis]] to map the serotonin-related genes and impulsive aggression, as well as dopamin-related genes and proactive aggression. In particular, the serotonin [[5-HT]] seems to be an influence in inter-male [[aggression]] either directly or through other molecules that use the 5-HT pathway. 5-HT normally dampens aggression in animals and humans. Mice missing specific genes for 5-HT were observed to be more aggressive than normal mice and were more rapid and violent in their attacks.&lt;ref name="Nelson01"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nelson, Randy J.  |author2=Chiavegatto, Silvana |year=2001 |title=Molecular basis of aggression |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=713–9 |pmid=11718876 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01996-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have been focused on neurotransmitters. Studies of a [[mutation]] in the neurotransmitter metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) have been shown to cause a syndrome that includes violence and impulsivity in humans.&lt;ref name="Tremblay05"/&gt; Studies of the molecular genetics pathways are leading to the production of [[pharmaceuticals]] to fix the pathway problems and hopefully show an observed change in aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name="Nelson01"/&gt;

==Human behavior genetics==
In determining if a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] is related to genetic factors or environmental factors, [[twin studies]] and adoption studies are used. These studies examine [[correlations]] based on similarity of a trait and a person's genetic or environmental factors that could influence the trait. [[Aggression]] has been examined via both twin studies and adoption studies.

===Twin studies===
Twin studies manipulate the environmental factors of behavior by examining if [[identical twins]] raised apart are different from twins raised together. Before the advancement of [[molecular genetics]], twin studies were almost the only mode of investigation of [[genetics|genetic]] influences on personality. [[Heritability]] was estimated as twice the difference between the [[correlation]] for identical, or monozygotic, twins and that for fraternal, or dizygotic, twins. Early studies indicated that personality was fifty percent genetic. Current thinking holds that each individual picks and chooses from a range of [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and events largely on the basis of his [[genotype]] creating a unique set of experiences; basically meaning that people create their own environments.&lt;ref name="Bock96"/&gt;

The '''Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit''' (HHMU), also known as the maneuvering gun, or informally as "the zip gun", was used by astronaut [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] in the first American "spacewalk" ([[extra-vehicular activity]], EVA), on [[Gemini 4]], June 3, 1965. Different models of HHMU were present on Gemini 4, 8, 10, and 11, but were only used on Gemini 4 and [[Gemini 10|10]].&lt;ref name=Birds&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter13.html From Engineering Science To Big Science (1998) - Chap.13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=us&gt;{{cite book |title= US Spacesuits |last= |first= |authorlink= |authors= Kenneth S.

Astronauts described the gun as easier to use than other methods of maneuvering during space-walking.  It provided an [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] to send the space-walker away from and back to the spacecraft, and was the easiest way for him to control his motions in the [[microgravity environment]].

The Gemini 4 device received its propellant from tanks on the device and used pressurized [[oxygen]] to control and propel the astronaut via [[conservation of momentum]].&lt;ref name=Birds/&gt;&lt;ref name='gemini4eva'&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/gemini_4_eva.html Gemini 4 Extravehicular Activity] summary from [[NASA]]&lt;/ref&gt; White enjoyed using the gun&lt;ref name="mcdivitt"/&gt; and found it useful,&lt;ref name='white_bio'&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/white.htm Biography of Ed White] from [[NASA]] history archive.&lt;/ref&gt; but quickly ran out of propellant, forcing him to pull on his tether to continue maneuvers. However, fellow crewman [[James McDivitt]] recalled the gun as being "hopeless" and "utterly useless" as it required precise aim through the user's [[center of mass]] in order to [[translation (geometry)|translate]] in a straight line without inducing unwanted [[rotation]].&lt;ref name="mcdivitt"&gt;[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/McDivittJA/JAM_6-29-99.pdf Oral History Transcript] / [http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/McDivittJA/mcdivittja.pdf James A. McDivitt] / Interviewed by Doug Ward / Elk Lake, Michigan - 29 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The device carried on [[Gemini 8]] (March 16–17, 1966) received its [[Tetrafluoromethane|Freon 14]] propellant from a tank to be carried on the astronaut's back.&lt;ref name=Birds/&gt; Astronaut [[David Scott]] never got a chance to use it, because the mission had to be terminated before his EVA due to a critical thruster problem.

The Gemini 10 device used by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] received its [[nitrogen]] gas propellant from inside the spacecraft, through a hose bundled with the astronaut's umbilical connector.&lt;ref name=Birds/&gt; Collins successfully used it to move back and forth between the Gemini and the [[Agena Target Vehicle]].

[[Richard F. Gordon Jr.|Richard Gordon]] did not get to use his HHMU on [[Gemini 11]], because his EVA had to be cut short when he became fatigued.

'''Hans Strøm''' (25 January 1726 – 1 February 1797) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] clergyman. He also became a prominent [[zoologist]] and [[naturalist]]. He is best associated with his topographical description of the [[Districts of Norway|traditional district]] of [[Sunnmøre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hivolda.no/ahf/hansstrom/hansstrom.htm ''Hans Strøm'' (Høgskulen i Volda)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927164745/http://www2.hivolda.no/ahf/hansstrom/hansstrom.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://snl.no/Hans_Str%C3%B8m|title = Hans Strøm | publisher = Store norske leksikon | author = Magne Njåstad|accessdate = December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Strøm was born at [[Borgund, Møre og Romsdal|Borgund]] in [[Møre og Romsdal]], Norway. His father was a clergyman and many other relatives of both his father and mother were ministers. He attended the [[Bergen Cathedral School]]. He was educated as a Lutheran clergyman and in 1745 took a theological degree at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Then he worked from 1750 to 1764 as chaplain in [[Borgund, Møre og Romsdal|Borgund]]. In 1764 he became parish priest, first in [[Volda]] where he served until 1779, when he went to [[Eiker]] where he served as Vicar for 18 years. He died at [[Hokksund]] in [[Øvre Eiker]] in [[ Buskerud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eiker.org/Leksikon/Hans-Stroem.htm ''Hans Strøm'' (Eiker Lekiskon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Strøm was the first Norwegian who gave species descriptions for Norwegian animals. The results of his research was published as ''Physisk og Oeconomisk Beskrivelse over Fogderiet Søndmør I–II'' (Copenhagen, 1762–1766), a work that established his reputation as a scientific authority. He followed up this work with a number of articles, particularly where the natural sciences were strongly represented. He co-founded the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] in 1760, with [[Gerhard Schoning]], the historian, and [[Johan Ernst Gunnerus]], bishop of [[Trondheim]]. In 1779, Strøm was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. He was also elected as a member of a number of science academies in Norway, Denmark and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hivolda.no/ahf/hansstrom/tidstavle.htm ''Biography of Hans Strøm'' (in Norwegian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316231726/http://www2.hivolda.no/ahf/hansstrom/tidstavle.htm |date=2005-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The term '''hybrid neural network''' can have two meanings: 
#[[biological neural networks]] interacting with [[artificial neural network|artificial neuronal models]], and
#[[Artificial neural networks]] with a [[Computationalism|symbolic]] part (or, conversely, symbolic computations with a [[Connectionism|connectionist]] part). 

As for the first meaning, the [[artificial neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in hybrid networks can be [[Digital data|digital]] or [[analog circuit|analog]]. For the digital variant [[voltage clamp]]s are used to monitor the [[membrane potential]] of [[neuron]]s, to computationally simulate artificial neurons and synapses and to stimulate biological neurons by inducing synaptic. For the analog variant, specially designed electronic circuits connect to a network of living neurons through electrodes. 

As for the second meaning, incorporating elements of symbolic computation and artificial neural networks into one model was an attempt to combine the advantages of both paradigms while avoid the shortcomings. Symbolic [[Knowledge representation|representation]]s have advantages with respect to explicit, direct control, fast initial coding, dynamic variable binding and knowledge abstraction. Representations of artificial neural networks, on the other hand, show advantages for biological plausibility, learning, robustness (fault-tolerant processing and graceful decay), and generalization to similar input. Since the early 1990s many attempts have been made to reconcile the two approaches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8184">'''Low-voltage electron microscope (LVEM)''' is an [[electron microscope]] which operates at accelerating voltages of a few kilo[[electronvolt]]s or less. Traditional electron microscopes use accelerating voltages in the range of 10-1000 keV.

Low voltage imaging in transmitted electrons is possible in many new scanning electron detector.

Low cost alternative is dedicated table top low voltage transmission electron microscope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lv-em.com LVEM5 from Delong America]&lt;/ref&gt; While its architecture is very similar to a conventional [[transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscope]], it has a few key changes that enable it to take advantage of a 5 keV electron source, but trading off many advantages of higher voltage operations, including higher resolution,  possibility of X-ray microanalysis and EELS, etc... Recently a new low voltage transmission electron microscope has been introduced that operates at variable voltage ranges between 6–25 kV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lv-em.com LVEM25 from Delong America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Higher contrast===
A substantial decrease of electron energy allows for a significant improvement of [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of light elements. The comparison images below show that decreasing the acceleration voltage from 80 kV to 5 kV significantly enhances the contrast of test samples. The improved contrast is a direct result of increased electron scattering associated with a reduced accelerating voltage.

LVEM brings an enhancement of imaging contrast nearly twenty times higher than for 100 kV. This is very promising for biological specimens which are composed from light elements and don't exhibit sufficient contrast in classical TEMs.&lt;ref name=nebes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nebesářová1|first=Jana |author2=Vancová, Marie |year=2007 |title=How to Observe Small Biological Objects in Low Voltage Electron Microscope |journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=248–249 |doi=10.1017/S143192760708124X|doi-broken-date=2018-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, a relatively low mean free path (15&amp;nbsp;nm) for organic samples at 5 kV means that for samples with constant thickness, high contrast will be obtained from small variations in density. For example, for 5% contrast in the LVEM bright field image, we will only need to have a difference in density between the phases of 0.07 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that the usual need to stain polymers for enhanced contrast in the TEM (typically done with [[osmium]] or [[ruthenium tetraoxide]]) may not be necessary with the low voltage electron microscopy technique.&lt;ref name="drummythinfilms"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drummy |first=Lawrence, F.|author2=Yang, Junyan |author3=Martin, David C. |year=2004 |title=Low-voltage electron microscopy of polymer and organic molecular thin films |journal=Ultramicroscopy |pmid=15149719 |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=247–256 |doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2004.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stain not required===
The improved contrast allows for the significant reduction, or elimination, of the heavy metal [[negative stain]]ing step for TEM imaging of light elements (H, C, N, O, S, P). While staining is beneficial for experiments aimed at high resolution structure determination, it is highly undesirable in certain protein sample preparations, because it could destabilize the protein sample due to its acid pH and relatively high heavy metal concentration. The addition of stain to sectioned samples such as biological materials or polymers can also introduce imaging artifacts.

LVEM experiments carried out on an extracted membrane protein sample that was analyzed with and without the staining procedure show a marked improvement in the appearance of the sample when standard staining is omitted. Results show that LVEM could be even more useful than conventional EM for this particular application because it avoids the potentially disrupting staining step, thus providing an undisturbed image of the protein’s aggregation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asmar |first=G.A. |author2=Hanson, M.A. |author3=Ward, A.B. |author4=Lasalde, J.A. |author5=Stevens, R.C. |author6=Potter, C. |author7=Kuhn, P.

Additionally, The ability to eliminate the staining step could aid to improve safety in the lab, as common heavy metal stains, such as [[uranyl acetate]] do have associated health risks.

===Resolution===
The first low-voltage electron microscopes were capable of spatial resolutions of about 2.5&amp;nbsp;nm in TEM, 2.0&amp;nbsp;nm in STEM, and 3.0&amp;nbsp;nm in SEM modes.&lt;ref name="drummythinfilms"/&gt; The SEM resolution has been improved to ~1.2 nm at 800 eV by 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2010.07.012|pmid=20728276|year=2010|author1=Van Aken|first1=R.

E.|last5=Kruit|first5=P}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 0.14 nm TEM resolution at 15 keV has been reported in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.153004|pmid=27768334|title=Atomic Resolution Imaging at an Ultralow Accelerating Voltage by a Monochromatic Transmission Electron Microscope|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=117|issue=15|pages=153004|year=2016|last1=Morishita|first1=Shigeyuki|last2=Mukai|first2=Masaki|last3=Suenaga|first3=Kazu|last4=Sawada|first4=Hidetaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Currently available low voltage microscopes are only able to obtain resolutions of 1.0–3 nanometers. While this is well beyond resolutions possible from optical (light) microscopes, they are not yet able to compete with the atomic resolution obtainable from conventional (higher voltage) electron microscopes.

Low voltage limits the maximum thickness of samples which can be studied in the TEM or STEM mode. Whereas it is about 50-90&amp;nbsp;nm in conventional TEM, it decreases to around 20–65 nanometers for LVEM @ 5 kV. However, thicknesses of the order of 20&amp;nbsp;nm or less are required to attain the maximal resolution in the TEM and STEM modes 5 kV..&lt;ref name=nebes/&gt;&lt;ref name="drummythinfilms"/&gt; These thickness are sometimes achievable with the use of an [[ultramicrotome]].

in 2015 these limitations were overcome with a 25 kV low voltage electron microscope that can produce high quality results with thin sectioned samples up to around 100 nm+.

'''lumi''' is a [[Free software|free]], [[Open-source software|open source]] and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] expression and methylation microarray data. The project was started in the summer of 2006 and set out to provide algorithms and data management tools of Illumina in the framework of [[Bioconductor]]. It is based on the [[statistics|statistical]] [[R programming language]].

==Features ==
The '''lumi''' package provides an analysis pipeline for probe-level Illumina expression and methylation microarray data, including probe-identifier management ([[nuID]]), updated probe-to-gene mapping and annotation using the latest release of RefSeq (nuIDblast), probe-intensity transformation (VST) and normalization (RSN), quality control (QA/QC) and preprocessing methods specific for Illumina methylation data. By extending the ExprSet object with Illumina-specific features, '''lumi''' is designed to work with other Bioconductor packages, such as Limma and GOstats to detect differential genes and conduct Gene Ontology analysis.

==History==
The '''lumi''' project was started in the summer of 2006 at the Bioinformatics Core Facility  of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, [[Northwestern University]]. Originally '''lumi''' was designed for the analysis of Illumina Expression BeadArray data. Starting from 2010 (version &gt; 2.0), functions of analyzing Illumina methylation microarray data was added. The project team consists of Drs. Pan Du, Simon M. Lin, and Warren A. Kibbe. The project was started upon a request for collaboration from [[Serdar Bulun|Dr. Serdar E. Bulun]] to analyze a set of new Illumina microarray data acquired at his lab on the study of the effect of retinoic acids on cancers. Dr. Pan Du led the software development of the project. '''lumi''' was the first software package to utilize the unique design of redundancy of beadArrays for the data transformation and normalization processes. The first release of '''lumi''' was on January 3, 2007 through the [[Bioconductor]] website. Before its formal release, it was beta-tested at Norwegian Radiumhospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Università degli Studi di Brescia,  UC Davis, Wayne State University, NIH, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Harvard University, Washington University, and Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.

'''''Mad about Physics: Brainteasers, Paradoxes, and Curiosities''''' by [[Christopher Jargodzki]] and [[Franklin Potter]] (2001, published by John Wiley and Sons) is a book containing 397 puzzles and their solutions. The book covers information on [[mechanics]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]], as well as the physics of sports, [[space exploration]], and [[astronomy]]. ''Mad about Physics'' has been translated into seven languages, including German, [[Greek language|Greek]], Japanese, and Chinese. As of 2013, ''Mad about Physics'' is in its 10th reprinting.

==Content==
From the preface: "Solutions and more than three hundred references are provided. They constitute about two-thirds of the book. Most of the puzzles contain an element of surprise. Indeed, the clash between common sense conjecture and physical reasoning is the central theme that runs through this volume. Einstein characterized common sense as the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen, and we agree: At least in science, common sense is to be refined and often transcended rather than venerated. The present volume tries to undermine physical preconceptions employing paradoxes (from the Greek ''para'' and ''doxes'', meaning 'beyond belief') to create cognitive dissonance. 'Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.' We believe that far from being merely amusing, paradoxes are uniquely effective in addressing specific deficiencies in understanding. (cf. Daniel W. Welch, 'Using paradoxes.' ''American Journal of Physics'' 48 [1980]: 629–632)."

''Mad about Physics cover (1st Ed.)'' contains a multitude of questions which are claimed to be both creative and difficult.
A few examples:

* Why do professional race car drivers accelerate when going around a curve? 
* Why is there eight times more ice in Antarctica than in the Arctic?
* Why is a full moon about nine times brighter than a half-moon even though its lit area is only twice as large? 
* Why can you warm your hands by blowing gently and cool your hands by blowing hard? 
* Why are the tallest mountains on Mars much taller than ours even though Mars is only about half the size of Earth?

An extensive set of marginalia is provided, including jokes, anecdotes, offbeat scientific facts, and unusual quotations ranging from Einstein on the sensation of the mystical to Bugs Bunny on the law of gravity. For example:

* Isaac Newton spent years trying to date the world's end. He leaned toward 1948.
* An inscription on the wall of a restroom at Princeton University: 2 + 2 = 5 for large values of 2.
* The first prize offered for communication with extraterrestrials was announced in 1900, but Mars was excluded because it was felt that contact with the Martians would be too easy. 

A detailed 7-page index is also included.

Physicist Peter Ford (University of Bath, UK) described ''Mad about Physics'' as a "fascinating new book." He wrote that "many of its problems will be useful for teachers, both at senior level in schools and at universities, for discussion with students in small groups. Such tutorials should be used to encourage students to start talking about physics and 'thinking like a physicist.'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1760">'''Relative apparent synapomorphy analysis''', or '''RASA''', is a method that aims to determine whether a given character is shared between [[Taxon|taxa]] due to [[shared ancestry]] or due to [[Convergence (biology)|convergence]]. A [[synapomorphy]] is a shared trait found among two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor, whose ancestor in turn does not possess the trait.

'''Ronald Alexander McIntosh''' (21 January 1904 – 17 May 1977) was a New Zealand journalist who was most famous for his contributions to [[astronomy]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] on 21 January 1904 and left school at the age of 14. In 1926 he began a long career in [[journalism]] when he started work at [[The New Zealand Herald]] as a proofreader. He married Harriet Munro in 1930. After [[World War II]] service in New Zealand in military intelligence he re-joined ''The New Zealand Herald'', becoming a sub-editor in 1945 before leaving the following year. After spending some years working on aviation magazines and in [[public relations]] McIntosh returned to the ''Herald'' in 1957 as a senior sub-editor. Ronald McIntosh died in Auckland in 1977 and was survived by his wife, son, daughter and sister.&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

==Astronomical Work==

His interest in astronomy was kindled by the 1910 appearance of [[Halley's Comet]], and at age 13 he made his first binocular observations of the [[Moon]]. From 1919 to 1950 he collaborated with a number of other New Zealand amateurs in naked-eye observations of [[meteors]]. The group recorded 15,627 meteors between 1927 and 1945, with McIntosh contributing about half. He drew on these observations when he published a number of research papers on meteors. One of his most important papers was ''An Index to Southern Meteor Showers''. Published in 1935, it remained the standard work for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

In 1927 he purchased a 14-inch [[Newtonian telescope]] which was used for lunar and planetary studies. Over a 30-year period he studied various lunar features and published papers based on his observations. He studied the crater [[Aristarchus (crater)|Aristarchus]] for a long period, beginning in the early 1950s. His main planetary focus was [[Jupiter]] and he made many observations from 1927 to the 1960s. He also observed [[Saturn]] and [[Mars]] as well as [[Comets]].&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

McIntosh was also interested in the history of science, and published papers on the history of astronomy in New Zealand. He played a role in establishing the [[Auckland Observatory]] and devoted a lot of his time to popularising astronomy through lectures, planetarium sessions and newspaper articles. He was a long-time member of the New Zealand Astronomical Society (later the [[Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand]]), the [[Auckland Astronomical Society]], the [[American Meteor Society]] and the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

==Recognition==

His work was frequently acknowledged by [[Charles Pollard Olivier]] of the [[American Meteor Society]] and he was elected to the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s Commission 22 on Meteors. He was twice awarded the Donovan Medal by the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]].&lt;ref name=Hockey&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hockey|first1=Thomas|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-31022-0|page=758|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=t-BF1CHkc50C&amp;pg=PA758&amp;lpg=PA758&amp;dq=ronald+alexander+mcintosh+meteors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mg64oZTtB5&amp;sig=mBjwagDYABzTHkysdfhyVAgeW4g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ronald%20alexander%20mcintosh%20meteors&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 August 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Safecast''' is an international, volunteer-centered organization devoted to open [[citizen science]] for the environment. Safecast was established by Sean Bonner, Pieter Franken, and [[Joi Ito]] shortly after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in Japan, following the [[Tōhoku earthquake]] on 11 March 2011 and manages a global [[open data]] network for [[ionizing radiation]] monitoring.

The Safecast team, with help of International Medcom, Tokyo [[Hackerspace]] and other volunteers, has designed various [https://github.com/Safecast/General/wiki/Safecast-Devices devices] for radiation mapping. These include the bGeigie and bGeigie Nano for mobile applications (carborne and walking measurements) as well as fixed stations called Pointcast.

All data are collected via the [http://api.safecast.org/ Safecast API] and are presented on the publicly available interactive [http://safecast.org/tilemap/ Safecast Tile Map].

Safecast later expanded to offer [[air quality]] sensors which also report open [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] maps.

==bGeigie Nano==
Safecast bGeigie Nano is a portable radiation detector equipped with a [[Geiger-Mueller tube]] type detector, built-in GPS and logging to microSD card.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Image:Safecast Tile Map screenshot.jpeg|250px|right|thumb|Screenshot of Safecast Tile Map website with data visualization]]

The bGeigie Nano is available as a kit, so the user needs to learn how to solder in order to build it from the supplied parts. The kit can be purchased from the [https://kithub.cc/safecast/ Kithub product page]. The device was developed in collaboration with International Medcom Inc. and shares some parts with their [https://medcom.com/product/imi-inspector-alert-surface-contamination-meter/ Inspector Alert™] detector. According to the [https://github.com/Safecast/bGeigie-transitional Safecast Github page] ''"bGeigie Nano is a lighter version of the bGeigie Mini using an Arduino Fio, a GpsBee, an OpenLog and an Inspector Alert geiger counter. The aim is to make everything fit in a Pelican Micro Case 1040"''.
The final version of the bGeigie is placed inside the smaller Pelican Micro Case 1010. It features the [http://www.lndinc.com/products/17/ LND 7317] pancake [[Geiger-Mueller tube]] type detector, a GPS receiver and is expandable with a Bluetooth module. The mode switch offers choice between geotagged radiation logging (data saved to microSD card) and measuring without GPS - showing also Bq/m2 (Cs137) values. Inside the case the unit is calibrated for gamma radiation. The main unit taken out of its case will additionally do α- and β-detection for careful use as a surface contamination spot meter.

According to the KitHub page &lt;ref&gt;https://kithub.cc/safecast-researchers/ - KitHub - Agencies Using Safecast Devices&lt;/ref&gt; Safecast devices are also used by the following institutions:  
* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] ([[IAEA]])
* Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety / [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire]] ([[IRSN]]), France
* [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC), United States
* Czech National Radiation Protection Institute / [http://www.suro.cz/en Státní ústav radiační ochrany] (SÚRO), [[Czech Republic]]

In [[botany]], a '''section''' ({{lang-la|sectio}}) is a [[taxonomic rank]] below the [[genus]], but above the [[species]].&lt;ref name="Stuessy"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tod F.

Sections may in turn be divided into subsections.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 in {{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

Sections are typically used to help organise very large genera, which may have hundreds of species.&lt;ref name="Stuessy"/&gt; A botanist wanting to distinguish groups of species may prefer to create a taxon at the rank of section or series to avoid making [[combinatio nova|new combinations]], i.e. many new [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]] for the species involved.&lt;ref name="Stuessy"/&gt;

Examples:
* ''[[Lilium]]'' section ''Martagon'' &lt;small&gt;Rchb.&lt;/small&gt; are the Turks' cap lilies
* ''[[Plagiochila]] aerea'' &lt;small&gt;Taylor&lt;/small&gt; is the [[type species]] of ''Plagiochila'' sect. ''Bursatae''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">In [[applied physics]], the concept of '''controlling self-organized criticality''' refers to the control of processes by which a [[self-organized]] system dissipates [[energy]]. The objective of the control is to reduce the probability of occurrence of and size of [[energy dissipation]] bursts, often called ''avalanches'', of self-organized systems.  Dissipation of energy in a [[self-organized criticality|self-organized critical]] system into a lower energy state can be costly for society, since it depends on avalanches of all sizes usually following a kind of [[power law]] distribution and large avalanches can be damaging and disruptive.&lt;ref name=cajand10a&gt;{{cite journal

== Schemes ==

Several strategies have been proposed to deal with the issue of controlling self-organized criticality:

#''The design of controlled avalanches.'' [[Daniel O. Cajueiro]] and [[Roberto F. S. Andrade]] show that if well-formulated small and medium avalanches are exogenously triggered in the system, the energy of the system is released in a way that large avalanches are rarer.&lt;ref name="cajand10a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cajand10b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cajand10c" /&gt;
#'' The modification of the degree of interdependence of the network where the avalanche spreads.'' [[Charles D. Brummitt]], [[Raissa M. D'Souza]] and [[E. A. Leicht]] show that the dynamics of self-organized critical systems on [[complex network]]s depend on connectivity of the complex network. They find that while some connectivity is beneficial (since it suppresses the largest cascades in the system), too much connectivity gives space for the development of very large cascades and increases the size of capacity of the system.&lt;ref name=brum12&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = C. D. Brummitt, R. M. D'Souza and E. A. Leicht
 | year = 2012
 | title = Suppressing cascades of load in interdependent networks

 | pmid=22355144
 | pmc=3311366}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'' The modification of the deposition process of the self-organized system.''  [[Pierre-Andre Noel]], Charles D. Brummitt and Raissa M. D'Souza show that it is possible to control the self-organized system by modifying the natural deposition process of the self-organized system adjusting the place where the avalanche starts.&lt;ref name=noel13&gt;{{cite journal

|arxiv = 1305.1877 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.111g8701N
 | pmid=23992086}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'' Dynamically modifying the local thresholds of cascading failures.'' In a model of an electric transmission network, Heiko Hoffmann and David W. Payton demonstrated that either randomly upgrading lines (sort of like preventive maintenance) or upgrading broken lines to a random breakage threshold suppresses self-organized criticality.&lt;ref name=hh2014&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = H. Hoffmann and D. W. Payton
 | year = 2014

 | pages = 87–93
 | doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2014.06.011
| bibcode = 2014CSF....67...87H
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, these strategies undermine the self-organization of large critical clusters. Here, a critical cluster is a collection of transmission lines that are near the failure threshold and that collapse entirely if triggered.

== Applications ==

There are several events that arise in nature or society where these ideas of control may help to avoid them:&lt;ref name="cajand10a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cajand10b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cajand10c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brum12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="noel13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hh2014" /&gt;

# [[Flood]] caused by systems of dams and reservoirs or interconnected valleys. 
# Snow avalanches that take place in snow hills.
# Forest fires in areas susceptible to a lightning bolt or a match lighting. 
# [[Cascading failure|Cascades of load shedding]] that take place in power grids (a type of [[power outage]]). The [[power outage#OPA model|OPA model]] is used to study different techniques for criticality control.
# [[Cascading failure]] in the internet switching fabric.
# [[Ischemic cascade]]s, a series of biochemical reactions releasing toxins during moments of inadequate blood supply.
# [[Systemic risk]] in financial systems.
# [[Criticality accident|Excursions in nuclear energy systems]].

The failure cascades in electrical transmission and financial sectors occur because economic forces cause these systems to operate near a critical point, where avalanches of indeterminate size become possible.

'''''The Curiosity Show''''' is an [[Australia]]n educational children's [[television show]] produced from 1972 to 1990 and hosted by [[zoologist]] Dr. [[Rob Morrison (scientist)|Rob Morrison]] and Dr. [[Deane Hutton]]. The show was produced by Banksia Productions in [[South Australia]] for the [[Nine Network]]. 500 episodes were produced.

==History==
Banksia Productions produced the popular children's series ''[[Here's Humphrey]]'' from 1965. The company planned to add some science segments in 1971 and sought assistance from the South Australian Institute of Technology. Rob Morrison and Deane Hutton were selected as presenters and the segments were introduced as ''Humphrey B Bear's Curiosity Show''. After positive reception from the audience, Banksia Productions and the Nine Network agreed to produce a spin-off series. Planning commenced with the working title ''The F Show''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Hutton, the working title resulted from the single word uttered by producer [[Ian Fairweather (presenter)|Ian Fairweather]] when told he was to make a science show for children.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton adds that until the early 1970s, children's television was aimed at younger children.  The broadcasting regulations were changed to require a proportion of programmes to be aimed at school-age children, broadcast after school hours.  This prompted the creation of the Curiosity Show as a separate show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= Deane Hutton &amp; Rob Morrison|date= |title=Curiosity! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvLE899SA1s |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date=30 October 2014 |format= |time=3m16s |location= |publisher=TEDxCanberra |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
From 1972 to 1980 the format was a 60-minute show presented by Morrison, Hutton, Ian Fairweather, [[Alister Smart]], [[Belinda Davey]], Gabrielle Kelly, Dr Mark Dwyer and Lynn Weston. The emphasis was on science but also included general craft and music. Producers were Neil Smith, Kate Kennedy White (1978–79), James Lingwood (1980) and Ian Smyth.

From 1980 the show was reduced to 30 minutes, presented by Morrison and Hutton, with emphasis on science, nature and the environment.

''The Curiosity Show'' won many national and international awards, including the coveted Prix Jeunesse in 1984, voted by peers from around the world as the best factual program for children.

The program placed a strong emphasis on practical demonstrations of various science topics, and included activities such as floating a [[ping-pong]] ball on a stream of air, recreating historical devices, setting off a room full of [[mouse trap]]s, the science of musical instruments and freezing objects with [[liquid nitrogen]]. Commonly, segments presented scientific concepts in the form of tricks and puzzles.

Many segments described a sequence of steps to build something out of common household materials with longer builds invariably ending with the phrase "here's one I prepared earlier" so as to keep the segment moving. Hutton's catchphrase, after presenting a hypothesis he postulates the audience may be curious about, was to declare "well, I'm glad you asked," before responding to the hypothesis. The use of household materials was deliberate, in order to demystify science and ensure that children, wherever they lived, could make what they needed rather than rely on buying it, and this proved popular with the young audience who could easily replicate the demonstrations at home. Morrison suggested that they should always show what they had made working so that children would know that their own constructions would work if made properly and also to show the limitations of the constructions to dispel any overambitious expectations. Both Morrison and Hutton always told viewers to get their parents' permission before building things or conducting experiments, especially if it involved the use of sharp objects such as knives or scissors or the use of flames or hot or dangerous liquids.

==Spin offs==
Four companion books were available in 1981 produced by Jacaranda Press containing scientific explanations and instructions for experiments for children to perform at home. Each of the books was themed upon one of the four Western [[classical element]]s of earth, air, fire and water. Together, Hutton and Morrison published 11 books, including ''Supermindstretchers'', ''The Arrow book of Things to Make and Do'' and ''String for Lunch'' (Ashton Scholastic). Morrison published more than 40 additional books which included material from Curiosity Show,  including ''Nature in the Making'', ''A Field Guide to the Tracks and Traces of Australian Animals'' the first such field guide in Australia and still the only one to deal with all taxa, ''Clever and Quirky Creatures'', ''It's Raining Frogs and Fishes'' and many more for the school reading programs of various publishers. Morrison's field guide to Tracks and Traces, and a segment he had prepared for Curiosity Show on dingos at Uluru, led to his involvement in the Morling enquiry into the Chamberlain Convictions. He gave evidence on dingo and dog tracks and conducted various forensic investigations on dingo gapes and behaviour. His collection of specimens and artefacts from the trial have been acquired by the National Museum of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azaria Revisited|url=http://blogs.flinders.edu.au/flinders-news/2012/02/27/azaria-revisited/|publisher=Flinders University News|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Children's Television Workshop]] wanted to make a version of the ''Curiosity Show'' using American scientists as presenters. Rob Morrison and Deane Hutton were consultants in the early planning stages. [[PBS]] didn't think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into ''[[3-2-1 Contact]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2014, ''The Curiosity Show'' made a brief online series which was available on YouTube.  It was co-hosted by Morrison and Hutton again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2640647/The-Curiosity-Show-20-years-hosts-Rob-Morrison-Deane-Hutton-havent-lost-geeky-charm.html|title=The Curiosity Show is back after more than 20 years|last=Kilby|first=Penelope|date=28 May 2014|work=Daily Mail Australia|access-date=2017-03-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/aussie-science-program-the-curiosity-show-makes-a-comeback-after-24-years/news-story/5ea1b289baf81fc8b4a371381b5e624e|title=The Curiosity Show makes a comeback|last=Keene|first=Neil|date=May 27, 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2017-03-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YouTube channel==
In 2013, the show's former hosts, Hutton and Morrison, announced they had purchased the remaining rights to the show for an undisclosed sum, from Banksia Productions which had gone into liquidation. On July the 12th 2013, in conjunction with producer Enabled Solutions, they launched a [[YouTube]] channel to make the episodes and segments available for a new generation of viewers.&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{cite news|last=Leo|first=Jessica|title=Curiosity Show back for a new generation|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/curiosity-show-back-for-a-new-generation/story-e6frfmyi-1226673441920|accessdate=3 July 2013|newspaper=news.com.au|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are some 5,000 segments, and some have attracted significant audiences, especially in the USA and India; {{as of|2017|6|lc=y}}, one segment about self-starting syphons had been viewed more than a million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cronshaw|first1=Damon|title=The golden years of curious television|url=https://www.theherald.com.au/story/4761200/the-golden-years-of-curious-television/|accessdate=11 May 2018|work=Newcastle Herald|date=30 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Hutton and Morrison released, on the YouTube channel, the ''"Curiosity Show'''s first new episode since 1990".  The online production was funded with the assistance of Kellogg Australia.  The episode followed the original format of the programme, supported by extra internet resources, with Hutton and Morrison performing experiments related to cereal, including making homemade cornflakes and cornflour non-Newtonian fluid.  The episode was praised by the channel's followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keene|first1=Neil|title=The Curiosity Show makes a comeback|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/aussie-science-program-the-curiosity-show-makes-a-comeback-after-24-years/news-story/5ea1b289baf81fc8b4a371381b5e624e|accessdate=5 January 2017|work=Daily Telegraph|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Threatcasting''' is a conceptual framework used to help multidisciplinary groups envision future scenarios. It is also a process that enables systematic planning against threats ten years in the future. Utilizing the threatcasting process, groups explore possible future threats and how to transform the future they desire into reality while avoiding undesired futures. Threatcasting is a continuous, multiple-step process with inputs from social science, technical research, cultural history, economics, trends, expert interviews, and science fiction storytelling. These inputs inform the exploration of potential visions of the future.

Once inputs are explored for impact and application, participants create a science fiction story ([[Science fiction prototyping|Science Fiction Prototyping]]) based ten years in the future to add context around human activity. Science Fiction Prototyping consists of a future story about a person in a place doing a thing. The threatcasting process results in creation of many potential futures scenarios - some futures are desirable while others are not. Identifying both types of futures (desirable and undesirable) will help the participant recognize which future to aim toward, and which to avoid. Utilizing the scenarios, participants plot actions necessary in the present and at various intervals working toward the ten year future scenario. These actions will help participants understand how to empower or disrupt the target future scenario. Flags (warning events) are also determined in order to map societal indicators onto the recommended path toward the targeted future. When identified flags appear in society, threatcasting participants map these back to the original forecast to see whether or not they are on track toward the target future scenario.

== Origins ==
{{see also|Science fiction prototyping}}

The notion of threatcasting can be traced back to Brian David Johnson, an applied futurist, who first began using threatcasting, also referred to as futurecasting, in 2011 and to George Hemingway of the Stratalis Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/MMStratalisFuturecasting1.pdf|title=Futurecasting the Mining Industry|last=|first=|date=January 2013|website=Stratalis Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who pioneered notion of futurecasting for corporate strategy and innovation industrial markets, including mining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/futurecasting-the-power-of-foresight/|title=The Stratalis Group {{!}}   Futurecasting: The Power of Foresight – The Final in a Six Part Series|website=www.stratalisgroup.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. Early adopters of threatcasting include the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[Government of California]], and the Army Cyber Institute at [[United States Military Academy|West Point Military Academy]]. Official use of the term threatcasting is attributed to Brian David Johnson in a 2014 Gazette article “Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gazette.com/drones-smart-hydrants-considered-by-experts-looking-at-future-of-firefighting/article/1515148|title=Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting|newspaper=Colorado Springs Gazette|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between Threatcasting and Strategic Planning ==
Threatcasting is fundamentally different from traditional [[strategic planning]] and [[Scenario analysis|scenario building]] processes due to the identification of specific actions, indicators and concrete steps that can be taken today to disrupt, mitigate and recover from future threats.

The Army Cyber Institute at West Point in conjunction with [[Arizona State University Polytechnic campus|Arizona State University's]] Global Securities Initiative and the School for the Future of Innovation in Society have established a Threatcasting Lab to host and manage a Cyber Threatcasting Project which looks to envision future cyber threats ten years in the future. The first session of this collaborative group was held at West Point, NY in August 2016.

The term '''unicycle''' is often used in [[robotics]] and [[control theory]] to mean a generalised cart or car moving in a two-dimensional world; these are also often called "unicycle-like" or "unicycle-type" vehicles. This usage is distinct from the literal sense of "[[Self-balancing_unicycle|one wheeled robot bicycle]]".

These theoretical vehicles are typically shown as having two parallel driven wheels, one mounted on each side of their centre, and (presumably) some sort of offset castor to maintain balance; although in general they could be any vehicle capable of simultaneous arbitrary rotation and translation. An alternative realization uses a single driven wheel with steering, and a pair of idler wheels to give balance and allow a steering torque to be applied.

A physically realisable unicycle, in this sense, is a [[nonholonomic system]].  This is a system in which a return to the original internal (wheel) configuration does not guarantee return to the original system (unicycle) position.  In other words, the system outcome is [[Path dependence|path-dependent]].

'''Vegetable farming''' is the growing of vegetables for human consumption. The practice probably started in several parts of the world over ten thousand years ago, with families growing vegetables for their own consumption or to trade locally. At first manual labour was used but in time livestock were domesticated and the ground could be turned by the plough. More recently, mechanisation has revolutionised vegetable farming with nearly all processes being able to be performed by machine. Specialist producers grow the particular crops that do well in their locality. New methods such as aquaponics, Raised-bed gardening|raised beds and cultivation under glass are used. Marketing can be done locally in farmer's markets, traditional markets or pick-your-own operations, or farmers can contract their whole crops to wholesalers, canners or retailers.

==History==
Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by [[hunter-gatherer]]s and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new [[History of agriculture|agricultural way of life]] developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits. 

Traditionally it was done in the soil in small rows or blocks, often primarily for consumption on the farm, with the excess sold in nearby towns. Later, farms on the edge of large communities could specialize in vegetable production, with the short distance allowing the farmer to get his produce to market while still fresh. The [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]] method used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (specifically the [[Haudenosaunee]]/[[Iroquois]]) grew [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[beans]] and [[Maize|corn]] together so that the plants enhanced each other's growth. Planting in long rows allows machinery to cultivate the fields, increasing efficiency and output; however, the diversity of vegetable crops requires a number of techniques to be used to optimize the growth of each type of plant. Some farms, therefore, specialize in one vegetable; others grow a large variety. Due to the needs to market vegetables while fresh, vegetable gardening has high labor demands. Some farms avoid this by running [[u-pick]] operations where the customers pick their own produce. The development of ripening technologies and [[refrigeration]] has reduced the problems with getting produce to market in good condition.

==Different growing methods==
Over the past 100 years a new technique has emerged—[[raised bed gardening]], which has increased yields from small plots of soil without the need for commercial, energy-intensive [[fertilizer]]s. Modern [[Hydroponics|hydroponic farming]] produces very high yields in [[greenhouse]]s without using any soil.

==Marketing==
Several economic models exist for vegetable farms: farms may grow large quantities of few vegetables and sell them in bulk to major markets or middlemen, which requires large growing operations; farms may produce for local customers, which requires a larger distribution effort; farms may produce a variety of vegetables for sale through on-farm stalls, local [[farmer's market]]s, u-pick operations. This is quite different from commodity farm products like [[wheat]] and [[maize]] which do not have the ripeness problems and are sold off in bulk to the local granary. Large cities often have a central produce market which handles vegetables in a commodity-like manner, and manages distribution to most supermarkets and restaurants.

In America, vegetable farms are in some regions known as truck farms; "truck" is a noun for which [[truck|its more common meaning]] overshadows its historically separate use as a term for "vegetables grown for market". Such farms are sometimes called muck farms, after the [[Muck (soil)|dark black soil]] in which vegetables grow well.

==Common vegetable crops==
[[Vegetable]]s which are farmed include:
*[[Fabaceae]] (pea family): [[pea]]s, [[bean]]s, [[lentil]]s
*[[Solanaceae]] (nightshade family): [[tomato]]es, [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper]]s, [[potato]]es
*[[Brassicaceae]] (mustard family): [[cauliflower]], [[cabbage]], [[brussels sprout]]s, [[broccoli]]
*[[Allium]] family: [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[leek]], [[shallot]], [[chives]]
*[[Carrot]]s ([[Apiaceae]])
*[[Lettuce]] ([[Asteraceae]])
*[[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]] family of plants including [[watermelon|melon]], [[cantaloupe]], [[cucumber]], [[calabash]], [[squash (vegetable)|squash]], and [[pumpkin]]
*[[Sweet corn]]
