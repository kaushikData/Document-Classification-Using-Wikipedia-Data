'''1852 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 21 August — [[John Morrissey]] defeats George Thompson in the 11th round at Mare Island, California and claims the Heavyweight Championship of America, which has been vacated by the now-retired [[Tom Hyer]].  His claim is not generally recognised at this time because of the prior claim by [[Yankee Sullivan]], who fought Hyer in 1849.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/morrisey.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – John Morrissey].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harry Broome]] retains the Championship of England but there is no record of any fights involving him in 1851.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/broome-h.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Harry Broome].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other players representing the UEE in its early years include [[John Lillywhite]], [[Tom Lockyer (cricketer)|Tom Lockyer]], [[James Grundy (cricketer)|James Grundy]], [[Frederick Miller (cricketer)|Frederick Miller]], [[Will Mortlock]] and [[Tom Sherman (cricketer)|Tom Sherman]].
* 27 July — [[John Sherman (cricketer)|John Sherman]] makes his final first-class appearance for [[Manchester Cricket Club|Manchester]] v. [[Sheffield Cricket Club|Sheffield]] at [[Hyde Park Ground]], [[Sheffield]].  His career has spanned a record 44 seasons from his debut at [[Lord's]] on 20 September 1809 when he played for Beauclerk's XI v. Ladbroke's XI.
'''England'''
* Most runs – [[Nicholas Felix]] 529 @ 18.24 (HS 70)

* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Daniel O'Rourke (horse)|Daniel O'Rourke]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – Songstress 
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – Stockwell

==[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]==
'''The Boat Race'''
* 3 April — [[Oxford University Boat Club|Oxford]] wins the 11th [[The Boat Race 1852|Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]], a revival of the race last contested in 1849
'''Other events'''
* 3 August — The first [[Harvard–Yale Regatta]] is a 2-length win for Harvard in a single eight-oar, two-mile race on [[Lake Winnipesaukee]], [[New Hampshire]]. The Yale club initiated this Race, and the next one in 1855, by challenge to the Harvard club.&lt;ref name=150yrs&gt;[http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/mcrew-hw/tradition/harvard-yale-regatta "Harvard–Yale Regatta – 150 Years of Tradition"].

== History ==

AOGC has had numerous successes at National Level as well as on the International stage, representing Team USA.

In 2008, [[Mattie Larson]] made it to Nationals as a first year senior, aged 16. After advancing to the Olympic Trials, she made it to the Olympic Training Squad but after she sustained an injury, her Olympic dream was jeopardized. Also that year, [[Samantha Shapiro]] was on the U.S team for the [[2008 Pacific Rim Championships]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. She was the Bars Champion as well as winning a silver in the all-around and she also placed 8th in the floor and 6th on the beam.

In 2010, AOGC had a new member, Junior elite gymnast [[McKayla Maroney]] transferred from Gym-Max Gymnastics in [[Costa Mesa]]. McKayla competed at the U.S Nationals, placing 3rd in the all-around and winning the Vault. [[Mattie Larson]] won the floor at the U.S Nationals and was named to the U.S 2010 World Gymnastics Championships team. In the team final, she had a disastrous floor routine after she hadn't connected 2 skills, as well as not having a front element. Not only that, she also fell on her double pike.

In 2011, both Mattie and Samantha ended their Elite careers, going into Collegiate gymnastics, for UCLA and Stanford. Meanwhile, Maroney was named to the U.S Worlds Squad. She took the team gold and also won the World title on the Vault.

In 2012, McKayla was named to the U.S Olympic Squad. Injured in the leadup to the Olympics, Maroney competed only on her best event, vault. She competed a near-flawless vault during team finals and later won the silver medal on vault.

In 2013, Maroney took the U.S National titles on Floor and Vault and was later named to the 2013 Worlds Squad. She won a gold medal for vault.

In January 2018, Larson was one of two former AOGC gymnasts to make statements about both sexual abuse by then-Team USA doctor Larry Nassar and the abusive practices of the AOGC coaches. Joining her in those statements was Maroney.

''' Azwan bin Muhamad Saleh''' (born 6 January 1988) is a Bruneian [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[DPMM FC]] as a [[Midfield (association football)|midfielder]] or [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-sided full-back]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azwan Saleh|url=http://www.goal.com/en/people/brunei/69714/azwan-saleh|date=|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His patronym is sometimes erroneously written as '''Salleh'''.

==Club career==
Azwan first played club football with [[QAF FC]] in the [[Brunei Premier League|B-League Premier I]], gaining his first international appearances while his team was sent to represent the [[Brunei national football team|national team]] for regional qualifying tournaments of the likes of [[AFC Challenge Cup]] and the [[AFF Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brudirect.com/DailyInfo/News/Archive/Nov06/101106/nite26.htm|title=QAF FC For AFF Challenge |publisher=[[Borneo Bulletin]]|date=7 February 2007|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201161623/http://www.brudirect.com/DailyInfo/News/Archive/Nov06/101106/nite26.htm|archivedate=1 December 2008|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to the under-21 team of DPMM in 2007, initially playing as a striker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tricky trip for injury-plagued DPMM |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/classification/sport/2007/03/10/tricky_trip_for_injury_plagued_dpmm|date=10 March 2007|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played deeper in midfield as the [[2007–08 Malaysia Super League|2007-08 season]] progressed, which would be the final season DPMM played in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penang force DPMM draw |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2008/04/06/penang_force_dpmm_draw|date=6 April 2008|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to the Singaporean [[S.League]] in [[2009 S.League|2009]] with his club, he was a key player for [[Vjeran Simunić]] who deployed him on the left side of DPMM's midfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC out to maul Lions |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2009/05/16/dpmm_fc_out_to_maul_lions|date=16 May 2009|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their season was ended abruptly due to [[Brunei national football team#Suspension|FIFA's suspension of Brunei]], but not before winning the [[2009 Singapore League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wardun saves the day as DPMM FC win League Cup|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2009/06/20/wardun_saves_the_day_as_dpmm_fc_win_league_cup|date=20 June 2009|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azwan was loaned to [[Indera SC]] in 2010 while his parent club were barred from playing in the S.League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indera rely on DPMM FC connection|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sport-national/2010/04/02/indera-rely-dpmm-fc-connection|date=2 April 2010|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was lifted in 2012 and DPMM retained Azwan who started in their first game back against [[Tampines Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC vs 'Barca'|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2012/02/12/dpmm-fc-vs-barca|date=12 February 2012|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They replicated their [[2012 Singapore League Cup|League Cup]] success that year, with Azwan scoring a direct free-kick in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azwan Salleh - Brunei's own free-kick specialist|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2012/08/13/azwan-salleh-bruneis-own-free-kick-specialist|date=13 August 2012|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the emergence of namesake [[Muhammad Azwan Ali Rahman|Azwan Ali Rahman]] from [[2014 S.League|2014]], Azwan switched to a more defensive role, surrendering the number 7 shirt in [[2015 S.League|2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azwan, Shahrazen adjusts to life on the bench|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2014/03/07/azwan-shahrazen-adjusts-life-bench|date=7 March 2014|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in 15 games, half of them substitute appearances as DPMM won their first S.League title. He scored his first league goal in 3 years against [[Geylang International]] on 5 August via a long distance shot with his weaker right foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC top table|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/08/06/dpmm-fc-top-table|date=6 August 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Azwan was a member of the [[Brunei national under-21 football team|Brunei Under-21s]] for the [[2007 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy]] held in his home country. He also played for the [[Brunei national under-23 football team|Under-23s]] at the [[Football at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games|2011 SEA Games]] in Indonesia.

Azwan holds the record number of appearances, with 26 caps to his name. His debut came in the [[2006 AFC Challenge Cup]] in a 0-1 loss against [[Sri Lanka national football team|Sri Lanka]] in Bangladesh. He scored on two occasions in [[AFF Suzuki Cup]] qualifying, one against [[Timor-Leste]] in [[2008 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification|2008]], the other against Cambodia in [[2012 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification|2012]].

Azwan was appointed captain of the national team for the two-legged [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC First Round|2018 World Cup qualifier]] against [[Chinese Taipei national football team|Chinese Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘Biggest game of my life’|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/03/17/%E2%80%98biggest-game-my-life%E2%80%99|date=17 March 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team went down 0-2 at home after an encouraging 1-0 win at [[Kaohsiung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei make history|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/frontpage-sports-national/2015/03/13/brunei-make-history|date=13 March 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Cup dreams over|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/03/18/world-cup-dreams-over|date=18 March 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azwan joined up with the Wasps for the [[2016 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification]] held in Cambodia in October 2016. With [[Najib Tarif]] injured since the first game, he was placed at left-back in the third game against [[Laos national football team|Laos]] which ended in a 4–3 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei put up strong fight|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/10/22/brunei-put-strong-fight|date=22 October 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azwan started the first match of the [[2016 AFC Solidarity Cup]] in central midfield against [[Timor-Leste]] in [[Kuching]], Malaysia. The match ended 4-0 to the Wasps in their biggest victory of date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei beat Timor Leste|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/11/03/brunei-beat-timor-leste|date=3 November 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a total of four games for the Wasps at central midfield in the tournament.

{{nihongo|'''''Battlefield Baseball'''''|地獄甲子園|Jigoku Kōshien|"Hell Stadium"}} is a 2003 Japanese film directed by [[Yūdai Yamaguchi]]. The film is written by [[Gatarō Man]], based on his [[manga]] series of the same name, and stars [[Tak Sakaguchi]], [[Atsushi Itō (actor)|Atsushi Itō]], and [[Hideo Sakaki]]. It was produced by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]].

The film is a combination of several [[genre]]s, mixing [[martial arts]] action with the [[cliché]]s of the [[sports film]]—particularly skewering [[baseball]], one of Japan's most popular [[high school baseball in Japan|high school]] sports—and the violence and brutality of a [[horror film]].  The film's bizarre—sometimes almost incoherent—plot, blood and gore, and unique comedy have given it something of a "[[cult film|cult]]" popularity in the West.{{Citation needed lead|date=February 2015}}

Though the film is ostensibly about high school baseball rivalries, the amount of actual baseball in the film is fairly light.  There are many scenes involving [[baseball bat|bats]] and [[baseball (ball)|balls]], however.

The film was released on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]] by [[Subversive Cinema]].

== Plot ==
{{plot|date=February 2015}}
It's every high school baseball team's dream to go to the legendary [[Koshien Stadium]] [[High school baseball in Japan|Tournament]]. For the first time in years, Seido High School has a chance&amp;mdash;star player Gorrila Matsui has finally given the team an opportunity to succeed. Most delighted at this prospect is Principal Kocho. His hopes are dashed, however, when the [[Head teacher]] reveals to him that the first game will be played against the infamous Gedo High School.&lt;ref&gt;"Head Teacher" is only ever referred to by this title. This title-in-place-of-name system is standard in the Japanese language&lt;/ref&gt;

Gedo is notorious for its brutal killings during games. They hardly play at all, instead engaging in a form of martial arts combat called "fighting baseball". Their matches erupt into brutal battlefields, Gedo slaughtering its opponents in any way possible, and the competing team vainly struggling for their lives. The Gedo team is almost inhuman in its slaughter, and their bizarre weapons and attire coupled with their green-grey skin only increase this reputation. Understandably, Kocho is distressed&amp;mdash;not only at the likely murder of his students, but at the loss of yet another chance to win the Koshien Stadium Tournament.

Much to his delight, however, is the appearance of mysterious newcomer Jubeh, played by [[Tak Sakaguchi]]. Jubeh rescues Four Eyes (Megane, so named because of his [[eyeglasses]].), played by [[Atsushi Itō (actor)|Atsushi Itō]], from a gang of expelled students, beating Bancho (Japanese for "boss" or "leader") and catching Kocho's eye.&lt;ref name="Crowd"&gt;During various points in the film, a crowd of people appears, usually engaging in spontaneous celebration or watching some event. Among the crowd is a schoolgirl dressed in a traditional ''[[sailor-fuku]]'', an injured man with a cast on his arm, and a nude man with his crotch covered by a [[fig leaf]]. According to the audio commentary included on the DVD release, the nude man is played by director Yudai Yamaguchi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drunk"&gt;Another recurring element in the film is a drunk man, usually seen laughing uproariously at whatever event has just occurred. He is always accompanied by his dog. At the end of the film, it is revealed through narration that the drunk died of [[alcohol poisoning]] during the final confrontation between the antagonists and protagonists. He also states that the drunk was "[his] master", implying that the dog has been the narrator of the entire film. [[Andy Klein]] of the ''[[L.A. City Beat]]'' called this the film's "best joke". {{cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id%3D2120%26IssueNum%3D102 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513092749/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=2120&amp;IssueNum=102 |archivedate=2006-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He begs and pleads with Jubeh to join the team to help them defeat Gedo, but he steadfastly refuses. During this time Kocho and Jubeh are also confronted by a resurrected Bancho, though his "face changed". Bancho joins the team, explaining that the injuries that prevented him from playing baseball were cured by Jubeh's punches.

When confronted by Four Eyes, Jubeh reveals why he has stopped playing baseball&amp;ndash;in song. He musically laments his [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] skill, explaining how he became so skilled he was a danger to himself and others. Only his father, with an absurdly huge [[catcher's mitt]], will allow Jubeh to pitch. However, when an accidental ball to the head kills him, Jubeh vows never to pitch again.

Despite this sorrowful story, Four Eyes insists that Jubeh join the team, explaining his own plight. His mother hates baseball, and would be furious if he were to play. As a result, he must keep his presence on the Seido team a secret. Four Eyes' sheer love for the game touches Jubeh deeply, and he joins the team.&lt;ref name="Crowd"/&gt;

However, when the game against Gedo starts, Jubeh is nowhere to be found. As a result, the team is, predictably, slaughtered by the Gedo students.&lt;ref name="Drunk"/&gt; Jubeh gets there in time to hear Gorilla's last words.&lt;ref&gt;During this speech, the letters that make up the word "Seido" on Gorilla's uniform are strewn about to indicate the trauma that he has experienced.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a body he believes to be Four Eyes', Jubeh laments the loss, before realising that it's in fact a Gedo trap. The "body" explodes, hurling Jubeh across the field, sending him to an early grave.

Jubeh finds himself in a sepia-toned small town street in the afterlife. He sees a man he has not seen for some time&amp;ndash;his father. He convinced Jubeh to embrace his pitching skills, and defeat Gedo once and for all. Jubeh pledges to do so as he watches his father ride off. Returning from the afterlife, he introduces his pitch, dubbed the "Super Tornado". Bancho also returns, again, this time as a child. He too met Jubeh's father in the afterlife, and was given his catcher's mitt.

In the meantime, somehow Four Eyes' mother has discovered that he was on the baseball team. As punishment, she locks him up in a cage, and watches over him day and night. Jubeh comes to rescue him, fighting Four Eyes's mother. He confronts her, asking her why she hates baseball so much. She reveals that her husband was killed by a baseball pitcher. All three come to a sudden realization&amp;mdash;They are family. In jubilation, Four Eyes' mother gives him permission to play.&lt;ref name="Crowd"/&gt;

Kocho, Bancho, Jubeh, and Four Eyes, having formed a new Seido team, confront Gedo. The Gedo coach mocks the size and strength, or more accurately the lack thereof, of the new team. Much to his surprise however, several new team members show up&amp;mdash;Head Teacher and Gorilla, now [[cyborg]]s, having been resurrected by "advanced technology", one of the school's [[cheerleader]]s, and Four Eyes' mother all team up to defeat Gedo.

Ultimately, all except Jubeh and the Gedo coach have been knocked unconscious. They duel with elaborate baseball bats, before Jubeh is knocked to the ground.  Then, the Gedo coach unveils his ultimate weapon: the Gedo Poison Bat. Filled with a combination of deadly poisons and healing herbs, the effect is to create a horrific pain that will last for "hundreds of years." The coach slams it down onto Jubeh&amp;mdash;However, Four Eyes has sacrificed himself, jumping in the way of the coach's attack. Jubeh, furious at the loss of his brother, leaps up and bitterly attacks the coach. However, before he can kill the coach, the Gedo players plead for his life, explaining how he brought them out of orphanages and became like a father to them. Seeing their heartfelt plea, Jubeh can't help but allow the coach to live.

Happily, the coach gains a newfound respect for life, and throws a bottle of antidote to Jubeh. A crowd gathers,&lt;ref name="Crowd"/&gt; and the sun begins to shine. However, this peace is soon interrupted by one member of the Gedo team, his head wrapped in bandages. He guns down everyone on the field, firing randomly and hitting everything in sight, including his own teammates. Jubeh manages to escape only through his own dexterity and the gunman's limited ammo. Looking around in outrage, Jubeh sheds a tear. As [[cherry blossom]]s fall, everyone on the field returns to life, before Jubeh attacks the bandaged gunman, literally knocking the muscles off his bones.

Joyously, the crowd celebrates, and the narrator (who turned out to be the bleachers drunkard's dog) states that they lived happily ever after&amp;mdash;Including the one person on the field that day who wasn't resurrected by Jubeh's tears.&lt;ref name="Drunk"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The reaction to the film has been for the most part lukewarm. Though many praised its irreverent and unique style, others found the purposefully ludicrous plot hard to follow and indicative of a lack of effort on the screenwriter's part. However, the film did win the Grand Prize at the 14th [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]] held in February 2003. Director [[Yūdai Yamaguchi]] was a guest at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubarifanta.com/views.php?id=274&amp;langue=21002|title=AKANBO SHOUJO|publisher=yubarifanta.com|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been compared with other Japanese films featuring baseball prominently. For instance, one reviewer compared it to 1992's ''[[Mr. Baseball]]'', explaining that it was better than that film due to a relative lack of actual baseball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monsterhunter.coldfusionvideo.com/Battlefield_Baseball.html Review at "Monster Hunter Movie Reviews"].&lt;/ref&gt; The parodic aspect of the film takes so much precedence that the [[cliché]]s of baseball films are skewered more than baseball itself.&lt;ref name="Midnight Eye"&gt;[http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/battbase.shtml Review at Midnight Eye].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the film is its intentional strangeness. The strangest aspects of the plot (the frequent reappearances of a crowd&lt;ref name="Crowd"/&gt; and an alcoholic man,&lt;ref name="Drunk"/&gt; Head Teacher and Gorilla returning as cyborgs, etc.) are more prominent than the plot in the minds of most reviewers.&lt;ref name="Midnight Eye"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;Erik Lundergaar [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2001997600_baseball06.html Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424085715/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2001997600_baseball06.html |date=April 24, 2006 }} from the [[Seattle Times]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most reviewers agree that while the film is not necessarily [[Fine art|high art]], it is a good martial arts/horror/comedy film&amp;mdash;they say that it is interesting and exciting enough to keep one watching until the end credits.&lt;ref name="Midnight Eye"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horrortalk.com/reviews/Battlefield/Battlefield.htm Review at "Horrortalk"].&lt;/ref&gt; The film's humour is often highly praised, lightening up what would otherwise be a superficial and generic action film.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Henriksen. [http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=31801&amp;category=22133 "Shocked Yet?"] from the [[Portland Mercury]].&lt;/ref&gt; The film has received some criticism, largely that it is ludicrous and "stupid", or that its plot does not sustain its length.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Klein. [http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=2120&amp;IssueNum=102 Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513092749/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=2120&amp;IssueNum=102 |date=May 13, 2006 }}, [[L.A. City Beat]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that this is not only irrelevant&amp;mdash;The film is ''intended'' to be ludicrous and stupid&amp;mdash;it is actually one of the strengths of the film.&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt;

'''''Bell's Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer''''', also published as ''Bell’s Life in Sydney and Sporting Chronicle'', was a weekly English language newspaper published in [[Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia between 1845 and 1872.

==History==
The newspaper was first published on 4 January 1845 by Thomas Revel Johnson. He took on a business partner, George Ferrers Pickering, in 1847. However, Johnson left the company in 1848 and was succeeded by Charles Hamilton Nichols (the son of [[Isaac Nichols]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trove|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-title58|work=|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Bell’s Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer'' was published from 1845 to 1860. The publication was continued as ''Bell’s Life in Sydney and Sporting Chronicle'', which was published from 1860 to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport and Recreation|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/cdp/documenting/social/sport.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721182207/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/cdp/documenting/social/sport.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 July 2008|work=Documenting Life in New South Wales|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article covers '''[[Cricket|Cricket]] broadcasting rights'''. For a list of sports broadcasting rights by countries, see [[List of sports television broadcast contracts]].

In certain countries international cricket rights are protected and must be broadcast live and free to air.

{{TOC right}}

==Protected TV rights==

In India content rights holder is required to share the feed with national broadcaster [[Doordarshan|Doordarshan]] for "Sports events of National importance". Doordarshan can broadcast the game only on terrestrial TV and its own direct to home platform. They are not permitted to share these signals with cable operators and other DTH provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sc-upholds-hc-verdict-on-cricket-broadcasting-rights-in-india/articleshow/60179706.cms |title=SC upholds HC verdict on cricket broadcasting rights in India |publisher=Times of India |date=22 August 2017 |accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently all official one-day international, Twenty20 and test matches played by the Indian men’s cricket team, semifinals and finals of the [[Cricket world cup|men’s World Cup]] and International Cricket Council Championship Trophy are considered as cricketing events of “national importance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Sports/9au73qn1qtCjUEwg96tSUO/Govt-lists-noncricket-sporting-events-of-national-importanc.html |title=Govt lists non-cricket sporting events of national importance |publisher=Live Mint |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia an anti-siphoning list gives the free-to-air broadcasters the first right to negotiate. For cricket, it includes all Test matches Australia plays at home or in England, home ODIs and home T20 internationals. It also includes Australia's matches in the World Cup or World T20 when played at home, and the final of any tournament hosted in Australia or New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cricket.com.au/news/cricket-australia-odi-t20-anti-siphon-list-explained-fox-sports-broadcast-deal/2018-04-14 |title=TV's anti-siphon list and cricket explained |publisher=Cricket Network |date=14 April 2018 |accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In UK Test matches involving English national team and world cup matches involving home nations as well as Semi Final and Final are included in category B list of Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events. Category B events are allowed to be broadcast on pay TV provided there is adequate secondary coverage in form of highlights and delayed broadcast. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/other-codes/ofcom_code_on_sport.pdf | title=Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events | publisher=Ofcom | date=March 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125053653/http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/other-codes/ofcom_code_on_sport.pdf | archivedate=2011-01-25 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary Rights Sale==
Various cricket boards and ICC often sell the rights first to a primary broadcaster who may later resell those rights to other streaming or broadcast partners in territories where the original broadcaster has no presence. For example Star Sports bought the global rights for IPL in all territories and all platforms from BCCI and later resold these rights to Sky Sports for UK market.

{{unreferenced|date=April 2018}}

In [[golf]], a '''caddie''' (or '''caddy''') is the person who carries a player's bag and [[Golf club|clubs]], and gives insightful advice and moral support. A good caddie is aware of the challenges and obstacles of the [[golf course]] being played, along with the best strategy in playing it. This includes knowing overall yardage, pin placements and club selection. A caddie is not usually an employee of a private club or resort. They are classified as an "independent contractor", meaning that he or she is basically self-employed and does not receive any benefits or perks from his association with the club. Some clubs and resorts do have caddie programs, although benefits are rarely offered.  Particularly in Europe, the vast majority of clubs do not offer caddies, and amateur players will commonly carry or pull their own bags.

[[File:Golf caddy.JPG|thumb|A golf caddie depicted in a late-18th-century painting. Artist unknown.]]

== Types of caddying ==
'''Traditional caddying''' involves both the golfer and the caddie walking the course.  The caddie is in charge of carrying the player's bag, and walks ahead of the golfer to locate his ball and calculate the yardage to the pin and/or hazards.  This is the most common method used in golf clubs and is the only method allowed in the [[Professional Golfers' Association|PGA (Professional Golf Association)]] and [[LPGA|LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association)]]. The three "ups" of caddying are: show up, shut up, and keep up.

'''Fore-Caddying''' entails the caddie walking while the players ride in carts. The fore-caddie will give a hole description and then walk ahead to spot the players' tee shots. The caddie then gets the player's yardage (either with a GPS watch, laser, course knowledge, or sprinkler heads) while the players drive their carts from the tee to their shots. The caddie walks ahead again to spot the golfer's next shots. This process is continued until the players reach the green. Once on the [[green (golf)|green]] the caddie will read greens (if asked per proper [[golf etiquette]]), clean [[golf balls]] (if asked), fix ball marks, and attend the flag. The caddie is also responsible for raking [[bunker (golf)|traps]] on the course. Caddies will help with club selection, reading greens, weather variables, and marking balls on the green but should do so only if asked by the player. More than anything else, the caddie is there to make the player's round enjoyable by taking care of menial tasks, speeding up play, and providing mental support if asked.

==Caddie ranks==
Many clubs use a ranking system. Caddies will start as a trainee, and be promoted through the ranks of Intermediate, Captain, Honor, and finally Championship. Many courses start their caddies off at the B level, and after a year move them to A, and on their fourth year (if they have earned it), they will receive the title of Honor caddie. The intermediate and captain ranks can usually be obtained within the first year of caddying, and the honor rank is usually obtained in the second or third year of caddying. Championship takes at least 6 years and often as many as 10 years to obtain. An alternative ranking system often used in the American Mid-West proceeds as B level, A level, AA level, Honor level, and [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholar]]. Caddies often obtain a promotion in rank once a year, while often Honor takes two years to achieve and Evans Scholars are only produced by winning the venerable Evans Scholarship for university. However, in many American clubs, caddies are divided simply between "B" caddies (usually younger, less experienced caddies who often carry only one bag), and "A" caddies (usually older, more experienced caddies who almost always carry two bags).

== Weekly schedule ==
Caddies are most frequently employed at clubs on weekends, when the majority of country club golf takes place.  Some (but usually not as many) opportunities to caddie exist during the week, as well.  Additionally, caddies are often allowed to play the course at which they caddie for free, usually on a Monday (the day that most private clubs choose to close their course for maintenance).  On pro golf tours, professional caddies accompany their player to all events, which usually take place from Thursday through Sunday.  Additionally, the player may hire their caddie to carry their bag for them during training sessions and practice rounds.

== Pay scale ==
At most clubs, caddies are paid at the end of the round by cash, or receive a payment ticket for which they can redeem their wages in the clubhouse.  Generally, the player will tip the caddie based on their performance during the round, with extra money given for exemplary work.  Most American club caddies earn between $80 and $120 per bag, though newer caddies will often earn less than more experienced caddies.  Caddies working during a tournament, high-stakes match, or 4-Day member-guest will often earn significantly more, upwards of $150 per round, per bag, at times. It is common for experienced caddies to carry two bags at a time. It is considered acceptable to ask a professional at the course what the average pay for a caddie is, as courses differ.

In a [[professional golf tour]] setting, a player often pays their caddie a percentage of their winnings, which can be as high as 10%.  A common pay scale is 5% for making the cut, 7% for a top 10, and 10% for a win. The caddie also usually receives a salary, as the player is not guaranteed to win money at every tournament.

'''Donovan Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Utica, New York]]. It is primarily used for [[baseball]] and was formerly the home of [[Utica Blue Sox]].  The ballpark has a capacity of 4,000 people and opened in 1976. The movement to remodel the field started in 1967 in  effort of  the Utica Free Academy Student Council spearheaded by then President Steven Oram . Shares of imaginary stock were sold to students and the proceeds given to the City to highlight the need and community interest.  Oram a successful Maryland Attorney went on to establish the Give Back to Utica Fund at the Community Foundation of Oneida and Herkimer Counties The newly founded four-team [[New York State League]] played all of its games there for the 2007 season.  

It is the current home of the [[Utica Blue Sox]], originally of the [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|collegiate summer]] [[Eastern Collegiate Baseball League]] but today of the [[Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League]], and is also used for [[American Legion]] baseball. The stadium was named after [[James H. Donovan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Franklin's Gardens''' is a purpose-built [[rugby union|rugby]] [[stadium]] in [[Northampton]], [[England]].  It is the home stadium of [[Northampton Saints]]. The stadium holds 15,249 people. The four stands are: Tetleys Stand; Elite Insurance Stand; Church's Stand; and Barwell Stand. It is also the [http://www.northamptonconferenceandeventscentre.co.uk/ Northampton conference centre] as well as the only UK Aviva Premiership Rugby ground with its own cenotaph, the setting for a moving ceremony every Remembrance Weekend. The current run out song is "[[Can't Stop (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Can't Stop]]" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers|The Red Hot Chilli Peppers]], a song which has been chosen by the players. Geoff Allen, a Saints legend, takes the role of announcer.

== History of Franklin's Gardens==
The Gardens, originally known as Melbourne Gardens, were created by John Collier, and after his death in 1886 they were bought by John Franklin, a successful hotelier, who renamed them Franklin’s Gardens the following year.

In 1888 the Gardens were sold for £17,000 to the Northampton Brewery Company who started making extensive improvements. New features included a running track, bicycle track, cricket ground, swimming pool, bear pit, a large ornamental lake, an improved monkey house and a larger zoological garden.

Franklin’s Gardens was described as the "Champs Elysees of Northampton" and trams ran from the town centre every few minutes for a penny. Home matches began in Abbey fields, next door to Franklin’s Gardens and it wasn’t until the late 1880s when the Saints moved to Franklin’s Gardens.

At the end of the 1896/97 season a new stand was built by Mr A Dunham’s building company, 45 feet long and costing £45 5s. It was carpeted and reserved for members paying 10s 6d for season tickets. Ladies got away with paying only five shillings!

On 9 October 1920, a two-page advertisement in the Independent appeared offering 15,000 shares in a new company, Franklins Gardens Sports and Pleasure Co Ltd. The company prospectus proposed to turn the site into a sports complex, allowing the Saints to play at the Gardens in return for a percentage of the gate.

During the Second World War Franklin’s Gardens was used for livestock. However that didn’t last long, as there was a new-look Franklin’s Gardens in, with its £6,000 Member’s stand.

The 1966/67 season kicked off with style with the opening of the Peter Haddon designed Gordon Sturtridge Pavilion, marked by a floodlit game between the Saints and an R E G Jeeps XV. The pavilion enhanced the Gardens’ reputation for being one of the finest rugby grounds in the country.

During the 1976/77 season the club acquired a four-acre training pitch on a 60-year lease at the back of the ground and in November 1977, the committee pulled off its biggest coup by buying Franklin’s Gardens outright for £30,000.

During the early 1990s a raft of temporary stands increased the capacity up to 10,000. Then in 2001 the stadium underwent a complete re-build. The fans got their first look of the £6 million new look Franklin’s Gardens on 8 September 2001.

The Tetley’s and South stands were opened formally by Ian McGeechan with the horseshoe stadium completed in summer 2002 with the building of the Church’s Stand, opened by five Saints legends. But there was more development to come in 2005 when an extension to the South Stand became a further piece to the Franklin’s Gardens jigsaw.

The north stand was re-developed in the summer of 2015, this included the demolition of the old Sturtridge Pavilion and the construction of the new Barwell Stand, marking the end of the original re-build plans.

== Location ==

Franklin's Gardens is  located in the St James district of Northampton, approximately one mile from the town centre &lt;ref&gt;https://maps.google.com/maps?q=google+maps+franklins+gardens&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Stands==
===Carlsberg Stand===
[[File:Tetley's Stand Northampton RFC.jpg|thumb|left|The Carlsberg Stand (with old branding)]]
The Carlsberg Stand (formerly the Tetley's stand) holds 6,000 (est) people and has 19 executive boxes. The stand's capacity is split between the Gordon Terrace (named after former club secretary Jerry Gordon) and seating. Unlike premier league football stadiums, standing is allowed at rugby stadiums and the terracing was included as a specific part of the design. All of the people in the stand are under cover.

The Carlsberg Stand also includes the club's major conferencing facilities, including the Rodber Suite, Captains' Suite and Heroes' Bar. There is full wireless internet access throughout the stand. Facilities including all the bars and suites were refurbished to simulate the look and feel of the members' bar located in the Barwell Stand in 2016.

In November of 2017, it was announced that through a continuation of the sponsorship from Carlsberg, the stand will be re-branded as 'The Carlsberg Stand', this rebrand was completed in July 2018.

===The South Stand===
[[File:Franklins Gardens - South Stand.jpg|thumb|The South Stand (formerly The Burrda Stand and Elite Insurance Stand)]]
In 2005 the South Stand was doubled in size raising the Gardens capacity from 12,100 to 13,591. The redevelopment involved extending the South Stand over the lake in the village area of the ground to make room for additional seating, seven new boxes, a premium members' club, as well another bar and extra toilet facilities. The South stand extension was finished in the 2005/2006 season. At the start of the 10/11 season it was announced that the South stand will be renamed the Burrda Stand after the club's new kit suppliers. The stand was renamed in 2016 to become the Elite Insurance Stand, but this ended in 2018. Currently, there are no sponsors for the stand.

===The Church's Stand===
[[File:The Charles Church Stand Northampton RFC.jpg|thumb|left|The Church's Stand]]
The Church's Stand is the 'third' all seater stand. It was developed and completed the horseshoe in the summer of 2002. It was opened by five club legends, former captains – Ron Jacobs, Don White, Gary Pearce, David Powell and Vince Cannon in November 2002.

The stand replaced the old Members' Stand which had lasted since the 1920s. It contains both the home and away dressing rooms, TV camera gantry, press bench, press room and a cinema for Saint's players (this was a bar until the Barwell Stand development).
[[File:Barwell Stand .jpg|thumb|The Barwell Stand]]

===The Barwell Stand===
This is to the North of the ground and is the newest stand (built in 2015) which replaced The Sturtridge Pavilion, completing the redevelopment of Franklin's Gardens. This stand takes the name of the Barwell family, who were influential in making Northampton Saints one of English rugby's leading clubs at the turn of the professional era in the mid 1990s. This stand houses the members' bar, corporate facilities, control room, the Sturtridge Suite and approximately 2,000 seats. It also houses a war memorial to former Saints players who died in the 1st and 2nd World Wars. This stand was officially opened by Keith Barwell on 14 February 2016.

[[File:Surridge Pavilion Northampton RFC.jpg|thumb|right|The demolished old Sturtridge Pavilion|187x187px]]

=== The Sturtridge Pavilion ===
The 1966/67 season kicked off with style with the opening of the Peter Haddon designed Gordon Sturtridge Pavilion, marked by a floodlit game between the Saints and an R E G Jeeps XV. The pavilion enhanced the Gardens’ reputation for being one of the finest rugby grounds in the country.

The Pavilion was earmarked for demolition and redevelopment when the original rebuild was designed, however, due to time and money, the rebuild didn't happen until 2015.

==The future==
===Future Development===
Further development on the existing ground would be compromised by the Beacon Bingo hall which sits in close proximity to the Barwell Stand. The Church's Stand also is compromised by backing onto the site boundary. Further opportunity could involve expanding the South and/or Tetley's Stand's.

Northampton Saints will continue to explore playing one fixture a season at the 30,000 capacity MK Dons stadium in Milton Keynes, although in 2017 it was announced that this would be 'put-on-hold' for the foreseeable future.

==Other uses==
===Anglo-Welsh Cup===
The second LV= Cup final was played at the Gardens, seeing Gloucester beat Newcastle 34-7.

The '''Gambian national cricket team''' is the team that represents the [[Republic of The Gambia]] in [[international cricket]]. They became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/52.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[ICC members|associate member]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="Assoc"/&gt; Their international debut came at the African affiliate championship in 2004 where they finished sixth. In 2006 they played in the equivalent tournament, Division Three of the African qualifiers for the [[ICC World Cricket League]], this time finishing in seventh place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/97/97495.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Gambia and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HexPad''' is a [[patent]]ed technology that provides a lightweight padding system applied directly to performance fabric. This method of padding is used in many sports but most visible in [[basketball]] and [[American football]].

==Construction==
Hexpad uses high quality [[closed cell foam|closed cell athletic foam]] padding, the same padding density and impact resistance that is used in pads for American football and other impact sports. Hexpad is lightweight allowing for greater coverage and comfort than traditional padding systems. The spaces between the cells allow moisture movement and breathability for temperature regulation.

==Types==
There are two types of HexPad available: HexPad Dual Density (DD), and HexPad Mono Cellular (MC). HexPad Dual Density (14mm thick) is designed specifically for higher impact sports. HexPad DD is made up of larger Hex shaped pads than HexPad MC, with two layers, an outer layer of harder [[durometer]] and softer inner durometer layer. HexPad Mono Cellular (9mm thick) is the standard in sports protection and is made up of independently positioned hex shaped pads.

==Notable users==
[[Dwyane Wade]] and Shaquille O'Neal of the [[Miami Heat]] first adopted the technology in basketball.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Famous players who use this technology for protection against body-to-body contact and body-to-ground contact include [[Allen Iverson]], [[LeBron James]], [[Carmelo Anthony]] and [[Kobe Bryant]]. In the NFL, a custom HexPad shoulder protector was created for [[Drew Brees]] when he returned from surgery.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The '''Horse Racing Hall of Fame''' ({{lang-ja|競馬の殿堂}}) is a Japanese [[horse racing]] memorial hall which was installed on September 2, 1985 at the JRA Horse Racing Museum, [[Fuchu, Tokyo]]. It was founded by [[Japan Racing Association]] to honor the achievements of [[race horses]], [[jockey]]s and [[horse trainer|trainers]].

Race horses inducted into the [[Hall of Fame]] are called ''Kensho-ba'' ([[:ja:顕彰馬|顕彰馬]]) while jockeys and trainer are called ''Kensho-sha'' ([[:ja:調教師・騎手顕彰者|顕彰者]]) by the [[Japan Racing Association]].

== Race horse Nomination ==
Race horse selection is decided annually by a vote in April. It is voted on by mass communication or newspeople who have been involved in the horse racing news for more than ten years. Racehorses are inducted to the Hall of Fame if they gather over three-quarters of the total vote.

Voters can vote for race horses which:
*Have won more than three [[Graded stakes race|Grade 1 races]].&lt;ref&gt;This rule may not apply to all horse, particularly before 1984 (the introduction of Grading system in Japan).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Have had excellent racing and breeding results (sired a G1 winner more than five or bred G1 winner more than two)
*Have had a positive contribution to the racing world or JRA.

Since 2004, an additional rule was set up. race horses which have retired less than a year, or more than 20 years cannot be nominated. In that year only, an extra vote is held exclusively for horse which retired more than 20 years (where Takeshiba O was selected).

Nobody is elected by a vote being divided in an average year. Particular, after 1999 when [[El Condor Pasa (horse)|El Condor Pasa]] retired, El Condor Pasa had been voted more than half of total most years, Nobody was elected until 2004 because [[Special Week]] which was the one of El Condor Pasa's rival in Japan had been voted more than 30 percents of total, and they had divided their votes less than three-fourths.

Outdoor Korfball
]]
'''Korfball''' ({{lang-nl|Korfbal}}) is a [[ball sport]], with similarities to [[netball]] and [[basketball]]. It is played by two teams of eight players with four females and four males in each team or with eight players in each team. The objective is to throw a ball into a bottomless basket that is mounted on a {{convert|3.5|m|ft|1|abbr=in}} high pole.

The sport was invented by Dutch school teacher [[Nico Broekhuysen]] in 1902. In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 569 clubs and over 100,000 people playing korfball. The sport is also very popular in [[Belgium]] and [[Taiwan]], and is played in many other countries.

== History ==

[[File:Korfbal 1928 actie.jpg|thumb|Korfball match at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in the [[Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]] in Amsterdam]]

In 1902 [[Nico Broekhuysen]], a Dutch school teacher from [[Amsterdam]], was sent to [[Nääs]], a town in [[Sweden]], to follow an educational course about teaching gymnastics to children. This is where he was introduced to the Swedish game '[[ringboll]]'. In ringboll one could score points by throwing the ball through a ring that was attached to a 3&amp;nbsp;m pole. Men and women played together, and the field was divided into three zones. Players could not leave their zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knkv.nl/Flex/Site/Page.aspx?PageID=14090&amp;Lang=NL |title=History of korfball |language=Dutch |author=Koninklijk Nederlands Korfbalverbond |accessdate=4 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217184830/http://knkv.nl/Flex/Site/Page.aspx?PageID=14090&amp;Lang=NL |archive-date=17 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;{{cite book|page=248|chapter=korfball|title=Webster's Sports Dictionary|publisher=G&amp;G Merriam Company|year=1976|location=Springfield, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broekhuysen was inspired and when he returned to Amsterdam he decided to teach his students a similar game. He replaced the ring with a basket (for which the Dutch word is ''korf'' or ''mand''), so it was easier to see if a player had scored or not. Broekhuysen also simplified the rules so children could also understand and play it. Korfball was born. The main idea was the same as ringboll, but it now stood on its own.

The oldest still existing korfball club to never have merged with any other club is a Dutch korfball club [[H.K.C. ALO]] from [[The Hague]], Netherlands. H.K.C. ALO was founded on 1 February 1906.

At first there was considerable controversy about the sport, because the players were of both sexes. Several sports journalists refused to pay even the slightest attention to the new sport{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Korfball players were accused of being immoral. Even the sportswear was criticized, because the women were showing bare knees and ankles; one newspaper wrote that "Korfball is a monster that spreads its claws to all sides"{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Yet korfball was featured as a [[demonstration sport]] in the Summer Olympics of [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/09/14/vergeten-sporthelden-nico-broekhuysen.aspx |title=Forgotten Sport-heroes: Nico Broekhuysen |language=Dutch |author=Jurryt van de Vooren |accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IKF members (2012).PNG|thumb|Members of the [[International Korfball Federation]]]]

The [[International Korfball Federation]] was founded in 1933.

Korfball is played in over 60 countries including: United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, the Czech Republic, Poland, Greece, Serbia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, India, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Germany, Taiwan, Turkey, Hong Kong, Portugal, Pakistan, Sweden, Hungary, the Philippines, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, France and Romania. It is growing in popularity in the UK and in a unique reference to the sport, is featured in a song by the band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] entitled "Joy in [[Leeuwarden]] (We Are Ready)" on their 2011 album ''[[90 Bisodol (Crimond)]]''.

Korfball has been played in the [[Korfball at the World Games|World Games]] since 1985. IKF World Championships have been held every four years since 1978. The leading nations are Belgium and the Netherlands.

Hong Kong hosted its first international tournament, the Asia Oceania Championship in 2006. New Zealand hosted the Asia Oceania Youth Championships in 2007.

== Rules and regulations ==

=== Equipment ===

Korfball is played inside in winter and outdoors in spring and fall.

The size of the indoor court is {{convert|20|x|40|m|yd|abbr=on}}, outdoor courts are {{convert|30|x|60|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The new outdoor courts size is 40 m x 20 m.The court is divided into halves called ''zones''. In each zone is a {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall post with a basket at the top. This is positioned two-thirds of the distance between the center line and the back of the zone.&lt;ref name="encyclo"/&gt;

=== Team ===
A korfball team consists of eight players; four female and four male.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ikf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Rules-of-Korfball-v-2015-09-01.pdf |title=Complete Rules of Korfball |author=IKF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Match ===
[[File:Dameskorfbal.jpg|thumb|Korfball match in the Netherlands]]

A korfball match typically consists of two periods, with the length varying depending on the competition, but typically between 25 and 30 minutes, with a break between periods.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt;

Four players of each team are in one zone, and the others are in the other zone. Within each zone, a player may only defend a member of the opposite team of the same gender.

At the beginning of the match one team chooses one-half of the court. That half will be their defending zone, with 'their' basket in it. Players score by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket. After two goals, the teams change zones: defenders become attackers and attackers become defenders. In between those zone-changes, attackers cannot set foot on their defending zone or vice versa. At half-time teams swap halves.

The rules prevent physical strength dominating the game. Blocking, tackling and holding are not allowed, as well as kicking the ball. Once a player has the ball, one cannot dribble, run or walk with it, however, one can move one foot as long as the foot the player landed on when they caught the ball stays in the same spot. Therefore, tactical and efficient teamwork is required, because players need each other to keep the ball moving. A player may not attempt to score when defended, which occurs when the defender is in between the opponent and the basket, is facing his/her opponent, is within arm's length and attempting to block the ball. This rule encourages fast movement while also limiting the impact of players' height compared to their opponents.

=== IKF U23 World Championship ===
{{Main|IKF U23 World Championship}}
* 2008 [[Kaohsiung]], Taiwan – Winner: Netherlands
* 2012 [[Barcelona]], Catalonia, Spain – Winner: Netherlands
* 2016 [[Olomouc]], Czech Republic – Winner: Netherlands

=== Continental championships ===
IKF promotes four continental championships: [[European Korfball Championship]], [[All-Africa Korfball Championship]], [[Pan-American Korfball Championship]] and [[Asia-Oceania Korfball Championship]].

=== Europa Cup for Clubs ===

Every year the [[International Korfball Federation|IKF]] organises the Europa Cup for national champions (clubs). The Europa Cup was organized for the first time in 1967, and was won by Ons Eibernest from the Netherlands. The winner of the last edition was TOP/SolarCompleet, which also won in 2017.

PKC from [[Papendrecht]], the Netherlands, have won the championship the most times, a record 12 wins in total. 

Until now, the winning team was either from the Netherlands or Belgium, with respectively 45 and 6 championships. The only club from the United Kingdom to reach the final was [[Mitcham Korfball Club]] from London. Mitcham lost the final against [[Catbavrienden]] from Belgium in 1998.

==Beach Korfball==
For beach korfball, the rules of the game differ slightly from those of regular korfball. Each team has 4 starters and 4 substitutes. The field of play is 16 metres by 8 metres, and goals are to be placed 3 metres from the end line. Matches consist of four quarters of 150 seconds each with a 45-second rest between each quarter. If either team has only two players remaining (1 man and 1 woman) because of injury or other reason during the match, the referee will stop play and terminate the game early.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ikf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Draft-BEACH-KORFBALL-PLAYING-RULES-distributed-Nov-2013.pdf The rule of Beach korfball] International Korfball Federation&lt;/ref&gt;

Each team has a total of 4 players in the field, two men and two women.  Players can be substituted at any time. 
Furthermore, if a goal is scored from the corners of the field, a two-point goal is awarded. Free shots can both be executed at the standard Free Shot line, or at the spot where the fault was made by the opponent. 

The current European Beach Korfball champion is Belgium, while they won the IKF Beach Korfball World Cup (Europe) 2018. Portugal won the silver medal, and Poland wrote national korfball history by winning the bronze medal.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Cultural references==

Korfball is the theme of the song "Joy in Leeuwarden (We Are Ready)" on the album ''[[90 Bisodol (Crimond)]]'' by [[Half Man Half Biscuit]].

The ministry is headed by [[Azad Rahimov]].&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/world-leaders-a/azerbaijan.html |title=CIA.

==History==
The Ministry of Youth and Sport was established on July 26, 1994 by the [[President of Azerbaijan|Presidential]] Decree No. 179. The statute of the ministry was approved by the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] with Resolution No. 861. The ministry was based on the immediate need for development of Azerbaijani youth which suffered from several years of [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. It was estimated that at least 30% of the [[Refugees and internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani refugees and IDPs]] were young people under the age of 25. Fourteen committees within the ministry were formed analized how the young people should relate to such topics as religion, business, crime, drugs, education, agriculture, health, sports, ideology, politics, entertainment. The results of government's attention to sports was immediate. In 1995, Azerbaijani athletes brought home 52 medals, including 23 gold. They excelled most in wrestling, boxing, judo, and karate.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite news | url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/44_folder/44_articles/44_sports.html | title= THE MINISTRY OF YOUTHAND SPORTS IN AZERBAIJAN |publisher= [[Azerbaijan International]] |author=Laurel Deck |date= Winter 1996 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, 2001 the ''Council of Foreign Tourism'' under the administration of [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan]] was liquidated and its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, subsequently re-establishing it as the Ministry of Youth, Sport and Tourism.

The '''outdoor gym''' is a [[gym]] built outside in a public [[park]], with the all-weather construction of its [[exercise machine]]s somewhat modeled on [[playground]] equipment.  It is similar to the 1960s–1970s proliferation of [[fitness trail]]s, which continue to be created particularly in the USA and Europe.  In some instances, trails used for fitness are referred to as outdoor gyms.&lt;ref name=Randall&gt;Randall, Laura (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mf2OaGom304C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22outdoor+gym%22+fitness+trail Day and Overnight Hikes: Palm Springs] [[Menasha Ridge Press]], {{ISBN|978-0897329811}}. Retrieved 2010-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of outdoor gym equipment==
Types of outdoor gym equipment may vary according to the nature of parks, locality and the visitors. There is no fixed list as which can include all of the machines or fixtures used in different parts of the world for outdoor recreation. These fixtures or machines can also be categorized into strength training and simple fitness or resistance training. Some basic outdoor exercising installations used commonly all over the world are pullup bars, balancing beams, parallel dip bars, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdlfitness.com/blog/best-exercising-machines-to-look-for-in-the-playground/

== By country ==
=== China ===
Outdoor gyms have been used in [[China]] as a national fitness campaign prior to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=Xinhua&gt;[http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/c/t510021.htm Olympic passion turns into "exercise fervor" in China] ''Chinese Embassy in the U.S.'', 29 August 2008 [[Xinhua News Agency]]. Retrieved 2010-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The government has rolled out over {{convert|20000000|m2|sqft}} of outdoor [[gym]]nasiums across China&lt;ref name=Xinhua/&gt;  Currently a third of the sports lottery is dedicated to funding this concept.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In China they have a similar survey to the Active People Survey. The participation levels in physical activity have been steadily on the increase since the outdoor gym concept has been introduced to China.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

=== India ===
Outdoor gyms are starting to trend in New Delhi, India, where traditional gyms have had low popularity. In 2012 the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) installed 40 sets around the area, surrounding municipalities have followed suit.

=== United Kingdom ===
Since 2007, outdoor gyms have become increasingly common in the [[United Kingdom]], where they are usually installed in public parks and school playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17818223|title=The rise of the adult playground|publisher=BBC News|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://creativeplayuk.com/top-5-outdoor-gym-equipment-items-every-school-have/|title=Top 5 Outdoor Gym Equipment Items that Every School Should Have|publisher=Creative Play|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phil Welch Stadium''' is a baseball [[stadium]] in [[St Joseph, Missouri]]. It originally opened in 1939 as the home of the minor league St. Joseph Saints.  It has a [[seating capacity]] of 3,600 and is located at 2600 SW Parkway in St. Joseph.

Phil Welch Stadium was the home from 2006 to 2007 to the [[St. Joe Blacksnakes]], a minor-league team competing in the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]]. Since 2009 the stadium has been the home of the Saint Joseph Mustangs, a [[collegiate summer baseball]] team competing in the M.I.N.K. League. Phil Welch was also the home park of the [[Missouri Western State University]] Griffons until the 2011 season. It has previously housed several minor league and independent league teams including a Saint Louis Cardinal farm team named the Cardinals. Hall of Fame players like [[Mickey Mantle]] and [[Willie Mays]] played games there while rising through the ranks.

Stadium dimensions are 320-420-320 (left to right). The lighting poles in the outfield are constructed out of metal lattice frame and are located within the field of play, creating scenarios of balls bouncing off the metal frame or getting caught inside the framework.

The '''Phillip Ice Skating Centre''' (also known as '''Phillip Swimming &amp; Ice Skating Centre''' and the '''Brave Cave''') is an [[ice sports]] and public skate centre, open in 1980 and located at the [[Phillip, Australian Capital Territory|Phillip]] precinct of [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Australia]]. It is the current home of the [[CBR Brave]] [[AIHL]] ice hockey club and previous home of the [[Canberra Knights]] AIHL ice hockey club.

Phillip Ice Skating Centre's rink is the only ice rink in Canberra and will continue to be the only rink in Canberra for the foreseeable future after ACT Sports minister [[Shane Rattenbury]] on 16 August 2014 confirmed the [[ACT Government]] is not looking to build a new larger ice rink co-located with a new swimming pool next to Stromlo Forest Park to service the new suburbs of Molonglo in Canberra's west despite constant lobbying by the CBR Brave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-16/act-sports-minister-rules-out-new-ice-rink-for-canberra/5675570 | title = ACT Sport Minister rules out new ice rink for Canberra despite lobbying by CBR Brave team | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Company|ABC News]] | first=Tim | last=Gavel | date=16 August 2014 | access-date = 24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed years of speculation about the aging Phillip Ice Skating Centre after it was revealed in 2012 that the private owner of the centre was open to working with developers to reconfiguring the site so that the outdoor pools went inside, a new ice rink was built and a boutique hotel constructed on the block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/draft-report-reveals-south-canberra-swimming-facility-shortage-20121004-271cj.html | title = Draft report reveals south Canberra swimming facility shortage | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Megan | last=Doherty | date=4 October 2012 | access-date = 24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
All facilities are located on a single level, barring a small mezzanine level with some seating and the bar serving alcoholic beverages, usually open during Canberra Brave home games only. Until June 2018, the rink was renowned nationally for its lack of hand dryers in the bathrooms. As of 22nd June 2018, news broke rapidly of a fresh install of working hand dryers, breaking the long drought. A full list of facilities is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/attraction/phillip-ice-skating-centre | title = Phillip Ice Skating Centre | publisher=www.VisitCanberra.com.au | first= | last= | date= | access-date = 24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nican.com.au/service/phillip-swimming-and-ice-skating-centre | title = Phillip Swimming and Ice Skating Centre | publisher=www.nican.com.au | first= | last= | date= | access-date = 24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

''Procession at Seville and bullfighting scenes'' depicts the traditional Spanish [[Holy Week]] celebration, portraying Spain in the 19th century. This recording includes a traditional parade and [[Bullfighting|bullfights]] in Spain, representing how this holiday was celebrated at the time.&lt;ref name="Arte Sacro" /&gt; At the beginning, the short film shows the Procession Parade from the Christ of Sorrows. This celebration occurs during [[Holy Week in Seville]] which is celebrated one week before Easter. It includes decorated chariots that are pulled around the city streets by ''Costaleros''. The ''Penitentes'', dressed in tunics and a cape, march together in the procession along with the chariots and other people wearing traditional  and formal clothing &lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Société Anonyme des Plaques et Papiers Photographiques Antoine Lumière|first1=Société Lumière|title=Descargas  Procesión en Sevilla y escenas de corridas de toros|journal=World Digital Library|date=12/02/ 2016|volume=1|issue=1|page=2|url=https://www.wdl.org/es/item/536/#featured_item=true&amp;page=2|accessdate=3 November 2016|ref=Société Lumière}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the bullfighting celebration, the ''Banderillero'' entertains the bull and plays with it, meanwhile a ''[[Picador]]'' (Lancer) enters the spectacle. The Picador is riding a horse and manages to stab the bull. The short film displays the process of bullfighting and how each participant plays their specific role, as well as the traditional parade.&lt;ref name="El Correo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=El Correo de Andalucía|first1=El Correo|title=Sevilla, vista por los hermanos Lumière|url=http://elcorreoweb.es/historico/sevilla-vista-por-los-hermanos-lumiere-MBEC169137|website=El Correo Web|publisher=El Correo|accessdate=3 November 2016|ref=El Correo Web de Andalucía}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and development==

===Production===

To create the short film, the Lumière Brothers used a [[cinematograph]], a new projection device which was beginning to be used at that time.&lt;ref name="El Correo" /&gt; The brothers sent different equipment all over the world in order to film a variety of scenes and images. Two of the main filming locations were France and Spain.&lt;ref name="El Correo" /&gt; This short [[non-fiction]] film marked the first time that someone filmed the Spanish Holy Week.&lt;ref name="Aciprensa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruiz|first1=Bianca|title=Hermanos Lumière, padres del cine moderno, pioneros en grabar Semana Santa de Sevilla|url=https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/hermanos-lumiere-padres-del-cine-moderno-pioneros-en-grabar-semana-santa-de-sevilla-36981/|website=Aciprensa|publisher=EWTN Noticias|accessdate=3 November 2016|ref=Aciprensa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and reception==

The first 1,000 copies of this film were distributed by Auguste and Louis Lumière. ''Procession at Seville and bullfighting scenes'' was found later on a 16mm reel and a videocassette, along with other 46 Lumière films.&lt;ref name="WolrdCat"&gt;{{cite web|first1=La Société Lumière|title=Procession at Séville and bullfighting scenes|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/procession-at-seville-and-bullfighting-scenes/oclc/76783352|website=WorldCat|publisher=Online Computer Library Center|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the [[Library of Congress]] as well as the World Digital Library, the latter created by the [[UNESCO]] in order to distribute cultural and academic content,&lt;ref name="Diario de Sevilla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diario de Sevilla|first1=Diario de Sevilla|title=La Unesco rescata la Sevilla de los Lumière|url=http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/semanasanta2009/404279/la/unesco/rescata/la/sevilla/los/lumiere.html|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=Diario de Sevilla|agency=Joly Digita|issue=Semana Santa|publisher=Diario de Sevilla|date=10/03/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributed the video in a digital format via the Internet .&lt;ref name="WDL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|first1=Library of Congress|title=Procession at Séville and bullfighting scenes|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2006640141/|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''smash''' in [[tennis]] is a shot that is hit above the hitter's head with a serve-like motion. It is also referred to as an overhead. A smash can usually be hit with a high amount of force and is often a shot that ends the [[point (tennis)|point]]. Most smashes are hit fairly near the net or in mid-court before the ball bounces&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patcash.co.uk/2018/03/the-6-basic-strokes-in-tennis-explained/#overheadsmash|title=Tennis 101: The 6 Basic Strokes Explained Step-by-Step {{!}} Pat Cash Tennis|date=2018-03-01|work=Pat Cash Tennis|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, generally against [[lob (tennis)|lob]]s that have not been hit high enough or deep enough by the opponent. A player can also smash a very high ball from the ''baseline'', generally on the bounce, although this is often a less forceful smash.

''Smash'' commonly refers to the [[forehand]] smash; [[backhand]] smashes are rarer and more difficult to execute, especially for beginners, since they are basically high backhand [[volley (tennis)|volley]]s generally hit at an exact angle causing the ball to spin. [[Rod Laver]] and [[Jimmy Connors]], both left-handers, were known for their very powerful backhand smashes. The forehand smash was first used in Tennis by [[Helena Rice]] on championship point in the [[1890 Wimbledon Championships]] final.

In his 1979 autobiography [[Jack Kramer (tennis player)|Jack Kramer]], who had a fine overhead himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: "OVERHEAD—[[Ted Schroeder|Schroeder]] just tops here, ahead of [[Ken Rosewall|Rosewall]] and [[John Newcombe|Newcombe]].

==Grip and action==
{{Main|Grip (tennis)}}
The grip used for a tennis smash is usually a continental grip although some players use an Eastern grip. The swing is an upward throwing motion, making the execution of the shot almost identical to a serve. The main difference from a serve is position and footwork. The positioning and footwork are more similar to a [[Volley (tennis)|volley]] which is usually hit with a strong forward weight transfer from inside the court. The smash can be executed with one or both feet on the ground.

{{Anchor|Skyhook}}Jimmy Connors invented and popularized the ''skyhook'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivalfish.com/rivalroom/2008/01/sandy-balls-story-of-nbta.html|title=The Rival Room |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/stars/alanko/tennis.html |title=Tennis Magazine's 101 tips: Serve |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a version of the overhead smash in which the Eastern grip used to hit the ball further behind the body than is possible with a traditional overhead smash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tennis.about.com/od/volleyoverheadothershots/a/skyhooksmashvid.htm |title=About.com:Tennis-Windmill or Sky Hook Overhead Smash - Video and Analysis|publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pete Sampras]] (and before him [[Yannick Noah]]) popularized the ''jump smash'', where the player jumps and then hits the smash in mid-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/28/tennis-learn-overhead-smash|title=Overhead smash|date=2009-06-28|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shot is often also called a slam dunk, as in [[basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tennisplanet.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/pete-sampras-slam-dunks.html|title=Pete Sampras Slam Dunks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arsene Wenger.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Arsène Wenger]], for whom the stadium is named]]
'''Stade Arsène Wenger''' ''([[French language|French]]: Arsène Wenger Stadium)'', also erroneously called ''Stade de Arsène Wenger'' in international usage,&lt;ref name=espn /&gt; is an [[association football]] stadium in [[Duppigheim]], [[Alsace]], France. It was built in 2016 and it is the home ground of USL Duppigheim with a capacity of 500 seats. It is named after the former manager of the [[Premier League]] team  [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Arsène Wenger]] who grew up in nearby [[Duttlenheim]].&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/22/arsenal-boss-arsene-wenger-now-has-a-stadium-named-after-him-5898567/ |title=Arsenal news: 'Stade Arsene Wenger' – stadium named after Arsenal boss |publisher=Metro |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
USL Duppigheim initially played their home at Rue de Stade in Duppigheim, though Stade Arsène Wenger was built to replace it. The location that Stade Arsène Wenger built upon used to be a farmer's field mostly used for growing potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Arsene-wenger-inaugure-un-stade-a-son-nom-en-alsace/680298 |title=Arsène Wenger inaugure un stade à son nom en Alsace |publisher=Lequipe.fr |language=French |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a new 500-seat stadium was built on the site of this field at a cost of €750,000 (£580,000).&lt;ref name=bleu&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/societe/arsene-wenger-donne-son-nom-au-stade-de-football-de-duppigheim-1463938330 |title=Arsène Wenger donne son nom au stade de football de Duppigheim |publisher=Francebleu.fr |language=French |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate his contribution to football, it was named after Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whaling |first=James |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsene-wenger-travels-back-hometown-8028183 |title=Arsene Wenger travels back to hometown in Alsace to open new stadium named after him – Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is located {{convert|3|km}} between Duppigheim and Duttlenheim but is considered to be administratively in Duppigheim. Duppigheim residents jokingly stated "who will tell the guys in Duttlenheim?" upon the news that the stadium named after Wenger would be in Duppigheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A Duppigheim, Floréal Hernandez |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/strasbourg/1849835-20160522-football-arsene-wenger-inaugure-premier-stade-nom-3-km-village-natal |title=Arsène Wenger inaugure le premier stade à son nom à 3 km de son village natal |language=French |publisher=20minutes.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was opened by Wenger in May 2016 in front of 600 people. During the ceremony, he stated that he recalled: "When I was little, this stadium was a field of potatoes. Now it looks like [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]]."&lt;ref name=bleu /&gt; Wenger also stated that "It’s an honour. I am a little surprised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vaishali Bhardwaj |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-manager-inaugurates-stade-arsene-wenger-in-french-region-where-he-grew-up-a3254151.html |title=Stade Arsene Wenger: Arsenal manager opens venue in French region where he grew up |publisher=Evening Standard |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USL Duppigheim chairman Peter Troesch stated that it was an "easy choice" and proclaimed that "He [Wenger] deserves to have one in every village in Alsace and France."&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/arsenal/story/2878110/arsenal-boss-arsene-wenger-opens-stadium-named-after-him-in-france |title=Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger opens stadium named after him in France |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taiho-jutsu''' (''arresting art'') (逮捕術) is a term for martial arts developed by Japan’s feudal police to arrest dangerous criminals, who were usually armed and frequently desperate. While many ''taiho-jutsu'' methods originated from the classical Japanese schools of ''[[kenjutsu]]'' (swordsmanship) and ''[[jūjutsu]]'' (unarmed fighting arts), the goal of the feudal police officers was to capture lawbreakers alive and without injury. Thus, they often used specialized implements and unarmed techniques intended to pacify or disable suspects rather than employing more lethal means.&lt;ref name="refname1" /&gt;

==History==
Japanese law enforcement officers trained in self-defense and arresting techniques primarily based on the unarmed fighting styles of ''jūjutsu''. They also developed and perfected the use of a variety of non-lethal implements for capturing and restraining suspects such as ''[[juttejutsu]]'' (truncheon arts), ''toritejutsu'' (restraining arts), and ''[[hojōjutsu]]'' (binding and tying arts). Feudal era police officers became proficient in a variety of specialized techniques for arresting both armed and unarmed individuals.

Many traditional Japanese martial arts schools once included elements of ''taiho jutsu'', although most have since been lost to history. A number of ''taiho jutsu'' techniques have survived, though, and are still taught and practiced in their original forms by specialists in ''jūjutsu'' as well as ''kenjutsu'' and ''[[iaido]]'' (swordsmanship).

==Modern Taiho-Jutsu==
The modern version of ''Taiho-jutsu'' was created during the Allied occupation of post World War II Japan.  Japan was being demilitarized, the practice of the martial arts had been prohibited, and the Japanese police force was unable to cope with the outbreaks of violence during that period. The Tokyo police bureau convened a technical committee headed by kendoist Saimura Goro; judoist Nagaoka Shuichi; [[Shimizu Takaji]], the twenty-fifth headmaster of the Shindo Muso Ryu; Otsuka Hidenori, founder of the Wado Ryu; and Horiguchi Tsuneo, a pistol expert. This committee reviewed the techniques of classical kenjutsu, jujutsu, and [[jojutsu]], and adapted several techniques from each of these disciplines for police use; the committee also selected techniques from modern disciplines, such as jujutsu, karate-jutsu, kendo, and judo, for incorporation into the proposed system of self-defense; and further ideas were gained from a study of Western boxing.  A system comprising these elements and called ''taiho-jutsu'' was created in 1947, and ''Taiho-jutsu Kihon Kozo'' (Fundamentals of Taiho-jutsu) was published as an official manual for policemen.&lt;ref name="refname2" /&gt; Takaji and Takayama Kenichi demonstrated [[jodo]] for the Police Technical Commission in 1927, and this resulted in the subsequent development of a police combat system using the short staff or [[jō]], ''[[keijojutsu]]'', which is still used by the [[Law enforcement in Japan#Riot police|Japanese riot police]] (although the staff used is somewhat heftier than that used in classical jodo).&lt;ref name="GreenSvinth2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas A. Green|author2=Joseph R. Svinth|title=Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaTfuuIlmqcC&amp;pg=PA150|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-243-2|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Draeger1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donn F.

''Taiho-jutsu'' has had several revisions since 1947 and is still studied and examined to bring in refinements and adapt it to new conditions of street fighting. It makes great use of Keibo, a short police baton, in a range of techniques called ''Keibo-soho'', as well as the extending tubular baton (''Tokushu Keibo'') which was adopted by the Japanese police in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ustjf.us/news/Keijutsu.html | title=Taiho-Jutsu and Keijutsu: A Comparison | publisher=United States Taiho Jutsu Federation | accessdate=September 10, 2012 | author=Kaplan, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In The U.S.==
''Taiho-jutsu'' was introduced to the U.S. when the Strategic Air Command began sending combative measures instructors to the [[Kodokan]] in Japan for eight-week training programs. The course was a Japanese-designed mix of [[judo]], [[karate]], [[aikido]] and ''taiho-jutsu''. Kodokan officials contacted the JKA to manage the karate instruction. The JKA responded by sending Nishiyama, Obata, Okazaki, and Terada. Judo instruction was provided by Kodokan greats Kotani, Otaki, Takagake, Sato, Shinojima, and Yamaguchi. Aikido instruction was led by Tomiki, along with Yamada and Inuzuka, while the instruction in ''Taiho-jutsu'' was given by Hosokawa and Kikuchi. The SAC airmen attended class at the dojo for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and at the end of the course had to compete against and be evaluated by ten Black Belts. Upon returning to the United States, these airmen became instructors at every SAC base where it was important to develop combatives courses for crewmen in training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ustjf.us/news/heritage.html | title=A Classical Heritage | publisher=United States Taiho Jutsu Federation | accessdate=September 10, 2012 | author=Shipley, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ustjf.us/news/sac.html | title=S.A.C. Training, Taiho-Jutsu, and the Formation of Jakata | publisher=United States Taiho Jutsu Federation | accessdate=September 10, 2012 | author=Kaplan, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the current leaders in the United States “Taiho Jutsu” community is Daniel Hect; Daniel has over 30 years experience in combatives and is a Police Officer and Reserve USAF Security Forces Master Sergeant.

To promote more effective Arrest and Control and Defensive Tactics training methods, Daniel Hect led a committee of law enforcement and military trainers as well as leading martial artist in reviewing the techniques from traditional Taiho Jutsu, Goju Karate, Japanese Jujutsu, Brazilian Jujutsu, and Aikido to develop a comprehensive Arrest and Control curriculum that could be used in the field today. To validate the project, Daniel also attended the University of Southern California for his master's degree and completed this summary project on “The Impact of Martial Arts in Law Enforcement”  where the benefits of “Taiho Jutsu” were emphasized.

The Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu committee selected techniques that were effective, easy to use and could be adapted to meet the standards set by the California Police Officer Standards and Training (POST).  These same techniques were incorporated into the Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu system.  All techniques taught in the Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu system are in compliance with the California POST, Use of Force Standard; and are the foundation for Arrest and Control/Defensive Tactics curricula. Techniques not applicable to current Law Enforcement methods were omitted from the Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu curricula to limit the potential of excessive force liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ustjf.us/news/Keijutsu.html | title=Taiho-Jutsu and Keijutsu: A Comparison | publisher=United States Taiho Jutsu Federation | accessdate=September 10, 2012 | author=Kaplan, Japlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As military units have different Force Options and Rules of Engagement specific to the operation and branch of service, a separate but similar Methodology was developed to instruct military members in the art of Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu. These techniques are taught to Military members and units. The Police and Military curricula have separate focuses and objectives based upon the needs of the entities being instructed.

Current Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu instructors teach Arrest and Control tactics at Police Departments and Police Academies all over California as well as Force Options at Military Units all over the world.

THT also features a blog, THT Live, which is run by Novick.

The site is edited by Joe Distelheim, Travis Conrads, Jeremiah Oshan and Bryan Tsao.

==THT Fantasy==
The Hardball Times includes a dedicated fantasy section, running multiple articles a day five days a week. Its writers include Derek Carty, who has been there from the start, as well as Derek Ambrosino, Jeffrey Gross, Matt Hagen, Jonathan Halket, Jeremiah Oshan, Josh Shepardson, and Jonathan Sher. 

THT Fantasy runs a weekly "Roster Doctor" column in which writers dissect a reader's roster and features a daily updated "Closer Watch" feature, which allows readers to keep up tabs on the closer situation for all 30 Major League teams.

Launched in March 2010, THT Forecasts begins its third season as a subscription-only section featuring Brian Cartwright's [[Oliver Projections]]. Subscribers can access six years worth of projections, including minor league players, which are updated weekly during the season.

==Books==
Since its inception in 2004, The Hardball Times has released an annual book, “The Hardball Times Baseball Annual.” The latest edition, “The Hardball Times Annual 2012,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/its-the-hardball-times-annual-2012/|title=It’s the Hardball Times Annual 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; features reviews of the 2011 season as well as  articles by the likes of [[Rob Neyer]], [[Craig Calcaterra]], [[Adam Dorhauer]], [[Matt Swartz]], [[Max Marchi]], [[John Dewan]], Michael Humphreys and [[Brian Cartwright (baseball)|Brian Cartwright]]. 

From 2007-2009, The Hardball Times also released a pre-season book, “The Hardball Times Season Preview.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/its-the-hardball-times-season-preview-2009/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; The book consisted of 30 team essays, over 1,000 player comments, and projections for each player. It also featured projected standings, career projections, and multiple essays in the back of the book, mostly concerning fantasy baseball. In the 2010, the book was replaced by THT Forecasts.

In 2004, Steve Treder and Dave Studeman also released “The Hardball Times Bullpen Book,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-bullpen-book/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; which chronicled the history of major league relievers and reviewed, in detail, the best and worst performers of each major league bullpen from 2002 through 2004.

'''Wagner College Stadium''' is a 3,500-seat [[multi-purpose stadium]] located on the campus of [[Wagner College]] in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Wagner College Stadium|publisher=stadiumjourney.com|url=http://www.stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/wagner-college-stadium-s1813/|accessdate=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened in 1967, the stadium is used for football, men's lacrosse, women's lacrosse, and track &amp; field. Hameline Field has 400 premium seat back chairs located at midfield. Below the stadium is a field house featuring several locker rooms, a training room, an equipment room, and public facilities. Surrounding the field is a six-lane synthetic track, allowing the college to play host to many major track &amp; field events. The stadium was renovated as part of a $13 million addition to the campus facilities in 1998. In 2006, the stadium's natural grass field was replaced with state-of-the-art [[FieldTurf]], a synthetic grass playing surface.

In 2012, the playing surface was named '''Hameline Field''' in honor of long-time athletic director and head football coach Walt Hameline. In 2013, lights were added to the stadium, and the football and women's soccer teams played home night games for the first time.

'''World Rugby''' is the world governing body for the sport of [[rugby union]].&lt;ref name=times-1998/&gt; World Rugby organises the [[Rugby World Cup]] every four years, the sport's most recognised and most profitable competition.&lt;ref name="RWC Hist rfh"&gt;{{cite web|work=Rugby Football History |title=Rugby World Cup History |url=http://rugbyfootballhistory.com/world_cup.htm | accessdate=14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also organises a number of other international rugby competitions, such as the [[World Rugby Sevens Series]], the [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]], the [[World Rugby Under 20 Championship|World Under 20 Championship]], and the [[Pacific Nations Cup]].

World Rugby's headquarters are in [[Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=it-2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=irb-org/&gt; Its membership now comprises 120 national unions.&lt;ref name="RW Handbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/member-unions|title=World Rugby Member Unions|last=|first=|date=|work=World Rugby|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member country must also be a member of one of the six regional unions into which the world is divided: Africa, Americas North, Asia, Europe, South America and Oceania.{{sfn|WR Handbook|2014|page=20}}

World Rugby was founded as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) in 1886 by [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]], [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]] and [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]], with [[Rugby Football Union|England]] joining in 1890.{{sfn|IRB Handbook|2013|pages =15-20}} [[Rugby Australia|Australia]], [[New Zealand Rugby|New Zealand]] and [[South African Rugby Board|South Africa]] became full members in 1949.{{sfn|IRB Handbook|2013|pages=15-20}} [[French Rugby Federation|France]] became a member in 1978 and a further eighty members joined from 1987 to 1999.{{sfn|IRB Handbook|2013|pages=15-20}} The body was renamed the '''International Rugby Board (IRB)''' in 1998, and took up its current name of World Rugby in November 2014.&lt;ref name= irb-name-wr/&gt;

In 2009, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) voted to include rugby sevens in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=rfh-olmpics/&gt; World Rugby gained membership of the [[Association of Summer Olympic International Federations]] (ASOIF) in 2010.&lt;ref name=asoif&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asoif.com/IFDirectory/ |title=Members |publisher=ASOIF |access-date=29 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710081849/http://asoif.com/IFDirectory/ |archive-date=10 July 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:IRB Letter 1887.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The minutes of the first formal meeting of the IRFB, from a meeting attended by Lyle and McAlistair of Ireland, Carrick and Gardner of Scotland, [[Richard Mullock|Mullock]] and [[Horace Lyne|Lyne]] of Wales]]
Until 1885 the laws of [[rugby football]] were made by England as the founder nation. However, following a disputed [[try]] in an international between [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]] in 1884, letters were exchanged in which England claimed that they made the laws, and the try should stand.&lt;ref name= ru-museum/&gt; Scotland refused to play England in the [[1885 Home Nations Championship]]. Following the dispute, the [[Home Nations|home unions]] of Scotland, Ireland and Wales decided to form an international union whose membership would agree on the standard rules of rugby football. The three nations met in Dublin in 1886, though no formal regulations were agreed upon. On 5 December 1887, committee members of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], [[Scottish Rugby Union]] (named the Scottish Football Union at the time) and [[Welsh Rugby Union]] met in Manchester and wrote up the first four principles of the International Rugby Football Board. England refused to take part in the founding of the IRFB, stating that they should have greater representation, as they had more clubs.&lt;ref name="1880's RFC hist"&gt;{{cite web | work=Rugby Football History |title = 1880s |url= http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1880s.htm| accessdate=15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The England Union also refused to accept the IRFB as the recognised lawmaker of the game.&lt;ref name="1880's RFC hist" /&gt; This led to the IRFB taking the stance of member countries not playing England until they joined, and no games were played against England in 1888 and 1889.&lt;ref name=history_laws&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the laws of rugby football |url= http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/laws.htm |work=Rugby Football History |accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 England joined the IRFB, gaining six seats while the other unions had two each.&lt;ref name=history_laws/&gt; The same year, the IRFB wrote the first international laws of rugby union.&lt;ref name="ARU Hist"&gt;{{cite web|work=rugby.com.au |title=History of the Game |url=http://www.rugby.com.au/community_rugby/what_is_rugby/history_of_the_game,24.html |accessdate=15 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819105410/http://www.rugby.com.au/community_rugby/what_is_rugby/history_of_the_game%2C24.html |archivedate=19 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, the IRFB was faced with the divide between [[amateurism]] and [[professionalism]], which was nicknamed the "Great Schism". Following the introduction of working class men to the game in Northern England, clubs began paying "broken time" payments to players, due to the loss of earnings from playing on a Saturday.&lt;ref name="1890s RFC hist"&gt;{{cite web | work=rugbyfootballhistory.com |title =1890s |url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1890s.htm| accessdate=15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland County Union also complained of another club using monetary incentives to lure players, leading to the IRFB conducting an enquiry. The IRFB was warned by all the chief clubs in [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] that any punishment would lead to the clubs seceding from the union.&lt;ref name="1890s RFC hist" /&gt; The debate over broken time payments ultimately caused the 22 leading clubs in Yorkshire and Lancashire to form the [[Northern Rugby Football Union]].  The competing unions' laws of the game diverged almost immediately; the northern body's code eventually became known as [[rugby league|rugby league football]].&lt;ref name="1890s RFC hist" /&gt;

[[File:Irb-logo.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Original IRB logo]]
England's seats on the IRFB were reduced from six to four in 1911. The [[Rugby Australia|Australian Rugby Union]],&lt;!--Renamed as Rugby Australia in October 2017.--&gt; [[New Zealand Rugby|New Zealand Rugby Football Union]]&lt;!--NZR didn't drop "Football" from its official name until 2006, and didn't adopt "New Zealand Rugby" as its brand name until 2013.--&gt; and [[South African Rugby Board]]&lt;!--This was the all-white governing body, which merged with the former black rugby governing body in 1992 to form what is now the South African Rugby Union.--&gt; joined the board with one seat each in 1948, with England's seats being reduced to two, the same as the other home nations. The three Southern Hemisphere unions were given a second seat each in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5005_99_96.html |title=Major team and individual sports |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=22 October 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Rugby Federation]] was admitted in 1978 and the [[Argentine Rugby Union]], [[Rugby Canada|Canadian Rugby Union]], [[Italian Rugby Federation]] and [[Japan Rugby Football Union]] were admitted in 1991.&lt;ref name=history_laws/&gt; In 2016, [[Georgia Rugby Union|Georgia]], [[Romanian Rugby Federation|Romania]], and [[USA Rugby|the USA]] were added to the voting Council with one vote each. Additionally, current Council members Argentina, Canada and Italy were granted a second representative and vote. The six regional associations represented on the Council also received an additional vote.&lt;ref name="Sero"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usarugby.org/2015/11/usa-rugby-reaction-to-world-rugby-governance-reform/ |title=USA Welcomed to Expanded WorldRugby Council |last=Sero |first=Nick |date=11 May 2016 |website=usarugby.org |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that in the late 1950s the IRFB was presented with the ideas of a world championship.&lt;ref name="wcweb"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=worldcupweb.com |title=The History of RWC |url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/history.asp |accessdate=28 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414193531/http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/history.asp |archivedate=14 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 and 1984 respectively, the Australian and New Zealand Rugby Football Unions each proposed hosting such a tournament.&lt;ref name="wcweb"/&gt; The following year the board committed to conduct a feasibility study. A year later there was another meeting in Paris, and the Union subsequently voted on the idea. It was the South African Rugby Board's vote that proved to be crucial in setting up a tied vote, as they voted in favour, even though they knew they would be excluded due to the [[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|sporting boycott]] because of their [[apartheid]] policies. English and Welsh votes were then changed, and the vote was won 10 to 6.&lt;ref name="wcweb"/&gt;

{{Update after|2017|text=As at January 2017, World Rugby has 102 member unions and 17 associated unions.}}{{sfn|WR Handbook|2017|pages=15–19}}

Membership of World Rugby is a four-step process:&lt;ref name= irb-rev-2010/&gt;

# A Union must apply to become an associate member of its Regional Union
# After all membership criteria are met, including one year as an associate member, the Union is admitted to the Regional Union as a full member
# After completion of stages 1 and 2, and two years as a full member of a Regional Union, the Union may then apply to become an Associate member of World Rugby. As an associate member, the union can participate in World Rugby funded tournaments but not the Rugby World Cup
# Following two years of associate membership of World Rugby, the union may then apply to become a Full Member

'''Regional Unions'''

Six regional associations, which represent each continent, are affiliated with World Rugby and help to develop the fifteen-a-side game as well as Rugby 7's across the world. Not all members of the regional associations are members of World Rugby. Below is a list of member and associate unions and their regional associations with the year that they joined World Rugby. Associate unions are in ''italics''.

==Governance==
===Council===
The World Rugby Council meets twice a year and manages and controls the affairs of World Rugby.&lt;ref&gt;IRB bye-law 9, http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/AboutIRB/IRBConstitution/02/03/02/20/2030220_PDF.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101105432/http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/AboutIRB/IRBConstitution/02/03/02/20/2030220_PDF.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council formulates and oversees the implementation of World Rugby's strategic plan and application of policy decisions, and selects the host nation(s) for the [[Rugby World Cup hosts|Rugby World Cup]].  The Council considers recommendations of the General Assembly. The Council may admit or expel member nations.  The Council is also the supreme legislative authority of World Rugby. Most Council decisions require approval of simple majority, but to amend the World Rugby's by-laws, regulations, or the Laws of the Game requires approval of three quarters of the Council.

Prior to 2016, the Council had 28 members. In November 2015, World Rugby announced that they would be adding more unions to the voting council and giving the regional associations two votes each on the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/news/122987 |title=Expanded game representation and independence at the heart of World Rugby governance reform |publisher=World Rugby |date=10 May 2017 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usarugby.org/2015/11/usa-rugby-reaction-to-world-rugby-governance-reform/ |title=USA Rugby Reaction to WorldRugby Governance Reform |last=Sero |first=Nick |date=10 November 2015 |website=usarugby.org |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* (30) Ten unions each have three votes and two delegates: [[Argentine Rugby Union|Argentina]], [[Rugby Australia|Australia]], [[Rugby Football Union|England]], [[French Rugby Federation|France]], [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]], [[Italian Rugby Federation|Italy]], [[New Zealand Rugby|New Zealand]], [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]], [[South African Rugby Union|South Africa]], and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]].
* (2) One union has two votes and one delegate: [[Japan Rugby Football Union|Japan]].
* (6) Six unions each have one vote and one delegate: [[Rugby Canada|Canada]], [[Georgia Rugby Union|Georgia]], [[Fiji Rugby Union|Fiji]], [[Samoa Rugby Union|Samoa]], [[Romanian Rugby Federation|Romania]], and the [[USA Rugby|United States]]. 
* (12) The six regional associations representing [[Rugby Europe|Europe]], [[Sudamérica Rugby|South America]], [[Rugby Americas North|Americas North]], [[Rugby Africa|Africa]], [[Asia Rugby|Asia]] and [[Oceania Rugby|Oceania]] each have two votes and one delegate.

In total, Europe has 22 votes; Oceania 10 votes; South America 5 votes; Africa 5 votes; North America 4 votes and Asia 4 votes.

A Chairman and Vice Chairman are elected from among the delegates and these positions are held by [[Bill Beaumont]] of England and [[Agustín Pichot]] of Argentina, respectively, {{as of|2017|5|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="Eligibility reform"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrugby.org/news/158701 |title=Bill Beaumont elected next World Rugby Chairman |date=11 May 2016 |website=worldrugby.org |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive Committee===
The Executive Committee, in accordance with bye-laws 9.14 - 9.16, ensures the effective management and operation of the World Rugby.&lt;ref&gt;IRB bye-laws, http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/AboutIRB/IRBConstitution/02/03/02/20/2030220_PDF.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101105432/http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/AboutIRB/IRBConstitution/02/03/02/20/2030220_PDF.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee formulates and monitors the implementation of the World Rugby's strategic plan, business plan, operational plan and budget. 
In 2016, as part of the reforms to the World Rugby Council, the Executive Committee was increased to 12 members.  The Chairman, Vice-Chairman, nine elected officials, including two independent members, and the Chief Executive sit on the World Rugby Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrugby.org/news/122987 |title=Expanded game representation and independence at the heart of World Rugby governance reform |date=10 November 2015 |website=worldrugby.org |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Assembly===
A General Assembly of the full membership is convened every two years.&lt;ref name= irb-org/&gt; The General Assembly may make recommendations to the Council, and may consider business that the Council has referred to it,&lt;ref&gt;IRB bye-law 8, http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/AboutIRB/IRBConstitution/02/03/02/20/2030220_PDF.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101105432/http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/AboutIRB/IRBConstitution/02/03/02/20/2030220_PDF.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the General Assembly has no legislative powers.&lt;ref name="puttingrugbyfirst.com"&gt;Addleshaw Goddard, Putting Rugby First, July 2008, http://www.puttingrugbyfirst.com/downloads/Putting_Rugby_First.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102193322/http://www.puttingrugbyfirst.com/downloads/Putting_Rugby_First.pdf |date=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the World Rugby are elected by the Council. The current chairman is [[Bill Beaumont]], previously president of the Rugby Football Union (RFU). He was elected chairman effective on 1 July 2016 following the Executive Council vote on 11 May 2016. 
Previous chairmen include [[Bernard Lapasset]] (2008 to 2016), [[Syd Millar]] (2002 to 2007) and [[Vernon Pugh]], QC (1994 to 2002).

In July 2012, [[Brett Gosper]] was appointed as the new Chief Executive of what was then the IRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2063233.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724053453/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2063233.html#gosper+appointed+irb+chief+executive |archive-date=24 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
World Rugby have recently{{when|date=November 2013}} released £18.6&amp;nbsp;million of funding over three years for developing rugby nations [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[United States national rugby union team|the USA]], [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]], [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] and [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]]. [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] will also receive additional support to enable it to retain its tier one status. The money, built up from successful World Cups, was released following a report commissioned by World Rugby highlighting the growing disparity between tier one and tier two nations. (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20051129204725/http://www.irb.com/InTouch/Press/050804+SL+investment.htm IRB statement]). This is in addition to the £10–12&amp;nbsp;million it normally gives out grants and tournament costs. The emphasis is on three areas infrastructure, high performance units and cross border competitions.

It was announced in April 2006 that tier-3 rugby nations [[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgia]], [[Portugal national rugby union team|Portugal]], [[Tunisia national rugby union team|Tunisia]] and [[Russia national rugby union team|Russia]] were identified as the key investment nations over the next three years. The program is designed to increase the competitiveness of international rugby union.

==Tournaments==

===Rugby World Cups===
World Rugby organises the [[Rugby World Cup]], which has been held every four years since 1987, the sport's most recognised and most profitable competition.&lt;ref name="RWC Hist rfh"/&gt; Despite the profitability of the Rugby World Cup, the majority of its revenues and viewers come from a small number of countries. For the 2007 Rugby World Cup final, 87% of viewers came from the Five Nations (England, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland), 15% came from the Tri-Nations (South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand), with just 2% of viewers coming from all other countries.&lt;ref name="puttingrugbyfirst.com"/&gt;

The most recent Rugby World Cup was held in England in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]]. New Zealand defeated Australia 34-17 in the [[2015 Rugby World Cup Final|final]], winning their third title.

The next Rugby World Cup will be held in [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]] hosted by Japan.

World Rugby also organises the [[Women's Rugby World Cup]], also held every four years. It was first held by the IRB in 1998, though tournaments in 1991 and 1994 were retrospectively recognised in 2009. The Women's Rugby World Cup is contested by fewer teams than the men's Cup, with only the 1998 and 2002 editions featuring more than 12 teams (these competitions both had 16 teams, compared to the 20 teams in the men's Rugby World Cup).

The most recent Women's Rugby World Cup was held in [[Ireland]], with matches held both in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], in [[2017 Women's Rugby World Cup|2017]]. The four-year cycle was brought forward by a year to ease congestion in the sport's international calendar.&lt;ref name="wrwc 2017 host"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/news/70650|title=Ireland to host Women’s Rugby World Cup 2017|work=worldrugby.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- IRFU organises rugby in RoI and NI, hence used Ireland rather than Rep page or NI page --&gt; The tournament was won by New Zealand, who defeated England 41–32 in the final.

===Sevens===
World Rugby also organizes three international sevens tournaments - two annual Sevens Series (one for men and one for women), and a quadrennial World Cup.

Arguably the most high-profile sevens competition organised by World Rugby is the [[World Rugby Sevens Series|HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series]]. Held every year, the season-long series takes place over 10 legs, each held in a different country. The [[World Rugby Women's Sevens Series|HSBC World Rugby Women's Sevens Series]], a five- or six-leg series similar to its male counterpart, is held for women's sevens teams.

Both tournaments follow the same principle—points are awarded based on a teams position in each round of the series, and the team with the most points at the end of the Series is crowned champions. Following the inclusion of rugby sevens into the Olympics, beginning with the 2014–15 series, the series prior to an Olympic event (i.e. the series which ends in the year before the Olympics takes place) forms the first phase of Olympic qualification. When Olympic Qualification is included, the top four teams from both the men's and women's series will qualify for the Olympic Games, and remaining teams will compete in regional competitions for one of the remaining places.

World Rugby also organises the quadrennial [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]]. The tournament, which includes both the men's and women's world cup tournaments, was originally due to be discontinued after the inclusion of rugby sevens into the Olympic Programme. However, it was later decided to retain the tournament, as it involved a significantly larger number of teams than the Olympics would, and to move the tournament so as to create a more even sevens calendar (with the ''major'' sevens events alternating every two years).

As a result, the most recent tournament was the [[2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens]] in [[San Francisco]], [[United States|USA]].&lt;ref name="rwc7s 2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/news/70795|title=USA to host Rugby World Cup Sevens 2018|work=worldrugby.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men's and women's competitions at this event were both won by New Zealand.

===Developmental competitions===
World Rugby organizes annual international competitions involving Tier 2 nations.

* [[World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup|Pacific Nations Cup]], which has been played annually since 2006. The national teams of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga currently compete for the cup. At various times in the past, the national teams of Japan, the United States, and Canada, plus second-tier representative sides from Australia and New Zealand, have also been involved.
* [[World Rugby Pacific Challenge|Pacific Challenge]], which is a competition involving the national "A" sides from Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga (and more recently Junior Japan, Canada A, and Argentina's [[Pampas XV]]).
* [[Americas Rugby Championship]], whose current incarnation involves Argentina's "A" side, currently branded as [[Argentina XV national rugby union team|Argentina XV]], and the full national teams of Brazil, Canada, Chile, Uruguay, and the USA.

===Junior competitions===
World Rugby organizes two competitions for under-20 national teams, the [[World Rugby Under 20 Championship]] and the [[World Rugby Under 20 Trophy]]. These competitions were created following the merger of under-19 and under-21 representative teams, into an under-20 age group

==Olympics==
{{See also|Rugby union at the Summer Olympics}}
The sport of rugby union has been played at the Summer Olympics on four occasions, with the last being in 1924. The winners, and thus the reigning champions, were the [[United States national rugby union team|U.S.]] team. Rugby union made one more appearance as a demonstration event but was then removed from the Games. World Rugby has most recently been very keen to see it return to the Games and is adamant that the sport (specifically referring to [[rugby sevens]]) satisfies every respect of the criteria set out in the Olympic Charter.

The main problem for reintroducing the 15-man game to the Olympics is the 7-day turnaround required by World Rugby regulations for players to rest between games. Since the Olympics only officially run for 16 days, with only slight expansions allowed to accommodate sports such as football, this effectively makes it impossible to conduct a 15s tournament within the current Olympic schedule. This limitation does not apply to sevens, as games last only 14 minutes (20 in championship finals) instead of the 80 minutes in the 15s game. All of the events in the current men's and women's Sevens Series, which feature a minimum of 16 national teams for men and 12 for women, are conducted within a single weekend.

But in furthering the World Rugby cause, the organisation became an [[International Olympic Committee]] [[List of international sport federations#Association of the IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|Recognised International Federation]] in 1995, marked by a ceremonial signing by President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] prior to a match between [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref name="olympics"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=irb.com |title=Rugby &amp; The Olympic Games |url=http://www.irb.com/EN/IRB+Organisation/Olympics/ |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708173752/http://www.irb.com/EN/IRB%2BOrganisation/Olympics/ |archivedate=8 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Rugby cites rugby union's global participation, with men playing the game in well over 100 countries and women playing in over 50 as well; the organisation's compliance with the [[World Anti-Doping Agency|World Anti-Doping Code]]; and that a rugby sevens tournament could be (and generally is) accommodated in one stadium and is relatively inexpensive to play.&lt;ref name="olympics"/&gt; Not only is the sevens game successful in the context of the Sevens World Series and World Cup Sevens, it is also very successfully played in the [[Commonwealth Games]]; the [[Rugby Sevens at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|sevens tournament]] at [[2006 Commonwealth Games|the 2006 Games]] in Melbourne set all-time attendance records for a sevens tournament.

As a result of this, World Rugby applied to the [[International Olympic Committee]] for a Sevens tournament to form part of the Olympics. Subsequently, Sevens was accepted into the Summer Olympic Games and was first played in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.

==Laws and regulations==
The [[Rugby union#Laws|laws of rugby union]] are controlled by a standing Laws Committee, which is established by the World Rugby Council. The current chairman of the committee is [[Bill Beaumont]]. The Laws of the Game are formulated by World Rugby, and are then circulated by the national Unions. The official laws of the game are written in English, French, Russian and Spanish. There are variations for under-19 and Sevens rugby. There are 21 regulations in total, these regulations range from definitions, eligibility, advertising, disciplinary, anti-doping and a number of other areas. World Rugby also approves equipment, which are tested at an Approved Testing House.

===Experimental law variations===
{{Main article|Experimental law variations}}
In 2006, the IRB initiated proposals for variations to the laws, which were formulated and trialled initially at [[Stellenbosch University]] in South Africa. Further trials were set down for 2007 and 2008. The law variations aimed to push the balance between defensive and attacking play more in favour of attacking play, and to reduce stoppages for penalties and infringements.

==Anti-doping==
World Rugby is compliant with the [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]] code. The World Rugby anti doping programme includes testing at the under 19 and under 21 level, sevens and senior 15 a side. Testing is a mix of in-competition at World Rugby organised events, as well as out-of-competition testing, which can occur during a specified one-hour time slot designated by a player. In 2003, World Cup year, the World Rugby member unions undertook approximately 3,000 tests.&lt;ref name="antidoping"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=irb.com |title=IRB adopts WADA code |url=http://www.irb.com/EN/Education+and+Training/Anti+doping/Anti+doping+news/mig_antidoping_21.htm |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904114515/http://www.irb.com/EN/Education%2Band%2BTraining/Anti%2Bdoping/Anti%2Bdoping%2Bnews/mig_antidoping_21.htm |archivedate=4 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Keep Rugby Clean" is a campaign message run by the World Rugby Anti-Doping Manager Tim Ricketts.

==World rankings==
{{details|World Rugby Rankings}}
{{IRB World Rankings}}
World Rugby publishes and maintains the [[World Rugby Rankings]] of the men's national rugby union teams. The concept was launched in October 2003, at the start of [[2003 Rugby World Cup|that year's world cup]] in Australia. The rankings are calculated using a Points Exchange system, whereby nations take points off each other based on a match result. Several years of research went into developing the rankings system, using an extensive database of international matches that date back to 1871.

The system's reliability is assessed in a number of objective ways, which includes predictions of current strength and responds to changes in form. The system takes into account home advantage, in that the home nation is treated as though it has an extra three rating points, effectively handicapping them, as they will gain fewer ranking points for a win, and lose more should they lose. In the case of a freak result, there is a maximum number of movements on the ranking that any nation can gain from one match.

If a nation does not play for a number of years they are considered dormant, and excluded from the rankings, upon returning, picking up from where they were excluded. If a nation is to merge or split, the highest rating of any of the rankings is inherited.

Currently all capped international matches are equally weighted, whether or not they take place within a [[List of rugby union competitions#National tournaments|competition]] or are played as [[Test match (rugby union)|tests]]; the sole exception to this is the World Cup final tournament.

==Recognitions and awards==
The [[World Rugby Awards]] were introduced in 2001, to honour outstanding achievements in rugby union. Prior to 2009, all of the awards were announced at an annual ceremony; the most recent such ceremony was held in London on 23 November 2008.

However, as a response to the [[Great Recession]], the annual ceremony only saw the International Player, Team, and Coach of the Year Awards presented in 2009 and 2010; all other awards were presented at different times throughout the year. The IRB reinstated a single year-end ceremony in 2011 after the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2031536.html#new+irb+awards+presentation+format |title=New IRB Awards presentation format |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007215958/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2031536.html#new+irb+awards+presentation+format |archive-date=7 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has chosen to present some awards at times relevant to those specific prizes—such as Sevens awards after the [[London Sevens]], the final event of the Sevens World Series, and the Junior Player award after the final of the Junior World Championship. The bulk of awards will be presented at the year-end Awards ceremony.

The current awards are:
* [[IRB International Player of the Year|International Player of the Year]]
* [[IRB International Team of the Year|International Team of the Year]]
* [[IRB International Coach of the Year|International Coach of the Year]]
* [[IRB International Sevens Team of the Year|International Sevens Team of the Year]]
* [[IRB International Sevens Player of the Year|International Sevens Player of the Year]]
* [[IRB International Junior Player of the Year|International Junior Player of the Year]]
* [[IRB Women's Personality of the Year|Women's Personality of the Year]]
* [[IRB Referee Award for Distinguished Service]]
* [[Vernon Pugh Award for Distinguished Service]]
* [[IRB Development Award]]
* [[Spirit of Rugby Award]]

At the year-end ceremony, the International Rugby Players' Association also hands out the following awards:
* [[IRPA Try of the Year]]
* [[IRPA Special Merit Award]]

In the past, the following awards have also awarded:
* [[IRB International U21 Player of the Year]]
* [[IRB International U19 Player of the Year|IRB Under 19 Player of the Year]]
* [[IRB Chairman's Award]]

The awards that recognise achievements in the preceding 12 months tend to be won by that season's most successful nation(s): France in 2002, England in 2003, South Africa in 2004, New Zealand in 2005, South Africa again in 2007. For those award categories that have nominees, a shortlist is drawn up by an independent panel of judges, who are all former internationals. The panel then reconvenes to choose a winner. The current judges are [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]], [[Will Greenwood]], [[Gavin Hastings]], [[Michael Jones (rugby union)|Michael Jones]], [[Dan Lyle]], [[Federico Méndez]], [[Francois Pienaar]] and past Player of the Year winners [[Fabien Galthié]] and [[Keith Wood]], with [[John Eales]] as convenor. The judges have a total of over 500 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] between them.

In 2006 a [[World Rugby Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] was established to chronicle the achievements and special contribution of the sport's players, coaches, administrators, match officials, institutions and other individuals. The Hall of Fame was inaugurated at the 2006 IRB Awards, when [[William Webb Ellis]] and [[Rugby School]] were named as the first two inductees. Hall of Fame inductees in 2007 were [[Pierre de Coubertin]], [[Danie Craven]], [[John Eales]], [[Gareth Edwards]] and [[Wilson Whineray]]. The 2008 inductees were the [[1888–89 New Zealand Native football team]] and its organiser [[Joe Warbrick]], [[Jack Kyle]], [[Melrose RFC]] and [[Ned Haig]] (for their roles in the invention of rugby sevens), [[Hugo Porta]], and [[Philippe Sella]]. Since then, induction ceremonies have been held annually, except in 2010.

The last year for a single induction ceremony was 2009. Starting in 2011, ceremonies have been held at multiple locations around the world. Also, some or all of the inductions have had an overriding theme since 2009:
* 2009 – [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]] tours to [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]; all candidates for induction were either Lions or Springboks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2034071.html#nine+inductees+join+irb+hall+fame |title=Nine inductees to join IRB Hall of Fame |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=24 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026175640/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2034071.html#nine+inductees+join+irb+hall+fame |archive-date=26 October 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2011 – The year's final set of inductions, held at the IRB Awards in Auckland on the night after the [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final|2011 World Cup Final]], was, according to the IRB, "under the theme of Rugby World Cup founders, visionaries and iconic figures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/news/newsid=2057416.html#stars+glittering+finale+irb+awards |title=Stars set for glittering finale at IRB Awards |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106233154/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/news/newsid%3D2057416.html |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2012 – The IRB's theme for this year's inductions was ''Rugby - a global Game'', "celebrat[ing] Rugby’s expansion to become a global sport played by millions of men and women worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2062277.html#chilean+rugby+greats+added+hall+fame |title=Chilean Rugby greats added to IRB Hall of Fame |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529035906/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2062277.html#chilean+rugby+greats+added+hall+fame |archive-date=29 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
