      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5663">Recent research has looked into the effects of '''alcohol''' on the amount of '''cortisol''' that is produced in the human body. Continuous consumption of alcohol over an extended period of time has been shown to raise cortisol levels in the body. Cortisol is released during periods of high stress, and can result in the temporary shut down of other physical processes, causing physical damage to the body.

==Cortisol==
 
[[Cortisol]] is a stress hormone secreted by the [[adrenal gland]], which makes up part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [[HPA axis|(HPA) axis]]. It is typically released at periods of high stress designed to help the individual cope with stressful situations.&lt;ref name=pmid17349749&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.01.004 |title=Response of the HPA-axis to alcohol and stress as a function of alcohol dependence and family history of alcoholism |year=2007 |last1=Dai |first1=Xing |last2=Thavundayil |first2=Joseph |last3=Santella |first3=Sandra |last4=Gianoulakis |first4=Christina |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=293–305 |pmid=17349749}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortisol secretion results in increased heart rate and blood pressure and the temporary shut down of metabolic processes such as digestion, reproduction, growth, and immunity as a means of conserving energy for the stress response. Chronic release of cortisol over extended periods of time caused by long-term high stress can result in:    
* Fatigue
* Hypertension
* Ulcers
* Hampered growth
* Cancer
* Accelerated neural degeneration during aging
* Impaired immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2639 |title=Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition |year=2009 |last1=Lupien |first1=Sonia J. |last2=McEwen |first2=Bruce S. |last3=Gunnar |first3=Megan R. |last4=Heim |first4=Christine |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=434–45 |pmid=19401723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alcohol and cortisol interactions ==

High cortisol levels have largely been associated with high alcohol consumption, which is likely due to the disregulation (impaired inhibitory control) of the HPA axis.&lt;ref name=pmid17349749/&gt;

=== History ===
 
Research on alcohol’s effects on cortisol dates back to the 1950s. Many studies showed a relation between the two, however they were limited to short-term alcohol ingestion. The first human study to assess the long-term effects of alcohol ingestion on cortisol was conducted in 1966 (Mendelson et al.). They found heightened cortisol levels in both alcoholics and non-alcoholics while actively drinking. Cortisol was overall higher in alcoholics than non-alcoholics, indicating that alcohol has long-term effects on the endocrine system. Also, alcoholics had the highest cortisol levels after drinking stopped, demonstrating symptoms of withdrawal (a hormonal marker of alcohol addiction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jack |last1=Mendelson |first2=Stefan |last2=Stein |year=1966 |title=Serum Cortisol Levels in Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Subjects During Experimentally Induced Ethanol Intoxication |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=616–26 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/28/4/616.abstract |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent findings ===

Recent research supports this strong association between high alcohol use and heightened cortisol levels. In one study, overnight urinary cortisol levels were taken from people who regularly drank a large amount of alcohol versus a small amount of alcohol. People who drank more alcohol had higher cortisol levels and lower heart rate variability (which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, ANS), suggesting a connection between the HPA axis and the ANS. People who drank more alcohol had higher blood pressure and difficulty sleeping, indicative of heightened cortisol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2005.10.013 |title=Alcohol use, urinary cortisol, and heart rate variability in apparently healthy men: Evidence for impaired inhibitory control of the HPA axis in heavy drinkers |year=2006 |last1=Thayer |first1=Julian F. |last2=Hall |first2=Martica |last3=Sollers |first3=John J. |last4=Fischer |first4=Joachim E. |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=244–50 |pmid=16325293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology has allowed researchers to measure cortisol levels in human hair (showing cumulative cortisol exposure over extended periods of time). This method of measurement has been used to compare long-term cortisol levels in alcoholics, abstinent alcoholics, and non-alcoholics. One recent study revealed that alcoholics had three to four times higher hair cortisol concentrations than abstinent alcoholics or non-alcoholics (consistent with previous research showing periods of alcohol consumption are associated with heightened cortisol levels). Abstinent alcoholics and non-alcoholics had the same low levels of cortisol, suggesting that cortisol levels eventually return to normal after extended cessation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.08.005 |title=Use of hair cortisol analysis to detect hypercortisolism during active drinking phases in alcohol-dependent individuals |year=2010 |last1=Stalder |first1=Tobias |last2=Kirschbaum |first2=Clemens |last3=Heinze |first3=Kareen |last4=Steudte |first4=Susann |last5=Foley |first5=Paul |last6=Tietze |first6=Antje |last7=Dettenborn |first7=Lucia |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=357–60 |pmid=20727937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anovulation''' is when the ovaries do not release an [[oocyte]] during a [[menstrual cycle]]. Therefore, ovulation does not take place. However, a woman who does not ovulate at each menstrual cycle is not necessarily going through menopause. Chronic anovulation is a common cause of [[infertility]].

In addition to the alteration of menstrual periods and infertility, chronic anovulation can cause or exacerbate other long term problems, such as [[androgen|hyperandrogenism]] or [[osteopenia]]. It plays a central role in the multiple imbalances and dysfunctions of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].

During the first two years after [[menarche]] 50% of the menstrual cycles could be anovulatories.

It is in fact possible to restore ovulation using appropriate medication, and ovulation is successfully restored in approximately 90% of cases. The first step is the diagnosis of anovulation. The identification of anovulation is not easy; contrary to what is commonly believed, women undergoing anovulation still have (more or less) regular periods. In general, patients only notice that there is a problem once they have started trying to conceive.

Temperature charting is a useful way of providing early clues about anovulation, and can help gynaecologists in their diagnosis.

==Classification==
The [[World Health Organization]] criteria for classification of anovulation include the determination of [[oligomenorrhea]] (menstrual cycle &gt;35 days) or [[amenorrea]] (menstrual cycle &gt; 6 months) in combination with concentration of [[prolactin]], [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[estradiol]] (E2). The patients are classified as WHO1 (15%) - hypo-gonadotropic, hypo-estrogenic, WHO2 (80%) - normo-gonadotropic, normo-estrogenic, and WHO3 (5%) - hyper-gonadotropic, hypo-estrogenic. The vast majority of anovulation patients belong to the WHO2 group and demonstrate very heterogeneous symptoms ranging from anovulation, [[obesity]], biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism and [[insulin resistance]].&lt;ref name="FARIDDiamanti-Kandarakis2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=NADIR R. FARID|author2=Evanthia Diamanti-Kandarakis|title=Diagnosis and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgMYVxmPDnMC&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=26 March 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-09717-6|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Hormonal or chemical imbalance===
This is the most common cause of anovulation and is thought to account for about 70% of all cases. About half the women with hormonal imbalances do not produce enough follicles to ensure the development of an [[ovule]], possibly due to poor hormonal secretions from the [[pituitary gland]] or the [[hypothalamus]]. The [[pituitary gland]] controls most other hormonal glands in the human body. Therefore, any pituitary malfunctioning affects other glands under its influence, including the [[ovaries]]. This occurs in around 10% of cases. The [[mammary glands]] are also controlled by the pituitary gland, so [[lactation]] can also be affected. The [[pituitary gland]] is controlled by the [[hypothalamus]]. In 10% of cases, alterations in the chemical signals from the [[hypothalamus]] can easily seriously affect the [[ovaries]].

There are other hormonal anomalies with no direct link to the ones mentioned above that can affect [[ovulation]]. For instance, women with hyper or hypo-thyroidism sometimes have [[ovulation]] problems. [[Thyroid]] dysfunction can halt ovulation by upsetting the balance of the body’s natural reproductive hormones. [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] (also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome) and [[hyperprolactinemia]] can also cause anovulatory cycles through hormonal imbalances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Legro RS |title=A 27-year-old woman with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=5 |pages=509–519 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17284701 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.5.509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander NB, Cotanch PH |title=The endocrine basis of infertility in women |journal=Nurs. Clin. North Am. |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=511–24 |date=September 1980 |pmid=6777763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional problem===
This accounts for around 10-15% of all cases of anovulation. The [[ovaries]] can stop working in about 5% of cases. This may be because the ovaries do not contain eggs. However, a complete blockage of the ovaries is rarely a cause of [[infertility]]. Blocked ovaries can start functioning again without a clear medical explanation. In some cases, the egg may have matured properly, but the [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] may have failed to burst (or the follicle may have burst without releasing the egg).  This is called [[luteinised unruptured follicle syndrome]] (LUFS). Physical damage to the ovaries, or ovaries with multiple cysts, may affect their ability to function. This is called ovarian [[:wikt:dystrophy|dystrophy]]. Patients who are suffering from [[Stein-Leventhal syndrome]] (also referred to as polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS) can also suffer from anovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=Fertil.

Clin. Endocrinol.

Weight loss or [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] can also cause hormonal imbalance, leading to irregular ovulation (dysovulation). It is possible that this mechanism evolved to protect the mother’s health. A pregnancy where the mother is weak could pose a risk to the baby’s and mother’s health. On the other hand, excess weight can also create ovarian dysfunctions. Dr Barbieri of Harvard Medical School has indicated that cases of anovulation are quite frequent in women with a BMI ([[body mass index]]) over 27&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;kg&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbieri RL |title=The initial fertility consultation: recommendations concerning cigarette smoking, body mass index, and alcohol and caffeine consumption |journal=Am.

==Detection==

===Signs and symptoms===

Anovulation is usually associated with specific symptoms.  However, it is important to note that they are not necessarily all displayed simultaneously. [[Amenorrhea]] (absence of [[menstruation]]) occurs in about 20% of women with ovulatory dysfunction. Infrequent and light menstruation occurs in about 40% of women with ovulatory dysfunction. Another potential symptom is irregular menstruation, where five or more menstrual cycles a year are five or more days shorter or longer than the length of the average cycle. Absence of [[mastodynia]] (breast pain or tenderness) occurs in about 20% of women with ovulatory problems. Also possible is increased body mass and facial hair, which is relatively easy to treat, and is often associated with [[PCOS]], or polycystic ovary syndrome.

===Fertility awareness and LH measurement===

Symptoms-based methods of [[fertility awareness]] may be used to detect ovulation or to determine that cycles are anovulatory.  Charting of the menstrual cycle may be done by hand, or with the aid of various [[fertility monitors]].  Records of one of the primary fertility awareness signs—[[basal body temperature]]—can detect [[ovulation]] by identifying the shift in temperature which takes place after ovulation. It is said to be the most reliable way of confirming whether ovulation has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freundl G |author2=Godehardt E |author3=Kern PA |author4=Frank-Herrmann P |author5=Koubenec HJ |author6=Gnoth Ch |title=Estimated maximum failure rates of cycle monitors using daily conception probabilities in the menstrual cycle |journal=Hum. Reprod. |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=2628–2633 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14645183 |doi= 10.1093/humrep/deg488|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14645183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women may also use ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) which detect the increase in [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) levels that usually indicates imminent ovulation. For some women, these devices do not detect the LH surge, or high levels of LH are a poor predictor of ovulation; this is particularly common in women with PCOS. In such cases, OPKs and those fertility monitors which are based on LH may show false results, with an increased number of [[Type I and type II errors|false positives or false negatives]]. Dr Freundl from the University of Heidelberg suggests that tests which use LH as a reference often lack sensitivity and specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freundl G, Bremme M, Frank-Herrmann P, Baur S, Godehardt E, Sottong U |title=The CUE Fertility Monitor compared to ultrasound and LH peak measurements for fertile time ovulation detection |journal=Adv Contracept |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=111–121 |date=June 1996 |pmid=8863906 |doi=10.1007/BF01849632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==
The treatment of anovulation is termed [[ovulation induction]] and is usually quite efficient. The main treatments are clomifene citrate and gonadotropins.

===Clomifene citrate===&lt;!--Clomifene links to here--&gt;
[[Clomifene citrate]] (or clomid) is the medication which is most commonly used to treat anovulation. It is a [[selective estrogen-receptor modulator]], affecting the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]] to respond as if there was an estrogen deficit in the body, in effect increasing the production of gonadotrophins. It is relatively easy and convenient to use.&lt;ref name="lord"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lord JM, Flight IH, Norman RJ |title=Metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7421 |pages=951–0 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14576245 |pmc=259161 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7421.951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clomifene appears to inhibit [[estrogen receptor]]s in [[hypothalamus]], thereby inhibiting [[negative feedback]] of estrogen on [[gonadotrophin]] production.&lt;ref name=drugbank&gt;[http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00882 DrugBank &gt; Clomifene]. Updated on April 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It may also result in direct stimulation of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary axis]].&lt;ref name=drugbank/&gt; It also has an effect on [[cervical mucus]] quality and uterine mucosa, which might affect [[sperm]] penetration and survival, hence its early administration during the [[menstrual cycle]]. Clomifene citrate is a very efficient ovulation inductor, and has a success rate of 67%. Nevertheless, it only has a 37% success rate in inducing pregnancy. This difference may be due to the anti-estrogenic effect which clomifene citrate has on the [[endometrium]], [[cervical mucus]], uterine blood flow, as well as the resulting decrease in the motility of the [[fallopian tubes]] and the maturation of the [[oocytes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kousta E, White DM, Franks S |title=Modern use of clomiphene citrate in induction of ovulation |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=359–365 |year=1997 |pmid=9459281 |doi= 10.1093/humupd/3.4.359|url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9459281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard dosage for first-time takers is 50 or 100&amp;nbsp;mg of clomifene per day for five consecutive days, starting early in the menstrual cycle, usually on the third to fifth day counting from the beginning of the menstrual period. In case of [[amenorrhea]], a period can be induced by intake of an oral [[progestin]] for 10 days. In absence of success, the dosage can be increased in subsequent cycles with increments of 50&amp;nbsp;mg. However, at a dosage of 200&amp;nbsp;mg, further increments are unlikely to increase pregnancy chances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asrm.org/Medications_for_Inducing_Ovulation/ Medications for Inducing Ovulation] from [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]]. Revised 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letrozole===
[[Letrozole]] has been used for [[Ovulation induction|ovarian stimulation]] by fertility doctors since 2001 because it has fewer side-effects than [[clomiphene]] and less chance of multiple gestation. A study of 150 babies following treatment with letrozole or letrozole and gonadotropins presented at the [[American Society of Reproductive Medicine]] 2005 Conference found no difference in overall abnormalities but did find a significantly higher rate of locomotor and cardiac abnormalities among the group having taken letrozole compared to natural conception.&lt;ref name="biljan2005"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.07.230 | title=The Outcome of 150 Babies Following the Treatment With Letrozole or Letrozole and Gonadotropins | vauthors=Biljan MM, Hemmings R, Brassard N | year=2005 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.07.230 | volume=84 | journal=Fertility and Sterility | page=S95}}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger, follow-up study with 911 babies compared those born following treatment with letrozole to those born following treatment with clomiphene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16650422 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.03.014 | volume=85 | issue=6 |date=June 2006 | pages=1761–5  |vauthors=Tulandi T, Martin J, Al-Fadhli R, etal | title = Congenital malformations among 911 newborns conceived after infertility treatment with letrozole or clomiphene citrate | journal = Fertility and Sterility}}&lt;/ref&gt; That study also found no significant difference in the rate of overall abnormalities, but found that congenital cardiac anomalies was significantly higher in the clomiphene group compared to the letrozole group. Despite this, India banned the usage of letrozole in 2011, citing potential risks to infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-18/india/30296687_1_letrozole-breast-cancer-post-menopausal-women|title=Finally, expert panel bans fertility drug Letrozole|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=The Times of India|first=Kounteya|last=Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, an Indian parliamentary committee said that the drug controller office colluded with letrozole's makers to approve the drug for infertility in India and also stated that letrozole's use for infertility was illegal worldwide;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-09/india/31641343_1_letrozole-anti-cancer-drug-infertility |title=House panel to govt: Punish those guilty of approving Letrozole |newspaper=The Times of India |date=10 April 2007 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, such [[off-label use]]s are legal in many countries such as the US and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen DT, Wynia MK, Moloney RM, Alexander GC | year = 2009 | title = Physician knowledge of the FDA-approved indications of commonly prescribed drugs: results of a national survey | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122544649/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 | journal = Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety | volume = 18 | issue = 11| pages = 1–7 | pmid = 19697444 | doi = 10.1002/pds.1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/current/library/prescriptions_faqs.asp#5d |title=GMC &amp;#124; Good practice in prescribing medicines&amp;nbsp;– guidance for doctors |publisher=Gmc-uk.org |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=21 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219225153/http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/current/library/prescriptions_faqs.asp#5d |archivedate=19 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gonadotropins===
[[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) is a molecule which is structurally similar to [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH).  LH is secreted by the [[pituitary]] just before ovulation occurs, whereas hCG is released during pregnancy. On its own, hCG is not very effective in inducing ovulation, but when combined with clomifene citrate, it is much more effective. The results associated with this method have been described as "quite encouraging".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nugent D, Vandekerckhove P, Hughes E, Arnot M, Lilford R |title=Gonadotrophin therapy for ovulation induction in subfertility associated with polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD000410 |year=2000 |pmid=11034687 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000410 |url= |editor1-last=Nugent |editor1-first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCG should only be administered at certain points in the cycle, around the time of ovulation, and only if the infertility diagnostic has indicated that the problem is related to the release of the egg.

[[Human menopausal gonadotropin]] (hMG) is a very powerful treatment for [[infertility]]. It consists of a combination of LH and FSH. From menopause onwards, the body starts secreting LH and FSH in large quantities due to the slowing down of the ovarian function. This excess of hormones is not used by the body and is expelled in the urine. HMG is therefore collected from the urine of menopausal women.  The urine then undergoes purification and a chemical treatment. The resulting hMG induces the stimulation of several [[ovarian follicle]]s. This increases the risk of producing several [[oocytes]] during the same cycle, and thus the risk of multiple pregnancies.

[[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH or recombinant FSH) is now used as a replacement for hMG. Although hMG is a combination of FSH and LH, FSH is the only active component that has an effect on ovulation. However, until recently, it was not possible to produce pure FSH. FSH is now administered in a similar way as hMG, at a specific point during the cycle, and it requires medical monitoring. It is therefore important to fully understand a woman’s cycle, and to be able to accurately anticipate menstruation and ovulation dates.  FSH is also sometimes useful for women who are suffering from PCOS.

===Other treatments in anovulation===
The [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) pump is used to release doses of GnRH in a pulsatile fashion. This hormone is synthesised by the [[hypothalamus]] and induces the secretion of LH and FSH by the pituitary. GnRH must be delivered in a pulsatile fashion to imitate the random secretion of the hypothalamus in order to fool the pituitary into secreting LH and FSH. The GnRH pump is the size of a cigarette box and has a small catheter. Unlike other treatments, using the GnRH pump doesn’t usually lead to multiple pregnancies. Filicori from the University of Bologna suggests that this might be because gonadotrophins are absent when the treatment is initiated, and therefore the hormones released by the pituitary (LH and FSH) can still take part in the [[retro-control]] of gonadotrophin secretion, mimicking the natural cycle.&lt;ref name="filicori" /&gt; This treatment can also be used for underweight and/or [[anorexic]] patients;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Braat DD, Schoemaker R, Schoemaker J |title=Life table analysis of fecundity in intravenously gonadotropin-releasing hormone-treated patients with normogonadotropic and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=266–71 |date=February 1991 |pmid=1991525}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been used in certain cases of hyperprolactimenia.

[[Tamoxifen]] affects estrogen receptors in a similar fashion as clomifene citrate. It is often used in the prevention and treatment of [[breast cancer]]. It can therefore also be used to treat patients that have a reaction to clomifene citrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boostanfar R, Jain JK, Mishell DR, Paulson RJ |title=A prospective randomized trial comparing clomiphene citrate with tamoxifen citrate for ovulation induction |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=1024–1026 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11334921 |doi= 10.1016/S0015-0282(01)01749-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015-0282(01)01749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromocriptine acts in a completely different manner to the other treatments mentioned above. It does not induce ovulation, but reduces the production of [[prolactin]] by the pituitary.&lt;ref name="palomba2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palomba S |title=Metformin administration versus laparoscopic ovarian diathermy in clomiphene citrate-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a prospective parallel randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial |journal=J.

[[Corticosteroids]] (usually found in anti-inflammatory drugs) can be used to treat anovulation if it is caused by an overproduction of [[male hormones]] by the [[adrenal glands]]. Corticosteroids are usually used to reduce the production of [[testosterone]].

Several studies indicate that in some cases, a simple ''change in lifestyle'' could help patients suffering from anovulation.  Consulting a nutritionist, for example, could help a young woman suffering from anorexia to put on some weight, which might restart her [[menstrual cycle]]. Conversely, a young overweight woman who manages to lose weight could also relieve the problem of anovulation (losing just 5% of body mass could be enough to restart ovulation). However, it is widely acknowledged by doctors that it is usually very difficult for PCOS patients to lose weight.

Previously, [[metformin]] was recommended as treatment for [[anovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome]], but in the largest trial to date, comparing clomiphene with metformin, clomiphene was more effective than metformin alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Legro RS, Barnhart HX, Schlaff WD |title=Clomiphene, Metformin, or Both for Infertility in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=356 |issue=6 |pages=551–566 |year=2007 |pmid=17287476 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa063971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this study, the ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored Consensus workshop do not recommend metformin for ovulation stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid18243179"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group |title=Consensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=Fertil.

===Prevention of multiple pregnancy===
The [[European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology]] (ESHRE) notes that the aim of ovulation induction should be mono-ovulation and not over-stimulation of the ovaries {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. The risks associated with [[multiple pregnancy]] are much higher than singleton pregnancy; incidences of perinatal death are seven times higher in triplet births and five times higher in twin births than the risks associated with a singleton pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bergh T, Ericson A, Hillensjö T, Nygren KG, Wennerholm UB |title=Deliveries and children born after in-vitro fertilisation in Sweden 1982-95: a retrospective cohort study |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9190 |pages=1579–1585 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10560671 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04345-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisk NM, Trew G |title=Two's company, three's a crowd for embryo transfer |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9190 |pages=1572–1573 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10560665 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00290-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important to adapt the treatment to each individual patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mono-ovulatory cycles: a key goal in profertility programmes |journal=Hum.

Women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] may be particularly at risk. Multiple pregnancy occurs in approximately 15-20% of cases following cycles induced with gonadotrophins such as hMG and FSH induced ovulations.&lt;ref name=hkcog2003&gt;[http://hkcog.obg.cuhk.edu.hk/docs/college_guidelines/Use_of_Gonadotrophins_Revised_2003.txt Hong Kong College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists &gt; Guidelines for use of gonadotrophins- revised] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909004107/http://hkcog.obg.cuhk.edu.hk/docs/college_guidelines/Use_of_Gonadotrophins_Revised_2003.txt |date=September 9, 2012 }}. Number 1. April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

During ovulation induction, it is recommended to start at a low dose and [[monitoring (medicine)|monitor]] the ovarian response with [[obstetric ultrasonography|vaginal ultrasound]], including discernment of the number of developing follicles. A cycle with supernumerary follicles is usually defined as one where there are more than two follicles &gt;16&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name=hkcog2003/&gt; It is generally recommended to have such cycles cancelled because of the risk of multiple pregnancy.&lt;ref name=hkcog2003/&gt; In cancelled cycles, the woman or couple should be warned of the risks in case of supernumerary follicles, and should avoid sexual intercourse or use contraception until the next menstruation.&lt;ref name=hkcog2003/&gt; [[Induction of final maturation]] (such as done with hCG) may need to be withheld because of increased risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]](OHSS).&lt;ref name=hkcog2003/&gt; The starting dose of the inducing drug should be reduced in the next cycle.&lt;ref name=hkcog2003/&gt;

Alternatives to cancelling a cycle are mainly:

==Associated conditions==
For most women, alteration of [[menstrual cycle|menstrual periods]] is the principal indication of chronic anovulation. Ovulatory menstrual periods tend to be regular and predictable in terms of cycle length, duration and heaviness of bleeding, and other symptoms. Ovulatory periods are often accompanied by midcycle symptoms such as [[mittelschmerz]] or premenstrual symptoms. In contrast, anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods ([[amenorrhea#Secondary amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]) or excessive bleeding ([[dysfunctional uterine bleeding]]). [[Mittelschmerz]] and premenstrual symptoms tend to be absent or reduced when a woman is anovulatory.

'''Avalon University School of Medicine''' ('''AUSOM''') (previously '''Xavier University School of Medicine''' in [[Bonaire]]) is a [[private university|private]] [[medical school]] located in [[Willemstad]], [[Curaçao]], in the [[Caribbean]]. AUSOM confers upon its graduates the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) degree. Administrative offices for the university are located in [[Youngstown]], [[Ohio]].

==History==
AUSOM was founded in 2003 in Bonaire in the [[Netherlands Antilles]] (now known as the [[Caribbean Netherlands]]) as the Xavier University School of Medicine. In 2010, the university relocated to Curacao and changed its name to Avalon University School of Medicine to differentiate itself from [[Xavier University School of Medicine|another university with the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Xavier University School of Medicine Bonaire Announces Name Change and Relocation | url = http://www.prlog.org/10745937-xavier-university-school-of-medicine-bonaire-announces-name-change-and-relocation.html | accessdate = 2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
The curriculum for the Doctor of Medicine degree spans four years. First- and second-year students study basic science courses on the Curacao campus. Third-year students attend an 8-week course at the admissions office in Youngstown, Ohio for orientation in clinical studies, preparation for  the [[USMLE Step 1]] examination and an overview of US residency application. Students who pass the USMLE exam spend the final 18 months in [[medical clerkship|clinical clerkships]] in the United States, including 24 weeks of elective clerkships for fourth-year students.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Accreditation==
Avalon University School of Medicine states that it is chartered by the Ministry of Education of Curacao to offer an MD degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.avalonu.org/accreditation.html | title=Accreditation | work=avalonu.org | accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUSOM is listed in the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research|FAIMER]] [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://imed.faimer.org/details.asp?country=&amp;school=avalon&amp;currpage=1&amp;cname=&amp;city=&amp;region=&amp;rname=&amp;mcode=665050&amp;psize=25 | title=School Details | work= International Medical Education Directory | publisher=Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research | accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Avicenna Directories#AVICENNA Directory for medicine|AVICENNA Directory for medicine]].&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web | title = Avalon University School of Medicine: Curacao | work=AVICENNA Directory for Medicine | publisher=University of Copenhagen | url = https://search.wdoms.org/home/SchoolDetail/F0000591 | date=24 March 2011 | accessdate = 2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUSOM has also submitted a request for accreditation by the [[Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions]]. As of August 7, 2015, Avalon University School of Medicine is NOT accredited by the CAAM-HP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caam-hp.org/sitevisit.html | title=Upcoming Site Visits and Accreditation Requests... | work=caam-hp.org | publisher=Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions | date=July 20, 2011 | accessdate=2011-08-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725115414/http://www.caam-hp.org/sitevisit.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartholin gland carcinoma''' is an uncommon type of [[malignancy]] in the [[Bartholin gland]] that accounts for 1% of all [[vulva cancer|vulvar malignant neoplasms]].  It is most common in women in their mid-60s. The [[tumor]] can become large before a woman is aware of [[symptom]]s. One of the first symptoms can be [[dyspareunia]]. In other instances a woman may find a mass or [[ulcer]] in the vulva area. Many clinicians assume that an enlarged Bartholin gland is malignant in postmenopausal woman until proven otherwise. The growth of the tumor can spread to nearby areas such as the [[ischiorectal fossa]] and [[inguinal lymph nodes]]. Approximately 50% of bartholin gland carcinomas originate from [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s. Another uncommon characteristic of Bartholin gland malignancies is that the growth of a lesion originates from the three types of epithelial tissue present in the gland: [[mucinous]], [[Transitional epithelium|transitional]], and [[squamous]].&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"/&gt;
&lt;!--Classification: If relevant. May also be placed as a subheading of diagnosis--&gt;
&lt;!--Signs and symptoms or Characteristics--&gt;
&lt;!--Causes: Includes Risk factors, triggers, Genetics or genome, Virology (e.g., structure/morphology and replication).--&gt;
&lt;!--Mechanism: For information about pathogenesis and pathophysiology.--&gt;

&lt;!--Prevention or Screening (if the section only discusses secondary prevention it should follow the treatment section)--&gt;
&lt;!--Treatment --&gt;

==Cause==
{{Empty section|date=February 2018}}
==Diagnosis==
Bartholin gland can be differentiated by histology to determine whether the malignancy is due to squamous cell carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, or adenocarcinomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Donato|first=Violante|last2=Casorelli|first2=Assunta|last3=Bardhi|first3=Erlisa|last4=Vena|first4=Flaminia|last5=Marchetti|first5=Claudia|last6=Muzii|first6=Ludovico|last7=Panici|first7=Pierluigi Benedetti|title=Bartholin gland cancer|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1040842816302645|journal=Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology|volume=117|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2017.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Management==
Though Bartholin gland carcinoma is rare, along with other unusual Bartholin gland growths, it many not be the typical practice for clinicians to consider lesions malignant. Early diagnosis can help to prevent the cancer from the glands to surrounding. Though malignancies of the Bartholin gland are rare clinicians biopsy Bartholin gland lesions in older women or when the growth reoccurs or does not respond to original treatment.&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heller|first1=Debra S.|last2=Bean|first2=Sarah|title=Lesions of the Bartholin Gland|journal=Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease|volume=18|issue=4|year=2014|pages=351–357|issn=1089-2591|doi=10.1097/LGT.0000000000000016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--PMID unavailable  --&gt;

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is optimistic as long as the growth has not metastasized to the lymph nodes.&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"/&gt;
&lt;!--Epidemiology: factors such as incidence, prevalence, age distribution, and sex ratio.--&gt;

==History==
Bartholin glands were described in cattle by Casper Barthlin in 1677. Their existence in humans was postulated at that time.&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"/&gt; 
&lt;!--Society and culture: This might include social perceptions, cultural history, stigma, economics, religious aspects, awareness, legal issues, notable cases--&gt;
&lt;!--Research directions: Include only if addressed by significant sources.--&gt;
&lt;!--Special populations, such as Geriatrics or Pregnancy or Pediatrics--&gt;
&lt;!--Other animals--&gt;
Treatment can be a [[vulvectomy]] that results in the removal of the growth along with an extensive removal of adjacent tissue. An inguinal lymphadenectomy often accompanies the vulvectomy. The tissue that is removed sometimes includes sections of the [[vagina]] and [[rectum]].&lt;ref name="Phillip Saia 2012"&gt;Clinical gynecologic oncology, Phillip Saia, editor.

The [[Adenoid cystic carcinoma]] of the Bartholin gland is another uncommon malignancy with symptoms that include local painful intermittent recurrences. The disease is slow to progress but it can result in lung cancer after a long time after the initial treatment. Treatment consists of surgical removal of the growth. Sometimes radiation and chemotherapy is performed.&lt;ref name="Phillip Saia 2012"/&gt;

'''Choluria''' is the presence of [[bile]] in urine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/choluria "Choluria"]&lt;/ref&gt; Choluria is a common symptom of liver diseases, such as [[hepatitis]] and [[cirrhosis]]. It can be described as dark or brown urine, often referred to as the color of Coca-Cola. Choluria is usually manifested when serum bilirubin is higher than 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.
The presence of choluria is a useful symptom to distinguish if somebody presenting with [[jaundice]] has liver disease (direct hyperbilirubinemia) or [[hemolysis]] (indirect hyperbilirubinemia). In the first case, patients have choluria due to excess conjugated ("direct") [[bilirubin]] in blood, which is eliminated by kidneys. Hemolysis, on the contrary, is characterized by unconjugated ("indirect") bilirubin which is bound to [[albumin]] and thus not eliminated in urine.

{{Disability}}
'''Disability culture''' is a widely used concept developed in the late 1980s to capture differences in lifestyle that are caused or promoted by disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Vasey, Sian |title=Disability culture: it's a way of life |journal= Feminist Arts News |volume=2 |issue=10 |year=1989 |url=http://imagina.org/archivos/archivos_vi/Disability%20Culture_it%27s%20a%20Way%20of%20Life%20By%20Sian%20Vasey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disability cultures exist as communities of people around topics of disability. The cultures include [[Disability in the arts|arts movements]], coalitions, and include but are not limited to: poetry, [[Physically integrated dance|dance]], performance pieces, installments, and sculptures.  Steven Brown, in an academic study, wrote, "The existence of a disability culture is a relatively new and contested idea. Not surprising, perhaps, for a group that has long been described with terms like 'in-valid', 'impaired', 'limited', 'crippled', and so forth. Scholars would be hard-pressed to discover terms of hope, endearment or ability associated with people with disabilities."&lt;ref name=quote&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Steven|title=Investigating a Culture of Disability Final Report|url=http://library.ncrtm.org/pdf/J230.0002.01.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113220844/http://library.ncrtm.org/pdf/J230.0002.01.pdf|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability culture cannot be defined by one specific description or language. It is a complex blending of art, performance, expression, and community. Within this culture, the word "disabled" has been re-purposed to represent a social identity of empowerment and awareness. Like many civil rights movements in the past, disability culture challenges the norms of society, and seeks to counter oppressive entities such as medicalization and institutionalization. Its core values as a culture are reflected in art, conversation, goals, or behaviors. These core values often include: "an acceptance of human differences, an acceptance of human vulnerability and interdependence, a tolerance for a lack of resolution of the unpredictable in life, and a humor to laugh at the oppressor or situation, however dire it may be".&lt;ref name="Gill 1995 1–4 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=Carol|title=A Psychological View of Disability Culture|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|year=1995|issue=Fall Issue|pages=1–4 [3]|url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs3/gill1995.html|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The elements of our culture include, certainly, our longstanding social oppression, but also our emerging art and humor, our piecing together of our history, our evolving language and symbols, our remarkably unified world view, beliefs and values, and our strategies for surviving and thriving." -Carol Gill Ph.D.&lt;ref name="Gill 1995 1–4 3"/&gt;

Disability culture is a trajectory, a movement, a path, rather than a destination: "Disability culture is the difference between being alone, isolated, and individuated with a physical, cognitive, emotional or sensory difference that in our society invites discrimination and reinforces that isolation – the difference between all that and being in community. Naming oneself part of a larger group, a social movement or a subject position in modernity can help to focus energy, and to understand that solidarity can be found – precariously, in improvisation, always on the verge of collapse." - [[Petra Kuppers]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuppers|first=Petra|title=Disability Culture and Community Performance: Find a Strange and Twisted Shape|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave|location=Houndmills and New York|isbn=978-0-230-29827-9|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=504063|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Disability culture, which values interdependence over the illusion of independence, privileges not a uniform perspective but the validity and value of a wide range of ways of moving through the world - and the varied perspectives those different experiences engender." - Jim Ferris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferris|first1=Jim|chapter=Keeping the Knives Sharp|editor1-last=Bartlett|editor1-first=Jennifer|editor2-last=Black|editor2-first=Shiela|editor3-last=Northen|editor3-first=Michael|title=Beauty is a verb : the new poetry of disability|date=2011|publisher=Cinco Puntos Press|location=El Paso, TX|isbn=978-1935955054|page=91|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disabled people are one of the most marginalised, excluded and poorest groups in Zimbabwean society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adry.up.ac.za/index.php/2014-2-section-b-country-reports/zimbabwe|title=Zimbabwe|last=User|first=Super|website=www.adry.up.ac.za|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities in Zimbabwe are treated as [[Second-class citizen|second-class citizens]].&lt;ref name=Rugoho/&gt;{{rp|page=2}} It is estimated about 900 000–1.4 million people have some sort of disability in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is a State Party to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) and the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (UNCRPD).

== Demographics ==
{{see also|Demographics of Zimbabwe}}
It is estimated that disability in Zimbabwe is 7% out of the total population which prevails in Zimbabwe. Disability exists in Zimbabwe mainly due to diseases,war conflicts,malnutrition,accidents,abnormal births,hereditary characteristics etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/zimbabwe/the-herald-zimbabwe/20170517/281732679415448|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large population of individuals with disabilities are children and young people. About 53% of people living with disability population in [[Zimbabwe]] became disabled before the age of 20 years. Around 27% of disability with population from the birth while 9% disability exists between the ages limit of 1–5.

The disability population of males is estimated approximately about 56% while the disability population of women is around 44% as of 2013.

About 600 000 children live with disabilities in Zimbabwe according to the Department of International Development Zimbabwe as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.co.zw/2016/10/22/disabled-persons-discrimination-remedies/|title=Disabled persons — discrimination, remedies|date=2016-10-22|website=NewsDay Zimbabwe|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voazimbabwe.com/amp/unicef-children-with-disabilities-facing-challenges/1680208.html|title=UNICEF: Disabled Zimbabwe Children Face Serious Challenges|website=www.voazimbabwe.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:Shepherd_and_his_bird_in_Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|Shepherd and his bird in Zimbabwe]]
Around 52% of the disabled children in Zimbabwe have no access to education although Zimbabwe having a record of 93% literacy rate among its school-going children, which is also the best in the African continent.
On the other hand,it was evident that about 34% of disabled women didn't attend the school while 22% of disabled men didn't attend the school.

In Zimbabwe,children with disabilities live under especially difficult,challengeable circumstances and are vulnerable as they live with negative attitudes,beliefs,customs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/new-constitution-disability-friendly/|title=New Constitution disability friendly {{!}} The Chronicle|website=www.chronicle.co.zw|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment ==
According to statistics, around 83% of women have been unemployed who have disabilities while about 74% of disabled men population have been unemployed.

It is a common perception within Zimbabwe that disabled people are passive,inactive,economically inactive and unproductive and therefore constitute a "burden" upon the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.weekendpost.co.zw/articles/2015/03/20/900-000-live-with-disability|title=900 000 live with disability|work=Weekend Post|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
Zimbabwe was one of the first countries in the world to enact disability discrimination legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://herzimbabwe.co.zw/2015/06/being-a-zimbabwean-woman-with-a-disability/|title=Being a Zimbabwean Woman with a Disability {{!}} Her Zimbabwe|date=2015-06-09|work=Her Zimbabwe|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.herald.co.zw/spare-a-thought-for-the-disabled/|title=Spare a thought for the disabled {{!}} The Herald|website=www.herald.co.zw|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe ratified the CRPD and its Optional Protocol on 23 September 2013, thereby becoming the 135th state party to ratify the Convention and its protocol.Zimbabwe is the State Party to the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] and to the [[Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Disabled Persons Act is the primary law that addresses disability in Zimbabwe.This act provides for welfare and rehabilitation of PWDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/journals/ADRY/2014/14.html|title=Zimbabwe (Country Reports) [2014] ADRY 14|website=www.saflii.org|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental health provides for the consolation and amendment of the law relating to the care, detention and aftercare of persons with mental disabilities for the purpose of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mugumbate|first=Jacob|title=Disability in Zimbabwe under the New Constitution: Demands and Gains of People with Disabilities|url=https://www.academia.edu/7762774/Disability_in_Zimbabwe_under_the_New_Constitution_Demands_and_Gainsof_People_with_Disabilities|journal=Southern Peace Review Journal (Special Issue in association with OSSREA Zimbabwe Chapter)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health care challenges ==
Many disabled individuals are unable to access health care due to the limited number of clinics and the distances they need to travel in order to get to a doctor. Some [[public transport]] providers force [[wheelchair]] users to pay extra to ride.&lt;ref name=Rugoho&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rugoho|first1=Tafadzwa|last2=Maphosa|first2=France|title=Challenges faced by women with disabilities in accessing sexual and reproductive health in Zimbabwe: The case of Chitungwiza town|journal=African Journal of Disability|date=31 January 2017|volume=6|doi=10.4102/ajod.v6i0.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=4–5}}

== Advocacy ==
There are a few organisations in Zimbabwe which represent and advocate for disabled people. They are

Zimbabwe has been competing at the [[Paralympic Games]] since independence in 1980; it had previously competed as [[Rhodesia]] at the 1972 Summer Paralympics. Zimbabwe was absent from the Games in 1988 and 1992, returning in 1996 with a two-man delegation, and has competed at every edition of the [[Summer Paralympics]] since then. It has never entered the [[Winter Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=ZIM&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Zimbabwe at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disaster social work''' is the practice of [[social work]] during natural disasters. This field specializes in strengthening individuals and communities in the wake of a natural disaster. It includes working with the most vulnerable members of a community while strengthening the community as a whole in order to help with the recovery process.

For a disaster to be classified as natural, it must be caused by a force of nature and result in great damage or loss of life. Examples of natural disasters are floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunami, avalanches, and tornadoes.

== Targets of Social Work ==
According to the [[American Red Cross]], “Across the duration of a [[disaster]], four stages have been identified that provide chronological targets for social work responses:

(1) Pre-impact, beginning when a disaster poses no immediate threat but prompts mitigation and preparedness activities

(2) Impact, or the period when the disaster event takes place

(3) Post-impact, or the period immediately after the impact up to the beginning of recovery

(4) Recovery, or the period in which disaster survivors are working toward restoration of their pre-disaster state.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disasters|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/events/911/disasters.asp|publisher=National Association of Social Workers|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four stages are the main targets social workers want to address when dealing with a natural disaster. These targets aim to help with the recovery process.

== Practice ==
In the context of disasters, social work should be a process that includes helping the emotionally and physically wounded while strengthening local communities. It is important to focus on development issues in addition to the disaster. [[Community organizing|Community organizers]] should be supportive facilitators helping the community members return to their lives before the trauma. Along with psychological help, social workers aim to help the public regain structure to their homes. Rather than taking over the process, their objective is to help the community accomplish these goals on their own. The idea behind this is that community members should be the ones to restore their lives in order to heal psychologically and come to terms with the disaster that has occurred. Social workers must also have knowledge of the systems and institutions in the community in order to work within and against them as necessary. [[File:AmeriCorpsredcrosscpr2008cedarrapidsiowa.jpg|thumbnail|AmeriCorps NCCC members, including three social workers, learn CPR]]

In addition to these [[community organizing]] skills, social workers should also incorporate [[Clinical social work|clinical]] and research skills. These skills should include the ability to assess emergent community needs, so that they can quickly assess the [[public health]] needs of individual community members immediately following a disaster, and make a plan accordingly.  These kinds of assessments help social workers plan and organize their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyles|first1=L.|title=Community organizing for post-disaster social development: Locating social work|journal=International Social Work|date=2008|volume=50|issue=30|pages=321–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Redcrossemergencydrillmarquettemi2012.jpg|thumbnail|Volunteers attend a community emergency drill in Marquette, MI.]]Social workers also need to formulate their approaches in a way that increases the [[Self-determination theory|self-determination]] of disaster survivors. Disaster survivors are in a vulnerable position, so it is important for social workers to ensure the survivors can maintain agency over their lives and not become disempowered by the expertise of the social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soliman|first1=H.H.|last2=Rogge|first2=M.E.|title=Ethical considerations in disaster services: a social work perspective|journal=Electronic Journal of Social Work|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being prepared for disasters is yet another important role for social workers. They are there to help lessen the harmful effects of disasters. All communities should be prepared for natural disasters because nobody is immune to them. Social workers can help communities be prepared by emphasizing community collaboration and coordination of social networks to make a comprehensive plan before a disaster strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathbor|first1=G.M.|title=Enhancement of community preparedness for national disasters: The role of social work in building social capital for sustainable disaster relief and management|journal=International Social Work|date=2007|pages=357–369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==
Across the board, the policies and national governmental bodies responsible for disaster management have been regarded as “unclear, poorly explained, too rigid, and required a high level of middle-class financial management skills to comply with eligibility requirements.”

An emergency system in need of significant improvement risks the vital emergency needs in a community.Any areas in need of improvement result in delays in emergency services at the most critical time of need.

Even the best efforts and intentions of organizations may still pose ethical questions if the processes and services do not adequately translate into the desired outcome of adequately responding to survivors’ needs under disaster conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soliman|first1=H.H.|last2=Rogge|first2=M.E.|title=Ethical considerations in disaster services: A social work perspective.|journal=Electronic Journal of Social Work|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethically, social work professionals are held to the standards of the [http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp NASW Code of Ethics].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASW Code of Ethics|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/default.asp|publisher=National Association of Social Workers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This code outlines that a social worker has an ethical responsibility to serve the broader society: “Social workers should provide appropriate professional services in public emergencies to the greatest extent possible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6.04 Public Emergencies section|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|website=NASW Code of Ethics|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great difficulty working under emergency or disaster conditions, which highlights the need to continually work to expand and explore ways the system needs improving.

== Qualifications ==
Social workers are trained to provide services, navigate social systems, create necessary programs, and connect at-risk individuals with resources. They must work with all people regardless of their demographic characteristics and be committed to serving the most vulnerable members of communities. Social workers' skills in navigating complex systems of care for their clients makes the [[Social work|social work profession]] uniquely qualified to work with communities. Their skills are invaluable in ensuring the health of the community and individuals post natural disasters.

'''Eleazer Parmly''' (March 13, 1797 – December 13, 1874) was an American [[dentist]] in New York City during the early 1800s. He was the first Provost of The [[University of Maryland School of Dentistry]], a first dental school established in the [[United States]]. He was the third of five brothers and his three brothers also pursued careers in dentistry.

==Education and career==
Parmly was born in 1797, in [[Braintree, Vermont]]. At the age of 23, Parmly moved to [[London]] to work as a dentist. In 1823, he moved back to the United States to practice in New York City, where he opened a dental shop on Bond Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Linda|title=Dr Eleazar Parmly|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/64537321|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was responsible for the development of American [[dentistry]] from a primitive craft to a respected profession with various national societies and journals. He also furthered the development of dental colleges. In addition to being a well-trained practitioner and educator, Parmly was a gifted poet and set down his autobiography in verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12846256 | volume=51 | title=Eleazar Parmly: clinician, educator, poet | journal=J Hist Dent | pages=51–5 | last1 = Shklar | first1 = G | last2 = Chernin | first2 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked with several other famous dentists of the time, such as [[Solyman Brown]], [[Norman William Kingsley]], and [[Chapin A. Harris]].

==Death==
Parmly died of [[pneumonia]] on December 13, 1874, in New York City, at the age of 77.

'''Enteritis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[small intestine]]. It is most commonly caused by food or drink contaminated with [[pathogen]]ic microbes,&lt;ref name=medline&gt;Dugdale, David C., IIII, and George F Longretch [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/article/001149.htm "Enteritis"]. [[MedlinePlus]] Medical Encyclopedia, 18 October 2008. Accessed 24 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[serratia]]'', but may have other causes such as [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]], [[cocaine]], [[radiation therapy]] as well as [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune conditions]] like [[Crohn's disease]] and [[coeliac disease]]. Symptoms include abdominal pain, cramping, [[Diarrhea|diarrhoea]], [[dehydration]], and [[fever]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; 

Related diseases of the [[gastrointestinal system]] include inflammation of the stomach and large intestine. 

{| {{Table}}
! Condition !! Organ
|-
| [[gastritis]] || [[stomach]]
|-
| [[gastroenteritis]] || stomach and [[small intestine]]
|-
| [[colitis]] || [[large intestine]]
|-
| [[enterocolitis]] || large and small intestine
|}

[[Duodenitis]], [[jejunitis]] and [[ileitis]] are subtypes of enteritis which are only localised to a specific part of the small intestine. Inflammation of both the stomach and small intestine is referred to as [[gastroenteritis]]. 

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of enteritis are highly variable and vary based on the specific cause and other factors such as individual variance and stage of disease.
Symptoms may include [[abdominal pain]], [[cramp]]ing, [[Diarrhea|diarrhoea]], [[dehydration]], [[fever]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and [[weight loss]].

== Causes ==

=== Autoimmune ===
[[Crohn's disease]] – also known as regional enteritis, it can occur along any surface of the gastrointestinal tract. In 40% of cases it is limited to the small intestine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Coeliac disease]] – caused by an autoimmune reaction to gluten by genetically predisposed individuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Eosinophilic enteropathy – a condition where [[eosinophil]]s build up in the gastrointestinal tract and blood vessels, leading to polyp formation, necrosis, inflammation and ulcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischer|first=David M.|last2=Atkins|first2=Dan|date=2009-02-01|title=Evaluation of the patient with suspected eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease|pmid=19141341|journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America|volume=29|issue=1|pages=53–63, ix|doi=10.1016/j.iac.2008.09.002|issn=1557-8607}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly seen in patients with a history of [[atopy]], however is overall relatively uncommon.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mori|first=Amit|last2=Enweluzo|first2=Chijioke|last3=Grier|first3=David|last4=Badireddy|first4=Madhu|date=2013-05-01|title=Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: review of a rare and treatable disease of the gastrointestinal tract|pmid=23904840|journal=Case Reports in Gastroenterology|volume=7|issue=2|pages=293–298|doi=10.1159/000354147|issn=1662-0631|pmc=3728613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious enteritis ===
In Germany, 90% of cases of infectious enteritis are caused by four pathogens, [[Norovirus]], [[Rotavirus]], ''[[Campylobacter]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epple|first=H.-J.|last2=Zeitz|first2=M.|date=2011-09-01|title=[Infectious enteritis]|journal=Der Internist|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1038, 1040–1044, 1046|doi=10.1007/s00108-011-2862-z|issn=1432-1289|pmid=21847579}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common causes of infectious enteritis include bacteria such as ''[[Shigella]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]],'' as well as viruses such as adenovirus, astrovirus and calicivirus. Other less common pathogens include ''[[Bacillus cereus]], [[Clostridium perfringens]], [[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aVmRWrknaWgC|title=Textbook of Therapeutics: Drug and Disease Management|last=Helms|first=Richard A.|last2=Quan|first2=David J.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781757348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]''  is one of the most common sources of infectious enteritis, and the most common bacterial pathogen found in 2 year old and smaller children with diarrhoea.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coker|first=Akitoye O.|last2=Isokpehi|first2=Raphael D.|last3=Thomas|first3=Bolaji N.|last4=Amisu|first4=Kehinde O.|last5=Obi|first5=C.

=== Vascular disease ===
Ischemic enteritis is uncommon compared to ischemic colitis due to the highly vascularised nature of the small intestine,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koshikawa|first=Yorimitsu|last2=Nakase|first2=Hiroshi|last3=Matsuura|first3=Minoru|last4=Yoshino|first4=Takuya|last5=Honzawa|first5=Yusuke|last6=Minami|first6=Naoki|last7=Yamada|first7=Satoshi|last8=Yasuhara|first8=Yumiko|last9=Fujii|first9=Shigehiko|date=2016-10-12|title=Ischemic enteritis with intestinal stenosis|pmc=4754528|journal=Intestinal Research|volume=14|issue=1|pages=89–95|doi=10.5217/ir.2016.14.1.89|issn=1598-9100|pmid=26884740}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for sufficient blood flow in most situations.

=== Radiation enteritis ===
{{Main article|Radiation enteropathy}}

Inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract is common after treatment with radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauer-Jensen|first=Martin|last2=Denham|first2=James W.|last3=Andreyev|first3=H. Jervoise N.|date=2016-10-14|title=Radiation Enteropathy – Pathogenesis, Treatment, and Prevention|pmc=4346191|journal=Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|volume=11|issue=8|pages=470–479|doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2014.46|issn=1759-5045|pmid=24686268}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is classified as early if it manifests within the first 3 months, and delayed if it manifests 3 months after treatment. Early radiation enteritis is caused by cell death of the [[Intestinal gland|crypt epithelium]] and subsequent mucosal inflammation, however usually subsides after the course of radiation therapy is completed. Delayed radiation enteritis is a chronic disease which has a complex pathogenesis involving changes in the majority of the intestinal wall.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis may be simple in cases where the patient's signs and symptoms are idiopathic to a specific cause. However this is generally not the case, considering that many pathogens which cause enteritis may exhibit the similar symptoms, especially early in the disease. In particular, ''campylobacter, shigella, salmonella'' and many other bacteria induce acute self-limited colitis, an inflammation of the lining of the colon which appears similar under the microscope.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A medical history, physical examination and tests such as blood counts, stool cultures, CT scans, MRIs, PCRs, colonoscopies and upper endoscopies may be used in order to perform a differential diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregg|first=null|last2=Nassar|first2=null|date=1999-04-01|title=Infectious Enteritis|pmid=11096582|journal=Current Treatment Options in Gastroenterology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=119–126|issn=1092-8472|doi=10.1007/s11938-999-0039-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biopsy may be required to obtain a sample for histopathology.

== Treatment ==
Mild cases usually do not require treatment and will go away after a few days in healthy people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In cases where symptoms persist or when it is more severe, specific treatments based on the initial cause may be required.

In cases where diarrhoea is present, replenishing fluids lost is recommended, and in cases with prolonged or severe diarrhoea which persists, intravenous rehydration therapy or antibiotics may be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zEZOqB6r9hwC|title=Sleisenger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, Management, Expert Consult Premium Edition - Enhanced Online Features|last=Feldman|first=Mark|last2=Friedman|first2=Lawrence S.|last3=Brandt|first3=Lawrence J.|date=2010-05-03|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1437727670}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple [[oral rehydration therapy]] (ORS) can be made by dissolving one teaspoon of salt, eight teaspoons of sugar and the juice of an orange into one litre of clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=pZ9fpHtvOGYC|title=Communicable Disease Epidemiology and Control: A Global Perspective|last=Webber|first=Roger|date=2009-01-01|publisher=CABI|isbn=9781845935054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown the efficacy of antibiotics in reducing the duration of the symptoms of infectious enteritis of bacterial origin, however antibiotic treatments are usually not required due to the self-limiting duration of infectious enteritis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word ''enteritis'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|n|t|ə|ˈ|r|ai|t|ᵻ|s}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:entero-#Prefix|entero-]]'' and ''[[wikt:-itis#Suffix|-itis]]'', both [[New Latin]] from [[Greek Language|Greek]], respectively from ἑντερον (''enteron'', [[small intestine]]) and -ιτις (''-itis'', [[inflammation]]).

To date, there have been no conclusive or major studies relating to female ejaculation. Much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions or research [[methodology]]. Research has used highly selected individuals, case studies, or very small numbers of subjects, making generalization difficult. Most of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains [[urine]]. Some believe the fluid is secreted by the [[Skene's gland|paraurethral ducts]] through and around the human [[female urethra]], but the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals, which is also related to doubts over the existence of the [[G-spot]].

==Reports==
In questionnaire surveys, 35–50% of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bullough B, David M, Whipple B, Dixon J, Allgeier ER, Drury KC |author-link3=Whipple B | title = Subjective reports of female orgasmic expulsion of fluid | journal = Nurse Pract |date=March 1984 | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages= 55–9 |pmid=6546788 | doi = 10.1097/00006205-198409030-00009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davidson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davidson JK, Darling CA, Conway-Welch, C |date=Summer 1989 | title = The role of the Grafenberg Spot and female gushing in the female orgasmic response: an empirical analysis | journal = J Sex Marital Ther | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–20 | pmid=2769772 | doi = 10.1080/00926238908403815 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="darling"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Darling CA |author2=Davidson JK Sr |author3=Conway-Welch C. | title = Female ejaculation: perceived origins, the Grafenberg spot/area, and sexual responsiveness | journal = Arch Sex Behav |date=February 1990 | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–47 |pmid=2327894 | doi = 10.1007/BF01541824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies find anywhere from 10–69%, depending on the definitions and methods used.&lt;ref name="wimpissinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zaviacic99"/&gt; For instance Kratochvíl (1994) surveyed 200 women and found that 6% reported ejaculating, an additional 13% had some experience and about 60% reported release of fluid without actual gushing.&lt;ref name=Kratochvil/&gt; Reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zaviacic M |title=Sexual asphyxiophilia (Koczwarism) in women and the biological phenomenon of female ejaculation |journal=Med.

The suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of [[sexual arousal]] has been described by women's health writer Rebecca Chalker as "one of the most hotly debated questions in modern [[sexology]]".&lt;ref name="chalker"/&gt; Female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical, medical, and biological literature throughout recorded history.

===Western literature===

====16th to 18th century====
In the 16th century, the Dutch physician [[Laevinius Lemnius]], referred to how a woman "draws forth the man's seed and casts her own with it".&lt;ref&gt;Lemnius, L. De occultis naturae miraculis 1557, Reprinted as The Secret Miracles of Nature. London 1658, p.19 cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=6geM40gONl8C Laqueur T. Making Sex: The body and gender from the Greeks to Freud. Harvard, Cambridge 1990 vii]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[François Mauriceau]] described glands at the [[female urethral meatus]] that "pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition, which increases the heat and enjoyment of women".&lt;ref&gt;[[One sex two sex theory|Cited in Laqueur 1990 pp. 92–3]]&lt;/ref&gt; This century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function,&lt;ref name=blackledge&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2d-11Y_u3cC |last=Blackledge|first=Catherine|title=The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality|year=2004 |origyear=2003 |isbn=0813534550 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |place=New Brunswick, N.J }}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular the work of the [[Caspar Bartholin the Elder|Bartholin]] family in Denmark.

====De Graaf====
In the 17th century, the Dutch anatomist [[Reinier de Graaf]] wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs ''Concerning the Generative Organs of Women'' which is much cited in the literature on this topic. De Graaf discussed the original controversy but supported the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] view.&lt;ref name="graaf"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Regnier De Graaf | title = New Treatise Concerning the Generative Organs of Women. Reprinted as: Jocelyn HD, Setchell BP: Regnier de Graaf on the human reproductive organs.

{{quote|[VI:66-7]The urethra is lined by a thin membrane. In the lower part, near the outlet of the urinary passage, this membrane is pierced by large ducts, or lacunae, through which pituito-serous matter occasionally discharges in considerable quantities.

Between this very thin membrane and the fleshy fibres we have just described there is, along the whole duct of the urethra, a whitish membranous substance about one finger-breadth thick which completely surrounds the urethral canal... The substance could be called quite aptly the female 'prostatae' or 'corpus glandulosum', 'glandulous body'''...''The function of the 'prostatae' is to generate a pituito-serous juice which makes women more libidinous with its pungency and saltiness and lubricates their sexual parts in agreeable fashion during coitus.

[VII:81] The discharge from the female 'prostatae' causes as much pleasure as does that from the male 'prostatae'}}

He identified [XIII:212] the various controversies regarding the ejaculate and its origin, but stated he believed that this fluid "which rushes out with such impetus during venereal combat or libidinous imagining" was derived from a number of sources, including the vagina, urinary tract, cervix and uterus. He appears to identify [[Skene's ducts]], when he writes [XIII: 213] "those [ducts] which are visible around the orifice of the neck of the vagina and the outlet of the urinary passage receive their fluid from the female 'parastatae', or rather the thick membranous body around the urinary passage." However he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid "which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man." Further on [XIII:214] he refers to "liquid as usually comes from the pudenda in one gush." However, his prime purpose was to distinguish between generative fluid and pleasurable fluid, in his stand on the Aristotelian semen controversy.

===19th century===
[[Richard von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing's]] study of sexual perversion, ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' (1886), describes female ejaculation under the heading "Congenital Sexual Inversion in Women" as a perversion related to [[neurasthenia]] and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;von Krafft-Ebing R. ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', Klaf FS (trans.) Stein and Day, NY 1965, at 265&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the intersexual gratification among ...women seems to be reduced to kissing and embraces, which seems to satisfy those of weak sexual instinct, but produces in sexually neurasthenic females ejaculation}}

It is also described by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] in pathological terms in his study of [[Dora (case study)|Dora]] (1905), where he relates it to hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;Freud S. Fragments of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria. 1905, in Strachey J (trans.) ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works by Sigmund Freud'', vol VII: 84&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The pride taken by women in the appearance of their genitals is quite a special feature of their vanity; and disorders of genitals which they think calculated to inspire feelings of repugnance or even disgust have an incredible power of humiliating them, of lowering their self-esteem, and of making them irritable, sensitive, and distrustful. An abnormal secretion of the mucous membrane of the vagina is looked upon as source of disgust.}}

However, women's writing of that time portrayed this in more positive terms. Thus we find [[Almeda Sperry]] writing to [[Emma Goldman]] in 1918, about the "rhythmic spurt of your love juices".&lt;ref name="bell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aZ-jOTonK8C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;cad=0_0#PPA163,M1 |title=''Falk C.''

Cleis 2003, at 163 |publisher=Books.google.ca |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomical knowledge was also advanced by [[Alexander Skene]]'s description of para-urethral or periurethral glands (glands around the [[urethra]]) in 1880, which have been variously claimed to be one source of the fluids in the ejaculate, and now commonly referred to as the [[Skene's glands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Skene AJC | title = The anatomy and pathology of two important glands of the female urethra | journal = Am. J. Obstet. Dis. Women Child. | year = 1880 | volume = 13 | pages = 265–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

====Early 20th century understanding====
Female ejaculation is mentioned as normal in early 20th century 'marriage manuals', such as TH [[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde|Van de Velde]]'s ''[[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]]'' (1926). Certainly van de Velde was well aware of the varied experiences of women.&lt;ref&gt;van de Velde, TH. ''Ideal Marriage: Its physiology and technique''. Random, NY 1957, pp 195–6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It appears that the majority of laymen believe that something is forcibly squirted (or propelled or extruded), or expelled from the woman's body in orgasm, and should so happen normally, as in the man's case. Finally it is just as certain that such an 'ejaculation' does not take place in many women of sexually normal functions, as that it does take place in others.}}

Yet the subject was largely ignored for most of the early part of the century. In 1948, Huffman, an American gynaecologist, published his studies of the prostatic tissue in women together with a historical account and detailed drawings. These clearly showed the difference between the original glands identified by Skene at the urinary meatus, and the more [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] collections of glandular tissue emptying directly into the urethra.&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, J. W. The detailed anatomy of the paraurethral ducts in the adult human female" ''American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology'' 55: 86–101, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The urethra might well be compared to a tree about which and growing outward from its base are numerous stunted branches, the paraurethral ducts and glands.}}

To date, most of the interest had focused on the substance and structure rather than function of the glands. A more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after, in 1950, with the publication of an essay by [[Ernst Gräfenberg|Gräfenberg]] based on his observations of women during orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://doctorg.com/Grafenberg.htm |author=E. Grafenberg |title=The role of the urethra in female orgasm |journal=Int J Sexol |volume=3 |pages=145–8 |year=1950 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807175157/http://doctorg.com/Grafenberg.htm |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|An erotic zone always could be demonstrated on the anterior wall of the vagina along the course of the urethra...analogous to the male urethra, the female urethra also seems to be surrounded by erectile tissues...In the course of [[sexual stimulation]], the female urethra begins to enlarge and can be felt easily. It swells out greatly at the end of orgasm...Occasionally the production of fluids is ...profuse...

If there is the opportunity to observe the orgasm of such women, one can see that large quantities of a clear transparent fluid are expelled not from the vulva, but out of the urethra in gushes. At first I thought that the bladder sphincter had become defective by the intensity of the orgasm. Involuntary expulsion of urine is reported in sex literature. In the cases observed by us, the fluid was examined and it had no urinary character. I am inclined to believe that "urine" reported to be expelled during female orgasm is not urine, but only secretions of the intraurethral glands correlated with the erotogenic zone along the urethra in the anterior vaginal wall. Moreover the profuse secretions coming out with the orgasm have no lubricating significance, otherwise they would be produced at the beginning of intercourse and not at the peak of orgasm.}}

However this paper made little impact, and was dismissed in the major sexological writings of that time, such as [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] (1953)&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A.C., Pomeroy, W.B., Martin, C.E., Gebhard, P.H. (1953). ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female''. Philadelphia : W.B. Saunders Company&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Masters &amp; Johnson|Masters and Johnson]] (1966),&lt;ref&gt;Masters WH, Johnson VE. ''Human Sexual Response''. Little Brown, Boston 1966&lt;/ref&gt; equating this "erroneous belief" with [[#Relation to urinary incontinence|urinary stress incontinence]]. Although clearly Kinsey was familiar with the phenomenon, commenting that (p.&amp;nbsp;612);

{{quote|Muscular contractions of the vagina following orgasm may squeeze out some of the genital secretions, and in a few cases eject them with some force}}

as were Masters and Johnson ten years later, who observed (pp 79–80):

{{quote|Most women do not ejaculate during orgasm...we ''have'' observed several cases of women who expelled a type of fluid that was not urine}}

(emphasis in original) yet dismissed it (p.&amp;nbsp;135) – "female ejaculation is an erroneous but widespread concept", and even twenty years later in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Masters WH, Johnson VE, Kolodny RC. Masters and Johnson on ''Sex and Human Learning''. Little Brown, Boston 1982&lt;/ref&gt; they repeated the statement that it was erroneous (p.&amp;nbsp;69–70) and the result of "urinary stress incontinence".

====Late 20th century awareness====
The topic did not receive serious attention again until a review by Josephine Lowndes Sevely and JW Bennett appeared in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sevely JL, Bennett JW | title = Concerning female ejaculation and the female prostate | journal = J Sex Res | volume = 14 | pages = 1–20 | year = 1978 | doi = 10.1080/00224497809550988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter paper, which traces the history of the controversies to that point, and a series of three papers in 1981 by [[Beverly Whipple]] and colleagues in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'',&lt;ref name="belzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="addiego"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; became the focal point of the current debate. Whipple became aware of the phenomenon when studying urinary incontinence, with which it is often confused.&lt;ref name=whipple-chalker&gt;Personal communication, cited by Chalker 2000 p.125&lt;/ref&gt; As Sevely and Bennett point out, this is "not new knowledge, but a rediscovery of lost awareness that should contribute towards reshaping our view of female sexuality". Nevertheless, the theory advanced by these authors was immediately dismissed by many other authors, such as physiologist Joseph Bohlen,&lt;ref name="bohlen"/&gt; for not being based on rigorous scientific procedures, and psychiatrist [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] (1983) stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCqMzcAka54C |last=Kaplan|first= HS.|title= The Evaluation of Sexual Disorders: Psychological and Medical Aspects|year=1983 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1984.279_7.x |publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Female ejaculation (as distinct from female urination during orgasm) has never been scientifically substantiated and is highly questionable, to say the least.}}

Some radical feminist writers, such as [[Sheila Jeffreys]] (1985) were also dismissive, claiming it as a figment of male fantasy:&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys S. The Spinster and Her Enemies: feminism and sexuality 1880–1930. Pandora Press, London 1985, at 110&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There are examples in the sexological literature of men's sexual fantasies about lesbian sexuality. Krafft-Ebing invented a form of ejaculation for women.}}

It required the detailed anatomical work of Helen O'Connell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/clitoris/ |last=Williamson|first= Susan|last2=Nowak|first2= Rachel|title= The truth about women.

As she observes, the [[female perineal urethra]] is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall and is surrounded by erectile tissue in all directions except posteriorly where it relates to the vaginal wall. "The distal vagina, [[clitoris]], and urethra form an integrated entity covered superficially by the vulval skin and its epithelial features.

====Anthropological accounts====
Female ejaculation appears in 20th-century [[anthropology|anthropological]] works, such as [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]]'s Melanesian study, ''[[The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia|The Sexual Life of Savages]]'' (1929), and Gladwin and Sarason's "Truk: Man in Paradise" (1956). Malinowski states that in the language of the [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand Island]] people, a single word is used to describe ejaculation in both male and female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=OSQuvsbE5ooC |title=Malinowski B.

{{quote|Both the male and female discharge are called by the same name (''momona'' or ''momola''), and they ascribe to both the same origin in the kidneys, and the same function, which has nothing to do with generation, but is concerned with lubricating the membrane and increasing pleasure}}

In describing sexual relations amongst the [[Chuuk State|Trukese]] Micronesians, Gladwin and Sarason state that "Female orgasm is commonly signalled by urination".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwin T, Sarason SB. Truk: Man in paradise. Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, NY 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Blackledge&lt;ref name=blackledge/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;205) provides a number of examples from other cultures, including the [[Uganda]]n [[Demographics of Uganda|Batoro]], [[Mohave people|Mohave]] Indians, [[Mangaia]]ns, and [[Pohnpei|Ponapese]]. Amongst the Batoro, older women teach the younger women "kachapati" (spraying the wall) at puberty. (See also Chalker 2002 pp.&amp;nbsp;531–2, Ladas et al. 1983 pp.&amp;nbsp;74–5)

==Research==

===General===
To date, there have been no conclusive or major studies relating to female ejaculation, the largest study being an internet survey consisting of 320 participants.&lt;ref name="issuu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/ontarion/docs/172.3/21?e=1481637%2F4946439 |title=The Ontarion|work=Issuu|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions&lt;ref name="schubach02"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schubach G |title=The G-spot is the female prostate |journal=Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=186 |issue=4 |pages=850; author reply 850 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11967519 |doi= 10.1067/mob.2002.121628|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/a121628}}&lt;/ref&gt; or research methodology. Research has used highly selected individuals, case studies, or very small numbers of subjects, making generalization difficult. For instance, much of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine. There are also problems involved in the collection of specimens and issues of contamination. Since the area of interest is para-urethral glands, it is impossible to completely separate the secretions from urine, especially considering that there may be [[retrograde ejaculation]] into the urethra towards the bladder. The best current data comes from studies where women have abstained from coitus, and where their own urine is used as a control both pre- and post-orgasm. Research has attempted to use chemicals that are excreted in the urine so that any urinary contamination can be detected. Further methodological issues include the fact that the composition of the fluid appears to vary with the menstrual cycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zaviacic M |title=The fluid of female urethral expulsions analysed by histochemical electron-microscopic and other methods |journal=Histochem.

Other issues relate to the sensitivity and specificity of the markers chosen. The key questions are the source of the fluid produced, and its composition.&lt;ref name="bohlen"/&gt;

===Female ejaculation vs. squirting or gushing ===
Some aspects of the research community distinguish between female ejaculation and what is colloquially known as squirting or gushing.&lt;ref name=Rubio-Casillas /&gt; These terms are used by the public interchangeably, which often leads to confusion. In these research publications, it is suggested that "real" female ejaculation is the release of a very scanty, thick, and whitish fluid from the female prostate,&lt;ref name=Rubio-Casillas /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19766406"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moalem | first1 = S. | last2 = Reidenberg | first2 = J.

===Relation to urinary incontinence===
Towards the later part of the 20th century, there was significant confusion between female ejaculation and [[urinary incontinence]]. In 1982, Bohlen explained the accepted wisdom:&lt;ref name="bohlen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bohlen JG |title="Female Ejaculation" and urinary stress incontinence |journal=J. Sex Res. |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=360–8 |year=1982 |doi=10.1080/00224498209551161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The previously accepted notion that all fluid expelled during a woman's orgasm is urine is now being challenged... sexologists must take care not to assume now that any fluid produced at orgasm is "female ejaculate".}}

Scientific studies from the 1980s and later have demonstrated that the substance produced is distinct from urine, though it does show similarities such as alkalinity with urine.&lt;ref name=Kratochvil&gt;{{cite journal |author = Kratochvíl Stanislav |date=April 1994 | title = Orgasmic expulsions in women | journal = Českoslovenaká psychiatrie | volume = 90 | issue = 2 | pages = 71–7 | pmid = 8004685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of women who report ejaculation found no evidence of any urological problems, suggesting these two conditions (ejaculation and coital incontinence) are quite distinct physiologically, although perhaps not always distinguishable in a particular individual's mind.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Davidson's study of 1,289 women found that the sensation of ejaculation was very similar to that of urination.&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt; One study by [[Gary Schubach]]  used [[urethral catheterization]] in order to separate urine from orgasmic expulsions from elsewhere in the body. Seven women claiming to have ejaculations expelled large volumes of urine through the catheter at orgasm, and little to no other fluid.&lt;ref name=Schubach&gt;{{cite journal |author = Gary Schubach |date=August 2001| title = Urethral Expulsions During Sensual Arousal and Bladder Catheterization in Seven Human Females | journal = Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be important for physicians to establish whether there is in fact any incontinence in women who report ejaculation, to avoid unnecessary interventions.&lt;ref name=whipple-chalker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cartwright R, Elvy S, Cardozo L |title=Do women with female ejaculation have detrusor overactivity? |journal=J Sex Med |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=1655–8 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17634057 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00541.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also important for physicians to distinguish orgasmic ejaculation from vaginal discharges which may require further investigation and treatment.  In individual cases, the exact source of any reported discharge may not be obvious without further investigation.

===Nature of fluid===
Critics have maintained that ejaculation is either stress incontinence or [[vaginal lubrication]]. Research in this area has concentrated almost exclusively on attempts to prove that the ejaculate is not urine,&lt;ref name="chalker02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Belzer EG |title=A review of female ejaculation and the Grafenberg spot |journal=Women Health |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |year=1984 |pmid=6367229 |doi= 10.1300/J013v09n01_02|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring substances such as [[urea]], [[creatinine]], [[prostatic acid phosphatase]] (PAP), [[prostate specific antigen]] (PSA),&lt;ref name="zaviacic99"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorg.com/sexual_products/ebook_female_prostate.html |title=Zaviacic M.

A 2007 study on two women involved [[ultrasound]], [[endoscopy]], and biochemical analysis of fluid. The ejaculate was compared to pre-orgasmic urine from the same woman, and also to published data on male ejaculate. In both women, higher levels of PSA, PAP, and glucose but lower levels of [[creatinine]] were found in the ejaculate than the urine. PSA levels were comparable to those in males.&lt;ref name="wimpissinger"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wimpissinger F, Stifter K, Grin W, Stackl W |title=The female prostate revisited: perineal ultrasound and biochemical studies of female ejaculate |journal=J Sex Med |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1388–93; discussion 1393 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17634056 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00542.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasounds from a 2014 study, involving seven women who reported recurring massive fluid emission during sexual arousal, confirmed thorough bladder emptiness before stimulation, noticeable bladder filling before squirting and demonstrated that the bladder had again been emptied after squirting. Although small amounts of prostatic secretions are present in the emitted fluid, the study suggests that squirting is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity.&lt;ref name="salamajsm"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salama, S., Boitrelle, F., Gauquelin, A., Malagrida, L., Thiounn, N. and Desvaux, P. |title=Nature and Origin of "Squirting" in Female Sexuality |journal=J Sex Med |date=December 2014 |doi=10.1111/jsm.12799 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12799/abstract |pmid=25545022 |volume=12 |pages=661–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of fluid===
One very practical objection relates to the reported volumes ejaculated, since this fluid must be stored somewhere in the pelvis, of which the [[urinary bladder]] is the largest source. The actual volume of the para-urethral tissue is quite small. By comparison, male ejaculate varies from {{convert|0.2|-|6.6|ml|USoz|2|abbr=on}} (95% [[confidence interval]]), with a maximum of {{convert|13|ml|USoz|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacLeod J |title=Semen quality in 1000 men of known fertility and in 800 cases of infertile marriage |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=115–39 |year=1951 |pmid=14823049 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, claims of larger amounts of ejaculate are likely to contain at least some amount of urine. The eleven specimens analyzed by Goldberg in 1983,&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; ranged from {{convert|3|-|15|ml|USoz|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="belzerjsr84"/&gt; One source states that Skene's glands are capable of excreting {{convert|30|-|50|ml|USoz|0|abbr=on}} in 30–50 seconds,&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; but it is unclear how this was measured and has not been confirmed. One approach is to use a chemical like [[methylene blue]] so that any urinary component can be detected.&lt;ref name="belzerjsr84"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belzer EG, Whipple W, Moger W |title=On female ejaculation |journal=J.

PAP and PSA have been identified in the para-urethral tissues, using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, suggesting that the ejaculate is likely to arise from the ducts in these tissues, in a manner homologous to that in the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pollen, JJ |author2=Dreilinger, A |date=March 1984 | title = Immunohistochemical identification of prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen in female periurethral glands | journal = Urology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–4 | pmid = 6199882 | doi = 10.1016/S0090-4295(84)90053-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tepper, SL |author2=Jagirdar, J |author3=Heath, D |author4=Geller, SA |date=May 1984 | title = Homology between the female paraurethral (Skene's) glands and the prostate.

PSA occurs in urine, and is elevated in post-orgasmic samples compared to pre-orgasmic.

===Function===
The physiological function of the purported liquid is unknown. A 2009 paper in ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'' suggests that it may have an [[anti-microbial]] function, protecting from [[urinary tract infections]].&lt;ref name="pmid19766406"/&gt;

==Controversy and feminist criticism==
The debate in the current literature focuses on three threads:  the existence of female ejaculation, its source(s) and composition, and its relationship to theories of female sexuality.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt; This debate has been influenced by popular culture, pornography, and physio-chemical and behavioral studies.

stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall involves simultaneous stimulation of the para-urethral tissue, the site of the [[Skene's gland]]s and ducts and presumed source of the ejaculated fluid, and therefore it has been variously stated that stimulation of this spot results in ejaculation. These tissues, surrounding the distal urethra, and anterior to the vagina, have a common embryological origin to the prostatic tissue in the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Longo VJ |title=The female prostate |journal=Urology |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=108–9 |date=July 1982 |pmid=7202277 |doi= 10.1016/0090-4295(82)90556-8|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zaviacicwhipple/&gt;

In an extensive survey, Darling and colleagues claim support for the existence of ejaculation,&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; while in a sharply critical response, Alzate&lt;ref name=alzate85/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alzate H. Hoch Z. The "G-Spot" and "Female Ejaculation": A current appraisal. J Sex Marital Therapy 12: 217, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; states that direct experimentation fails to provide any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Vaginal erogeneity, "female ejaculation," and the "Grafenberg spot" | author = Alzate H |date=December 1990 | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–11 |pmid=2082864 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | doi = 10.1007/bf01542469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alzate states:

{{quote|the ignorance and/or confusion still prevalent among women about the anatomy and physiology of their sexual organs may make them mistake either vaginal lubrication or stress urinary incontinence for an "ejaculation."}}

[[Shannon Bell]] argues that the debate is confused by the discussion of two separate phenomena.{{specify|date=January 2011}} She comments that Alzate simply dismisses women's subjective experiences in favour of rigorous scientific proof, and is typical of male sexologists withholding the validity of experience from women. Bell's critique lies at the heart of feminist concerns about this debate, namely a tendency to "disregard, reinterpret, and overwrite women's subjective descriptions." For some, she states, it is more a matter of belief than of physiology. Bell further questions why feminists have not been more outspoken in defense of women's control over female ejaculation, pointing out that the literature frames the discussion in only five separate ways; procreation, sexual pleasure, deviance, pathology, and a scientific mystery.&lt;ref name="bell"/&gt;

The discussion entered popular culture in 1982 with the publication of the best-selling book ''[[The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality]],'' by Ladas, Whipple, and Perry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ladas, AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD | year = 1982 | title = The G spot: And other discoveries about human sexuality | location = New York | publisher = Holt, Rinehart, and Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book discussed female ejaculation and brought the issue back into discussions of women's sexuality both in the medical community and among the general public.&lt;ref name="chalker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="santamaria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hines"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Hines, T |date=August 2001 |title =The G-Spot:   A modern gynecologic myth |journal =Am.

Importantly, a number of the women stated that they had been diagnosed with urinary incontinence. The book advances another feminist theory: that because women's pleasure in their sexuality has been historically excluded, the pleasure of ejaculation has been either discounted or appropriated by health professionals as a physiological phenomenon.&lt;ref name="whipple02"&gt;

"Orgasmic expulsions of fluid in the sexually stimulated female." Film available from Focus International, Inc., 1776 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10019.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the ''Journal of Sex Research'' described the debate surrounding female ejaculation as 'heated'.&lt;ref name=heath/&gt;
Josephine Sevely then followed up her 1978 study by publishing "Eve's Secrets: A new theory of female sexuality" in 1987, emphasising an integrated rather than fragmented approach to understanding [[female sexuality]], with the clitoris, vagina and urethra depicted as a single sexual organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingelman-Sundberg A |title=The anterior vaginal wall as an organ for the transmission of active forces to the urethra and the clitoris |journal=Int Urogynecol J Pelvic Floor Dysfunct |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=50–1 |year=1997 |pmid=9260097 |doi= 10.1007/BF01920294|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gravina/&gt; This not only challenged the traditional fragmentation of female sexuality into clitoral vs. vaginal sensation, but also sexualised the urethra.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;

The continuing debate is further illustrated in the angry exchange of letters between the author and researchers in the ''American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology'' in 2002 following the publication of 'The G-spot: A modern gynecological myth' by Terrence Hines.&lt;ref name="hines"/&gt;

==Social significance==
Sexual functions, and orgasm in particular, remain poorly understood scientifically, as opposed to politically and philosophically.&lt;ref name=gravina/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer J, Singer I | year = 1972 | title = Types of female orgasm | url = | journal = J Sex Res | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 255–67 | doi=10.1080/00224497209550761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Segraves R, Balon R, Clayton A |title=Proposal for changes in diagnostic criteria for sexual dysfunctions |journal=J Sex Med |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=567–80 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17433086 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00455.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the facts relating to the details of female ejaculation, the social significance of the popular accounts through the feminist health care movement has been considerable.&lt;ref name="chalker"/&gt;

Many women, before learning about ejaculation, experienced shame or avoided sexual intimacy under the belief that they had wet the bed.&lt;ref name=heath&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heath D |title=An investigation into the origins of a copious vaginal discharge during intercourse: "Enough to wet the bed" – that "is not urine" |journal=J. Sex Res. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=194–215 |year=1984 |doi=10.1080/00224498409551217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suppressed sexual climax, and sought medical advice for this "problem", and even underwent surgery.&lt;ref name="chalker"/&gt;

There are, however, concerns. The terminology (such as female prostate and female ejaculation) invoke images of the female as merely an imitation of the male, mapping the female body onto the male, as if, like the [[Galen]]ic view, it was incomplete.&lt;ref name=connell&gt;Connell SM. Aristotle and Galen on sex difference and reproduction: a new approach to an ancient rivalry. Studies In History and Philosophy of Science Part A 31(3): 405–27, September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, overemphasis of ejaculation may induce performance anxiety.&lt;ref name="chalker"/&gt; For the reason that 'sameness' has been construed as a male perspective, some feminists reject the term ejaculation. Others argue it should be retained as a distinctive feminine characteristic distinguishable from the male, and imbued with different properties and purpose. A third concern is that of the increasing 'medicalisation' of women's sexuality, as expressed by Leonore Tiefer which finds its most extreme manifestation in the concept of [[female sexual dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moynihan R |title=The marketing of a disease: female sexual dysfunction |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7484 |pages=192–4 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15661785 |pmc=545000 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7484.192 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tiefer has expressed concern that overemphasising ejaculation will drive women who might feel inadequate to seek medical attention,&lt;ref name=chalker/&gt; as has the [[Boston Women's Health Book Collective|Boston Women's Health Collective]].&lt;ref&gt;Boston Women's Health Collective. [[Our Bodies, Ourselves|Our Bodies, Our Selves]]. Simon and Schuster NY 1984, page 171&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticism comes from [[Barbara Ehrenreich]]&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich B, Hess E, Jacobs G. Re-making love, the feminization of sex. Anchor Press NY 1986, page 185&lt;/ref&gt; and colleagues who see this new sexuality as one that privileges the male in control, penile retention and body position, but this is denied by others.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;

Contemporary women's health literature summarises what is considered factual as being that the amount of fluid varies greatly and may be unnoticeable, occurs with or without [[vaginal stimulation]], and may accompany orgasm or merely intense sexual pleasure, and orgasm may occur without ejaculation. Whether it can be learned or not, women report that they can induce it by enhancing their sexual response.&lt;ref name=chalker/&gt; Regardless, countless workshops now exist to teach women that learning how to ejaculate is an important form of feminine sexual expression. Sundahl describes it as a birthright and essential part of female creativity.&lt;ref name=sundahl/&gt;

===Legal implications===

The presence of chemical markers such as [[Prostatic acid phosphatase|PSA or PAP]] in the female genital tract has been considered evidence in rape trials,&lt;ref&gt;Sensabaugh GF, Kahane D. Biochemical studies on "female ejaculates". California Association of Criminalists, Newport Beach, California May 1982&lt;/ref&gt; but Sensabaugh and Kahane demonstrated in four specimens that PAP was an order of magnitude greater in a woman's ejaculate than in her urine. Recently, knowledge that these markers can be of female origin has led to acquittal based on forensic evidence.&lt;ref name=zaviacicwhipple&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zaviacic M, Whipple B |title=Update on the female prostate and the phenomenon of female ejaculation |journal=J.

Kleffner''' (October 10, 1925 – June 12, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downingandlahey.com/memsol.cgi?user_id=1607908&lt;/ref&gt; was a professor at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], noted for his contributions in the fields of [[speech and language pathology]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].

His work with [[William Landau]] and [[Harold Klawans]] advanced his career beyond regular work in a neurology clinic. His name became well known for a controversial treatment for a disease affecting children under the age of five and causing acquired aphasia ([[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]]).

In 1976 Dr. Kleffner became the Director of the Institute of Logopedics in Wichita, Kansas, until his retirement.

==Frank R. Kleffner Clinical Career Award==
An award for excellence in speech-language pathology has been presented annually in his name since 1986.

The Frank R. Kleffner Clinical Career Award is given to a speech-language pathologist or audiologist in recognition of outstanding contributions to clinical science and practice in communication science and disorders over a period of twenty years or more. Selection of the award recipient is based on the criteria established by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Foundation (a body founded in 1946, affiliated to the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashfoundation.org/Foundation/recipients/FrankRKleffnerAwards.htm Frank R.

'''Gillick competence''' is a term originating in [[England]] and is used in [[medical law]] to decide whether a child (under 16 years of age) is able to consent to his or her own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge.

The standard is based on the 1985 decision of the House of Lords in ''Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority''.&lt;ref name="1985case"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech AHA [1985] UKHL 7|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1985/7.html|website=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|accessdate=19 February 2017|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is binding in England and Wales, and has been adopted to varying extents in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gillick and the Consent of Minors: Contraceptive Advice and Treatment in New Zealand|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/VUWLawRw/2009/38.pdf|website=Victoria University of Wellington Law Review|accessdate=19 February 2017|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennings|first1=Nicholas J.|title=Are competent children autonomous medical decision makers? New developments in Australia|journal=Journal of Law and the Biosciences|date=13 July 2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=459–468|doi=10.1093/jlb/lsv028|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar provision is made in Scotland by the [[Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991]]. In Northern Ireland, although separate legislation applies, the then [[Department of Health (Northern Ireland)|Department of Health and Social Services]] stated that there was no reason to suppose that the House of Lords' decision would not be followed by the Northern Ireland Courts. 

==The Gillick decision==
The Gillick case involved a [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|health departmental]] [[wiktionary:circular|circular]] advising doctors on the [[contraception]] of minors (for this purpose, under sixteens). The circular stated that the prescription of contraception was a matter for the doctor's discretion and that they could be prescribed to under sixteens without parental consent. This matter was litigated because an activist, [[Victoria Gillick]], ran an active campaign against the policy. Gillick sought a declaration that prescribing contraception was illegal because the doctor would commit an offence of encouraging sex with a minor and that it would be treatment without consent as consent vested in the parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1983: Mother loses contraception test case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/26/newsid_2499000/2499583.stm|website=On this day|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 February 2017|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue before the House of Lords was only whether the minor involved could give consent. "Consent" here was considered in the broad sense of consent to battery or assault: in the absence of patient consent to treatment, a doctor, even if well-intentioned, might be sued/charged.

The House of Lords focused on the issue of consent rather than a notion of 'parental rights' or parental power. In fact, the court held that 'parental rights' did not exist, other than to safeguard the best interests of a minor. The majority held that in some circumstances a minor could consent to treatment, and that in these circumstances a parent had no power to veto treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilmore|first1=Stephen|last2=Glennon|first2=Lisa|title=Hayes and Williams' Family Law|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198753087|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Scarman and Lord Fraser proposed slightly different tests (Lord Bridge agreed with both). Lord Scarman's test is generally considered to be the test of 'Gillick competency'. He required that a child could consent if he or she fully understood the medical treatment that is proposed:

{{Quote|text=As a matter of Law the parental right to determine whether or not their minor child below the age of sixteen will have medical treatment terminates if and when the child achieves sufficient understanding and intelligence to understand fully what is proposed.|author=Lord Scarman&lt;ref name="1985case" /&gt;}}

The ruling holds particularly significant implications for the legal rights of minor children in England in that it is broader in scope than merely medical consent. It lays down that the authority of parents to make decisions for their minor children is not absolute, but diminishes with the child's evolving maturity. The result of Gillick is that in England today, except in situations that are regulated otherwise by law, the legal right to make a decision on any particular matter concerning the child shifts from the parent to the child when the child reaches sufficient maturity to be capable of making up his or her own mind on the matter requiring decision.

==Subsequent developments==
The decisions ''In re R'' (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Great Britain. England. Court of Appeal|title=In re R (A Minor) (Wardship: Consent to Treatment).|journal=The weekly law reports|date=11 July 1991|volume=1991 Oct 25|pages=592-608|pmid=12041269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Re W'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Great Britain. England. Court of Appeal, Civil Division|title=Re W (A Minor) (Medical Treatment)|journal=The all England law reports|date=10 July 1992|volume=[1992]4|pages=627-49|pmid=11648298}}&lt;/ref&gt; (especially Lord Donaldson) contradict the Gillick decision somewhat. From these, and subsequent cases, it is suggested that although the parental right to veto treatment ends, parental powers do not "terminate" as suggested by Lord Scarman in Gillick. However, these are only [[obiter]] statements and were made by a lower court; therefore, they are not legally binding. However, the [[parens patriae]] jurisdiction of the court remains available allowing a court order to force treatment against a child's (and parent's) wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young People who Refuse Life Sustaining Treatment|url=http://www.law.leeds.ac.uk/assets/files/research/cfig/Young-People-who-Refuse-Life-Sustaining-Treatment-Briefing-Paper.pdf|website=School of Law|publisher=University of Leeds|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A child who is deemed "Gillick competent" is able to prevent their parents viewing their medical records. As such, medical staff will not make a disclosure of medical records of a child who is deemed "Gillick competent" unless [[consent]] is manifest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capacity and competence in  under  18s|url=https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20151008%20Brief%20guide%20-%20Capacity%20and%20consent%20in%20under%2018s%20FINAL.pdf|website=CQC|accessdate=19 February 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 judicial review, ''R (on the application of Axon) v Secretary of State for Health'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/37.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2006] EWHC 37 (Admin)&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the High Court affirmed Gillick in allowing for medical confidentiality for teenagers seeking an abortion. The court rejected a claim that not granting parent's a "right to know" whether their child had sought an abortion, birth control or contraception breached [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. The ''Axon'' case set out a list of criteria that a doctor must meet when deciding whether to provide treatment to an under-16 child without informing their parents: they must be convinced that they can understand all aspects of the advice, that the patient's physical or mental health is likely to suffer without medical advice, that it is in the best interests of the patient to provide medical advice, that (in provision of contraception) they are likely to have sex whether contraception is provided or not, and that they have made an effort to convince the young person to disclose the information to their parents.

In most jurisdictions the parent of an [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated minor]] does not have the ability to consent to therapy, regardless of the Gillick test. Typical positions of emancipation arise when the minor is married (''R v D'' [1984] AC 778, 791) or in the military.

The nature of the standard remains uncertain. The [[court]]s have so far declined invitations to define rigidly "Gillick competence" and the individual doctor is free to make a decision, consulting peers if this may be helpful, as to whether that child is "Gillick competent".

Some recent legislation appears to explicitly restrict the ability of Gillick competent children to consent to medical treatment outside of clinical settings. For example, parental consent is required for the treatment of children with asthma using standby salbutamol inhalers in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Funston |first=Wendy |last2=Howard |first2=Simon J |date=5 May 2006 |title=A cross-sectional questionnaire study of the rules governing pupils’ carriage of inhalers for asthma treatment in secondary schools in North East England |url=https://peerj.com/articles/2006/ |journal=PeerJ |volume=4 |doi=10.7717/peerj.2006 |access-date=7 May 2016 |pages=e2006 |pmc=4860314 |pmid=27168999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions have yet to be tested in court.

==Australian law==
The Australian High Court gave specific and strong approval for the Gillick decision in "[[Marion's Case]]", ''Secretary of the Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB'' (1992) 175 CLR 189. The Gillick competence doctrine is part of Australian case law (see, e.g., ''DoCS v Y'' [1999] NSWSC 644).

There is no express authority in Australia on ''In re R'' and ''Re W'', so whether a parent's right terminates is unclear. This lack of authority reflects that the reported cases have all involved minors who have been found to be incompetent, and that Australian courts will make decisions in the ''parens patriae'' jurisdiction regardless of Gillick competence.

In South Australia and New South Wales legislation clarifies the common law, establishing a Gillick-esque standard of competence but preserving concurrent consent between parent and child for the ages 14–16.

== Confusion regarding Gillick competence ==
On 21 May 2009, confusion arose between Gillick competence, which identifies under-16s with the capacity to consent to their own treatment, and the [[#Fraser guidelines|Fraser guidelines]], which are concerned only with [[contraception]] and focus on the desirability of parental involvement and the risks of unprotected sex in that area.

A persistent rumour arose that Victoria Gillick disliked having her name associated with the assessment of children's capacity, but an editorial in the BMJ from 2006 claims that Gillick as saying that she "has never suggested to anyone, publicly or privately, that [she] disliked being associated with the term 'Gillick competent{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Gillick or Fraser? A plea for consistency over competence in children | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/332/7545/807 | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = | page = 807 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.332.7545.807 | pmid = 16601020 | pmc=1432156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraser guidelines==&lt;!-- [[Fraser competence]] redirects here --&gt;
It is lawful for doctors to provide contraceptive advice and treatment without parental consent providing certain criteria are met. These criteria, known as the Fraser guidelines, were laid down by Lord Fraser in the House of Lords' case and require the professional to be satisfied that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A Cornock|first1=Marc|title=Fraser guidelines or Gillick competence?|journal=Journal of Children's and Young People's Nursing|date=July 2007|volume=1|issue=3|pages=142–142|doi=10.12968/jcyn.2007.1.3.24114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the young person will understand the professional's advice;
*the young person cannot be persuaded to inform their parents;
*the young person is likely to begin, or to continue having, sexual intercourse with or without contraceptive treatment;
*unless the young person receives contraceptive treatment, their physical or mental health, or both, are likely to suffer;
*the young person's best interests require them to receive contraceptive advice or treatment with or without parental consent.

Although these criteria specifically refer to contraception, the principles are deemed to apply to other treatments, including abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigel's surgery 8: Gillick competency and Fraser guidelines|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/nigels-surgery-8-gillick-competency-and-fraser-guidelines|website=CQC|accessdate=19 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the judgement in the House of Lords referred specifically to doctors, it is considered to apply to other health professionals, including nurses. It may also be interpreted as covering youth workers and health promotion workers who may be giving contraceptive advice and condoms to young people under 16, but this has not been tested in court.

If a person under the age of 18 refuses to consent to treatment, it is possible in some cases for their parents or the courts to overrule their decision. However, this right can be exercised only on the basis that the welfare of the young person is paramount. In this context, welfare does not simply mean their physical health. The psychological effect of having the decision overruled would have to be taken into account and would normally be an option only when the young person was thought likely to suffer "grave and irreversible mental or physical harm". Usually, when a parent wants to overrule a young person's decision to refuse treatment, health professionals will apply to the courts for a final decision.

An interesting aside to the Fraser guidelines is that many regard Lord Scarman's judgement as the leading judgement in the case, but because Lord Fraser's judgement was shorter and set out in more specific terms – and in that sense more accessible to health and welfare professionals – it is his judgement that has been reproduced as containing the core principles.

The '''Health Care in Canada Survey''' (HCIC) is a comprehensive annual survey of Canadian public and health care providers’ opinions on health care issues. It was conducted annually over the decade 1998–2007, and was developed to provide direction for governments as they work to manage health care reform.

The intent and spirit of the survey was not to provide a report card on the status of the health system, but rather to gauge the need for change, and to provide direction to government on where change is needed, and the options supported by stakeholders of the system. The results from the survey can help guide decision makers, serving as a roadmap to health system reform.

Results from the survey were based on telephone interviews with nationally representative samples of 1,223 members of the Canadian public, 202 doctors, 201 nurses, 202 pharmacists and 201 health managers. The questions were developed by POLLARA Research working in consultation with their partner organizations.

The survey was developed in partnership with a variety of key stakeholders in the healthcare system, working together to provide their experience and perspective on the system. The goal of the partnership was to develop a resource that provides strong direction to decision makers in this time of health care review and reform. Partners included - Association of Canadian Academic Healthcare Organizations, Canadian Healthcare Association, Canadian Home Care Association, [[Canadian Medical Association]], [[Canadian Nurses Association]], Health Charities Coalition of Canada, [[Université de Montréal]] - Groupe de recherche en gestion thérapeutique, [[Merck Frosst]] Canada Ltd., POLLARA Research, and [[Rogers Media]]. The partnership grew from three partners in 1998 to ten in its final year. The partnership represented a broad base of stakeholders in the system, including health care providers, health organizations and institutions, university institutes, the community and homecare sectors, and the innovative pharmaceutical industry.

A number of features made the survey unique. The first is the partnership of a range of stakeholder groups. Secondly, the experiences of the public and health care providers are captured, providing the ability to compare and contrast the reflections of these groups. Third, it was an annual survey, allowing for the tracking of trends over time, highlighting evolving appetites for change, priorities, and preferences.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;[[File:NewYorkPresbyterian-Cornell.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[New York–Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[New York City]] is one of the world's busiest [[hospital]]s. Pictured is the Weill-Cornell facility (white complex at centre).]]
'''Health care''' or '''healthcare''' is the maintenance or improvement of [[health]] via the [[preventive healthcare|prevention]], [[diagnosis]], and  [[therapy|treatment]] of [[disease]], [[illness]], [[injury]], and other [[disability|physical and mental impairments]] in human beings. Healthcare is delivered by [[health professional]]s (providers or practitioners) in [[allied health professions|allied health fields]]. [[Physicians]] and physician associates are a part of these health professionals. [[Dentistry]], [[midwifery]], [[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[optometry]], [[audiology]], [[pharmacy]], [[psychology]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and other [[health profession]]s are all part of healthcare. It includes work done in providing [[primary care]], [[secondary care]], and [[tertiary care]], as well as in [[public health]].

Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, largely influenced by social and economic conditions as well as the [[health policy|health policies]] in place. Countries and jurisdictions have different policies and plans in relation to the personal and population-based health care goals within their societies. [[Healthcare system]]s are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. Their exact configuration varies between national and subnational entities. In some countries and jurisdictions, health care planning is distributed among market participants, whereas in others, planning occurs more centrally among governments or other coordinating bodies. In all cases, according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), a well-functioning healthcare system requires a robust financing mechanism; a well-trained and adequately paid [[Health Human Resources|workforce]]; reliable information on which to base decisions and [[health policy|policies]]; and well maintained [[health facilities]] and logistics to deliver quality medicines and technologies.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/health_systems/en/ |title= Health Topics: Health Systems |publisher= WHO World Health Organization |website= www.who.int |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare can contribute to a significant part of a country's [[Economic system|economy]]. In 2011, the [[healthcare industry]] consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] or [[Us dollar|US$]] 3,322 ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]]) per capita across the 34 members of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries. The US (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the [[Netherlands]] (11.9%, 5,099), [[France]] (11.6%, 4,118), [[Germany]] (11.3%, 4,495), [[Canada]] (11.2%, 5669), and [[Switzerland]] (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however [[life expectancy|life expectancy in total population at birth]] was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), [[Japan]] and [[Italy]] (82.7), [[Spain]] and [[Iceland]] (82.4), France (82.2) and [[Australia]] (82.0), while OECD's average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The US (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except the US and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="OECDHealthGlance"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Health-at-a-Glance-2013-Chart-set.pdf|title=Health at a Glance 2013 - OECD Indicators|publisher=OECD|date=2013-11-21|format=PDF |id= ([http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/health-at-a-glance.htm link]) |pages=5, 39, 46, 48 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECDLifeExpectancy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=51904 |title= OECD.StatExtracts, Health, Health Status, Life expectancy, Total population at birth, 2011 |publisher=OECD's iLibrary |year=2013 |format=online statistics |website= stats.oecd.org/ |accessdate= 2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Health system#International comparisons|international comparisons]].)

Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general [[physical health|physical]] and [[mental health]] and [[well-being]] of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of [[smallpox]] in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first [[disease]] in human history to be completely eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Anniversary of smallpox eradication.'' Geneva, 18 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery==
{{See also|Health professionals}}
[[File:Jericho Health Centre 20050326.jpg|thumb|Primary care may be provided in community health centres.]]
The delivery of modern health care depends on groups of trained [[professional]]s and [[paraprofessional]]s coming together as [[interdisciplinary team]]s.&lt;ref name=USDL&gt;United States Department of Labor. [http://www.doleta.gov/BRG/Indprof/Health.cfm ''Employment and Training Administration: Health care'']. Retrieved June 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes professionals in [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[physiotherapy]], [[nursing]], [[dentistry]], [[midwifery]] and [[allied health]], along with many others such as [[public health|public health practitioners]], [[community health worker]]s and [[unlicensed assistive personnel|assistive personnel]], who systematically provide personal and population-based preventive, curative and rehabilitative care services.

While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different cultural, political, organizational and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care.&lt;ref name="Cookie"&gt;Thomas-MacLean R et al. [http://www.uwo.ca/fammed/csfm/tutor-phc/documentation/trainingpapers/TUTOR_Definitio_%20of_primar_%20health_care.pdf ''No Cookie-Cutter Response: Conceptualizing Primary Health Care.''] Retrieved 26 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare can be defined as either public or private.

[[File:Terapevt Mudrov train.JPG|thumb|Medical train "Therapist Matvei Mudrov" in [[Khabarovsk]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/06/siberian-train/yaffa-text ''Train for the Forgotten; For Siberia's isolated villagers, the doctor is in the railway car.''] June 2014 issue [[National Geographic (magazine)]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Primary care''' refers to the work of [[health professionals]] who act as a first point of consultation for all [[patients]] within the [[Health Care System|health care system]].&lt;ref name="Cookie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110303183810/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/45B45060-A38E-496F-B2C1-BD2DC6C04C52/0/44Definitionofterms2009.pdf ''Definition of Terms.''] Retrieved 26 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a professional would usually be a [[primary care physician]], such as a [[general practitioner]] or [[Family medicine|family physician]]. Another professional would be a licensed independent practitioner such as a [[physiotherapist]], or a non-physician primary care provider such as a [[physician assistant]] or [[nurse practitioner]]. Depending on the locality, health system organization the patient may see another health care professional first, such as a [[pharmacist]] or [[nurse]]. Depending on the nature of the health condition, [[patient]]s may be [[Referral (medicine)|referred]] for secondary or tertiary care.

Primary care is often used as the term for the health care services that play a role in the local community. It can be provided in different settings, such as [[Urgent care]] centers which provide same day appointments or services on a walk-in basis.

Primary care involves the widest scope of health care, including all ages of patients, patients of all [[socioeconomic]] and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal [[health]], and patients with all types of acute and chronic physical, [[mental health|mental]] and social health issues, including [[Polypharmacy|multiple chronic diseases]]. Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas. [[Transitional care#continuity|Continuity]] is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and [[preventive medicine|preventive care]], [[health education]], and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem. The [[International Classification of Primary Care]] (ICPC) is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care based on the reason for the patient's visit.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/icpc2/en/index.html ''International Classification of Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC-2)''.] Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include, for example: [[hypertension]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[back pain]], [[Osteoarthritis|arthritis]] or [[Thyroid disease|thyroid dysfunction]]. Primary care also includes many basic [[maternal health|maternal]] and child health care services, such as [[family planning]] services and [[vaccination]]s. In the United States, the 2013 [[National Health Interview Survey]] found that skin disorders (42.7%), osteoarthritis and joint disorders (33.6%), back problems (23.9%), disorders of lipid metabolism (22.4%), and upper respiratory tract disease (22.1%, excluding asthma) were the most common reasons for accessing a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=St Sauver JL, Warner DO, Yawn BP, etal |title=Why patients visit their doctors: assessing the most prevalent conditions in a defined American population |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=56–67 |date=January 2013 |pmid=23274019 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.08.020 |url= |pmc=3564521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, primary care physicians have begun to deliver primary care outside of the managed care (insurance-billing) system through [[direct primary care]] which is a subset of the more familiar [[concierge medicine]]. Physicians in this model bill patients directly for services, either on a pre-paid monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, or bill for each service in the office. Examples of direct primary care practices include [[Foundation Health]] in Colorado and [[Qliance]] in Washington.

In context of global [[population aging]], with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic [[non-communicable disease]]s, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected in both developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/ageing/en/ ''Aging and life course: Our aging world.''] Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simmons J. [http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content/233658/topic/WS_HLM2_PHY/Primary-Care-Needs-New-Innovations-to-Meet-Growing-Demands.html ''Primary Care Needs New Innovations to Meet Growing Demands.''] ''HealthLeaders Media'', May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] attributes the provision of essential primary care as an integral component of an inclusive [[primary health care]] strategy.&lt;ref name="Cookie"/&gt;

===Secondary care===

'''Secondary care''' includes [[acute care]]: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury, or other health condition. This care is often found in a [[hospital]] [[emergency department]]. Secondary care also includes skilled attendance during [[childbirth]], [[intensive care medicine|intensive care]], and [[medical imaging]] services.

The term "secondary care" is sometimes used synonymously with "hospital care." However, many secondary care providers, such as [[psychiatrists]], [[clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]], [[occupational therapists]], most [[dental specialties]] or [[physiotherapist]]s do not necessarily work in hospitals. Some primary care services are delivered within hospitals. Depending on the organization and policies of the national health system, patients may be required to see a primary care provider for a [[referral (medicine)|referral]] before they can access secondary care. 

In countries which operate under a [[mixed market]] health care system, some [[physician]]s limit their practice to secondary care by requiring patients to see a primary care provider first. This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group [[health insurance]] plans. In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred.

In other countries patient self-referral to a [[medical specialist]] for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from [[Health insurance|private insurance schemes]] or [[national health insurance]].

[[Allied health professions|Allied health professionals]], such as [[physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[respiratory therapists]], [[occupational therapist]]s, [[Speech and language pathology|speech therapists]], and [[dietitians]], also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral.

===Tertiary care===
[[File:NationalNeurologyHospital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] is a specialist neurological hospital.]]
{{See also|Medicine}}
'''Tertiary care''' is specialized consultative health care, usually for [[inpatient]]s and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced [[medicine|medical]] investigation and treatment, such as a [[tertiary referral hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine. [http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/patient_care/pay_bill/insurance_footnotes.html ''Patient Care: Tertiary Care Definition''.] Accessed 27 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of tertiary care services are [[cancer]] management, [[neurosurgery]], [[cardiac surgery]], [[plastic surgery]], treatment for severe [[burn]]s, advanced [[neonatology]] services, palliative, and other complex medical and surgical interventions.&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;Emory University. [http://www.em.emory.edu/hospital_eu.html School of Medicine.] Accessed 27 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quaternary care====
The term '''quaternary care''' is sometimes used as an extension of tertiary care in reference to advanced levels of medicine which are highly [[Medical specialist|specialized]] and not widely accessed. [[Clinical research|Experimental medicine]] and some types of uncommon [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[surgery|surgical]] procedures are considered quaternary care. These services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centers.&lt;ref name="Emory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Physician Link. [http://www.albertaphysicianlink.ab.ca/orientation_guide/levels-of-care.html ''Levels of Care''.] Retrieved 26 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Quaternary care is more prevalent in the United Kingdom.

===Home and community care===
{{See also|Public health}}
Many types of health care interventions are delivered outside of health facilities. They include many interventions of [[public health]] interest, such as [[food safety]] surveillance, distribution of [[condom]]s and [[needle-exchange programme|needle-exchange programs]] for the prevention of transmissible diseases.

They also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of [[self care]], [[home care]], [[long-term care]], [[assisted living]], treatment for [[substance use disorder]]s among other types of health and social care services.

Community [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] services can assist with mobility and independence after loss of limbs or loss of function. This can include [[prosthesis]], [[orthotics]] or [[wheelchair]]s.

Many countries, especially in the west are dealing with aging populations, so one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full, independent lives in the comfort of their own homes. There is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in day-to-day activities at home such as transportation to and from doctor's appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and well-being. Although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation, family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts. This state of affairs presents a challenge for the design of ICT (information and communication technology) for home care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Because statistics show that over 80 million Americans have taken time off of their primary employment to care for a loved one,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/business/economy/home-health-care-work.html|title=Home Health Care: Shouldn’t It Be Work Worth Doing?|last=Porter|first=Eduardo|date=2017-08-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; many countries have begun offering programs such as Consumer Directed Personal Assistant Program to allow family members to take care of their loved ones without giving up their entire income.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

With obesity in children rapidly becoming a major concern, health services often set up programs in schools aimed at educating children about nutritional eating habits, making physical education a requirement and teaching young adolescents to have positive self-image.

===Ratings===
{{Main|Health care ratings}}
[[Health care ratings]] are ratings or [[evaluation]]s of health care used to evaluate the process of care and healthcare structures and/or outcomes of health care services. This information is translated into report cards that are generated by quality organizations, nonprofit, consumer groups and media. This evaluation of quality is based on measures of:
* hospital quality
* [[health plan]] quality
* physician quality
* quality for other health professionals
* of [[patient experience]]

==Related sectors==
Health care extends beyond the delivery of services to patients, encompassing many related sectors, and is set within a bigger picture of financing and governance structures.

===Health system===
{{Main|Health system|Health systems by country}}
A '''health system''', also sometimes referred to as '''health care system''' or '''healthcare system''' is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to populations in need.

===Health care industry===
{{See also|Health care industry|Health economics}}
[[File: A group of Damas de Rojo.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Chile]]an 'Damas de Rojo' volunteering at their local hospital]]
The [[health care industry]] incorporates several sectors that are dedicated to providing health care services and products. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] categorizes health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and "other human health activities." The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Patient advocacy services ensure optimum health outcomes | author=Dorothy Kamaker | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/patient-advocacy-20150920-gjr53j.html | accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[allied health professions]].

In addition, according to industry and market classifications, such as the [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]], health care includes many categories of medical equipment, instruments and services including [[biotechnology]], diagnostic laboratories and substances, drug manufacturing and delivery.

For example, pharmaceuticals and other medical devices are the leading high technology exports of Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Europe"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures|year=2007|url=http://www.efpia.eu/documents/82/61/The-Pharmaceutical-Industry-in-Figures-Edition-2006|accessdate=February 15, 2010|work=[[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]]|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHRMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicaltrainingcourses.com/phrma.pdf|title=2008 Annual Report|accessdate= February 15, 2010|work=[[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States dominates the [[biopharmaceutical]] field, accounting for three-quarters of the world's biotechnology revenues.&lt;ref name="Europe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EFPIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efpia.org/content/Default.asp?PageID=388|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823030103/http://www.efpia.org/content/Default.asp?PageID=388|archivedate=23 August 2009 |title=Europe's competitiveness|work=[[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]]|accessdate= February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care research===
{{main|Medical research|Nursing research}}
{{For outline|Healthcare science}}
The quantity and quality of many health care interventions are improved through the results of science, such as advanced through the [[medical model]] of health which focuses on the eradication of [[illness]] through [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and effective treatment. Many important advances have been made through health research, [[biomedical research]] and [[pharmaceutical research]], which form the basis for [[evidence-based medicine]] and [[evidence-based practice]] in health care delivery.

[[Health services research]] can lead to greater efficiency and equitable delivery of health care interventions, as advanced through the [[social model of disability|social model of health and disability]], which emphasizes the societal changes that can be made to make populations healthier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bond J. |author2=Bond S. | title=Sociology and Health Care| publisher=Churchill Livingstone| year=1994 | isbn=978-0-443-04059-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from health services research often form the basis of [[evidence-based policy]] in health care systems. [[Health services research]] is also aided by initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence for the development of systems of health assessment that are clinically useful, timely, sensitive to change, culturally sensitive, low burden, low cost, built into standard procedures, and involve the patient.&lt;ref name = "campro"&gt;

===Health care financing===
{{See also|Health care system|Health policy|Universal health care}}

There are generally five primary methods of funding [[health care systems]]:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/searo/2004/SEA_HSD_274_eng.pdf "Regional Overview of Social Health Insurance in South-East Asia.'] Retrieved December 02, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

# general [[taxation]] to the state, county or municipality
# [[social insurance|social health insurance]]
# voluntary or private [[health insurance]]
# [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket payments]]
# [[donation]]s to health [[charities]]

In most countries there is a mix of all five models, but this varies across countries and over time within countries.

===Health care administration and regulation===
{{See also|Health professional requisites}}
The [[Health administration|management and administration of health care]] is vital to the delivery of health care services. In particular, the practice of health professionals and operation of health care institutions is typically [[Regulation|regulated]] by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of [[quality assurance]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, 2003. ''Quality and accreditation in health care services''. Geneva http://www.who.int/hrh/documents/en/quality_accreditation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries have credentialing staff in regulatory boards or [[health department]]s who document the [[Health professional requisites|certification or licensing of health workers]] and their work history.&lt;ref&gt;Tulenko et al., "Framework and measurement issues for monitoring entry into the health workforce."

==Activity==
A study by [[Public Health England]] in 2017 found that 41% of the 15.3 million English adults aged 40 to 60 do not walk for as much as 10 minutes continuously each month at a brisk pace.  A quarter of the English population was found to be “inactive” – doing less than 30 minutes of activity per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Six million adults fail to walk briskly for 10 minutes each month|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/six-million-adults-fail-to-walk-briskly-for-10-minutes-each-month-36064099.html|accessdate=24 August 2017|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol==
The heaviest-drinking 20% of the population drink almost two thirds of all alcohol consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Health at a Glance 2015 How does the United Kingdom compare?|url=https://www.oecd.org/unitedkingdom/Health-at-a-Glance-2015-Key-Findings-UK.pdf|accessdate=24 August 2017|publisher=OECD|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and economic inequality==
The [[Blair Government]] instituted a comprehensive programme to reduce health inequalities in England between 1997 and 2010 focused on reducing geographical inequalities in life expectancy.  It was targeted at the Spearhead areas - the 20% of local authorities with the worst health and deprivation indicators.  More NHS resources were directed to more deprived areas. The strategy was associated with a decline in geographical inequalities in life expectancy, reversing a trend which had increased over a long period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barr|first1=Ben|last2=Higgerson|first2=James|last3=Whitehead|first3=Margaret|title=Investigating the impact of the English health inequalities strategy: time trend analysis|journal=British Medical Journal|date=5 July 2017|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3310|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hebe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|iː|ˌ|b|iː}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἥβη}}) in [[ancient Greek religion]], is the [[goddess]] of youth or the prime of life&lt;ref&gt;According to Kerényi, p. 98, "Hebe's name... means 'Flower of Youth'.  She was another version of her mother in the latter's quality of Hera Pais, 'Hera the young maiden'."&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent: [[Juventas]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]] does not detect a unity of Hera (Juno) and Hebe (Juventus): he opens ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' vi with a dispute between Juno and Juventus claiming patronage of the month of June ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidFasti6.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; She is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+921 921&amp;ndash;922]; [[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:11.601 11. 604&amp;ndash;605]; [[Pindar]], ''Isthmian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DI.%3Apoem%3D4 4.59&amp;ndash;60]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.3.1 1.3.1], and later authors.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebe was the [[cupbearer]] for the gods and goddesses of [[Mount Olympus]], serving their [[nectar]] and [[ambrosia]] until she was married to [[Heracles]] ([[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent: [[Hercules]]); her successor was the [[divine hero]] [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]. Another title of hers, for this reason, is ''Ganymeda'', meaning "Gladdening Princess". She also drew baths for her brother [[Ares]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.899 5.905].&lt;/ref&gt; and helped [[Hera]] enter her chariot.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.711-5.763 5.722].&lt;/ref&gt; She was often connected to [[Aphrodite]], whom she was described dancing with and acting as her herald or attendant, linking the Classical association between beauty and youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homeric Hymn 3 to Pythian Apollo|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=186 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Euripides|Euripedes']] play [[Orestes (play)|Orestes]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] is said to sit on a throne beside Hera and Hebe upon obtaining immortality. In some traditions, her father Zeus gifted her two doves with human voices, one flew to where the Oracle of [[Dodona]] would be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Arthur Bernard|date=1906|title=Who Was the Wife of Zeus?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/695286|journal=The Classical Review|volume=20(7)|pages=365-378|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebe was supposed to have the power to give eternal youth and to restore youth to mortals, a power that appears exclusive to her, as the in Ovid's [[Metamorphoses]], the some gods lament their mortals aging. According to [[Philostratus the Elder]], Hebe was youngest of the gods and responsible for keeping the other gods eternally young, and thus was highly revered by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/PhilostratusElder2B.html|title=Imagines (Book 2)|last=Philostratus the Elder|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In art, she is typically seen with her father in the guise of an eagle, often offering a cup to her. This depiction is seen in classical [[engraved gem]]s as well as later art and seems to relate to a belief that the [[eagle]] (like the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]) had the ability to renew itself to a youthful state.

==Etymology==
The Greek ἥβη is the inherited word for "youth", from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''(H)iēg&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;-eh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'', "youth, vigour".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Hebe'' comes from Greek word meaning "youth" or "prime of life". ''Juventus'' likewise means "youth", as can be seen in such derivatives as ''juvenile''.

==Mythology==
Hebe is the daughter of Zeus and Hera and was seen in myth as a diligent daughter performing domestic tasks that were typical of high ranking, unmarried girls. In an alternative version of her birth, her mother became pregnant merely by eating a [[lettuce]] plant when dining with [[Apollo]]. Although there does not appear to be source from the classical era regarding the version of her paternity, it is referenced by American author [[Henry David Thoreau]] in his book ''[[Walden]]'', where Hebe is described as the daughter of Juno and wild lettuce.
[[File:Pittore_del_louvre_E739,_hydria_ricci,_etruria_(artigiani_da_focea),_dalla_banditaccia,_530_ac._ca.,_ercole_all'olimpo_su_quadriga_con_ebe_1.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The "Ricci Hydria" showing Hebe bringing Herakles to Olympus from Earth upon his apotheosis. (National Etruscan Museum).]]
A fragment by [[Callimachus]] describes Hera holding a feast to celebrate the seventh day after her daughter Hebe’s birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iambi, Fragment 202|last=Callimachus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gods have a friendly argument over who will give the best gift, with [[Athena]], [[Poseidon]], [[Apollo]], and [[Hephaestus]] specifically mentioned as presenting toys or as in Apollo's case songs.

As the bride of Herakles, Hebe was strongly associated with her husband. In some depictions on Attic vase paintings, such as the Ricci Hydria dated to approximately 525 BC, Hebe drives a chariot and is the one who brings her future husband Herakles to Olympus from Earth upon his apotheosis, a role traditionally fulfilled by Athena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Vases: Images, Contexts and Controversies|last=Jenifer|first=Neils|publisher=BRILL|year=2004|isbn=978-90-04-13802-5|editor-last=Marconi|editor-first=Clemente|location=|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebe had two children with Heracles: [[Alexiares and Anicetus]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although nothing is known about these deities beyond their names, Callimachus makes a reference to [[Eileithyia]], Hebe's sister, attending to her while in labour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.7.7 2.77].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fragment 524|last=Callimachus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Heracleidae (play)|Heracleidae]]'' and in [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses]], Hebe grants [[Iolaus]]' wish to become young again in order to fight [[Eurystheus]].

==Cult==
Hebe was particularly associated with the worship of her mother at [[Argos]] and in the [[Heraion of Argos]], one of the main centres of worship of Hera. It was said that Hebe, in a statue made of ivory and gold, was depicted standing beside a very large statue of her mother Hera, which depicted the goddess seated holding a pomegranate and sceptre with a [[cuckoo]] perched on top.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias2B.html|title=Description of Greece|last=Pausanias|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A relief made of silver above an alter depicted the marriage of Hebe and Heracles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Both of these depictions have been lost. It is possible the Hebe was worshipped as or represented the virginal aspect of Hera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greek Myths|last=Graves|first=Robert|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1955|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hebe was also depicted, alongside Athena, standing beside a sitting statue of Hera in the Temple of Hera at Mantinea in Arkadia, sculptured by [[Praxiteles]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 9. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aelian]] also refer to Hebe being worshipped alongside her spouse Hercules in a temple dedicated to them both on an unknown location. &lt;ref&gt;Aelian, On Animals 17. 46 (trans. Scholfield)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebe also had her own personal cult, and at least one temple in Greece dedicated to her personally. There was an altar to her in Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 19. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and her own temple in [[Sicyon]], which where the center of her own cult. The Phliasians, who lived near Sicyon, honored Hebe (whom they called Dia) by pardoning supplicants. Hebe was also worshipped as a goddess of pardons or forgiveness; freed prisoners would hang their chains in the sacred grove of her sanctuary at Phlius.
Pausanias described the Temple of Hebe: "A second hill on which the Phliasians [of Phlios in Argolis] have their citadel and their sanctuary of Hebe."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 12. 4 (trans. Jones)&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the cult of Hebe around the sanctuary:
:"On the Phliasian citadel [at Phlios in Argolis] is a grove of cypress trees and a sanctuary which from ancient times has been held to be peculiarly holy. The earliest Phliasians named the goddess to whom the sanctuary belongs Ganymeda; but later authorites call her Hebe, whom Homer mentions in the duel between Menelaos (Menelaus) and Alexandros (Alexander), saying that she was the cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the descent of Odysseus to Haides, that she was the wife of Herakles. Olen [a legendary Greek poet], in his hymn to Hera, says that Hera was reared by the Horai (Horae, Seasons), and that her children were Ares and Hebe. Of the honours that the Phliasians pay to this goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants. All those who seek sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in the grove. The Phliasians also celebrate a yearly festival which they call Kissotomoi (Ivy-cutters). There is no image, either kept in secret of openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a sacred legend of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of Hera with an image of Parian marble."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 13. 3 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient art==
In art, Hebe is usually depicted wearing a sleeveless dress, typically she was depicted with either one or both her parents, at her wedding ceremony, or with Aphrodite. 

It is possible that she is one of the headless figures from the [[Parthenon Marbles|Parthenon pediment]] in the [[British Museum]], as the figure stands as an attendant to Hera and is near Zeus and Ares.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neils|first=Jenifer|date=1999|title=Reconfiguring the Gods on the Parthenon Frieze|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3051284|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=81|pages=6-21|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the figure can indicate a child that is still dependent on their mother, as depictions of Eros with his mother Aphrodite have been equated to the figure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hebe may have been the [[Acroterion]] on the Temple of Ares in the Athenian Agora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neils Boulter|first=Patricia|date=1953|title=An Akroterion from the Temple of Ares in the Athenian Agora|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/146761|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|volume=3|pages=141-147|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A notable depiction of Hebe comes from an [[Attica|Attic]] [[Black-figure pottery|Black Figure]] dions dated to 580 - 570 B.C.E. held in the British Museum, depicting Hebe as part of a procession of gods arriving at the house of [[Peleus]] to celebrate his wedding to [[Thetis]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/K18.4.html|title=K18.4 HEBE|last=Atsma|first=Aaron J.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Hebe is the most prominent goddess in the procession, appearing alone and without a cloak covering her shoulders like most the other goddess in attendance. She wears an elaborate dress with the patterns of animals and geometric shapes and she wears earrings. Her hair is shown to be bound with three braids worn over her shoulder. Her prominent position may be due to her association with feasts, being the patron of brides, or because a mortal man is marrying a goddess, referencing her own marriage to Herakles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

==In post-classical art==
[[File:The Duchesse de Chartres as Hebe by Jean Marc Nattier and Studio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louise Henriette de Bourbon]] as Hebe by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]] (1744)]]
Hebe was a remarkably popular subject in art in the period from about 1750 to 1880, having attracted little artistic attention before or after. In the later period, many depictions were portraits of ladies as Hebe, for which at a minimum the only modifications to a normal costume needed were a flowing white dress, some flowers in the hair and a cup to hold. Most artists added an eagle and a setting amid the clouds. In French there was a special term, "''en Hébé''", for the costume. The personification appears in [[rococo]], [[Grand Manner]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. Even some very aristocratic models allowed a degree of nudity, such as exposing a single breast, though this was often much greater in non-portrait depictions.

[[Jean-Marc Nattier]] painted a [[Louise de Rohan|Rohan]] princess as Hebe in 1737,&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Charlotte_Louise_de_Rohan_%281722-1786%29,_princesse_de_Masseran.jpg Charlotte Louise de Rohan (1722-1786), princesse de Masseran], daughter of [[Hercule Mériadec, Prince of Guéméné]], now [[Palace of Versailles]]&lt;/ref&gt; and then the royal [[Louise Henriette of Bourbon, Duchess of Orléans]] (1744) and [[Michel Ferdinand d'Albert d'Ailly|another duchess]] the same year as Hebe, the latter with a breast exposed. [[François-Hubert Drouais]] painted [[Marie-Antoinette]], when Dauphine, ''en Hébé'' in 1773, and [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Gaspare Landi]] both painted several Hebes. [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] tells in her memoirs how she painted the 16-year-old Miss Anna Pitt, daughter of [[Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford|Thomas Pitt, Lord Camelford]], as Hebe in Rome, with a real eagle she borrowed from [[François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis|Cardinal de Bernis]]. The bird was furious at being brought indoors to her studio and badly frightened her, though it looks relatively harmless in the painting (now in the Hermitage Museum).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ikOYPIZeD3MC&amp;pg=PT16 Her Memoirs, start of chapter III (in French)]; [[:File:Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun - Portrait of Anna Pitt as Hebe - WGA25079.jpg|''Portrait of Anna Pitt as Hebe'']]&lt;/ref&gt; An entirely nude depiction by [[Ignaz Unterberger]] was a huge success in [[Vienna]] in 1795, and bought by [[Emperor Francis II]] for a large amount; the artist was also made a court painter.&lt;ref&gt;A. Griffiths and F. Carey, ''German Printmaking in the Age of Goethe'', London, 1994, pp. 90-92&lt;/ref&gt;

In sculpture Hebe began to flourish as a subject slightly later, but continued longer. [[Hubert Gerhard]] created an early statue of Hebe in 1590 that is currently on display at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], which depicts her naked, holding her dress in one hand and a cup raised above her head in another. She rests one foot upon a tortoise, a gesture associated with [[Aphrodite Urania]]. [[Antonio Canova]] sculpted four different versions of his statue of Hebe, and there are many later copies.&lt;ref&gt;The original is in the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St Petersberg]], with others in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]], Berlin and Museum of [[Forlì]], [[Italy]];&lt;/ref&gt; This had no accompanying eagle, but including the bird was a challenge accepted by several later sculptors. An elaborate marble group with a naked Hebe and the eagle with wings outspread was started in 1852 by the elderly [[François Rude]] but unfinished by his death in 1855.  Finished by his widow and another it is now in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]] and was very popular in bronze versions, with one in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/48844 ''Hebe and the Eagle of Jupiter''], [[Art Institute of Chicago]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]] produced another spectacular group, with the eagle perched above a sleeping Hebe (1869, now [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris). Jean Coulon (1853-1923) produced another group about 1886, with versions in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice]], [[Nice]] and the [[Stanford Museum]] in California.

Especially in America, figures of Hebe continued to be popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century for garden fountains and [[temperance fountain]]s, and statues were widely available in [[cast stone]]. [[Tarentum, Pennsylvania|Tarentum]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]] displays two such cast stone statues of Hebe.&lt;ref&gt;They are located at {{coord|40.59977|-79.752621|region:US-PA}} and {{coord|40.601603|-79.757264|region:US-PA}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  The mold for these statues was donated to the borough by the Tarentum Book Club on 6 June 1912. In [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], the Bloom Fountain installed in 1927 near the municipal rose garden, thanks to a bequest of $6,500 in the will of Louis Bloom, features a Hebe of cast zinc. At [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], [[Kentucky]], the Hebe fountain in Fountain Square follows Canova's model, in patinated cast iron, purchased in 1881 from the [[J. L. Mott Iron Works]] of New York, at a cost of $1500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgky.org/bgpr/ftsqpark.php "The City of Bowling Green, Ky: Fountain Square"]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar Hebe fountains, probably also from Mott, are located in Court Square, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]]  and in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]], and one with bronze patination was formerly the Starkweather Fountain in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]], [[Michigan]], installed in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ypsilantihistoricalsociety.org/publications/starkweatherfountain.html Ypsilanti Historical Society: "Lost Ypsilanti: The Starkweather Fountain"]; the single figure of Hebe cost $750. Other cast zinc Hebe fountains by Mott and other manufacturers are documented by  Carol A. Grissom, ''Zinc sculpture in America, 1850–1950'' 2009:301ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a bronze statue of Hebe, by [[Robert Thomas (sculptor)|Robert Thomas]]; (1966), in [[Birmingham]] city centre, [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Located at {{coord|52.484438|-1.892175|region:GB-BIR}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hirosi Ismael''' (November 30, 1936&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Aq7YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Hirosi+Ismael+30+nov+1936&amp;dq=Hirosi+Ismael+30+nov+1936&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimgoL008fZAhXQ-KQKHWMKAgEQ6AEIIjAA]&lt;/ref&gt; – July 25, 2008) became a [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesian]] politician after ending his medical practice.  Ismael served as the  third [[Vice President of the Federated States of Micronesia]] from May 1987 until 1991.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Former Vice President Ismael Dies in Kosrae|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/02/former-vice-president-ismael-dies-in-kosrae|work=[[Pacific Magazine]]|publisher=|date=2008-08-02|accessdate=2008-08-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121181135/http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/02/former-vice-president-ismael-dies-in-kosrae|archivedate=2008-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in 1936. Ismael was a native of [[Kosrae]], but he grew up in Pohnpei where he attended school. He served in a variety of top positions within the [[United Nations]]' Administration of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] before the FSM achieved its independence.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;

Ismael became the third Vice President of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in May 1987, a position he held until 1991.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; He returned to his home state of Kosrae after leaving office, where he wanted to live his live farming, read his books and go to church. Only after he was requested by some local politicians did he go back into politics but only on an advisory position to the then Governor of Kosrae, afterwards he felt that he had to go back to the medical field but only to help with the administrative side was he appointed the Director of Health Dept. He also became a Reverend to his church of Utwe. He was a simple man really who loved his fried chicken and Chinese checkers. When he found that he had cancer he went to the Philippines for treatments, after realizing the treatments were taking its toll on him, he decided to go back home and spend the rest of his life with his family. His last few hours were spent with his wife, daughter and grandchildren. His wife said that "he went with a smile on his face". Dr. Hirosi Ismael was a very humble man that only wanted what was good for the people of Kosrae and FSM and he lived his life by example.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;

Hirosi Ismael died on July 31, 2008, at his home in Kosrae at the age of 71.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; He was survived by his wife, Mitchigo Skilling, as well as their children: Greeno, Grant, Loto, Paul, Kenye and Ruth.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;

The Micronesian Government released a statement honoring Ismael following his August 1, 2008, [[funeral|memorial service]] praising him for his service to the country: "Ismael's leadership, commitment and guidance during the nation's early efforts toward self-government earned him the respect of his colleagues and the people of the Federated States of Micronesia."&lt;ref name=pdn&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Former FSM Vice President Hirosi Ismael dies at 72

'''Impedance–pH monitoring''' is a technique used in the diagnosis of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD), by monitoring both [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name="pmid19281866"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchett JM, Aslam M, Slaughter JC, Ness RM, Garrett CG, Vaezi MF |title=Efficacy of Esophageal Impedance/pH Monitoring in Patients With Refractory Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, on and off Therapy |journal=Clin.

Patients with ongoing symptoms while on [[Proton-pump inhibitor|proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy]] are commonly diagnosed with impedance–pH monitoring while continuing their medications. The impedance–pH monitoring diagnostic test determines the frequency of reflux episodes and the time relationship of reflux episodes and symptoms. The impedance–pH monitoring test determines if the patient's symptoms are related to [[acid reflux]], related to [[nonacid reflux]], or not related to reflux of any type. A positive GERD diagnosis is made if acid or nonacid reflux precedes symptoms in a statistically meaningful manner. Patients with a positive impedance–pH monitoring test may benefit from acid-reduction therapy such as [[fundoplication surgery]] or [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] fundoplication techniques.

The '''International HIV/AIDS Alliance''' ('''IHAA''') is a global partnership of nationally based [[Government agency|governmental]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] organizations which support [[community organization]]s which [[Activism|promote]] [[HIV/AIDS]] issues in [[developing countries]].{{Sfn|Samuels|McPherson|2010|pages=468–485}}  The [[Political alliance|Alliance]] was created in November 1993 as the '''International Alliance Supporting Community Action on AIDS''', and later renamed the International HIV/AIDS Alliance. The Alliance's founding Executive Director, from 1993 to 2003, was Jeffrey O'Malley.  From 2003 until 2015, the Alliance was led by Alvaro Bermejo.  The current Executive Director is Christine Stegling.

'''Iomazenil''' (also known as '''Ro16-0154''', [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]; '''benzodine''') is an [[antagonist]] and partial [[inverse agonist]] of [[benzodiazepine]] and a potential treatment for [[alcohol abuse]]. The compound was introduced in 1989 by pharmaceutical company [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] as an [[Iodine-123]]-labelled [[SPECT]] tracer for imaging benzodiazepine receptors ([[GABAA receptors|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]]) in the brain. Iomazenil is an analogue of [[flumazenil]] (Ro15-1788).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Höll|first=K|author2=Deisenhammer E |author3=Dauth J |author4=Carmann H |author5=Schubiger PA |year=1989|title=Imaging benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)|journal=Int J Rad Appl Instrum B|volume=16|issue=8|pages=759–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in brain research==
&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-labelled iomazenil can be used to image [[epileptic seizure]] foci as an alternative to [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fludeoxyglucose]] [[Brain positron emission tomography|PET imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kung|first=Hank F. |author2=Mei-Ping Kung |author3=Seok Rye Choi|date=January 2003|title=Radiopharmaceuticals for single-photon emission computed tomography brain imaging|journal=Seminars in Nuclear Medicine|volume=33|issue=1|pages=2–13|pmid=12605353|url=http://www.seminarsinnuclearmedicine.com/article/S0001-2998%2803%2980002-8/abstract|doi=10.1053/snuc.2003.127296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goethals|first=I|author2=Van de Wiele C |author3=Boon P |author4=Dierckx R |date=February 2003|title=Is central benzodiazepine receptor imaging useful for the identification of epileptogenic foci in localization-related epilepsies?|journal=Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging|volume=30|issue=2|pages=325–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of iomazenil of reducing levels of [[GABA]] in the brain was used by researchers to exacerbate symptoms in patients with [[schizophrenia]] in a laboratory study, supporting the theory that a GABA deficiency underlies that disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=Kyungheup|author2=Gil R |author3=Seibyl J |author4=Sewell RA |author5=D'Souza DC |date=February 2011|title=Probing GABA receptor function in schizophrenia with iomazenil|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|volume=36|issue=3|pages=677–83|pmid=21068719|pmc=3055690|doi=10.1038/npp.2010.198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol treatment==
Researcher Deepak D'Souza and colleagues at [[Yale University]] and [[Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System]] are testing iomazenil as a potential treatment for [[drunkenness]] due to its ability to bind alcohol receptors in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/tests-begin-on-new-drinkbusting-drug-7742366.html|title=Tests begin on new drink-busting drug|last=Dobson|first=Roger|author2=Jonathan Owen|date=13 May 2012|work=Independent on Sunday|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bosley Ziegler''' (''ca.'' 1920–1983)&amp;nbsp;— known as '''John Ziegler''' and '''Montana Jack'''&amp;nbsp;—  was the American [[physician]] who originally developed the [[anabolic steroid]] [[Methandrostenolone]] ([[Dianabol]], DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]].&lt;ref name="JZ02"&gt;[http://www.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/102.pdf NIDA Research Monograph 1990, Number 102, p97]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JZ01"/&gt; He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]], administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion [[Bill March]] of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/4547/trivia.html |title=Heartland - Pennsylvania firsts - First use of anabolic steroids in sports |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027142318/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/4547/trivia.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was banned by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) under the [[Controlled Substances Act]].  In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying "It is bad enough to have to deal with [[drug addicts]], but now healthy [[sportsperson|athletes]] are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?".&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''Death in the Locker Room'', Bob Goldman's history of drugs and sports&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler suffered from [[heart disease]], which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and he died from heart failure in 1983.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ziegler was born in the [[Midwestern United States]] but he returned to his family roots in southern [[Pennsylvania]] and graduated from [[Gettysburg College]] in 1942. He was descended from three generations of doctors going back to the [[American Civil War]], and his father had been both practicing physician and a scientist who had discovered the salt tablet.&lt;ref name="JZ01"&gt;John D. Fair, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080528195958/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1993/JSH2001/jsh2001b.pdf "Isometrics or Steroids? Exploring New Frontiers Of Strength in the Early 1960s], Journal of Sport History, Vol. 20. No. 1 (Spring 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as an officer in the [[United States Marine Corps]] in the Pacific in [[World War II]], where he suffered extensive bullet wounds. His experience of surgery and convalescence lead to a speciality in recuperative medicine at the [[University of Maryland Medical School]]. He served his internship and residency at Marine hospitals in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[Virginia]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] [[Alabama]], before completing a two-year residence in [[neurology]] at [[Tulane University|Tulane University School of Medicine]] in [[New Orleans]]. In 1954 after he settled in [[Olney, Maryland|Olney]], [[Maryland]] he specialized in the treatment of handicapped and seriously injured patients whilst conducting part-time chemistry research at Ciba Pharmaceuticals in Summit, N.J.&lt;ref name="JZ01"/&gt;

He became an enthusiastic weightlifter who pumped iron at the [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] Barbell Club, which was at the center of American fitness training thanks to its owner [[Bob Hoffman (promoter)|Bob Hoffman]]. Hoffman had competed with [[Joe Weider]] and [[Charles Atlas]] for the title of [[AAU Mr. America|Mr America]] and wrote the book ''Weight Lifting'' in 1939. Ziegler's scientific credentials supplemented Hoffman's bodybuilding theories. Ziegler befriended weightlifter and bodybuilder champion [[John Grimek]] who was employed by Hoffman.&lt;ref name="JZ01"/&gt;

===Developing anabolic steroids===
In October 1954, Ziegler, went to [[Vienna]] with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physicist who, over "a few drinks", repeatedly asked "What are you giving your boys?" When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried weak doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on three lifters, John Grimek, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce, but there were side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;Laure, P.: Les répresentations du dopage; approche psycho-sociologique, Thèse STAPS, Nancy, France, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; With the research assistance of Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ziegler began to look for synthetic substance that would mimic testosterone. Working at CIBA allowed Ziegler access to books and records from Germany where experiments with testosterone had been carried out by the Nazis, and which had been confiscated by the United States after the war.&lt;ref name="JZ01"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FF&gt;Frank Fitzpatrick, [http://articles.philly.com/2002-10-20/sports/25352734_1_steroids-york-barbell-chuck-yesalis "Where steroids were all the rage"], Philadelphia Inquirer, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the U.S. in 1958 by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]].&lt;ref name="JZ02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JZ01"/&gt;

Ziegler gave Dianabol to the entire U.S. Olympic weightlifting team in Rome in 1960, but they still lost to the Soviets.&lt;ref name=FF/&gt; He gave up experimentation with athletes when he learned that some who had taken 20 times the recommended dose of Dianabol had developed a liver condition. He was quoted in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1972 saying "I lost interest in fooling with IQ's of that caliber. Now it's about as widespread among these idiots as marijuana."&lt;ref name=science176&gt;Wade, N., 1972. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1734568 Anabolic steroids: doctors denounce them, but athletes aren’t listening]. Science 176, 1399–1403.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years Ziegler regretted introducing AAS to athletes. He recollected "but I wish to God now I’d never done it. I’d like to go back and take that whole chapter out of my life."&lt;ref name="JZ01"/&gt;

'''Lake Czorsztyn''' ({{lang-pl|Jezioro Czorsztyńskie}}) is a man-made reservoir on the [[Dunajec]] river, southern [[Poland]], between the [[Pieniny]] and the [[Gorce Mountains]]. It owes its existence to a [[dam]], which is located in the village of [[Niedzica]].

The dam itself was completed in 1995. Its measurements are: {{convert|56|m}} high, {{convert|400|m}} long and {{convert|7|m}} wide on top. The lake has the area ranging from {{convert|4.15|km2}} to {{convert|13.35|km2}}. Usually, its area is approximately {{convert|11|km2}}, with the length of {{convert|9|km}} and width of {{convert|1.5|km}}. Maximum depth is {{convert|50|m}}, and average depth is {{convert|17.6|m}}. Total length of the shoreline is {{convert|29.7|km}}. Below the dam there is a much smaller Sromowce Lake, which regulates the water level of Czorsztyn Lake.

Main purpose of the reservoir is to prevent floods in the Dunajec river valley. Furthermore, it attracts a growing number of tourists. The dam is equipped with a 92 megawatt power plant. The lake is located in close proximity of several popular tourist spots, such as [[Pieniny National Park (Poland)|Pieniny National Park]], [[Niedzica Castle]], [[Czorsztyn Castle]], and the tourist village of [[Kluszkowce]]. Among villages located by Czorsztyn Lake are [[Niedzica]], [[Falsztyn]], [[Frydman]], [[Dębno, Nowy Targ County|Dębno Podhalańskie]], [[Maniowy]], [[Kluszkowce]] and [[Czorsztyn]].

It was formed by [[dam]]ming a river valley to produce [[hydroelectricity]]. The lake, with its adjacent [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] habitats, has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an 8600&amp;nbsp;ha [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA).

'''Large group communication''' is a general description for [[organizational communication]] as a communication context describing large numbers of individuals who are members of a group. Large group contexts can include [[community|communities]] of interest, geography, or [[Market (economics)|economy]] brought together by need or self-identification. A company is a large group communication context with specific media, language codes, and methods of interaction that distinguish it from other companies or other groups. Unlike [[small-group communication]] where members interact in primarily synchronous and personal ways, large groups use a host of synchronous and asynchronous methods and media.

{{examples of large group:
workers of the same office, members of the same NGO, members of the club etc
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7836">'''Madras motor neuron disease''' (MMND) is a rare [[motor neuron disease]] originating in South India. Two other forms of the disease have been found, Familial Madras Motor Neuron Disease (FMMND) and the variant Madras Motor Neuron Disease (MMNDV).&lt;ref name= "116 patients" /&gt; The symptoms of MMND include weakness in the arms and legs, loss of vision, and deafness.&lt;ref name= "116 patients" /&gt;  Most affected individuals are diagnosed by the age of 15 and occurs at the same frequency in males and females.&lt;ref name= "116 patients" /&gt; While the cause of the disease and its origins are not yet known, [[supportive care]] is available to individuals affected by the disease.

==Classification==
Madras motor neuron disease (MMND) is a [[motor neuron disease]] affecting primarily [[lower motor neurons]]. It is similar to [[Monomelic amyotrophy]] and primarily affects young adults in southern India.&lt;ref name=Liewluck&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liewluck|first1=Teerin|last2=Saperstein|first2=David S|editor1-last=Dimachkie|editor1-first=Mazen M.|editor2-last=Barohn|editor2-first=Richard J.|title=Motor Neuron Disease, An Issue of Neurologic Clinics|date=November 2015|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323413459|page=766|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt2ZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA766|language=en|chapter=Progressive Muscular Atrophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of a large [[case study]], published in 2008, proposed that MMND be divided into two categories: spontaneously-arising MMND and Familial Madras Motor Neuron Disease (FMMND).&lt;ref name="116 patients"/&gt; Using this method, cases in which the disease is inherited would be categorized as FMMND,&lt;ref name="116 patients" /&gt; while cases that displayed no genetic linkage would be categorized as spontaneously-arising MMND.

According to the same study, there is a variant form known as MMNDV, which is classified by additional [[optic atrophy]].&lt;ref name="116 patients" /&gt;

Due to the rareness of MMND, it is classified as a [[orphan disease]].&lt;ref name="Orphanet2008" /&gt;

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of MMND begin appearing when people are young, often before the age of 15.  An affected individual is generally thin with weak arms and legs.  They may lose control of the muscles that control their face, mouth, nose, and throat. This in turn, will cause difficulties speaking and swallowing. Further complications from the loss of facial motor control include drooling, as well facial droop.  People with MMND may also suffer from a loss of hearing and sight.&lt;ref name=Orphanet2008&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merlini|first1=Luciano|title=Madras motor neuron disease ORPHA:137867|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&amp;Expert=137867|website=Orphanet|accessdate=8 April 2017|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RDI2010/&gt;

==Causes==
The cause of MMND has not yet been determined.  There are cases where MMND appears to be inherited. However, no relevant genes have been identified.&lt;ref name=Orphanet2008/&gt;

MMND affects many [[cranial nerves]], particularly involving the 7th ([[facial nerve]]) and 9th to the 12th cranial nerves (in order: [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], [[vagus nerve]], [[accessory nerve]], [[spinal accessory nerve]]).&lt;ref name="Orphanet2008" /&gt;
[[File:Brain human normal inferior view with labels en.svg|thumb|Brain human normal inferior view with labels en]]

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis requires a [[neurological examination]]. A [[neuroimaging]] exam can also be helpful for diagnosis. For example, an [[MRI]] can be used to discover the atrophy of the specific brain regions.

MMND can be [[Differential diagnosis|differentially diagnosed]] from similar conditions like [[Fazio-Londe syndrome]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], in that those two conditions don't involve [[sensorineural hearing loss]], while MMND, [[Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome]] (BVVLS), Nathalie syndrome, and Boltshauser syndrome do.  Nathalie syndrome does not involve lower cranial nerve symptoms, so it can be excluded if those are present.  If there is evidence of lower motor neuron involvement, Boltshauser syndrome can be excluded.   Finally, if there is a family history of the condition, then BVVLS is more likely, as MMND tends to be sporadic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sathasivam|first1=S|title=Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome.|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|date=17 April 2008|volume=3|pages=9|pmid=18416855|pmc=2346457|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
As of 2010, there was no cure for MMND.&lt;ref name=RDI2010/&gt;  People with MMND are given [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive care]] to help them cope, which can include [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[counselling]], and [[hearing aids]].&lt;ref name=Orphanet2008/&gt;

==Prognosis==
People with MMND become progressively more [[wasting|weak]] with time. Generally, affected individuals survive up to 30 years after they are diagnosed.&lt;ref name=Orphanet2008/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
As of 2008 under 200 cases have been reported worldwide.  The disease affects males and females in equal rates. Most cases have arisen in Southern India in the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], with others being reported in parts of Asia as well a Italy.&lt;ref name=Orphanet2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=RDI2010/&gt;

==History==
Madras motor neuron disease was first described by Meenakshisundaram et al. in [[Chennai]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=RDI2010&gt;{{cite web|last1=Navaneetham|first1=Duraiswamy|title=Madras Motor Neuron Disease|url=http://www.rarediseasesindia.org/madrasmnd|website=Foundation for Research on Rare Diseases and Disorders|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meenakshisundaram|first1=E|last2=Jagannathan|first2=K|last3=Ramamurthi|first3=B|title=Clinical pattern of motor neuron disease seen in younger age groups in Madras.|journal=Neurology India|date=December 1970|volume=18|pages=Suppl 1:109+|pmid=5508105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A 2008 paper presented a study of 116 cases, observed over 36 years.&lt;ref name="116 patients"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nalini|first1=A|last2=Thennarasu|first2=K|last3=Yamini|first3=BK|last4=Shivashankar|first4=D|last5=Krishna|first5=N|title=Madras motor neuron disease (MMND): clinical description and survival pattern of 116 patients from Southern India seen over 36 years (1971-2007).|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=15 June 2008|volume=269|issue=1-2|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.12.026|pmid=18261745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors looked at the [[family tree]]s of people with MMND, and found evidence for [[Autosomal Recessive|autosomal recessive]] inheritance in 15 of the 16 families studied, and [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance in the other.&lt;ref name="116 patients" /&gt; They also described [[postmortem studies]] of people with MMND, and found that the [[spinal cord]] had extreme loss of [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|anterior horn]] cells and [[Demyelinate|demyelination]] and [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] of the ventrolateral columns; which could explain peripheral weakness, paresthesias, or paralysis.  They also found changes in the color of the myelin of the [[optic nerve]]s, decreases in [[Purkinje cell]]s, increase in [[Bergman glia]], demyelination of fibers around the [[dentate nucleus]] with [[gliosis]], swollen globular neurons of deep nuclei of the [[cerebellum]], neural depletion and gliosis of the [[cochlear nucleus]] on both sides of the brainstem, and demyelination and axonal loss of the [[cochlear nerve]]. The authors said that the consistent findings of gliosis shows that inflammation in [[central nervous system]] is a key factor in how the disease harms people.&lt;ref name="116 patients" /&gt;

'''The Charitable Works Foundation of Sister Dulce''', known by its Portuguese acronym as '''OSID''', is a private non-profit philanthropic organization, established on May 26, 1959 by Brazilian Catholic nun [[Sister Dulce]].

It consists of 14 nuclei, 13 of them at the Roma Hospital Complex, a 1.000 bed teaching hospital, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia]]. OSID also operates CESA (Santo Antonio Educational Center), a school that provides free education and social services for 800 children who live in extreme poverty, in Simões Filho, one of the most impoverished cities in the metropolitan region of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].

'''OSID''' provides health, welfare and education services, with a strong commitment to medical education and research and a mission to "love and serve the poorest ones, offering them free health care and education".

It is chartered under Brazilian law; accredited at federal, state and municipal levels; and registered by the National Welfare Council and the Federal Ministry of Education.

== Mission ==

{{Quotation|align=center|

To Love and serve the poorest ones, offering them free health care and education for life.}}

== History ==

'''OSID''' was founded by [[Sister Dulce]] in 1959, as a result of her work with the poor people in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].

Since 1949, the [[Irmã Dulce (Sister Dulce)|Servant of God]] had been providing health care for over 70 people in her [[convent]]'s chicken yard. Then, the lack of physical structure was compensated by [[Sister Dulce]]'s tireless determination and managerial capacity and the volunteer support of friendly doctors and the community as a whole. [[Sister Dulce]] used to walk the streets both at night, searching for sick people who had nowhere to go, and during the day, collecting food, medicines and whatever else people donated.

In 1960, a year after the foundation of '''OSID''', the Santo Antônio Hospital, then with 150 beds, was inaugurated.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the organization went through of structural consolidation. An advisory council was established in order to help [[Sister Dulce]] manage '''OSID'''. During that time, a medical residency program was put in place.

After that period, expanding the services and ensuring the permanence of '''OSID''' became the main concern of [[Sister Dulce]]. In 1983, the new 1.000 beds Santo Antônio Hospital was inaugurated. Relation with the business sector and with the government were increased and an effort is made to make the management of the organization more professional.

In the late 1980s, due to economical instability and increased patient demand, '''OSID''' wentthrough a financial crisis, which worsened with [[Sister Dulce]]'s deteriorating health condition. The institution established an agreement with INAMPS (National Social Security Institute for Medical Assistance), currently INSS. The agreement was still valid after the federal public health system was unified by SUS (Sistema Único de Saúde, or United Health System).

At that time, already very debilitated, Sister Dulce expressed her wish that her niece Maria Rita Pontes was placed at the head of OSID, which takes place in 1992.

On March 13, 1992, Sister Dulce died. The death of its founder put the future of OSID in doubt and the institution focused on their mission, in order to overcome the obstacles.

In the decade after Sister Dulce's death, '''OSID''' inaugurated 6 new nuclei, along with a [[Pediatric]] and an Adult [[Intensive Care Unit|Intensive Care Center]] and the Center for Admission and Treatment of Alcoholics (CATA). The Santo Antonio Educacional Center started taking care of over 600 children, offering them free basic and technical education.

Since 2000, the organization reformed its organizational structure and invested in strategic areas like [[Information technology]], research, communication and company history, in order to support the increase in services provided ant to make possible a secure planning in the next years, facing self-sustainability as its biggest challenge. In 2001, '''OSID''' was awarded the ISO 9001–2000 certificate.

After a period of planned growth, [[inflation]], loss of [[revenue]] and even bigger increase in patient demand (21,75% in Santo Antônio Hospital), caused '''OSID''' to go through another financial crisis in 2003, forcing the management to cut down on its expenses severely.

== Present ==

Nowadays, 14 years after the death of its founder, '''OSID''' is the major health institution in the north and northeast of [[Brazil]].  '''OSID''' is responsible for the majority of patients service in the state of [[Bahia]] and is one of the top ten in the entire country.

It is the only health institution in Brazil with more than 1.000 beds provided exclusively on a public-care basis through SUS. The Roma Hospital Complex has 1.009 beds and houses, approximately, 400 [[Inpatient#Outpatient vs Inpatient|in-patients]] in residencial care facilities for the elderly. The hallmark of '''OSID''' is humanized care and the practice of providing free services is faithful to Sister Dulce's wish of always keeping her door open to the needy.

Today, '''OSID''' owns 173.000 square meters of land, of which 39.000 square meters are occupied by constructed facilities at the Roma Hospital complex.

== OSID Nuclei ==

* '''Santo Antonio Hospital'''

With 17 medical specialties for patients, approximately 1,000 surgeries are performed each month at HSA. In 2002, HSA's surgical center was accredited under ISO 9001:2000 and registered 14,500 hospitalizations.  The hospital has 10 wards, divided into Medical Care, Long-Term Medical Care (chronic patients), Surgery, Peritoneal Dialysis, Physiology, and an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The hospital also houses a medical teaching unit, the Professor Adib Jatene Center, for Teaching and Research (CEPPAJ). Ten areas of medical specialization are offered by CEPPAJ and, at any given time, approximately 300 residents and interns are all working to receive their professional qualifications.

* '''José Sarney Ambulatory'''

The Ambulatory is the entrance door for all who come to OSID for health care. With 33 medical specialties and a Physical Therapy Unit complete with state-of-the-art equipment, the Ambulatory provides services to approximately 3,000 people every day (or a total of almost 100,000 patient services each month).

* '''Children's Hospital'''

The Children's Hospital is widely considered an exemplary model of humanistic services for pediatric patients.  The hospital has 102 beds, an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and a variety of surgical and clinical specializations.  Providing services to children and adolescents up to the age of eighteen, the hospital's facilities are adapted to accommodate different age groups.  The hospital's model of patient care relies heavily on support from mothers (and fathers) as care givers.  The hospital, which combines health care and socio-educational programs such as the School in the Hospital and Family Health, is also an important resource in Bahia for the treatment of children who are victims of abuse.  It is also the only health center in Bahia that complies with all the Ministry of Justice's requirements regarding the rights of hospitalized children and adolescents.

* '''Dona Dulcinha' Women Clinic'''

Focusing on holistic services for women, the D. Dulcinha Women's Clinic provided 128,000 patient services in 2005, including ambulatory and cancer prevention gynecology procedures. A strong focus on psychological assistance for patients and family planning guidance is an integral part of the clinic

* '''Center for the Rehabilitation and Prevention of Deficiencies (CRPD)'''

Giving priority to citizenship and the [[social insertion]] of people with special needs, CRPD provides out-patient and in-patient assistance to 123 residents. In 2005, its Information Technology Program, which was awarded the Banco do Brazil/Unesco Award of Social Technology, provided training and developmental activities for 150 students with special needs.

* '''Augusto Lopes Pontes Social Medical Center (CMSALP)'''

As a mirror of Sister Dulce's philosophy, the nucleus provides services to socially disabled patients (people who live on the streets, alcoholics, and those with moderate physical and mental disabilities). The center has 188 beds and recorded 1,051 in-patient services in 2005. At present, the center houses 30 residents—socially disabled patients with no family reference.  CMSALP is also the only center in Bahia which provides in-patient services for alcoholics.  In addition to recorded hospitalizations, the Center for Assisting and Treating Alcoholism (CATA) provided 11,743 out-patient services in 2005 including detoxification, welfare, social and psychological assistance, and occupational therapy.

* '''BioImaging'''
In 2005, the BioImaging Nuclei, equipped with state-of-the-art technology, performed 98,224 tests, including digestive tract endoscopies, mammograms, ultra-sonograms, echocardiograms, and tomograms (CAT scans).  It is the only center in the state of Bahia to perform CAT scans on a public care basis through SUS (United Health System).  For some procedures, the cost of the material, provided free-of-charge to patients, is more expensive than the costs reimbursed by the SUS.

* '''Rehabilitation Center for Craniofacial Anomalies (Centrinho)'''

Considered a national point of reference by the Ministry of Health for the correction of craniofacial anomalies, a condition which affects approximately 30,000 people in Bahia, Centrinho is Brazil's second leading recovery center for facial cleft patients.  In 2005, it provided 134,416 patient services and 1,192 surgeries. Its multidisciplinary services focus on special areas including: Speech Therapy, Medical Care, Ortorhinology, Psychology, Pediatrics, Plastic Surgery, Nursing, Social Service, Odontology, Buccomaxilillary, Facial Surgery and Stomatology. The Antalgic Therapy Clinic, which is part of the nucleus, operates under the philosophy of holistic recovery and expert integration for the treatment of patients with chronic pain.

* '''Santo Antonio Educational Center'''

In Simões Filho, one of the poorest cities in the state of Bahia, OSID operates the Santo Antonio Educational Center (CESA—Centro Educacional Santo Antonio).  At CESA, OSID provides free educational programs for approximately 800 children and youth ranging from 6 to 19 years of age.  CESA offers basic education in accordance with the guidelines of the Brazilian Federal Ministry of Education.  In addition, CESA has developed a complementary program of educational, physical and professional development activities to help students learn more effectively and enrich their lives.

In order to include these complementary activities, CESA has adopted a full-time educational model where the students spent the whole day at the institution participating in different types of activities meant to complement their elementary education within diversified learning environments. Students have access to a state-of-the-art computer laboratory and multi-media presentation center, a library, sports and entertainment programs including Capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial arts and dance discipline. There are also specialized courses for young people over the age of 17 who are preparing to become professional bakers and electricians and a special program to help young women prepare for careers in commercial decorating and painting.

Among the trade courses offered by the CESA, the bakery program offers a credential from SENAI (a federal training institution for technicians and tradesmen) and stands out, having achieved significant levels of job placement within the local economy.

OSID provides everything free-of-charge to CESA students, including basic health care, dental care, course materials, prepared meals and family counseling.  All of this represents a tremendous advantage in a region where 85% of families survive on less than one US dollar a day per person and some families have no income whatsoever.  OSID operates the programs at CESA in keeping with its core philosophy of helping at-risk children and youth recover their citizenship.

* '''Júlia Magalhães Geriatric Center'''

CGJM is the only institution in Bahia recognized by the Ministry of Health to provide a full range of services for the elderly including out-patients, in-patients, and members of the community. The center performed 49,745 procedures in 2005 in addition to the in-patient services provided for its 83 long-term residents. The center offers programs including Third Age Education, Gymnastics, Cultural and Familiarity Group, as well as a special program for dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. The center also provides assistance including health advice and physical and recreational activities to elderly members of the community.

* '''Taciano Campos Laboratory'''

The Taciano Campos Laboratory performed 967,000 tests in 2005, all on a public care basis through SUS (United Health System).  The laboratory has been awarded the Gold Award Certificate of the Brazilian Society of Clinical Analysis which is granted to laboratories that have received a rating of "excellent" for monthly audits performed over a ten-year period.

* '''Research Support Nucleus'''

CPEC's objectives relate specifically to research on social pathologies and focus on improving therapies, diagnosis and prevention of prevailing diseases which affect the needy. The advanced technical level of CPEC has helped make it one of the world's leading centers for the research and development of vaccines which target the prevention of cervical and prostate cancer.  The center's excellence in research is reflected by strong partnerships with the Osvaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) and Cornell University and the University of California, Berkeley in the United States, as well as countless publications of papers in Brazilian and international scientific journals.  At the present time, CPEC is concentrating its efforts on the research programs including: bacterial resistance to antibiotics, virus HTLV II infection, Helicobacter Pylori infections, prevention and control of visceral leishmaniasis, a vaccine to prevent HPV/cervical cancer, urinary tract infections from escherichia coli, epidemiology of masculine aging, and a vaccine to prevent prostate cancer.
* '''Sister Dulce's Memorial'''
OSID's Memorial, its 14th Nuclei, preserves the history of Sister Dulce's life and institutional history.  Documents and photos, which trace the path followed by the one called the Mother of the Poor and the Good Angel of Bahia, are filed in the nucleus. Sister Dulce's Memorial houses approximately three thousand testimonies of the graces that were obtained. The investment in its perpetuation has as its pillar the Sister's canonization process, which started in January 2000 with the aim of having the Catholic Church acknowledge the virtues and the tireless determination of one of God's Servants who dedicated her life to the needy. Presently, the process, whose postulator is an Italian Friar, Paolo Lombardo, is following the procedural steps from the Congregation to the Cause of Saints in the Vatican. With the presentation of the Positio, a canonic law text that summarizes the process and the history of the virtues and the possible miracle already identified by the Vatican, the beatification is getting closer.  As part of the work in favor of this cause, OSID has invested in the dissemination of Sister Dulce's life, launching a book of thoughts and her biography, as well as the construction of the Church of Our Lady of the Conception of God's mother.  As a symbol of Sister Dulce's legacy of action and faith, the church building complies with the Vatican's recommendation as reinforcement to the beatification process and gives more institutional feasibility to OSID.

* '''Professor Adib Jatene Learning and Research  Center (CEPPAJ)'''
Started in the 1970s, the work of the Medical Education OSID, consolidated from the 1990s, has residencies in the specialties of Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Maxillofacial Surgery, Anesthesiology, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatric Surgery, Geriatrics, Pediatrics, Pediatric Intensive Care, Urology, Pediatrics Hematologic, Head and Neck Surgery and Boarding school in the specialties of Gynecology, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine and General Surgery.

The faculty is composed of preceptors, masters and doctors, serving approximately 500 residents and interns from Brazil and abroad. Students have, in addition to hospital structure, with a unique space for lectures and seminars and lectures, the Center for Teaching and Research Professor [[Adib Domingos Jatene|Adib Jatene]] (CEPPAJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.irmadulce.org.br/obrassociais/pesquisa_CEPPAJ.php|title = Centro de Ensino e Pesquisa Professor Adib Jatene (CEPPAJ)|accessdate = 19 April 2014|publisher = OSID|language = pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy''' ('''PEG''') is an [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] [[medical procedure]] in which a tube ('''PEG tube''') is passed into a patient's stomach through the [[abdominal wall]], most commonly to provide a means of feeding when [[Mouth|oral]] intake is not adequate (for example, because of [[dysphagia]] or [[sedation]]). This provides [[enteral]] nutrition (making use of the natural [[digestion]] process of the [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]) despite bypassing the mouth; enteral nutrition is generally preferable to [[parenteral nutrition]] (which is only used when the GI tract must be avoided). The PEG procedure is an alternative to open surgical [[gastrostomy]] insertion, and does not require a [[general anesthetic]]; [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|mild sedation]] is typically used. PEG tubes may also be extended into the [[small intestine]] by passing a jejunal extension tube ('''PEG-J tube''') through the PEG tube and into the [[jejunum]] via the [[pylorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Discussion |work=BCM Gastroenterology Grand Rounds |publisher=Baylor College of Medicine |url=http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/DDC/grandrounds/BCM/8-10-06/09-DISC.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEG administration of enteral feeds is the most commonly used method of nutritional support for patients in the community. Many [[stroke]] patients, for example, are at risk of [[aspiration pneumonia]] due to poor control over the swallowing muscles; some will benefit from a PEG performed to maintain nutrition. PEGs may also be inserted to decompress the [[stomach]] in cases of [[gastric volvulus]].&lt;ref name=Gauderer01&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gauderer MW |title=Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-20 years later: a historical perspective |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=217–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11150469 |doi=10.1053/jpsu.2001.20058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications==
Gastrostomy may be indicated in numerous situations, usually those in which normal (or [[nasogastric tube|nasogastric]]) feeding is impossible. The causes for these situations may be neurological (e.g. [[stroke]]), anatomical (e.g. [[cleft lip and palate]] during the process of correction) or other (e.g. [[radiation therapy]] for tumors in head &amp; neck region).

In certain situations where normal or nasogastric feeding is not possible, gastrostomy may be of no clinical benefit. In advanced [[dementia]], studies show that PEG placement does not in fact prolong life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy LM, Lipman TO |title=Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy does not prolong survival in patients with dementia |journal=Arch. Intern.

A gastrostomy can be placed to decompress the stomach contents in a patient with a malignant bowel obstruction. This is referred to as a "venting PEG" and is placed to prevent and manage nausea and vomiting.

A gastrostomy can also be used to treat [[volvulus]] of the stomach, where the stomach twists along one of its axes.  The tube (or multiple tubes) is used for gastropexy, or adhering the stomach to the abdominal wall, preventing twisting of the stomach.&lt;ref name=Gauderer01/&gt;

A PEG tube can be used in providing gastric or post-surgical drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Waldby, "PEG-J Gastrostomy drainage jejunal feeding tubes" {{cite web |url=http://surgnurseslinks.com/caluso.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716165120/http://surgnurseslinks.com/caluso.htm |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[Image:PEG tube kit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|PEG tube, cannula and guidewire (Pull Technique)]]
Two major techniques for placing PEGs have been described in the literature.

The Gauderer-Ponsky technique involves performing a [[gastroscopy]] to evaluate the [[anatomy]] of the [[stomach]].  The anterior stomach wall is identified and techniques are used to ensure that there is no [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] between the wall and the [[skin]]:
* digital pressure is applied to the abdominal wall, which can be seen indenting the anterior gastric wall by the endoscopist.
* transillumination (diaphanoscopy): the light emitted from the endoscope within the stomach can be seen through the abdominal wall.
* a small (21G, 40mm) needle is passed into the stomach before the larger cannula is passed.
An [[catheter|angiocath]] is used to puncture the abdominal wall through a small [[Surgical incision|incision]], and a soft guidewire is inserted through this and pulled out of the [[mouth]].  The feeding tube is attached to the guidewire and pulled through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and out of the incision.&lt;ref name=Gauderer01/&gt;

In the Russell introducer technique, the [[Seldinger technique]] is used to place a wire into the stomach, and a series of dilators are used to increase the size of the [[gastrostomy]].  The tube is then pushed in over the wire.&lt;ref name="pmid3349370"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deitel M, Bendago M, Spratt EH, Burul CJ, To TB |title=Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy by the "pull" and "introducer" methods |journal=Can J Surg |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=102–4 |year=1988 |pmid=3349370 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
As with other types of feeding tubes, care must be made to place PEGs into an appropriate population.  The following are contraindications to PEG use:&lt;ref&gt;Gastroenterological endoscopy. Meinhard Classen, G. N. J. Tytgat, Charles J. Lightdale. 2002. {{ISBN|978-1-58890-013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute contraindications===
* Inability to perform an [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]]
* Uncorrected [[coagulopathy]]
* [[Peritonitis]]
* Untreatable (loculated) massive [[ascites]]
* [[Bowel obstruction]] (unless the PEG is sited to provide drainage)

===Relative contraindications===
* Massive [[ascites]]
* Gastric mucosal abnormalities: large [[gastric varices]], portal hypertensive gastropathy
* Previous [[abdominal surgery]], including previous partial [[gastrectomy]]: increased risk of organs interposed between gastric wall and abdominal wall
* [[Morbid obesity]]: difficulties in locating stomach position by digital indentation of stomach and transillumination
* Gastric wall [[neoplasm]]
* Abdominal wall [[infection]]: increased risk of infection of PEG site
* Intra-abdmominal malignancy with peritoneal involvement (tumor seeding into formed channel with subsequent failure)

===In advanced dementia===
The [[American Medical Directors Association]], the [[American Geriatrics Society]] and the [[American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]] recommend against inserting percutaneous feeding tubes in individuals with advanced dementia and, instead, recommend oral assisted feedings. Artificial nutrition neither prolongs life nor improves its quality in patients with advanced dementia. It may increase the risk of the patient inhaling food, it does not reduce suffering, it may cause fluid overload, diarrhea, abdominal pain and local complications, and can reduce the amount of human interaction the patient experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lay summary: {{cite web |url= http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ChoosingWiselyFeedingTubeAGS-ER.pdf|title= Feeding tubes for people with Alzheimer’s disease: When you need them — and when you don’t|date= |website= |publisher= Consumer Reports|accessdate=6 December 2013}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
* [[Cellulitis]] (infection of the skin) around the gastrostomy site
* [[Hemorrhage]]
* [[Gastric ulcer]] either at the site of the button or on the opposite wall of the stomach ("kissing ulcer")
* Perforation of [[Intestine|bowel]] (most commonly [[transverse colon]]) leading to [[peritonitis]]
* Puncture of the left lobe of the [[liver]] leading to liver capsule pain
* Gastrocolic fistula: this may be suspected if diarrhea appears a short time after feeding.

==Removal of PEG tubes==
[[Image:PEG removal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Endoscopic removal of PEG tube]]

===Indications===
* PEG tube no longer required (recovery of swallow after [[stroke]] or brain trauma, or after surgery or radiotherapy for [[head and neck cancer]])
* Persistent infection of PEG site
* Failure, breakage or deterioration of PEG tube (a new tube can be sited along the existing track)
* "Buried bumper syndrome"

===Techniques===
PEG tubes with rigid, fixed "bumpers" are removed endoscopically. The PEG tube is pushed into the stomach so that part of the tube is visible behind the bumper. An endoscopy snare is then passed through the endoscope, and passed over the bumper so that the tube adjacent to the bumper is grasped. The external part of the tube is then cut, and the tube is withdrawn into the stomach, and then pulled up into the esophagus and removed through the mouth. The PEG site heals without intervention.

PEG tubes with a collapsible or deflatable bumper can be removed using traction (simply by pulling the PEG tube out through the abdominal wall).

==History==
The first percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy performed on a child was on June 12, 1979 at the [[Rainbow Babies &amp; Children's Hospital]], [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]]. Dr. Michael W.L. Gauderer, pediatric surgeon, Dr. Jeffrey Ponsky, endoscopist, and Dr. James Bekeny, surgical resident, performed the procedure on a {{frac|4|1|2}}-month-old child with inadequate oral intake.&lt;ref name=Gauderer80&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gauderer MW, Ponsky JL, Izant RJ |title=Gastrostomy without laparotomy: a percutaneous endoscopic technique |journal=J.

Gauderer and Dr. Jeffrey Ponsky, first published the technique in 1980.&lt;ref name=Gauderer80/&gt; In 2001, the details of the development of the procedure were published, the first author being the originator of the technique itself.&lt;ref name=Gauderer01/&gt;

The '''PolyIran''' study is a pragmatic open-labeled randomized trial being conducted within Golestan cohort study (GCS) on 31000 subjects in 305 villages of [[Golestan Province]],  northeastern [[Iran]]. The pill used in this study namely "Polypill", has been successfully evaluated in a pilot study and consists of 4 components.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;POLYIRAN in Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Middle-aged and Elderly Iranian. Available from: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01271985 (Accessed 7/1/2011).&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated to decrease the death rate due to myocardial infarction and stroke by 30-53% .&lt;ref&gt;Cardiovascular disease prevention using fixed dose pharmacotherapy in Iran: updated meta-analyses and mortality estimation. Sepanlou SG, Farzadfar F, Jafari E, Danaei G. Arch Iran Med. 2012 Sep;15(9):531-7. doi: 012159/AIM.004.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were enrolled to the study during February 2011 and April 2013.  The study will directly evaluate effect of Polypill tablet on cardiovascular death and hospitalizations compared to life style modification during 5 years of follow-up; unlike most of the studies that only investigate  the impact of Polypill on indirect surrogate markers of cardiovascular  diseases such as blood pressure or lipid profile. The study includes three arms. The first and largest arm (24000 subjects) are being just followed and receive no particular care other than care provided by governmental health system in Iran (usual care arm). The second arm (3500 subjects) receive recommendation about healthy lifestyle in face to face interviews and pamphlets, undergo blood pressure measurements in 6 months regular intervals and are referred to secondary or tertiary medical centers for treatment upon necessity(minimal care arm). The third arm (another 3500 subjects)  receive Polypill once daily in addition to care provided to minimal care arm (Polypill arm) .&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt; In case of a substantial decrease in mortality in Polypill arm at the end of the study, Polypill might be offered to all individuals above 50 years old as a cheap preventive alternative for [[cardiovascular disease]]s .&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;

'''[[Psychosomatic]] medicine''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] medical field exploring the relationships among social, psychological, and behavioral factors on bodily processes and [[quality of life]] in humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thure von Uexküll|Uexküll, Thure von]] (ed.), 1997. ''Psychosomatic Medicine''. München: Urban &amp; Schwarzenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic forebear of the modern field of [[behavioral medicine]] and a part of the practice of [[Liaison psychiatry|consultation-liaison psychiatry]], psychosomatic medicine integrates interdisciplinary evaluation and management involving diverse specialties including [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[neurology]], [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[allergy]], [[dermatology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]]. Clinical situations where mental processes act as a major factor affecting medical outcomes are areas where psychosomatic medicine has competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenson| first = James L. | title = Essentials of Psychosomatic Medicine| publisher = American Psychiatric Press Inc|year=2006| isbn = 978-1-58562-246-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychosomatic disorders==
{{Main|Psychoneuroimmunology}}
Some physical diseases are believed to have a mental component derived from the stresses and strains of everyday living. This has been suggested, for example, of [[lower back pain]] and [[high blood pressure]], which some researchers have suggested may be related to [[Stress (biology)|stress]]es in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Sarno| first = John| title = The Divided Mind| publisher =  ReganBooks|year=2006 | isbn = 0-06-085178-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within a psychosomatic framework, mental and emotional states are seen as capable of significantly influencing the course of any physical illness. Psychiatry traditionally distinguishes between psychosomatic disorders, disorders in which mental factors play a significant role in the development, expression, or resolution of a physical illness, and somatoform disorders, disorders in which mental factors are the sole cause of a physical illness.
Freud gave the world the famous theory of the "unconscious" as a product of displacement. As a result, as mentioned earlier, some fairly serious diseases fell into the category of "hysterical" or "psychosomatic". We are talking about the following diseases: asthma, allergies, imaginary pregnancy, headache and migraine. Freud himself said the following: "If we chase some problem into the door, then it enters through the window in the form of a symptom of diseases." Thus, a person can not avoid the disease if he does not solve the problem, but simply ignores it.
The basis of psychosomatics is the mechanism of psychological protection-displacement. This means something like this: each of us tries to drive away thoughts that are unpleasant to him. In the end, we simply reject problems, not solve them. We do not analyze problems because we are afraid to look them in the eye and face them directly. It is much easier to close your eyes to them, try not to think about unpleasant things. Unfortunately, the displacement in this way, problems don't disappear, they just move on to another level. All our problems, as a result, are transformed from the social level (that is, interpersonal relationships) or psychological (unfulfilled desires, our dreams and aspirations, suppressed emotions, internal conflicts), to the level of our physiology. '''Stress is a part of our everyday life. Stress is normal. There is good stress, and of course, bad stress. Good stress can motivate someone to do better. According to an article, ''The Effects of Stress on Your Body'', “For immediate, short-term situations, stress can be beneficial to your health. It can help you cope with potentially serious situations. Your body responds to stress by releasing hormones that increase your heart and breathing rates and ready you muscles to respond” (healthline.com).'''

'''Psych means mind or psyche and soma, meaning body.  The term Psychosomatic disorder has mainly been used to define a physical disease that has been cause or made worse by mental factors or mental factors can cause physical symptoms but there is no evidence of a disease  (centerforaxietydisorders.com). An example headaches or chest pain can be caused by someone who is under a lot of stress, but no physical disease can be found to back the evidence up. Anxiety and stress can make the physical symptoms worse than what they were before. For example, if someone has headaches, the headaches can be made worse if someone us experiencing a lot of anxiety and/or stress. “Physical symptoms that are cause by mental factors are also called somatization or somatoform disorders” (centerforanxietydisorders.com). Symptoms such as headaches, chest pain, pain in the arms and legs or other limbs, sickness and weak immune symptoms, are caused by increased activity of the nervous impulses that are sent from the brain to other parts of the body. “A number of factors may play a role in psychosomatic disorders, such as personality traits; genetic or environmental family influences; biological factors; learned behavior and more” (centerforaxietydisorders.com). A person’s current mental state is important.''' 

'''The best way to deal with stress is to learn how to manage it effectively. Some helpful tips to managing stress are practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness is the state or quality of being conscious or aware of something. This can be achieved by focusing yourself awareness on something that is present, in the moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one’s  circumstances, feelings, emotions, senses, thoughts, and bodily sensations. Some examples of mindfulness are yoga, meditating, taking an object and focusing on the texture, feel, and smell. Drinking a cup of warm tea and feeling the heat from the cup, being released into your palms. Taking a hot shower to release tension, self-care, getting an adequate amount of sleep, reading a book, taking a walk, there are so many positive ways to reduce stress and these things should be incorporated in everyday life.''' 

'''“Psychosomatic medicine is an interdisciplinary medical field exploring the relationships among social, psychological, and behavioral factors on bodily processes and quality of life in humans and animals” (disabled-world.com).''' 

'''Psychosomatic disorders can be classified into three different forms or categories:''' 

'''The first form is can include those who have both, a medical symptoms and mental illness.''' 

'''The second form would be those who experience a psychiatric issue that can be direct result of a medical illness and/ or the treatment. An example for this can be someone who is depressed due to a chronic or terminal illness such as cancer.'''

'''The third form is somatoform disorders. These are more of the psychiatric disorders that derive from physical issues. These disorders are based from physical disorders that result to psychological factors. They include the following: somatization (physical), conversion (neurological), body dysmorphic obsession with image), and hypochondriasis disorders(fear of having a disease). Treatment for psychosomatic disorders can include referral to a psychiatrist, medication, or treatments such as CBT. “Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is often the treatment of choice for a psychosomatic disorder. This therapy helps patients learn new ways to cope with and solve their problems as they gain a deeper understanding of their condition or circumstances. Patients will also learn to set realistic life goals and identify and change behaviors or thoughts that have negative effects on their lives” (centerforanxietydisorders.com).'''

It is difficult to establish for certain whether an illness has a psychosomatic component. A psychosomatic component is often inferred when there are some aspects of the patient's presentation that are unaccounted for by biological factors, or some cases where there is no biological explanation at all. For instance, ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' causes 80% of [[peptic ulcers]]. However, most people living with ''Helicobacter pylori'' do not develop ulcers, and 20% of patients with ulcers have no ''H. pylori'' infection. Therefore, in these cases, psychological factors could still play some role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fink|first1=G.|title=Stress Controversies: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Hippocampal Volume, Gastroduodenal Ulceration*|journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology|date=February 2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=107–117|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2010.02089.x|pmid=20973838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), there are abnormalities in the behavior of the gut. However, there are no actual structural changes in the gut, so stress and emotions might still play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Melmed| first =  Raphael N. | title = Mind, Body and Medicine: An Integrative Text| publisher = Oxford University Press Inc, USA| year = 2001| pages = 191–192 | isbn = 978-0-19-513164-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest perspective on psychosomatic disorders is that attempting to distinguish between purely physical and mixed psychosomatic disorders is increasingly obsolete as almost all physical illness have mental factors that determine their onset, presentation, maintenance, susceptibility to treatment, and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/borderline-mental-disorders-chronic-diseases-digestive-system-children-adolescents/|title=[Borderline mental disorders in chronic diseases of the digestive system in children and adolescents]|first=V.

Korsakova}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, even the course of serious illnesses, such as cancer, can potentially be influenced by a person's thoughts, feelings and general state of mental health.

Addressing such factors is the remit of the applied field of [[behavioral medicine]]. In modern society, psychosomatic aspects of illness are often attributed to [[stress (medicine)|stress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = I. H. Treasaden| first = Basant K. Puri, P. J. Laking| title = Textbook of Psychiatry| publisher = Churchill Livingstone| year = 2002| pages = 7| isbn = 978-0-443-07016-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the remediation of stress one important factor in the development, treatment, and prevention of psychosomatic illness.

==Connotations of the term "psychosomatic illness"==
In the field of psychosomatic medicine, the phrase "psychosomatic illness" is used more narrowly than it is within the general population. For example, in lay language, the term often encompasses illnesses with no physical basis at all, and even illnesses that are faked ([[malingering]]). In contrast, in contemporary psychosomatic medicine, the term is normally restricted to those illnesses that do have a clear physical basis, but where it is believed that psychological and mental factors also play a role. Some researchers within the field believe that this overly broad interpretation of the term may have caused the discipline to fall into disrepute clinically.&lt;ref name= "greco"&gt;{{cite book | last = Greco| first = Monica| title = Illness as a Work of Thought: Foucauldian Perspective on Psychosomatics| publisher = Routledge| year = 1998| pages = 1–3, 112–116| isbn = 978-0-415-17849-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, among others, the field of behavioral medicine has taken over much of the remit of psychosomatic medicine in practice and there exist large areas of overlap in the scientific research.

==Criticism==
Although lay persons may interpret the field to suggest that a person's mental state can influence the course and severity of even the most severe physical diseases, experts in this area scientifically evaluate such claims through empirical research. For example, early evidence suggested that patients with advanced-stage cancer may be able to survive longer if provided with psychotherapy to improve their social support and outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Fawzy|first1=FI|last2=Fawzy|first2=NW|last3=Hyun|first3=CS|last4=Elashoff|first4=R|last5=Guthrie|first5=D|last6=Fahey|first6=JL|last7=Morton|first7=DL|title=Malignant melanoma.

On the other hand, psychosomatic medicine criticizes the current approach of medical doctors disregarding psychodynamic ideas in their daily practice. For example, it questions the broad acceptance of self-proclaimed diseases such as gluten-intolerance, Lyme disease and Fibromyalgia as a gain of illness for patients to avoid the underlying intra-psychic conflicts eliciting the disease, while at the same time, challenging the reasons for this neglect in the doctors’ own avoidance of their emotional intra-psychic conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rueckert|first1=Kamiar-K.|title=The Nameless Disease|url=http://in-training.org/the-nameless-disease-15606|website=in-training|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
While in the US, psychosomatic medicine is considered a subspecialty of the fields of psychiatry and neurology, in Germany and other European countries it is considered a subspecialty of internal medicine. [[Thure von Uexküll]] and contemporary physicians following his thoughts regard the psychosomatic approach as a core attitude of medical doctors, thereby declaring it not as a subspecialty, but rather an integrated part of every specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  von Uexküll| first = Thure | title = Psychosomatische Medizin|year=2017| pages = 245–246 | isbn = 978-3-437-21833-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical treatments and psychotherapy are used to treat illnesses believed to have a psychosomatic component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] the Persian psychologist-[[Islamic medicine|physicians]] [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi]] (d. 934) and [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi|Haly Abbas]] (d. 994) developed an early model of illness that emphasized the interaction of the mind and the body. They proposed that a patient's [[physiology]] and [[psychology]] can influence one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Deuraseh Nurdeen, Abu Talib Mansor | year = 2005 | title = Mental health in Islamic medical tradition | url = | journal = The International Medical Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 76–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginnings of the 20th century, there was a renewed interest in psychosomatic concepts. Psychoanalyst [[Franz Alexander]] had a deep interest in understanding the dynamic interrelation between mind and body.&lt;ref name= "psydis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Asaad| first = Ghazi | title = Psychosomatic Disorders: Theoretical and Clinical Aspects| publisher = Brunner-Mazel|year=1996| pages = X, 129–130 | isbn = 978-0-87630-803-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] pursued a deep interest in psychosomatic illnesses following his correspondence with [[Georg Groddeck]] who was, at the time, researching the possibility of treating physical disorders through psychological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Erwin| first = Edward | title = The Freud Encyclopedia: Theory, Therapy and Culture| publisher =  Routledge|year=2002| pages = 245–246 | isbn = 978-0-415-93677-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Thure von Uexküll and his colleagues in [[Germany]] and elsewhere proposed a [[biosemiotics|biosemiotic]] theory (the [[umwelt]] concept) that was widely influential as a theoretical framework for conceptualizing mind-body relations.

[[Henri Laborit]], one of the founders of modern neuropsychopharmacology, carried out experiments in the 1970s that showed that illness quickly occurred when there was inhibition of action in rats. Rats in exactly the same stressful situations but whom were not inhibited in their behavior (those who could flee or fight – even if fighting is completely ineffective) had no negative health consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Henri Laborit and the inhibition of action|first=Edward|last=Kunz|date=1 March 2014|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=16|issue=1|pages=113–117|pmid=24733976|pmc=3984888}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that psychosomatic illnesses in humans largely have their source in the constraints that society puts on individuals in order to maintain hierarchical structures of dominance. The film ''[[My American Uncle]]'', directed by [[Alain Resnais]] and influenced by Laborit, explores the relationship between self and society and the effects of the inhibition of action.

'''Sciensano''' is a [[research institute]] and the [[national public health institutes|national public health institute]] of [[Belgium]]. It is a so-called federal [[scientific institution]] that operates under the authority of the federal [[Health minister|minister of Public Health]] and the federal [[Minister of Agriculture (Belgium)|minister of Agriculture]] of Belgium. Sciensano's [[core business]] is scientific [[research]] in the fields of [[public health]], [[animal health]] and [[food safety]]. Sciensano arose in 2017 from the merger of the former Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Centrum voor Onderzoek in Diergeneeskunde en Agrochemie'', in [[French language|French]]: ''Centre d’Étude et de Recherches Vétérinaires et Agrochimiques'', often shortened to CODA-CERVA) and the former Scientific Institute of Public Health (in Dutch: ''Wetenschappelijk Instituut Volksgezondheid'', in French: ''Institut Scientifique de Santé Publique'', often shortened to WIV-ISP). Both institutions were merged because of their complementary activities and to be able to provide a comprehensive answer to the health challenges of the future. More particularly, the merger was based on the [[One Health]] principle that states that the areas of human health, animal health and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] are inherently connected with each other. The merger became official on April 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciensano.be/nl/pershoek/oprichting-van-het-nieuwe-federale-onderzoekscentrum-sciensano|title=Oprichting van het nieuwe federale onderzoekscentrum Sciensano|last=|first=|date=3 April 2018|website=www.sciensano.be|publisher=Sciensano|language=Dutch|trans-title=Establishment of the new federal research center Sciensano|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciensano.be/en/about-sciensano|title=About Sciensano|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciensano.be|publisher=Sciensano|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

* '''Environmental health:''' Sciensano researches and monitors [[environmental health]] and environmental threats to human health. For example, it assesses the risks posed to [[biosafety]] by [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) and develops [[Environmental indicator|environmental indicators]] for a healthier and more [[environmentally friendly]] [[pesticide]] use. It also investigates the health impact of [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciensano.be/sites/www.wiv-isp.be/files/sciensano_plaquette_nl.pdf|title=Levenslang gezond|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciensano.be|publisher=Sciensano|language=Dutch|trans-title=Healthy all life long|format=pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Food consumption and food safety:''' Sciensano analyses the [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary habits]] of the population and whether they meet the [[dietary recommendations]]. It also investigates the presence and impact of GMOs, [[Food microbiology|food pathogens]], [[Food contaminant|food contaminants]], [[Pesticide residue|pesticide residues]], [[Food additive|food additives]], [[nanomaterials]] and other materials that come into contact with food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Health and disease monitoring:''' through different methods, such as nationwide [[Survey (human research)|surveys]], [[Disease registry|disease registries]] and networks of collaborating [[Physician|physicians]], Sciensano collects data about the health of the population, for example about [[Disability|disabilities]] or [[medication]] consumption. This data allows health authorities to evaluate and adjust [[health policy]]. It also follows up on the [[epidemiology]] of [[Infection|infectious diseases]] such as [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], [[influenza]], [[salmonella]] and [[bronchitis]], of [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]] such as [[brucellosis]] and [[rabies]] and of [[Chronic condition|chronic diseases]] that are [[Diseases of affluence|linked to wealth]], such as [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]] and [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. This allows Sciensano to detect and evaluate threats, and to support health authorities in their fight against these diseases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Quality of health care:''' together with the [[Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre]] and the [[National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance]], Sciensano evaluates the [[Health care quality|quality]] of the [[Healthcare in Belgium|Belgian health care system]]. For this purpose, it makes use of [[Health indicator|health indicators]], coordinates national databases, keeps track of [[Hospital-acquired infection|hospital-acquired infections]], makes complex [[Medical diagnosis|medical diagnoses]] as a scientific reference authority, and more. Sciensano's end goal is to improve the quality of health care and [[Patient-centered outcomes|patient outcomes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Vaccines, medications and health products:''' Sciensano supports the [[Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products|Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products]] by assessing the safety and effectiveness of [[Vaccine|vaccines]], medications and other health products. For example, it performs [[quality control]] on medications and vaccines, investigates illegal and [[counterfeit medications]] and researches [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Sciensano analyses samples of certain [[Prohibition of drugs|illegal drugs]] within the framework of the Belgian Early Warning System Drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciensano.be/en/health-topics/illegal-drugs/role#monitoring-of-illegal-drugs-in-belgium|title=SCIENSANO &amp; Illegal drugs|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciensano.be|publisher=Sciensano|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Quality of medical laboratories:''' Sciensano is responsible for the inspection and certification of [[Medical laboratory|medical laboratories]] in Belgium, especially with regard to [[Laboratory specimen|samples of human origin]]. It supervises the correct handling of sample material and the use of standardised [[Analytical technique|analytical methods]], and provides external [[quality assurance]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Animal health:''' Sciensano supports the [[Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain|Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain]], the [[Federal Public Service Health (Belgium)|Federal Public Service Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment]] and front-line organisations in their tasks related to animal health and food safety. To this end, it monitors zoonoses as well as [[Epizootic|epizootics]] for the impact they may have on human health through the [[food chain]] as well as purely for their socio-economical impact on [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Camelsmokinglounge.jpg|thumb|A Camel Cigarette Smoking Room in an airport at [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].]]

A '''smoking room''' (or '''smoking lounge''') is a room which is specifically provided and furnished for smoking, generally in buildings where smoking is otherwise prohibited.

==Locations and facilities==
Smoking rooms can be found in public buildings such as [[airport]]s, and in semi-public buildings such as workplaces. Such rooms are equipped with chairs, ashtrays and ventilation, and usually free to enter although there may be a [[smoking age]] restriction (usually 18). A [[cigarette]] company sometimes sponsors these smoking rooms, displaying its brand names on the room walls and financing the room or its maintenance. Cigarette companies have worked hard to ensure smoking was accommodated in major airports, which are high-profile locations serving many people who are often bored or nervous. Initially providing smoking and no smoking areas was their goal but when that policy failed they fell back on ventilated smoking rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pion|first1=M|title=Airport smoking rooms don't work|journal=Tobacco Control|date=1 March 2004|volume=13|issue=90001|pages=37i–40|doi=10.1136/tc.2003.005447|pmc=1766150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use in private houses==
When the [[Crimean War]] during the 1850s popularized [[Turkish tobacco]], smoking gained in fashionable popularity but was considered indelicate. After dinner in a large private house, the [[Gentleman|gentlemen]] might retreat from the ladies to a smoking room, furnished with [[velvet]] curtains and decorated to masculine tastes (wealthy owners would often choose Turkish themes and weapons collections), and replace his tail coat with a comfortable velvet [[smoking jacket]] and [[Smoking cap|cap]]. The velvet was intended to absorb the smoke, to avoid contaminating other rooms and clothes.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom smoking is illegal in any enclosed place where staff are employed, so that smoking rooms cannot be provided and facilities must be outdoors; apart from private homes, almost the only legal exception is for smoking rooms in tobacconists where customers may sample the wares. Mental health units in the [[National Health Service|NHS]] providing long term in-patient care also have an exemption allowing the provision of designated smoking rooms for patients. The Houses of Parliament, where these laws were passed, are a Royal palace, so are also exempt.

'''Sopor''' is a condition of abnormally deep [[sleep]] or a [[stupor]] from which it is difficult to rouse. It involves a profound depression of consciousness, which is manifested by [[drowsiness]], while maintaining coordinated defensive reactions to stimuli such as pain, harsh sound, and bright light, and preserving [[vital function]]s. Sopor may be caused by a [[drug]]; such drugs are deemed '''soporific'''. A [[stupor]] is more severe than a sopor.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=this seems to contradict the first sentence that sopor was deep sleep or stupor}} 

The name is derived from Latin ''[[wikt:sopor|sopor]]'' ([[cognate]] with the Latin noun ''[[somnus]]'' and the Greek noun ὐπνος, ''[[hypnos]]'').

== Causes and symptoms==
Soporous states can be caused [[Major trauma|traumatic]], vascular, inflammatory, neoplastic, and toxic lesions of the brain.

Symptoms include lack of  response to the environment, perform any tasks, or respond to questions, but the ability to swallow is maintained.
Examination will reveal decreased muscle tone of the extremities and depression of tendon reflexes.
Pupillary reaction to light may be sluggish, but the corneal reflexes are preserved.
[[Paresis]] and [[Babinski sign]] may be present.

[[Image:SwedishGoggles.jpg|thumb|A picture of various pairs of "swedish" style goggles. Note the different nose pieces and the lack of a traditional seal around the eye.]]

'''Swedish goggles''' are a classic and popular type of swimming [[goggles]] worn by many [[competitive swimming|competitive swimmers]].  The original Swedish goggles were produced by the Swedish company Malmsten AB and were first designed in the 1970s.  Swedish goggles influenced many other goggle designs and generic Swedish goggles are widely available.  Malmsten claims that Swedish goggles are "probably the worlds most copied swim goggles."&lt;ref name="swedishgoggles1"&gt;http://www.swedishgoggles.com/produktblad/Swedish%20goggles%20history%20080715.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish goggles are notable for a lack of a gasket or seal around the eye cup, as found on most other goggles. They come in various colors including clear, black, blue, green, red, amber, pink, silver metallic and bronze metallic.  Swedish goggles are relatively low cost, with basic goggles costing around $5 retail and metallic goggle costing around $15.&lt;ref name="slate1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lapidos |first=Juliet |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2197095/pagenum/2 |title=The best swim goggles |publisher=Slate.com |date=2008-08-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220231844/http://www.slate.com/id/2197095/pagenum/2 |archivedate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the popularity of Swedish goggles is due to their customizable fit.  The goggles are sold unassembled, with each goggle set including a pair of eye cups, one long (around 36") [[latex]] rubber strip, and a nose piece consisting of string that fits inside a plastic or rubber tube.  Swimmers may choose a single or double head strap, and some choose to cut a small piece of latex from the head strap for use as a nose piece.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt;
Malmsten's official assembly instructions can be found [https://web.archive.org/web/20150320024728/http://www.malmsten.com/produktblad/swedishassembly.pdf here].

==Assembly==

Swedish goggles require complete user assembly, which results in a fit that is specifically tailored to their owner. Proper assembly generally requires some skill and practice, as well as precision. Before assembly, the inside edges of the lenses are often filed down to remove any sharp edges and thus improve comfort.

The first step in building a set of Swedish goggles is to construct a nose piece. Nose pieces can feature a variety of designs, some of the most popular are the included string threaded through the included rubber tube, a short length of the included strap (which is much more easily adjusted than the string), or simply using the string as a nose piece. For nose pieces using the string and tube, a pair of [[tweezers]] can be used to guide the string through the small holes located on the inside of the frames, as well as into the rubber tube. A small knot is then tied by hand and threaded into the tube. 

Next, the latex strap is guided through the outboard holes of the goggle frames. The loose ends of the straps may be cut off if the user wishes to have a one-strap setup. Otherwise, they may be tied off, creating a two-strap setup and completing goggle assembly.

'''Tōhoku Shinseien Sanatorium''' or '''National Sanatorium Tōhoku Shinseien''' is a sanatorium for leprosy or ex-leprosy patients situated in Tome-shi, [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]]-ken, [[Japan]], founded in 1939.

==History==
===Background===
Following prefectural [[sanatorium]]s, the Japanese Government decided to increase sanatoriums, starting with National Sanatorium Nagashima Aiseien [[Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium]] in 1930. [[Tohoku]] Shinseien [[Sanatorium]] was the 6th sanatorium which was established in 1939. 

===Tohoku Shinseien Sanatorium===
*In October, 1939, National Sanatorium [[Tohoku]] Shinseien was established.
*Apr 1996:The 1953 [[Leprosy]] Prevention Law was abolished.
*Jul 1998: The trial for [[Damages|compensation]] started.
*May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous [[Leprosy]] Prevention was [[unconstitutional]].
*May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 yen to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients depending on the duration of unconstitutional periods.

===Number of Patients at the end of the fiscal year===
The number of in-patients is the sum of patients which changed not only by the newly diagnosed hospitalized and those who died among in-patients, by other factors such as the number of patients who escaped or were discharged, depending on the condition of the times. Recently they were encouraged to be discharged, but the long period of the segregation policy causing [[leprosy stigma]] might influence the number of those who went into the society. 
*the end of the fiscal year is the March 31, next year&lt;ref&gt;Leprosy and society(1986), Kon S, J. Iwate med Ass. 38,2,161-174&lt;/ref&gt;
