'''2014 EC''' is a 10-meter sized, eccentric [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]] that passed within {{convert |48000 |mi |km |sigfig=2}} of [[Earth]] in early March 2014. This  was six times closer to the [[Earth]] than the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="AstroBob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Space.com" /&gt; It was first observed on 5 March 2014, by the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]] in Arizona, United States. As of 2017, it has not since been observed.&lt;ref name="MPC-2014EC" /&gt;

== Description ==

{{mp|2014 EC}} has only been observed on two nights for a period of less than 48 hours, with a remaining [[Uncertainty parameter|orbital uncertainty]] of 4 and 6 respectively.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-2014EC" /&gt; It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.7–2.2&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 21 months (644 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.53 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 1[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The asteroid has an Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] of {{convert |0.0005 |AU |km |abbr=on |sigfig=3}} which translates into less than 0.2 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

Based on a generic [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-to diameter conversion, {{mp|2014 EC}} measures 7 meters in diameter, for a measured [[absolute magnitude]] of 28.2 and an assumed [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.2, which is typical value for stony [[S-type asteroid]]s.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt; Other sources estimated the body to be approximately 10 meters or 30 feet across.&lt;ref name="AstroBob" /&gt; It is too small for being a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]], which require an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or less.&lt;ref name="CNEOS-Glossary-PHA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22037">'''Bioclogging''' or '''biological clogging''' is clogging of [[pore space in soil]] by microbial biomass; their body and their byproducts such as  [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS). The microbial biomass blocks the pathway of water in the pore space, forming a certain thickness of impermeable layer in soil, and it reduces the rate of [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of water remarkably.

Bioclogging is observed under continuous ponded infiltration at various field conditions such as [[infiltration basin|artificial recharge ponds]], [[percolation trench]], [[irrigation]] channel, [[sewage treatment]] system and [[landfill liner]]. It also affects groundwater flow in [[aquifer]], such as [[permeable reactive barrier]] and [[microbial enhanced oil recovery]]. In the situation where infiltration of water at appropriate rate is needed, bioclogging can be problematic and countermeasures such as regular drying of the system are taken. In some cases bioclogging can be utilized to make impermeable layer to minimize the rate of infiltration.

==General description==

===Change in permeability with time===
Bioclogging is observed as the decrease of the infiltration rate. Decrease in the infiltration rate under ponded infiltration was observed in 1940s for studying the infiltration of artificial recharge pond and the water-spreading on agricultural soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allison |first=L.E. |journal=Soil Science| title=Effect of microorganisms on permeability of soil under prolonged submergence| year=1947| volume=63| issue=6| pages=439–450| url=http://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1947/06000/EFFECT_OF_MICROORGANISMS_ON_PERMEABILITY_OF_SOIL.3.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; When soils are continuously submerged, permeability or saturated [[hydraulic conductivity]] changes in 3 stages which was explained as follows.
# Permeability decreases for 10 to 20 days possibly due to physical changes of the structure of the soil.
# Permeability increases due to dissolving the entrapped air in soil into the percolating water.
# Permeability decreases for 2 to 4 weeks due to disintegration of aggregates and biological clogging of soil pores with microbial cells and their synthesized products, slimes or polysaccharides.

The 3 stages are not necessarily distinct in every field condition of bioclogging; when the second stage is not clear, permeability just continues to decrease.

===Various types of clogging===
The change in permeability with time is observed in various field situations. Depending on the field condition, there are various causes for the change in the [[hydraulic conductivity]], summarized as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baveye |first1=P. |last2=Vandevivere |first2=P. |last3=Hoyle |first3=B.L. |last4=DeLeo |first4=P.C. |last5=de Lozada |first5=D.S. |journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology |title=Environmental impact and mechanisms of the biological clogging of saturated soils and aquifer materials|year=2006 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=123–191 |doi=10.1080/10643389891254197 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233057180 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Physical causes: Physical clogging by [[suspended solids]] or physical changes of soils such as disintegration of aggregate structure. Dissolving of the entrapped air in soil into the percolating water is physical cause for the increase of the hydraulic conductivity.
# Chemical causes: Change in the [[electrolyte]] concentration or the [[sodium adsorption ratio]] in the aqueous phase, which causes [[dispersion (geology)|dispersion]] and [[expansive clay|swelling]] of clay particles.
# Biological causes: Usually bioclogging means the first of the following, while bioclogging in broader sense means all of the following.

## Entrapment of gas bubbles such as [[methane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reynolds |first1=W.D. |last2=Brown |first2=D.A. |last3=Mathur |first3=S.P. |last4=Overend |first4=R.P. |journal=Soil Science |title=Effect of in-situ gas accumulation on the hydraulic conductivity of peat |year=1992 |volume=153 |issue=5 |pages=397–408 |url=http://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1992/05000/EFFECT_OF_IN_SITU_GAS_ACCUMULATION_ON_THE.7.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[methanogen|methane producing microorganisms]] clog the soil pore and contributes in decreasing hydraulic conductivity. As gas is also microbial byproducts, it can also be considered to be bioclogging.
## Iron bacteria stimulates [[Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide|ferric oxyhydroxides]] deposition which may cause clogging of soil pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Houot| first1=S.| last2=Berthelin| first2=J.| journal=Geoderma| title=Submicroscopic studies of iron deposits occurring in field drains: Formation and evolution| year=1992| volume=52| issue=3–4| pages=209–222| doi=10.1016/0016-7061(92)90037-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an indirect biological cause of decrease in hydraulic conductivity.

==Field observation==
===Under ponded infiltration===
====Field problem and countermeasure====
Bioclogging is observed under continuous ponded [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] in such places as [[infiltration basin|artificial recharge ponds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouwer |first=H. |journal=Hydrogeology Journal | title=Artificial recharge of groundwater: hydrogeology and engineering| year=2002| volume=10| issue=1| pages=121–142 |doi=10.1007/s10040-001-0182-4| url=http://www.waterinfo.net.pk/sites/default/files/knowledge/Artificial%20Recharge%20of%20Groundwater%20-%20Hydrogeology%20and%20Engineering%20-%202001.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[percolation trench]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furumai |first1=H. |last2=Jinadasa |first2=H.K.P.K.| last3=Murakami| first3=M.| last4=Nakajima |first4=F. |last5=Aryal |first5=R.K. | journal=Water Science and Technology | title=Model description of storage and infiltration functions of infiltration facilities for urban runoff analysis by a distributed model |year=2005| volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=53–60 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7518861_Model_description_of_storage_and_infiltration_functions_of_infiltration_facilities_for_urban_runoff_analysis_by_a_distributed_model| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|pmid=16248180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of infiltration rate due to bioclogging at the infiltrating surface reduces the efficiency of such systems. To minimize the bioclogging effects, pretreatment of the water to reduce [[suspended solids]], nutrients, and organic carbon might be necessary. Regular drying of the system and physical removal of the clogging layer can also be effective countermeasures. Even operated cautiously in this way, bioclogging is still likely to occur because of microbiological growth at the infiltrating surface.

[[Septic drain field]]s are also susceptible to bioclogging because nutrient rich [[wastewater]] flows continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristiansen |first=R. | journal=Journal of Environmental Quality |title=Sand-filter trenches for purification of septic tank effluent: I. The clogging mechanism and soil physical environment| year=1981 |volume=10 | issue=3| pages=353–357| doi=10.2134/jeq1981.00472425001000030020x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nieć| first1=J. |last2=Spychała |first2=M. |last3=Zawadzki |first3=P. |journal=Journal of Ecological Engineering |title=New approach to modelling of sand filter clogging by septic tank effluent |year=2016 | volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=97–107 |doi=10.12911/22998993/62296 |url=http://www.jeeng.net/pdf-62296-4163?filename=NEW%20APPROACH%20TO%20MODELLING.pdf | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bioclogging material in the [[septic tank]] is sometimes called biomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inspectapedia.com/septic/Septic_Biomat_Formation.php|title=Septic Biomat: defined, properties|publisher=InspectAPedia |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pretreatment of water by [[filtration]] or reducing the load of the system could delay the failure of the system by bioclogging. [[Slow sand filter]] system also suffers from bioclogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mauclaire |first1=L. |last2=Schürmann |first2=A. |last3=Thullner |first3=M. |last4=Gammeter |first4=S. |last5=Zeyer |first5=J. |journal=Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology |title=Slow sand filtration in a water treatment plant: biological parameters responsible for clogging| year=2004| volume=53 |issue=2 |pages= 93–108 |url=http://aqua.iwaponline.com/content/53/2/93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the countermeasures mentioned above, cleaning or [[backwashing (water treatment)|backwashing]] sand may be operated to remove biofilm and recover the permeability of sand.

Bioclogging in [[river]]s can impact aquifer recharge especially in dry regions where losing rivers are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Newcomer |first1=M.E.| last2=Hubbard| first2=S.S.| last3=Fleckenstein| first3=J.H.| last4=Maier| first4=U.| last5=Schmidt| first5=C.| last6=Thullner| first6=M.| last7=Ulrich| first7=C.| last8=lipo| first8=N.| last9=Rubin| first9=Y.| journal=Water Resources Research| title=Simulating bioclogging effects on dynamic riverbed permeability and infiltration| year=2016| volume=52|  issue=4| pages=2883–2900| doi=10.1002/2015WR018351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefit====
Bioclogging can have a positive effect in certain cases. For example, in the dairy waste stabilization ponds used for the treatment of dairy farm wastewater, bioclogging effectively seals up the bottom of the pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis | first1=S.| last2=Fairbanks| first2=W.| last3=Weisheit| first3=H.| journal=Transactions of the ASAE| title=Dairy waste ponds effectively self-sealing| year=1973| volume=16| issue=1| pages=69–71| doi=10.13031/2013.37447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae and bacteria may be inoculated to promote bioclogging in [[irrigation]] channel for seepage control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ragusa| first1=S.R.| last2=de Zoysa| first2=D.S.| last3=Rengasamy| first3=P.| journal=Irrigation Science| title=The effect of microorganisms, salinity and turbidity on hydraulic conductivity of irrigation channel soil| year=1994| volume=15| issue=4| pages=159–166| doi=10.1007/BF00193683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioclogging is also beneficial in [[landfill liner]] such as compacted clay liners. Clay liners are usually applied in landfill to minimize the pollution by [[landfill leachate]] to the surrounding soil environment. Hydraulic conductivity of clay liners become lower than the original value because of bioclogging caused by microorganism in the leachate and pore spaces in clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kamon| first1=M.| last2=Zhang| first2=H.| last3=Katsumi| first3=T.| journal=Soils and Foundations| title=Redox effect on the hydraulic conductivity of clay liner| year=2002| volume=42| issue=6| pages=79–91| doi=10.3208/sandf.42.6_79| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sandf1995/42/6/42_6_79/_pdf| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tang| first1=Q.| last2=Wang| first2=H.Y.| last3=Chen| first3=H.| last4=Li| first4=P.| last5=Tang| first5=X.W.| last6=Katsumi| first6=T.| journal=Japanese Geotechnical Society Special Publication| title=Long-term hydraulic conductivity of compacted clay permeated with landfill leachates| year=2015| volume=2| issue=53| pages=1845–1848| doi=10.3208/jgssp.CHN-52| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jgssp/2/53/2_CHN-52/_pdf| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioclogging is now being studied to be applied for [[geotechnical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ivanov |first1=V. |last2=Stabnikov |first2=V.|title=Construction biotechnology: biogeochemistry, microbiology and biotechnology of construction materials and processes  |chapter=Chapter 8: Bioclogging and biogrouts |pages=139–178| year=2017 |publisher=Springer |location=New York| isbn=978-9811014444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In aquifer===
====Water withdrawal from well====
Bioclogging can be observed when water is withdrawn from [[aquifer]] (below groundwater table) through a [[water well]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Beek |first1=C.G.E.M. |last2=van der Kooij |first2=D. | journal=Ground Water| title=Sulfate-reducing bacteria in ground water from clogging and non-clogging shallow wells in the netherlands river region |year=1982 |volume=20| issue=3| pages=298–302| doi=10.1111/j.1745-6584.1982.tb01350.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over months and years of continued operation of water wells, they may show a gradual reduction in performance due to bioclogging or other clogging mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.groundwatereng.com/well-remediation-and-rehabilitation| title=Well remediation and rehabilitation| publisher=Groundwater Engineering Limited |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bioremediation====
Biofilm formation is useful in [[bioremediation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee| first1=M.D.| last2=Thomas| first2=J.M.| last3=Borden| first3=R.C. | last4=Bedient |first4=P.B.| last5=Ward |first5=C.H.|  last6=Wilson |first6=J.T.| journal=Critical Review in Environmental Control| title=Biorestoration of aquifers contaminated with organic compounds| year=1998| volume=18| issue=1| pages=29–89| doi=10.1080/10643388809388342| url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Lee79/publication/240520000_Biorestoration_of_Aquifers_Contaminated_with_Organic_Compounds/links/558beb3e08ae591c19d901b9.pdf| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of biologically degradable [[groundwater pollution]]. [[Permeable reactive barrier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Naftz |first1=D. |last2=Morrison |first2=S.J.| last3=Fuller| first3=C.C.| last4=Davis | first4=J.A. |title=Handbook of groundwater remediation using permeable reactive barriers: applications to radionuclides, trace Metals, and nutrients |year=2002 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0125135634}}&lt;/ref&gt; is formed to contain the groundwater flow by bioclogging and also to degrade pollution by microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Komlos| first1=J.| last2=Cunningham| first2=A.B| last3=Camper| first3=A.K.| last4=Sharp| first4=R.R.| journal=Environmental Processes| title=Biofilm barriers to contain and degrade dissolved tricholoroethylene| year=2004| volume=23| issue=1| pages=69–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contaminant flow should be carefully analyzed because preferential flow path in the barrier may reduce the efficiency of the remediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seki |first1=K. |last2=Thullner |first2=M. |last3=Hanada |first3=J. |last4=Miyazaki |first4=T. |journal=Groundwater Monitoring and Remediation |title=Moderate bioclogging leading to preferential flow paths in biobarriers|year=2006 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=68–76 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6592.2006.00086.x |url=https://github.com/sekika/paper/raw/master/GWMR/Seki-2006-GWMR.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oil recovery====
In [[extraction of petroleum]], a technique of [[enhanced oil recovery]] is implemented to increase the amount of oil to be extracted from an oil field. The injected water displaces the oil in the reservoir which is transported to recovery wells. As the reservoir is not uniform in permeability, injected water tends to go through high permeable zone, and does not go through the zone where oil remains. In this situation, bacterial profile modification technique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lappan |first1=R.E. |last2=Fogler |first2=H.S.| journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering| title=Reduction of porous media permeability from in situ ''leuconostoc mesenteroides'' growth and dextran production | year=1996|  volume=50 |issue=1 | pages=6–15 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19960405)50:1&lt;6::AID-BIT2&gt;3.0.CO;2-L |pmid=18626894 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1017.5978&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which injects bacteria into the high permeable zone to promote bioclogging can be employed. It is a type of [[microbial enhanced oil recovery]].

==Life==
Born on 28 September 1858 at Salcombe House, near [[Sidmouth]], the residence of his grandfather, Charles John Cornish, J.P., D.L., was eldest son of Charles John Cornish, then curate of [[Sidbury]], [[Devon]], by his first wife, Anne Charlotte Western (died 1887). He was brought up at [[Debenham]], [[Suffolk]], where his father became vicar in 1859. In 1872 he entered [[Charterhouse School]] as a gownboy, and left in 1876. After time as a private tutor, he entered [[Hertford College, Oxford]], as a commoner in 1881, was elected Brunsell exhibitioner in 1882 and Lusby scholar in 1883. In the same year he obtained a [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] in association football, a second class in classical moderations in 1883, and a second class in ''[[literae humaniores]]'' in 1885.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Cornish, Charles John|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1885, Cornish was appointed assistant classical master at [[St Paul's School, London]], a position he held for the rest of his life. Soon after coming to London he began to write articles on natural history and country life, and in 1890 became a regular contributor to ''[[The Spectator]]'', and later to ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; 

Cornish died at [[Worthing]] on 30 January 1906, the cause originating in a shooting accident many years before. After cremation his ashes were interred at [[Salcombe Regis]], near Sidmouth, and a mural tablet to his memory was placed in the parish church.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Christos Kakkalos''' ({{lang-el|Χρήστος Κάκκαλος}}; [[Litochoro]], 13 July 1882 – 12 April 1976) was a [[Greece|Greek]] mountain guide. He led the 1913 expedition of the Swiss Daniel Baud-Bovy and [[Frédéric Boissonnas]] and is considered the first climber to have ascended [[Mytikas]], the highest peak of [[Mount Olympus]] (2918.80 m) in [[Greece]].

== Life ==
After three years of schooling he helped his family with work and hunting. The family Kakkalos owned a hut called Paliokalyva (Greek Παλαιοκάλυβα, old hut) on the east side of Mount Olympus. They worked as lumberjacks and transported the wood to the water-driven sawmills in Prionia. As a child, Kakkalos became acquainted with the mountains and hunted up to the summit region the [[Balkan chamois]].

In the summer of 1913, he set out with the Swiss Baud-Bovy and Boissonnas to an expedition to the peaks of Mount Olympus and on 2 August 1913, the group succeeded in the first ascent of Mytikas. Further ascents were made in July 1919, 1921, and in September 1927 with 105 participants. In 1921 he led the Swiss topographer Marcel Kurz, who is considered the first-time climber of the Olympus summit Stefani (2909 m), and the Swiss engineer Fritz Kuhn. In 1931, he again led Daniel Baud-Bovy with a group of climbers.

Until 1932 he spent the nights with the groups he guided in Paliokalyva. In 1930, the foundation stone was laid for the first mountain hut of Mount Olympus, the "Spilios Agapitos" hut. In 1937 he was appointed by the [[Greek Mountaineering Association]] as the official guide for the mountain. He led climbers, geologists, botanists, ambassadors, politicians, artists and tourists. The last time he reached the summit was in 1973, when he was 91 years old.

Christos Kakkalos died on 12 April 1976.

In 1984, a mountain hut on the plateau of the Muses (2680 m) was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/72w77raciiljbcz/Sotiris%20Mastangas%2C%20Biografie.mp3?dl=0|title=Sound recording: Biography Christos Kakkalos, Speaker: Sotiris Mastangas, Litochoro 21. Juni 2018 (Greek)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The first ascent of Mytikas ==

On 28 July 1913, the Swiss Daniel Baud-Bovy and Frédéric Boissonnas reached the place Litochoro (about 400 m). They hired the lumberjacks Christos Kakkalos and Nikos Bistikos to lead them to the summit of Mount Olympus. The next day they started the ascent. At noon they reached the monastery of [[Agios Dionysios Monastery, Olympus|Agios Dionysios]] (820 m), went from there to Petrostrouga (1940 m) and stayed there overnight. On 30 July, they reached the Muses Plateau (about 2600 m) and climbed the peaks of Profitis Elias and Toumba. With the peaks of Mytikas and Stefani in mind, they decided to descend again and stayed in a log cabin (probably in the Paliokaliva) near today's mountain hut Spilios Agapitos (2040 m). On 31 July, they wanted to cancel their project and started their way back to Litochoro. During the descent, they changed their mind and stayed in Prionia (1100 m). On 1 August, they climbed back up to the lumberjack hut.

On the morning of 2 August 1913, the two Swiss, their guides and two shepherds, who were hired to carry the heavy photographic equipment, left the lumberjack hut for the summit region. It was raining, it was cold and foggy. On the way the two shepherds and the leader Nikos Bistikos stayed behind.

When the trio had climbed the supposed summit, they realized they had made a mistake when they saw the Mytikas above them. Kakkalos took the photo equipment and began the final ascent. A short time later, they climbed at 10.25 clock the summit of Mount Olympus.&lt;ref&gt;Giannis Kiritsis ''Olympus, by Frédéric Boissonnas'', Edition Dion-Olympus Municipality 2018, pages 27 to 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.travelogues.gr/collection.php?view=139|title=Aikaterina Laskaridis Foundation, Travelogues}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/07/24/the-hundred-year-climb-of-mount-olympus/|title=The Hundred-Year Climb of Mount Olympus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Menas'''  ({{lang-el|Ἄγιος Μηνάς }}, pr. ''Ágios Minás''; {{lang-tr|Ayios Minas Kilisesi}}) is a [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in [[Istanbul]].

The edifice was built in 1833 near an [[early christian art and architecture|early Christian]] [[Martyrium (architecture)|Martyrion]] of the fourth or fifth century, possibly dedicated to the saints '''[[Carpus and Papylus]]''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Μονὴ τῶν ἁγίων Κάρπου καὶ Παπὺλου, ''Monì ton Agíon Kárpou kai Papýlou'' ), and on the site of an ancient church dedicated to [[Polycarp|Hagios Polykarpos]].&lt;ref name=ja288&gt;Janin (1953), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw187&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977) pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt;
The modern church has [[Saint Menas|the same dedication]] as a nearby [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|water source]] ({{lang-el|Hagiásma}}, {{lang-tr|Ayazma}}).

==Location==
The church is located in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Fatih]], in the neighbourhood of Kocamustafapaşa (historically [[Samatya]]), on ''Bestekar Hakkı Sokak''.  It lies inside the [[walls of Constantinople|walled]] city, in an elevated position a short distance from the shore of the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The building is protected by a high wall.
The Martyrion is located under the church, on ''İmrahor İlyasbey Caddesi'', and currently houses an iron workshop and a car wash shop.&lt;ref name=tayprojpg41&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in a dilapidated state. Opposite to the Martyrion there is a spring also dedicated to [[Saint Menas]].

==History==

=== Byzantine period ===
According to the [[Church Fathers|Fathers of the Church]], in the fourth century Empress [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], mother of [[Constantine I]], authorized construction of a martyrion and a monastery dedicated to the Saints Karpos and Papylos at the foot of the steep southwestern face of the Xeropholos (part of the seventh hill of [[Constantinople]] and at that time, before the construction of the [[Walls of constantinople#Theodosian Walls|Theodosian Wall]], still outside the [[Walls of constantinople#Wall of Constantine|walls of the city]]).&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt; Karpos and Papylos had been martyred together with the Saints [[Saint Agathodorus|Agathodorus]] and [[Saint Agathonice|Agathonice]] in [[Pergamon]] under [[Decius]] in 251.&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt; The edifice was said to have the same plan as the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|one erected on the sepulcher of Christ]] in [[Jerusalem]], and to be adorned with marble.&lt;ref name=ja288/&gt; Although the Helena's involvement is far from certain, and her endowment can be surely excluded, the presence of several martyria in the area is attested.&lt;ref name=ja288/&gt; Moreover, the extant round structure under the modern church stems from the fourth or fifth century and has the typical form of a martyrion.&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt; A nunnery was built here at a later date during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Age]], but at any case before the tenth century.&lt;ref name=ja288/&gt; Indeed, at that time and at least until the twelfth century there are attestations to the existence of a female monastery dedicated to the Saints Karpos and Papylos in the vicinity  of the ''Helenianai'' Palace.&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt;

===Ottoman period===

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the complex remained under Greek control.
The are references in 1604 to the existence of a domed church dedicated to [[Polycarp|Saint Polykarpos]], and of an Ayazma dedicated to [[Saint Menas]].&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt; This church was destroyed in the great fire of Samatya of 1782, and rebuilt in 1833 by architect ''Konstantis Yolasığmazis'', with money collected through an offertory of the local [[Mahalle]] assembly with the consent of [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808–1839).&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt; The new church was dedicated to Saint Menas, like the near Ayazma. In 1878/9 four ancient tombs were found under the church.&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt; The building was damaged during the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of 6 September 1955, but since then it has been restored.&lt;ref name=mw187/&gt; It is still officiated and can be visited.

== Description ==
[[File:Church of Saint Menas 02.jpg|250px|thumb|A close view of the vault of the horse shaped corridor of the martyrion]]
The present church is a rectangular building with a basilica plan, with length of approximately {{convert|20|m|0}}, width of {{convert|13|m|0}}, and height of {{convert|9|m|0}}. It is oriented in east to west direction, and has a side entrance and a bell tower. The interior is divided into three [[nave]]s. The pictures on the upper section of its iconostasis contain images with episodes of the life of Jesus Christ; those on the lower section, several Saints, Jesus Christ, and the Virgin Mary. On the faces of the [[ambon (liturgy)|ambon]], Christ with the Evangelists are painted. The [[Cella|Naos]] is adorned with images of Christ [[Pantocrator]]. Nothing remains of the ancient Byzantine church.&lt;ref name=ey93/&gt;

The '''Martyrion''', which lies under the church and behind a gas station, currently houses two shops, an iron workshop and a car wash shop.

'''Cosmogenic nuclides''' (or '''cosmogenic isotopes''') are rare [[nuclide]]s ([[isotope]]s) created when a high-energy [[cosmic ray]] interacts with the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an ''[[in situ]]'' Solar System [[atom]], causing nucleons (protons and neutrons) to be expelled from the atom (see [[cosmic ray spallation]]). These isotopes are produced within Earth materials such as [[rock (geology)|rock]]s or [[soil]], in [[Earth|Earth's]] [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and in extraterrestrial items such as [[meteorite]]s.  By measuring cosmogenic isotopes, [[scientist]]s are able to gain insight into a range of [[geology|geological]] and [[astronomy|astronomical]] processes.  There are both [[radioactive isotope|radioactive]] and [[stable isotope|stable]] cosmogenic isotopes.  Some of these radioisotopes are [[tritium]], [[carbon-14]] and [[phosphorus-32]].

Certain light (low atomic number) [[primordial nuclides]] (some isotopes of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]]) are thought to have arisen not only during the [[Big Bang]], and also (and perhaps primarily) to have been made after the Big Bang, but before the condensation of the Solar System, by the process of [[cosmic ray spallation]] on interstellar gas and dust. This explains their higher abundance in cosmic rays as compared with their ratios and abundances of certain other nuclides on Earth. This also explains the overabundance of the early [[transition metal]]s just before [[iron]] in the periodic table; the cosmic-ray spallation of iron thus produces [[scandium]] through [[chromium]] on one hand and [[helium]] through boron on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the arbitrary defining qualification for cosmogenic nuclides of being formed "in situ in the Solar System" (meaning inside an already-aggregated piece of the Solar System) prevents primordial nuclides formed by cosmic ray spallation ''before'' the formation of the Solar System, from being termed "cosmogenic nuclides"— even though the mechanism for their formation is exactly the same. These same nuclides still arrive on Earth in small amounts in cosmic rays, and are formed in meteoroids, in the atmosphere, on Earth, "cosmogenically." However, beryllium (all of it stable beryllium-9) is present{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} primordially in the Solar System in much larger amounts, having existed prior to the condensation of the Solar System, and thus present in the materials from which the Solar System formed.

To make the distinction in another fashion, the ''timing'' of their formation determines which subset of cosmic ray spallation-produced nuclides are termed '''primordial''' or '''cosmogenic''' (a nuclide cannot belong to both classes). By convention, certain stable nuclides of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], and [[boron]] are thought{{according to whom|date=February 2014}} to have been produced by cosmic ray spallation in the period of time ''between'' the [[Big Bang]] and the Solar System's formation (thus making these [[primordial nuclide]]s, by definition) are not termed "cosmogenic," even though they were{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} formed by the same process as the cosmogenic nuclides (although at an earlier time). The primordial nuclide beryllium-9, the only stable beryllium isotope, is an example of this type of nuclide.

In contrast, even though the radioactive isotopes [[beryllium-7]] and [[beryllium-10]] fall into this series of three light elements (lithium, beryllium, boron) formed mostly{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} by cosmic ray spallation [[nucleosynthesis]], both of these nuclides have half lives too short for them to have been formed before the formation of the Solar System, and thus they cannot be primordial nuclides. Since the cosmic ray spallation route is the only possible source{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} of beryllium-7 and beryllium-10 occurrence naturally in the environment, they are therefore cosmogenic.

Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were the "[[Four Policemen|Big Four]]" Allied powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Turning Point: Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-Shek, 1943: The Moscow, Cairo, and Teheran Conferences|first=Keith|last=Sainsbury|location=[[Oxford]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; who called themselves "The United Nations." They were joined by numerous other countries, such as [[History of Canada|Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein, ''Canada's war: the politics of the Mackenzie King government, 1939–1945'' (1975); C.

===Cairo Conference===
{{Main|Cairo Conference}}
[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] of China with Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in 1943.]]
The Cairo Conference held in Cairo, Egypt, outlined the Allied position against Japan during World War II and made decisions about postwar Asia. The meeting was attended by President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin did not attend the conference because his meeting with Chiang could have caused friction between the Soviet Union and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cairo Conference of 1943: Roosevelt, Churchill, Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang|first=Ronald Ian|last=Heiferman|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Three conferences===
{{see also|List of World War II conferences}}
[[File:Teheran conference-1943.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stalin (left), Roosevelt and Churchill at Tehran, Nov. 1943]]
Britain, the USSR and the US, were in frequent contact through ambassadors, top generals, foreign ministers and special emissaries such as the American [[Harry Hopkins]]. There were numerous high-level conferences; in total Churchill attended 14 meetings, Roosevelt 12, and Stalin 5. Most visible were the three summit conferences that brought together the three top leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Feis, ''Churchill Roosevelt Stalin: The War They Waged and the Peace They Sought: A Diplomatic History of World War II'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hardy McNeill, ''America, Britain and Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941–1946'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tehran conference====
{{main|Tehran Conference}}
The first meeting of the Big Three, Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill, came at the Tehran Conference in Iran from 28 November to 1 December 1943. It agreed on an invasion of France in 1944 (the "Second front") and dealt with Turkey, Iran, Yugoslavia and the war against Japan as well as the post-war settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Vojtech Mastny, "Soviet War Aims at the Moscow and Tehran Conferences of 1943," ''Journal of Modern History'' (1975) 47#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;481–504 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1876003 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yalta conference====
{{main|Yalta Conference}}
The Yalta Conference met in the Crimea (Russia) February 4–11, 1945. It focused on postwar plans for European boundaries. The Soviets already controlled Poland. The new boundaries of Poland were especially important, with Stalin seeking control of western Belorussia and western Ukraine. Poland was to gain parts of Germany. Stalin promised free elections in Poland under the auspices of a government he controlled. At Roosevelt's strong urging, Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. It was agreed the USSR would be a member of the United Nations Security Council, with a veto, and Ukraine and Belorussia would be UN members, but not the other 12 Soviet republics. Germany was to be divided into three zones of occupation, and France was also to get a zone. In a decision that became highly controversial, all civilians would be repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser J. Harbutt, ''Yalta 1945: Europe and America at the Crossroads'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Potsdam conference 1945-8.jpg|right|thumb|Clement Attlee, Harry Truman and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference, circa 28 July – 1 August 1945]]

====Potsdam conference====
{{main|Potsdam Conference}}
The Potsdam Conference was held July 17-Aug. 2, 1945, at Potsdam, Germany, near Berlin. Stalin met with the new U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] and two British prime ministers in succession—Winston Churchill and [[Clement Attlee]]. It demanded "unconditional surrender" from Japan, and finalized arrangements for Germany to be occupied and controlled by the Allied Control Commission. The status of other occupied countries was discussed in line with the basic agreements made earlier at Yalta.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Feis, ''Between War and Peace: The Potsdam Conference'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dumbarton Oaks Conference===
{{main|Dumbarton Oaks Conference}}
The Dumbarton Oaks Conference or, more formally, the Washington Conversations on International Peace and Security Organization was an international conference at which the United Nations was formulated and negotiated among international leaders. The conference was held at Dumbarton Oaks from August 21, 1944 to October 7, 1944. At the conference, delegations from the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Republic of China deliberated over proposals for the establishment of an organization to maintain peace and security in the world.

===San Francisco Conference===
{{main|San Francisco Conference}}
San Francisco Conference was a convention of delegates from 50 [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] that took place from 25 April 1945 to 26 June 1945 in [[San Francisco]], [[United States]]. At this convention, the delegates reviewed and rewrote the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference|Dumbarton Oaks agreements]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm The United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941 – October 1945]&lt;/ref&gt; The convention resulted in the creation of the [[United Nations Charter]], which was opened for signature on 26 June.The heads of the delegations of the four sponsoring countries (China, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union) took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/history-united-nations-charter/1945-san-francisco-conference/index.html|title=1945: The San Francisco Conference|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain – United States==
{{Main|United Kingdom–United States relations World War II}}
{{See also|Lend-Lease|Destroyers for Bases Agreement|Manhattan Project}}
Though most Americans favoured Britain in the war, there was widespread opposition to American military intervention in European affairs. President Roosevelt's policy of [[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]] still allowed Britain and France to purchase munitions from the United States and carry them home.

[[File:Prince of Wales-5.jpg|thumb|right|Roosevelt and Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter in August 1941]]
Churchill, who had long warned against Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the [[German invasion of Norway]] in April 1940. After the fall of France Roosevelt gave Britain all aid short of war. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] of September 1940, gave the United States a ninety-nine-year lease on strategically located bases in the Atlantic in exchange for the Royal Navy receiving fifty old destroyers to use in anti-submarine warfare. Roosevelt also sold (for cash) munitions that were carried away in British ships, including over half a million rifles, 85,000 machine guns, 25,000 automatic rifles, mortars, hundreds of field guns, with supplies of the necessary ammunition. The British needed these munitions to reequip the soldiers who lost all their arms when Dunkirk was evacuated in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;W.K. Hancock and M. M. Gowing, ''British War Economy'' (1949) p. 227 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-9.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in March 1941, the United States enacted [[Lend-Lease]] sending tanks, warplanes, munitions, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Britain received $31.4 billion out of a total of $50.1 billion of supplies sent to the Allies. In sharp contrast to the First World War, these were not loans and no repayment was involved.&lt;ref&gt;Leo T. Crowley, "Lend Lease" in Walter Yust, ed. ''10 Eventful Years'' (1947)1:520, 2, pp. 858–60. There had been loans before Lend lease was enacted; these were repaid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Millions of American servicemen were based in Britain during the war, which led to a certain amount of friction with British men and intermarriage with British women. This animosity was explored in art and film, most particularly [[A Matter of Life and Death (film)#Anglo-American relations|''A Matter of Life and Death'']] and ''[[A Canterbury Tale#Anglo-American (mis)understandings|A Canterbury Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Reynolds, ''Rich Relations: The American Occupation of Britain, 1942–45'' (Random House, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 Churchill sent a British fleet to help the United States attack and invade Japan.

===Casablanca conference===

{{main|Casablanca Conference}}
From January 14–24, 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill and the Combined Staff met in [[Casablanca]], Morocco. They decided on the major Allied strategy for 1943 in Europe, especially the invasion of Italy and planning for the invasion of France. At Roosevelt's suggestion they agreed on a policy of "[[Unconditional surrender#World War II|unconditional surrender]]." This policy uplifted Allied morale, but it also made the Nazis resolve to fight to the bitter end. Roosevelt also tried to establish a working relationship between the two main French allies, Henri Giraud, the French high commissioner in North Africa, and General de Gaulle, leader of the [[Free French]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan F. Wilt, "The Significance of the Casablanca Decisions, January 1943," ''Journal of Military History'' (1991) 55#4 pp 517–529 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1985768 in JSTOR]

Britain's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939 included the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] and [[British Raj|India]], which it directly controlled. The dominions were independent in foreign policy but all of them (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa) soon declared war on Germany. The fears in London that South Africa would take the advice of Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and remain neutral were relieved when the parliament voted 80 to 67 for war, and Hertzog resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stewart, "The British Government and the South African Neutrality Crisis, 1938–39," ''English Historical Review'' (2008) 23# 503, pp&amp;nbsp;947–972&lt;/ref&gt; After the French defeat in June 1940, Britain and its empire stood alone in combat against Germany, until June 1941. The United States gave strong diplomatic, financial and material support, starting in 1940, especially through [[Lend Lease]], which began in 1941, In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and agreed on the [[Atlantic Charter]], which proclaimed "the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous and would be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.

Starting in December 1941, Japan overran British possessions in Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaya, and especially the key base at [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and marched into Burma, headed toward India. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the rapid defeats irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. The realisation that Britain could not defend them pushed Australia and New Zealand into permanent close ties with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Warren|title=Britain's Greatest Defeat: Singapore 1942|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zosKzAoocu8C&amp;pg=PA295|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Serious tension erupted over American demands that [[India]] be given independence, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-colonial era. However, in 1942 when the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] launched a [[Quit India]] movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and imprisoned them until 1945. Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base for aid to China. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt pushed too hard regarding independence, so Roosevelt backed down.&lt;ref&gt;Eric S. Rubin, "America, Britain, and Swaraj: Anglo-American Relations and Indian Independence, 1939–1945," ''India Review" (2011) 10#1 pp 40–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi &amp; Churchill: The Epic Rivalry That Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdPmzLtU5G4C|year=2008|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=472–539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain and France===
In spring 1939 both Britain and France formally announced they would defend the integrity of Poland. Hitler did not believe they would fight in such a faraway hopeless cause, and he invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Britain and France declared war on September 3, 1939. But there was little they could or did do to help Poland.

====Plans for intervention in the Winter War against USSR====
The USSR launched the [[Winter War]] against Finland in November 1939. The Finns made a remarkable defense against the much larger Soviet forces. The unprovoked invasion excited widespread outrage at popular and elite levels in support of Finland not only in wartime Britain and France but also in neutral United States.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon F. Sander, ''The Hundred Day Winter War'' (2013) pp 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The League of Nations declared the USSR was the aggressor and expelled it. "American opinion makers treated the attack on Finland as dastardly aggression worthy of daily headlines, which thereafter exacerbated attitudes toward Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph B. Levering|title=American Opinion and the Russian Alliance, 1939-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1fs4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT210|year=2017|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Elite opinion in Britain and France swung in favor of military intervention. [[Winston Churchill]], as head of the Royal Navy, and French Premier [[Paul Reynaud]] were the chief advocates. It came when there was a military stalemate on the continent called the "[[Phony War]]".  Months of planning at the highest civilian, military and diplomatic levels in London and Paris, saw multiple reversals and deep divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Kelly, "Drifting Towards War: The British Chiefs of Staff, the USSR and the Winter War, November 1939–March 1940." ''Contemporary British History'' 23.3 (2009): 267-291.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the British and French agreed on a plan that involved uninvited invasions of neutral Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark's  Faroe Islands, with the goals chiefly of damaging the German war economy and also assisting Finland in its war with the Soviet Union. An allied war against the Soviet Union was part of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. M. Butler, ''History of Second World War: Grand strategy, volume 2: September 1939-June 1941'' (1957) pp 91-150. [https://archive.org/details/grandstrategy02butl online free]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual Allied goal was not to help Finland but to engage in economic warfare against Germany by cutting off [[Swedish iron-ore mining during World War II|shipments of Swedish iron ore]], which they calculated would seriously weaken German war industry.  The British Ministry of Economic Warfare stated that the project against Norway would be likely to cause "An extremely serious repercussion on German industrial output...and would in any case have a profound effect on the duration of the war."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, p 97&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to shift forces away from doing little on the static Western front into an active role on a new front. The British military leadership by December became enthusiastic supporters when they realized that their first choice, an attack on German oil supplies, would not get approval but this plan would win strong support. The poor performance of the Soviet army against the Finns strengthened the confidence of the Allies that the invasion, and the resulting war with Russia, would be worthwhile. However the civilian leadership of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government in London drew back and postponed invasion plans. The neutrals refused to cooperate.  Meanwhile, Finland was overwhelmed and gave in to Moscow on 13 March 1940 and the plan was postponed. War plans against the USSR were dropped and the new goal was to mine the Norwegian coast to prevent the passage of ships carrying iron ore from northern Norway.  There were more delays and when mining operations finally started on 9 April it was too late—the Germans hours before had invaded Norway and had the upper hand in the [[Norwegian Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Erin Redihan, "Neville Chamberlain and Norway: The Trouble with 'A Man of Peace' in a Time of War." ''New England Journal of History'' (2013) 69#1/2 pp 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====German invasion 1940====
When Germany began its attack on France in April 1940, British troops and French troops again fought side by side, but defeat came quickly. The Royal Navy evacuated 198,000 British and 140,000 French soldiers in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] in late May/early June 1940. Tens of thousands of tanks, trucks and artillery guns were left behind, as well as all of the radios, machine guns, rifles, tents, spare parts and other gear. The new Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] pledged that Britain would continue to fight for France's freedom, even if it must do so alone.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II'' (1994) pp&amp;nbsp;130–31, 142–161&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Mers el Kebir]], Britain recognised [[Free France]] as its ally and the legitimate government of France. [[File:Churchill De Gaulle HU 60057.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Prime Minister Churchill and General de Gaulle at [[Marrakesh]], January 1944]]

The United States maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy (until late 1942) and avoided recognition of de Gaulle's claim to be the one and only government of France. Churchill, caught between the U.S. and de Gaulle, tried to find a compromise.&lt;ref name="Milton Viorst 1967"&gt;Milton Viorst, ''Hostile allies: FDR and Charles de Gaulle'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David G.

===Britain and Soviet Union===

In October 1944 Churchill and his Foreign Minister [[Anthony Eden]] met in Moscow with Stalin and his foreign minister Molotov. They planned who would control what in postwar Eastern Europe. They agreed to give 90% of the influence in Greece to Britain and 90% in Romania to USSR. USSR gained an 80%/20% division in Bulgaria and Hungary. There was a 50/50 division in Yugoslavia, and no Soviet share in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Resis, "The Churchill-Stalin Secret "Percentages" Agreement on the Balkans, Moscow, October 1944," ''American Historical Review'' (1978) 83#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;368–387 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1862322 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Larres, ''A companion to Europe since 1945'' (2009) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===

====Iraq====
[[File:Legionnaires guards gladiators.jpg|thumb|left|Gloster Gladiators of British RAF refuel in Iraq, 1941]]

Iraq was an independent country in 1939, with a strong British presence, especially in the oil fields. Iraq broke relations with Germany but there was a strong pro-German element. The regime of Regent [['Abd al-Ilah]] was [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|overthrown in 1941]] by the [[Golden Square (Iraq)|Golden Square]] pro-Nazi army officers, headed by [[Rashid Ali]]. The short living pro-Nazi government was overpowered in May 1941 by British forces in [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] and the Regent returned to power. Iraq was later used as a base for allied attacks on Vichy-French held [[Mandate of Syria]] and support for the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lyman|title=Iraq 1941: The Battles For Basra, Habbaniya, Fallujah and Baghdad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFOu9NG9pwC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran (Persia)====
In 1939 the dictator of Iran was [[Rezā Shāh|Shah Reza Pahlevi]], an army officer who took control in a coup d'état in 1925 and called himself "shah." He was a modernizer who had little use for traditional religion, but collaborated with the Germans. Iran proclaimed neutrality when the war began in 1939. British and Soviet forces [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupied Iran in August 1941]], deposed the Shah, and installed his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]]. Iran, with a largely rural population of 13 million, had oil wells and became a major route for shipping military supplies from the U.S. to the Soviet Union.

At the [[Tehran Conference of 1943]], Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill issued the [[Tehran Declaration]] that guaranteed the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the [[Azerbaijan People's Government]] and the [[Republic of Kurdistan]] respectively, in late 1945. Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946 after receiving a promise of oil concessions. The Soviet republics in the north were soon [[Iran crisis of 1946|overthrown]] and the oil concessions were revoked.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Hamzavi, "Iran and the Tehran Conference," ''International Affairs'' (1944) 20#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;192–203 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3018096 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth===
The British dominions joined in the September 3 declaration of war, except for Canada. In a symbolic statement of autonomous foreign policy, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] delayed Parliament's vote on a declaration of war until September 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip Alfred Buckner|title=Canada and the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmXnLGX7FvEC&amp;pg=PA105|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.P.|pages=105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain generally handled the diplomatic relations of the Commonwealth nations. Canada hosted top level conferences between Britain and the U.S., but did not itself participate in the formal discussions.

Australia, however, felt abandoned by London and moved to a close relationship with the U.S., playing a support role in the American war against Japan. Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] stated, "I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Morgan|title=Australia: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gz6BI-4jl_oC&amp;pg=PA90|year=2012|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President Roosevelt ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]], to move the American base from the Philippines to [[Brisbane, Australia]]. By September 1943, more than 120,000 American soldiers were in Australia. The Americans were warmly welcomed but there was some tensions. MacArthur worked very closely with the Australian government and took command of its combat operations. Fighting continued throughout [[Southeast Asia]] for the next two years. When the European war was declared over, Australia and the US still had a war to win against Japan. MacArthur promoted a policy of "[[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]]" for his American troops while he suggested that the Australian troops should continue clearing and rounding up the Japanese from New Guinea, New Britain, Borneo and Bougainville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Dean|title=Australia 1943: The Liberation of New Guinea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VUCAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{main|Franklin D. Roosevelt#Third term (1941–45)}}
President Roosevelt tried to avoid repeating what he saw as Woodrow Wilson's mistakes in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Pastor|title=A Century's Journey: How the Great Powers Shape the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqGJvW-zqocC&amp;pg=PA218|year=1999|publisher=Basic Books|page=218ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often made exactly the opposite decision. Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through [[Lend-lease|Lend-Lease]], with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt always had a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General John J. Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the "[[Europe first]]" strategy. He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender. Roosevelt often mentioned his role in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson's errors than from his successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William E.

===1941–42===
After Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight; The nation was now united on foreign policy. On December&amp;nbsp;11, 1941, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, which responded in kind. Roosevelt and his military advisers implemented a war strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts; and saving China and defeating Japan. Public opinion, however, gave priority to the destruction of Japan, so American forces were sent chiefly to the Pacific in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-first = David B. | editor1-last = Woolner | editor2-first = Warren F. | editor2-last = Kimball | editor3-first = David | editor3-last = Reynolds | displayeditors=1 | title = FDR's world: war, peace, and legacies | year = 2008 | page = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening weeks of the war, Japan had conquered the Philippines, and the British and Dutch colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], capturing [[Singapore]] in February&amp;nbsp;1942. Furthermore, Japan cut off the overland supply route to China. The United States flew supplies to China "over the hump" (The Himalayan Mountains) at enormous cost, until a road could be opened in 1945.

Roosevelt met with Churchill in late December and planned a broad informal alliance among the U.S., Britain, China and the Soviet Union. This included Churchill's initial plan to invade North Africa (called [[Operation Gymnast]]) and the primary plan of the U.S. generals for a western Europe invasion, focused directly on Germany ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]). An agreement was also reached for a centralized command and offensive in the Pacific theater called [[ABDA]] (American, British, Dutch, Australian) to save China and defeat Japan. Nevertheless, the Atlantic First strategy was intact, to Churchill's great satisfaction. On New Year's Day 1942, Churchill and FDR issued the "Declaration by United Nations", representing 26 countries in opposition to the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom'' (1970) pp 180-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==

{{see also|Second Sino-Japanese War|Chiang Kai-shek}}

In 1931 Japan took advantage of China's very weak central government in the [[Warlord Era]] and fabricated the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931 to set up the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in Manchuria. [[Puyi]], who had been the last [[emperor of China]], became "emperor" of China again; he was a Japanese puppet. In 1937 the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] triggered the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The invasion was launched by the bombing of many cities such as [[battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Nanjing]] and [[Guangzhou]]. The latest, which began on 22 and 23 September 1937, called forth widespread protests culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations.  The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured the Chinese capital city of Nanjing, and committed [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] in the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing massacre]].  The war tied down large numbers of Chinese soldiers, so Japan set up three different Chinese puppet states to enlist some Chinese support.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gordon, "The China–Japan War, 1931–1945" ''Journal of Military History'' (2006) v 70#1, pp 137–82. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_military_history/v070/70.1gordon.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States was a strong supporter of China after Japan invaded in 1937. Even the isolationists who opposed war in Europe supported a hard-line against Japan. The outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 saw aid flow into the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schaller, ''U.S. Crusade in China, 1938–1945'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

American public sympathy for the Chinese was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as [[Pearl Buck]], and ''[[Time Magazine]]'' of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the [[Nanking Massacre]], also known as the 'Rape of Nanking'. Japanese-American relations were further soured by the [[Panay incident|USS Panay Incident]] during the bombing of [[Nanjing]]. Roosevelt demanded an apology from the Japanese, which was received, but relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate. By early 1941 the U.S. was preparing to send American planes flown by American pilots under American command, but wearing Chinese uniforms, to fight the Japanese invaders and even to bomb Japanese cities. The "[[Flying Tigers]]" under [[Claire Chennault]] arrived just as the U.S. entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Byrd, ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

To augment Chennault's 100 P-40Bs, in May 1941 Washington decided to send 144 Vultee P-48's, 125 P-43's and 66 Lockheed and Douglas medium bombers. The goal was to give China by early 1942, a respectable air force, judged by Far Eastern standards, sufficient to "(a) protect strategic points, (b) permit local army offensive action, (c) permit the bombing of Japanese air bases and supply dumps in China and Indo-China, and the bombing of coastal and river transport, and (d) permit occasional incendiary bombing of Japan."&lt;ref&gt;Romanus and Sunderland. ''Stilwell's Mission to China'' p. 20 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-CBI-Mission/USA-CBI-Mission-1.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A year before the U.S. officially entered the war (after Dec. 7, 1941), Chennault developed an ambitious plan for a sneak attack on Japanese bases. His Flying Tigers would use American bombers and American pilots, all with Chinese markings. The U.S. military was opposed to his scheme, and kept raising obstacles, but it was adopted by top civilian officials including [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] (the Secretary of the Treasury who financed China) and especially President Roosevelt himself, who made it a high priority to keep China alive.&lt;ref&gt;The official Army history notes that 23 July 1941 FDR "approved a Joint Board paper which recommended that the United States equip, man, and maintain the 500-plane Chinese Air Force proposed by Currie. The paper suggested that this force embark on a vigorous program to be climaxed by the bombing of Japan in November 1941." Lauchlin Currie was the White House official dealing with China. Charles F. Romanus and Riley Sunderland, '' U.S. Army in World War II: China-Burma-India Theater: Stillwell's Mission to China'' (1953) p. 23 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-CBI-Mission/USA-CBI-Mission-1.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; By October, 1941, bombers and crews were on their way to China. However the American attack never took place. The bombers and crews arrived after Pearl Harbor and were used for the war in Burma, for they lacked the range to reach China.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schaller, "American Air Strategy in China, 1939–1941: The Origins of Clandestine Air Warfare," ''American Quarterly'' (1976) 28#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3–19 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2712474 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Armstrong, ''Preemptive Strike: The Secret Plan That Would Have Prevented the Attack on Pearl Harbor'' (2006) is a popular version&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romanus and Sunderland.

===Wartime===
[[File:Cairo Conference Participants.jpg|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek]], Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill meeting at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] in 1943]]
After the formal declaration of war in December 1941, the U.S. stepped up the flow of aid, but it had to be routed through India and over the Himalayan Mountains because Japan blocked the other routes. Chiang's beleaguered government was now headquartered in remote [[Chongqing]]. [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kaishek]],&lt;ref&gt;See Laura Tyson Li, ''Madame Chiang Kai-Shek: China's Eternal First Lady'' (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; who had been educated in the United States, addressed the US Congress and toured the country to rally support for China. Congress amended the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and Roosevelt moved to end the [[Unequal Treaties|unequal treaties]]. However, the perception that Chiang's government, with his poorly equipped and ill-fed troops was unable to effectively fight the Japanese or that he preferred to focus more on defeating the Communists grew. [[China Hands]] such as [[Joseph Stilwell]] argued that it was in American interest to establish communication with the Communists to prepare for a land-based counteroffensive invasion of Japan. The [[Dixie Mission]], which began in 1943, was the first official American contact with the Communists. Other Americans, such as [[Claire Chennault]], argued for air power. In 1944, Generalissimo Chiang acceded to Roosevelt's request that an American general take charge of all forces in the area, but demanded that Stilwell be recalled. General [[Albert Wedemeyer]] replaced Stilwell, [[Patrick Hurley]] became ambassador, and Us-China relations became much smoother.

After World War II ended in 1945, the showdown came between the Nationalists and the Communists in a full-scale [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]]. American general [[George C. Marshall]] tried to broker a truce but he failed. The Kuomintang (Nationalist) military position steadily worsened and by 1949, the Communists were victorious and drove the Nationalists from the mainland onto the island of Taiwan and other islands. [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in mainland China, while the Republic of China remains in Taiwan to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''Decisive Encounters: The Chinese Civil War, 1946–1950'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet military had conversations in Moscow with a high level military delegation from Britain and France. The Soviets demanded an agreement from Poland to allow Soviet troops to enter that country to defend it against Germany, but Poland refused. Those talks went nowhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Erickson|title=The Soviet High Command: a Military-political History, 1918-1941: A Military Political History, 1918-1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvXdi7jZy5YC&amp;pg=PA525|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=525–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, Hitler made friendly proposals to Stalin that led to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop nonaggression pact]] on August 23 that stunned the world. The Soviets achieved friendly relations with Germany in order to carve up Key elements of Eastern Europe, especially Poland and the Baltic states. Following the pact, Germany invaded and quickly defeated Poland; then the Soviets invaded and took control of its preassigned areas of eastern Poland. Both invaders systematically decimated the Polish elite. In the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]], the [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) executed 22,000 Polish military and police officers and civilian intelligentsia.&lt;ref&gt;Anna M. Cienciala et al. eds. ''Katyn: A Crime Without Punishment'' (Yale University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, the USSR supplied Germany with oil and grain. Furthermore, the Kremlin ordered Communist parties around the world to denounce the imperialistic war waged by Britain and France against Germany. For example, B. Farnborough says, "During the entire period up to the fall of France the British Communist Party functioned as a propaganda agency for Hitler."&lt;ref&gt;B. Farnborough, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/pearce/1959/04/ww2.htm "Marxists in the Second World War," ''Labour Review'', Vol. 4 No. 1, April–May 1959, pp. 25–28]&lt;/ref&gt;

After he ignored repeated warnings, Stalin was stunned when Hitler invaded in June 1941. Stalin eventually came to terms with Britain and the United States, cemented through a series of summit meetings.

{{further|Military history of France during World War II}}

===French Republic===
France and Britain collaborated closely in 1939, and together declared war against Germany two days after it invaded Poland. Apart from the British Dominions (Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa), no independent nation joined their cause. Britain and France took a defensive posture, fearing German air attacks on cities. France hoped the [[Maginot Line]] would protect it from an invasion. There was little fighting between the fall of Poland in mid-September and the following spring; it was the [[Phoney War]] in Britain or ''Drôle de guerre'' – the funny sort of war – in France. Britain tried several peace feelers, but Hitler did not respond.

When Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, it launched its [[Blitzkrieg]] against Denmark and Norway, easily pushing the British out. Then it invaded the Low Countries and tricked Britain and France into sending its best combat units deep into the Netherlands, where they became trapped in the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940. The Royal Navy rescued over 300,000 British and French soldiers from Dunkirk, but left behind all the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Blatt (ed), The French Defeat of 1940 (Oxford, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vichy France===
{{main|Foreign relations of Vichy France}}

====Relationships with Germany====
Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the government surrendered in the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] with new new leader Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] (1856-1961).  His Vichy regime was authoritarian, Catholic, paternal and anti-Semitic. His charisma and popularity from his heroic role in the First World War strengthened his authority, although he was increasingly too old to pay attention to details. After Germany seized all of Vichy in October 1942, it installed [[Pierre Laval]] as its puppet leaving Pétain as a helpless figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Olivier Baruch,  "Charisma and Hybrid Legitimacy in Pétain’s État français (1940‐44)." ''Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions'' 7.2 (2006): 215-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The armistice included numerous provisions that weakened France, all largely guaranteed by the German policy of keeping 2 million French prisoners of war and workers in Germany as hostages. Vichy France was nominally a neutral country. it never declared war on the Soviet Union or Britain, and was recognized diplomatically by the United States until 1942. Although Vichy France was nominally in control of all of France—apart from Alsace Lorraine—in practice the Germans controlled three-fifths of the country, including the northern and western coasts, the industrial northeast, and the Paris region. The Petain  government relocated to the resort town of in Vichy and controlled the rest From the start, Germany wanted food, minerals, and industrial productions, as well as volunteers to work in German factories. Vichy was allowed to control  its foreign colonies—to the extent it could defend them against the Free French—as well as its fleet, to the extent it could defend it against British naval attacks.  In October 1942, Germany took it all over; the Vichy regime became entirely a puppet of the German occupiers.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal Pétain, left, head of Vichy France, shaking hands with Hitler on October 24, 1940.]]

The small town of [[Montoire-sur-le-Loir]] was the scene of two meetings. On October 22, 1940, [[Pierre Laval]] met with Hitler to set up a meeting on October 24 between Hitler and Pétain. It ended in a much-publicized handshake between the two, but in fact their discussions had been entirely general and no decisions had been made. Hitler was impressed with Petain's commitment to defending the French Empire.  False rumours abounded that France had made major concessions regarding colonies and German control of French ports and the French feet.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, ''Our Vichy Gamble'' (1947) pp 89-98.&lt;/ref&gt;   Germany controlled the entire French economy, and demanded huge reparations in gold and food. However nearly 2 million French soldiers became prisoners of war in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Raffael Scheck, "The Prisoner of War Question and the Beginnings of Collaboration: The Franco-German Agreement of 16 November 1940." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 45#2 (2010): 364-388. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20753591 online]&lt;/ref&gt; They served as hostages and forced laborers in German factories.  Vichy was intensely conservative and anti-Communist, but it was practically helpless. Vichy finally collapsed when the Germans fled in summer 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson and Simon Kitson, "The paradoxes of foreign policy in Vichy France," in Jonathan Adelman, ed., ''Hitler and His Allies in World War Two.'' (Routledge, 2007) pp&amp;nbsp;79–115 [https://www.amazon.com/Hitler-His-Allies-World-War/dp/0415321670/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States granted Vichy full diplomatic recognition, sending Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] to Paris as American ambassador. President Roosevelt hoped to use American influence to encourage those elements in the Vichy government opposed to military collaboration with Germany. Vichy still controlled its overseas colonies and Washington encouraged Vichy to resist German demands such as for air bases in Syria or to move war supplies through French North Africa. The essential American position was that France should take no action not explicitly required by the armistice terms that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. When Germany took full control, the U.S. and Canada cut their ties with Vichy.&lt;ref&gt;William Langer, ''Our Vichy gamble'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; by 1942, Germany was demanding that Vichy turnover the Jews for deportation to German concentration camps. Reluctantly at first, then more enthusiastically, Vichy complied. They turned over 80,000 of the 330,000 French and foreign Jews living in Vichy; the Germans killed 77,000.  When Germany tried to seize the  French fleet at Toulon in November, 1942, the French navy scuttled all its ships.

====French fleet====
Britain feared that the powerful French navy could end up in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to maintaining north Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France had been allowed to retain the [[French Navy]], the ''Marine Nationale'', under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never fall into the hands of Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to far away territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. Shortly after France gave up it attacked a large French naval contingent in [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|Mers-el-Kebir]], killing 1,297 French military personnel. Vichy severed diplomatic relations but did not declare war on Britain. Churchill also ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. The French squadron at [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], under Admiral [[René-Emile Godfroy]], was effectively interned until 1943.

The American position towards Vichy France and Free France was inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked and distrusted de Gaulle, and agreed with Ambassador Leahy's view that he was an "apprentice dictator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mayers|title=FDR's Ambassadors and the Diplomacy of Crisis: From the Rise of Hitler to the End of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjLKYL3xbmAC&amp;pg=PA160|year= 2012|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Africa====
Preparing for a landing in North Africa in late 1942, the US looked for a top French ally. It turned to [[Henri Giraud]] shortly before the landing on 8 November 1942, but he had little local support. By hapstance the Vichy leader Admiral [[François Darlan]] was captured and supported the Americans. The Allies, with General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in charge, signed a deal with Admiral Darlan on 22 November 1942 in which the Allies recognized Darlan as high commissioner for North Africa and West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur L. Funk, "Negotiating the 'Deal with Darlan,'" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1973) 8#1 pp&amp;nbsp;81–117 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259995 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied world was stunned at giving a high command to man who days before had been collaborating with the Nazis; Roosevelt and Churchill supported Eisenhower, for he was following a plan that had been worked out in London and had been approved by Roosevelt and Churchill. Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942, so Washington turned again towards Giraud, who was made High Commissioner of French North and West Africa. Giraud failed to build a political base and was displaced by the last man with any standing, de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas, "The Discarded Leader: General Henri Giraud and the Foundation of the French Committee of National Liberation," ''French History'' (1996) 10#12 pp&amp;nbsp;86–111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free France===
{{see also|Free French Forces}}
[[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]]

Free France was the insurgent French government based in London and the overseas French colonies and led by charismatic general [[Charles de Gaulle]]. De Gaulle had been a [[Secretary of state]] in the last [[Constitution|consistutional]] government in the [[French Third Republic]]. From London on 18 June 1940 he gave an impassioned radio address [[Appeal of 18 June|exhorting the patriotic French people to resist]] [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="Berthon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allies at War: Allies at War: The Bitter Rivalry among Churchill, Roosevelt, and de Gaulle |last=Berthon|first=Simon|year=2001|publisher=Collins|place=London|isbn=0-00-711622-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He organized the [[Free French Forces]] from soldiers that had escaped with the British at Dunkirk. With British military support the Free French gradually gained control of all French colonies except [[French Indochina|Indochina]], which the Japanese controlled. The U.S., Britain and Canada wanted Vichy to keep nominal control of the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon|St. Pierre and Miquelon]] for reasons of prestige, but de Gaulle seized them anyway in late 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas, "Deferring to Vichy in the Western Hemisphere: The St. Pierre and Miquelon Affair of 1941," ''International History Review'' (1997) 19#4 pp&amp;nbsp;809–835.[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.1997.9640805#.UcdqXJyDnsg online]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the British and Americans landed in France in June 1944 de Gaulle headed a government in exile based in London, but he continued to create diplomatic problems for the U.S. and Britain. He refused to allow French soldiers to land on D-Day, and insisted that France be treated as a great power by the other Allies, and that he himself was the only representative of France. Churchill, caught between the U.S. and de Gaulle, tried to find a compromise.&lt;ref name="Milton Viorst 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="David G. Haglund 2007"/&gt; The U.S. and Britain allowed de Gaulle the honor of being the first to march into Paris at the head of his army after the Germans had fled.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Lacouture, ''DeGaulle: The Rebel, 1890–1944'' (1990) pp&amp;nbsp;515–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutrals==
The main neutrals were [[Irish neutrality during World War II|Ireland]], Portugal, Spain, [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden]], Switzerland and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Wylie, ''European Neutrals and Non-Belligerents During the Second World War'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union was officially neutral until June 1941 in Europe, and until August 1945 in Asia, when it attacked Japan in cooperation with the U.S.

===Latin America===
The U.S. believed, falsely, that Germany had a master plan to subvert and take control of the economy of much of South America. Washington made anti-Nazi activity a high priority in the region. By July 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt authorized the creation of the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] (OCIAA) in response to perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy. Through the use of news, film and radio broadcast media in the United States, Roosevelt sought to enhance his [[Good Neighbor policy]], promote [[Pan-Americanism]] and forestall military hostility in Latin America through the use of [[cultural diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Media Sound &amp; Culture in Latin America.

''World War II in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, with General Sources: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1997) pp&amp;nbsp;415–37&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba declared war in December 1941 and actively helped in the defense of the Panama Canal. It did not send forces to Europe. Mexico declared war on Germany in 1942 after u-boats sank Mexican tankers carrying crude oil to the United States. It sent a 300-man [[Escuadrón 201|fighter squadron]] to the war against Japan in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Leonard, and John F. Bratzel, eds. ''Latin America During World War II'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil declared war against Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 and sent a 25,700-man infantry force that fought mainly on the Italian front, from September 1944 to May 1945. Its Navy and Air Force acted in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank D. McCann]], "Brazil, the United States, and World War II," ''Diplomatic History'' (1979) 3#1 pp&amp;nbsp;59–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Argentina====
{{main|Argentina during World War II}}
Argentina hosted a strong, very-well-organized pro-Nazi element before the war that was controlled by German ambassadors. Brazil, Chile and Mexico had smaller movements.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Müller, ''Nationalsozialismus in Lateinamerika: Die Auslandsorganisation der NSDAP in Argentinien, Brasilien, Chile und Mexiko, 1931–1945'' (1997) 567pp.&lt;/ref&gt; American foreign-policy worked to unite all of Latin America in a coalition against Germany. Argentina proved recalcitrant, and the US worked to undermine the Argentine government. The American policy backfired when the [[1943 Argentine coup d'état|military seized power in a coup in 1943]]. Relationships grew worse to the point that Washington seriously considered economic and diplomatic isolation of Argentina and tried unsuccessfully to keep it out of the United Nations in 1945. Historians now agree that the supposed affinity between Argentina and Germany was greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Randall B. Woods. Hull and Argentina: Wilsonian Diplomacy in the Age of Roosevelt, Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs (1974) 16#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;350–371 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/174890 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine government remained neutral until the last days of the war but quietly tolerated entry of Nazi leaders fleeing Germany, Belgium and Vichy France in 1945. Indeed, a [[ODESSA|conspiracy theory]] grew up after the war that greatly exaggerated the Nazi numbers and amount of gold they brought. Historians have shown there was little gold and probably not many Nazis, but the myths live on.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald C. Newton, ''The "Nazi Menace" in Argentina, 1931–1947'' (Stanford U.P., 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stahl, "Odessa und das 'Nazigold' in Südamerika: Mythen und ihre Bedeutungen' ["Odessa and "Nazi Gold" in South America: Myths and Their Meanings"] ''Jahrbuch fuer Geschichte Lateinamerikas'' (2011), Vol. 48, pp&amp;nbsp;333–360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic States===
{{main|Occupation of the Baltic states}}
Despite declaring neutrality the Baltic states were secretly assigned to the Soviet [[Sphere of influence]] via the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact]] and subsequently occupied by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. [[Baltic Legations (1940–91)|Diplomatic legations]] continued to represent the Baltic states throughout the period. The United States never recognized control by Germans or USSR.

===Ireland===
{{main|Irish neutrality during World War II}}
Ireland tried to be strictly neutral during the war, and refused to allow Britain to use bases. However it had large sales of exports to Britain, and tens of thousands joined the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fisk, ''In Time of War: Ireland, Ulster and the Price of Neutrality 1939–1945'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
{{Main|Portugal during World War II}}
[[Image:LocationAzores.png|400px|thumb|Location of the Azores Islands]]
Portugal controlled strategically vital Azores islands in the Atlantic, and Britain and the U.S. made plans called [[Operation Alacrity]] to invade them if necessary. Portugal although it had an alliance with Britain was officially neutral; its highest goal was to avoid a German invasion.  Its dictator [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] collaborated with the British and sold them rubber and tungsten ("wolfram").&lt;ref&gt;William Gervase Clarence-Smith, "The Portuguese Empire and the 'Battle for Rubber' in the Second World War," ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2011), 19#1 pp&amp;nbsp;177–196&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1943 he allowed the Allies to establish air bases in the Azores to fight U-boats. He helped Spain avoid German control. Tungsten was a major product, and he sold to Germany; he stopped in June 1944, when the threat of a German invasion of Portugal was no longer possible.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Wheeler, "The Price of Neutrality: Portugal, the Wolfram Question, and World War II," ''Luso-Brazilian Review'' (1986) 23#1 pp&amp;nbsp;107–127 and 23#2 pp&amp;nbsp;97–111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Stevens, "World War II Economic Warfare: The United States, Britain, and Portuguese Wolfram."

Davis, "Salazar, Timor, and Portuguese Neutrality in World War II," ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2005) 13#1 pp&amp;nbsp;449–476.&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted several thousand Jewish refugees. Lisbon maintained air connections with Britain and the U.S. Lisbon was a hotbed of spies and served as the base for the International Red Cross in its distribution of relief supplies to POWs held by Germany. The Quakers and other peace groups used it as a base for their aid to refugees.&lt;ref&gt;William Howard Wriggins, ''Picking up the Pieces from Portugal to Palestine: Quaker Refugee Relief in World War II'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{main|Spain in World War II}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg|right|thumb|Nazi leaders (from left) [[Karl Wolff]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]] meet with Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] and his Foreign Minister [[Ramón Serrano Súñer|Serrano Súñer]] in Madrid, October 1940.]]

Nazi leaders spent much of the war attempting to persuade the [[Franco regime]] to enter the war and allow a German army to march on Gibraltar. The overtures proved futile. Franco was sympathetic but remained emphatically neutral. However, Spain did need to pay off its heavy debt to Germany. Therefore, Franco did provide various kinds of support to Italy and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire, Nazi rule in Occupied Europe'' (2009) pp.&amp;nbsp;114–5, 320&lt;/ref&gt; It sold Germany supplies, especially wolfram, the hard-to-find tungsten ore. It formed 45,000 volunteers into the [[Blue Division]], which fought exclusively on the Eastern Front.

Spain was neutral and traded as well with the Allies. Germany had an interest in seizing the key fortress of Gibraltar, but Franco stationed his army at the French border to dissuade Germany from occupying the Iberian Peninsula. Franco displayed pragmatism and his determination to act principally in Spanish interests, in the face of Allied economic pressure, Axis military demands, and Spain's geographic isolation. As the war progressed he became more hard-line toward Germany and more accommodating to the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/Franco-Hitler-Spain-Germany-World/dp/0300151225/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{main|Sweden during World War II}}


At the outbreak of war between Germany an Poland, Britain an France in September 1939, Sweden declared neutrality. At outbreak of war in November between Finland  and the  Soviet Union, Sweden declared "[[Non-belligerent]]" to make it possible to support Finland with arms and [[Military volunteer|Volunteers]] in the Winter War. From 13 December to the end of the war, a [[National unity government]] under Prime Minister [[Per Albin Hansson]] and Foreign Minister [[Christian Günther]] was formed that included all major parties in the Riksdag.

From April 1940 Sweden and Finland was encircled between the Nazi Germany and the Soviet union and subject to both British and German [[blockades]]. In spring-summer 1940 the United States stopped delivery of fighter aircraft to Sweden.
Sweden made concessions to both Allies and Germany. It held that that neutrality and cooperation with Germany were necessary for survival, for Germany was vastly more powerful, concessions were limited and were only made where the threat was too great; neutrality was bent but not broken; national unity was paramount; and in any case Sweden had the neutral right to trade with Germany. Germany needed Swedish iron and had nothing to gain—and much iron to lose—by an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;John Gilmour, ''Sweden, the Swastika, and Stalin: The Swedish Experience in the Second World War'' (2011) pp&amp;nbsp;270–71 [https://www.questia.com/library/120075612/sweden-the-swastika-and-stalin-the-swedish-experience online]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a free country, refugees from Finland, Norway, Denmark an the Baltic states fled to Sweden during the war. During the last part of the war, it was possible to save some victims from German [[White Buses|concentration camps]].

===Switzerland===
{{main|Switzerland during the World Wars}}
Switzerland was neutral and did business with both sides. It mobilized its army to defend itself against any invasion. The [[Operation Tannenbaum|Germans did make plans]], but never invaded.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Urner, ''Let's Swallow Switzerland: Hitler's Plans against the Swiss Confederation'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Cut off from the Allies, Swiss trade was mostly with Germany, with Swiss banks a favourite place for Nazis to store their loot. The Swiss depended on German permission to import its food and fuel. Smuggling high precision tools and weapons (such as jewel bearings, diamond dies, and chronographs) to Britain took place on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Wylie, "British Smuggling Operations from Switzerland, 1940–1944," ''Historical Journal'' (2005) 48#5 pp. 1077–1102 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4091649 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland became a convenient center for spies and espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Halbrook, ''Swiss and the Nazis: How the Alpine Republic Survived in the Shadow of the Third Reich'' (2010) ch 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss banks paid Germany 1.3 billion Swiss Francs for gold; Germany used the Francs to buy supplies on the world market. However much of the gold was looted and the Allies warned Switzerland during the war. In 1947 Switzerland paid 250 million francs in exchange for the dropping of claims relating to the Swiss role in the gold transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Z. Slany|title=US and Allied Efforts to Recover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen Or Hidden by Germany During World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dRKMeIM6EcC&amp;pg=PA100|year=1997|publisher=DIANE Publishing|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland took in 48,000 refugees during the war, of whom 20,000 were Jewish. They also turned away about 40,000 applicants for refugee status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georg Kreis|title=Switzerland and the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe92SCpUBM8C&amp;pg=PT132|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook, ''Swiss and the Nazis'' ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland's role regarding Nazi Germany became highly controversial in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, ''Between the Alps and a Hard Place: Switzerland in World War II and the Rewriting of History'', (2013) [https://www.amazon.com/Between-Alps-Hard-Place-ebook/dp/B00BY6TRB2/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie says, "Switzerland has been widely condemned for its part in the war. It has been accused of abetting genocide, by refusing to offer sanctuary to Hitler's victims, bankrolling the Nazi war economy, and callously profiting from Hitler's murderous actions by seizing the assets of those who perished in the death camps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neville Wylie|title=Britain, Switzerland, and the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoZ75_E3fpMC&amp;pg=PA2|year=2003|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A recent example of the expose literature is Adam LeBor, ''Tower of Basel: The Shadowy History of the Secret Bank that Runs the World'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Churchill told his foreign minister in late 1944:
:"Of all the neutrals, Switzerland has the great right to distinction. She has been the sole international force linking the hideous-sundered nations and ourselves. What does it matter whether she has been able to give us the commercial advantages we desire or has given too many to the German, to keep herself alive? She has been a democratic state, standing for freedom in self defence among her mountains, and in thought, despite of race, largely on our side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Leitz|title=Nazi Germany and neutral Europe: during the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=147g760AE9cC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2000|publisher=Manchester U.P,|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey was neutral in the war, but signed a treaty with Britain and France in October 1939 that said the Allies would defend Turkey if Germany attacked it. The deal was enhanced with loans of ₤41 million. An invasion was threatened in 1941 but did not happen and Ankara refused German requests to allow troops to cross its borders into Syria or into the USSR. Germany had been its largest trading partner before the war, and Turkey continued to do business with both sides. It purchased arms from both sides. The Allies tried to stop German purchases of chrome (used in making better steel). Starting in 1942 the Allies provided military aid and pressed for a declaration of war. Turkey's president conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in November, 1943, and promised to enter the war when it was fully armed. By August 1944, with Germany nearing defeat, Turkey broke off relations. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations. Meanwhile, relations with Moscow worsened, setting stage for the [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 and the start of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Erik J.

[[File:Second world war europe animation small.gif|thumb|300px|right|Animation of the European Theatre.]]
The dictators of Germany and Italy, Hitler and Mussolini, had numerous conferences. Neither ever met with top Japanese leaders. The Japanese ambassador to Germany handled many of the negotiations between Germany and Japan, but his coded messages home were intercepted and decrypted by the United States starting in 1941. The U.S. shared them with Britain. They revealed important German plans.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Boyd, ''Hitler's Japanese Confidant: General Oshima Hiroshi and Magic Intelligence, 1941–1945'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany's foreign policy during the war involved the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies, such as Italy and Hungary, and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as [[Vichy France]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'' (2009) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt; By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II'' (2005) p 414&lt;/ref&gt; When a country was no longer dependable, Germany would assume full control, as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Full control allowed the Nazis to achieve their high priority of mass murdering all Jewish population. Although Japan was officially a powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little coordination or cooperation, such as Germany's refusal to share the secret formula for making synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernd Martin|title=Japan and Germany in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_jBOpYASMQC&amp;pg=PA280|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=279–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10460, Adolf Hitler, Rednerposen.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hitler in action&lt;/center&gt;]]
DiNardo argues that in Europe Germany's foreign-policy was dysfunctional during the war, as Hitler treated each ally separately, and refused to create any sort of combined staff that would synchronize policies, armaments, and strategies. Italy, Finland, Romania, and Hungary each dealt with Berlin separately, and never coordinated their activities. Germany was reluctant to share its powerful weapons systems, or to train Axis officers. There were some exceptions, such as the close collaboration between the German and Italian forces in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. DiNardo, "The dysfunctional coalition: The axis powers and the eastern front in World War II," ''Journal of Military History'' (1996) 60#4 pp&amp;nbsp;711–730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. DiNardo, ''Germany and the Axis Powers: From Coalition to Collapse'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hitler====
[[Hitler]] devoted most of his attention during the war to military and diplomatic affairs. He frequently met with foreign leaders, such as the January 10, 1943 he met with Romanian Premier Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] at German field headquarters, with top-ranking generals on both sides. On 9 August 1943, Hitler summoned Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] to a stormy meeting at field headquarters, and demanded he declare war on Russia. The tsar refused, but did agree to declare war on far-away Britain. American news reports stated that Hitler tried to hit him and the tsar suffered a heart attack at the meeting; he died three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on File World News Digest'' (August 31, 1943)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forced labour====
{{main|Forced labour under German rule during World War II}}
German policy was not to use or build factories in occupied Eastern Europe but to move millions of workers into German factories and farms.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'' (2008) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt; Some were forced, some went voluntarily (going in search of food), and others were prisoners of war. They were closely watched, had poor food and housing, and were harshly treated. Their morale and levels of output were mediocre or poor.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Herbert, ''Hitler's Foreign Workers: Enforced Foreign Labour in Germany Under the Third Reich'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak the forced labourers comprised 20% of the German work force. Counting deaths and turnover, about 15 million individuals were forced labourers at one point or another during the war. Most came from Poland, Russia and other Eastern areas; all were repatriated at war's end.&lt;ref&gt;Panikos Panayi, "Exploitation, Criminality, Resistance. The Everyday Life of Foreign Workers and Prisoners of War in the German Town of Osnabrück, 1939–49," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (2005) 40#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;483–502 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30036339 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction'' (2007) pp. 476–85, 538–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Vichy France was one of the few countries that was able to have much influence on German policies, as it tried to protect the nearly two million French soldiers held as POWs inside Germany. Vichy arranged a deal whereby Germany would release one POW for every three Frenchmen who volunteered to work in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Curtis|title=Verdict on Vichy: Power and Prejudice in the Vichy France Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_1YIAcVKqkC&amp;pg=PT141|year=2002|publisher=Skyhorse|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Threatening Poland====
Before coming to power Hitler on his part denounced the right of Poland to independence writing that Poles and Czechs are a "rabble not worth a penny more than the inhabitants of Sudan or India. How can they demand the rights of independent states?",&lt;ref&gt;A ridiculous hundred million Slavs : concerning Adolf Hitler's world-view, Tadeusz Manteuffel Institute of History Polish Academy of Sciences, Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza page 49, Warsaw 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and demanding a new partition of Poland with nationalist Russia. Referring to the restoration of the Polish state, Hitler stated "the creation of the Polish state was the greatest crime ever committed against the German nation".&lt;ref&gt;A ridiculous hundred million Slavs : concerning Adolf Hitler's world-view, Tadeusz Manteuffel Institute of History Polish Academy of Sciences, Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza pages 91-92, Warsaw 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1934 Germany signed a non aggression pact with Poland followed by trade later in the year, while secretly organizing preparations in the following years for invasion of Poland and mass murder of Polish population&lt;ref&gt;Stutthof: hitlerowski obóz koncentracyjny Konrad Ciechanowski Wydawnictwo Interpress 1988, page 13"&lt;/ref&gt;
By the spring Hitler was openly pondering what inducements he might have to offer to obtain a military alliance with Poland.&lt;ref&gt;T. Snyder, ''Bloodlands, Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Vintage'', (2011). p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;   Between 1919 and 1939 Poland pursued a policy of balance between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and obtained non-aggression treaties with the former.&lt;ref&gt;Anna M. Cienciala, "The Foreign Policy of Józef Pi£sudski and Józef Beck, 1926–1939: Misconceptions and Interpretations," ''The Polish Review'' (2011) 56#1 pp&amp;nbsp;111–151 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41549951 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1939 Hitler wanted Poland to join the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] as a junior partner to help with the German invasion of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs, ''The Last European War: September 1939 - December 1941'' p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;   Steiner states that Hitler "wanted to broker an agreement with Colonel Beck, Poland's all-powerful foreign minister, which would bring Danzig and the Polish Corridor back into the Reich but keep Poland as a friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zara Steiner|title=The Triumph of the Dark:European International History 1933–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKOhFJFPI54C&amp;pg=PR6-IA26|year= 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=690–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Hitler offered Poland a new non-aggression pact and recognition of its current frontiers if it agreed to permit the German-inhabited city of Danzig to return to Germany as well as allow an extraterritorial highway connecting Germany proper with Danzig and East Prussia going through Polish territory.This would mean effectively annexing Polish territory while cutting off Poland from the sea and its main trade route.The Polish administration distrusted Hitler and saw the plan as a threat to Polish sovereignty, practically subordinating Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc while reducing the country to a state of near-servitude as its entire trade would be dependent on Germany.&lt;ref name="yale.edu"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/yellow/ylbk113.htm Avalon Project : The French Yellow Book : No. 113 - M.

In these circumstances, the new settlement proposed by Germany, which would link the questions of Danzig and of the passage across the Corridor with counterbalancing questions of a political nature, would only serve to aggravate this mortgage and practically subordinate Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc. Warsaw refused this in order to retain its independence."&lt;ref name="yale.edu"/&gt;  By March Hitler had given up on the Poles and in April began planning an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler, 1936–1945: Nemesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5fJYMxufVcC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2001|publisher=W W Norton |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's offers  are described by Max Domarus as an attempt to buy time before going against Poland.&lt;ref&gt;A ridiculous hundred million Slavs : concerning Adolf Hitler's world-view, Tadeusz Manteuffel Institute of History Polish Academy of Sciences, Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza page page 111, Warsaw 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland had few friends in the international arena.&lt;ref&gt;Zara Steiner, ''The Triumph of the Dark: European International History, 1933–1939'' (2011) pp&amp;nbsp;690–92, 738-41&lt;/ref&gt; Two critical developments caught Poland by surprise. At the end of March 1939 Britain and France announced that if Germany invaded Poland they would declare war. In terms of helping Poland militarily in an actual war, everyone realized very little could be done because the British and French military thought that if Germany invaded "Polish resistance would collapse in the early stages of fighting." Neither "was thinking of any major offensive action in the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Cameron Watt|title=How war came: the immediate origins of the Second World War, 1938–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-tmAAAAMAAJ|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hope was that the threat of a two-front war would deter Germany. Hitler believed that Britain and France were bluffing, but he handled the Soviet problem in late August, by an alliance agreement with Stalin, which included secret provisions to partition Poland—and indeed divide up much of eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Road to War: the Origins of World War II'' (1989) pp&amp;nbsp;1–20&lt;/ref&gt; The British and French offer was not a bluff—they did indeed declare war on Germany when it invaded Poland on 1 September, but neither was in a position to provide serious help.

Poland had a million-man army, but fell far short in terms of leadership, training, and equipment. The Polish military budget was about 2% of Germany's; its commanding general, Marshal Smigly-Rydz was not well prepared for the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed'' (2012) p 52&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet [[Red Army]] then [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] without a formal declaration of war on 17 September 1939, immediately after the undeclared war between the Soviet Union and the [[Empire of Japan]] at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] (Nomonhan) in the Far East had ended. Poland was then partitioned between Germany and the Soviet Union.

====Worldwide Fascist groups====
During the war, Nazi Germany cultivated relationships with Fascist and extreme right groups in neutral and Allied-controlled territory such as the [[Ossewabrandwag]], an Afrikaner paramilitary organisation based on the Nazi Party.

===Italy===
{{main|History of Italy|Italian Social Republic}}
Allied policy was to be friendly with [[Benito Mussolini]], the Fascist dictator of Italy, in the hopes he would either remain neutral or moderate Hitler's expansion plans.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morgan, ''The Fall of Mussolini: Italy, the Italians, and the Second World War'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May 1939, he joined the Axis with Germany, signing the [[Pact of Steel]]. When France was in the last stages of collapse Mussolini entered the war and gained some spoils. He brought along a powerful navy that could challenge the British for control of the Mediterranean. Roosevelt denounced the move: "On this 10th day of June, 1940, the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor." &lt;ref&gt;Langer and Gleason, ''Challenge to Isolation,'' 1:460-66, 502-8&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Italian social republic map.png|Thumb|right|250px|Italian Social Republic (RSI) as of 1943 in yellow and green. The green areas were German military operational zones under direct German administration.]]

Italy was poorly prepared for war and increasingly fell under Nazi dictation.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor Knox, ''Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Italian military efforts failed against Egypt, Greece, Ethiopia and Yugoslavia,&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn, ''Empire on the Adriatic: Mussolini's Conquest of Yugoslavia, 1941–1943'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany had to intervene to rescue its neighbor. After the Allies invaded and took Sicily and southern Italy in 1943, the regime collapsed. Mussolini was arrested and the King appointed General [[Pietro Badoglio]] as new Prime Minister. They [[Armistice of Cassibile|switched sides]], joined the Allies and banned the Fascist Party. However Germany moved in, occupying Italy north of Naples. German paratroopers rescued Mussolini and Hitler set him up as head of a puppet government the [[Italian Social Republic]], often called the Salò Republic; a [[Italian Civil War|civil war resulted]].  The Germans gave way slowly, for mountainous Italy offered many defensive opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith, ''Modern Italy: A Political History'' (1997) [https://www.questia.com/read/7696309?title=Italy%3a%20A%20Modern%20History online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain by 1944 feared that Italy would become a Communist state under Soviet influence. It abandoned its original concept of British hegemony in Italy and substituted for it a policy of support for an independent Italy with a high degree of American influence.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gat, "The Soviet Factor in British Policy towards Italy, 1943–1945," ''Historian'' (1988) 50#4 pp&amp;nbsp;535–557&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balkans===

[[File:Balkan boundary changes 1938 to 1941.jpg|thumb|350px]]
Hitler, preparing to invade the Soviet Union, diverted attention to make sure the southern or Balkan flank was secure.  Romania was under heavy pressure, and was forced to cede 40,000 square miles of territory with 4 million people to the USSR, Hungary and Bulgaria; German troops came in to protect the vital oil fields (Germany's only source of oil besides the USSR). Romania signed the Axis Pact and became a German ally (November 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Deletant, ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania, 1940–1944'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  So too did Hungary (November 1940) and Bulgaria (March, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Held, ed.

====Greece====
[[File:Contre-Offens Grèce Italie es.svg|thumb|Greek counteroffensive against Italian-controlled Albania, late 1940.]]
{{main|History of Greece#World War II|Military history of Greece during World War II|Greek Resistance|Battle of Greece}}

In spring 1939, [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy occupied and annexed Albania]]. Britain tried to deter an invasion by guaranteeing Greece's frontiers. Greece, under the dictatorship of [[Ioannis Metaxas]], to support the Allies' interests [[Ohi Day|rejected Italian demands]]. Italy invaded Greece on 28 October 1940, but Greeks repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle (see [[Greco-Italian War]]). By mid-December, 1940, the Greeks occupied nearly a quarter of Albania, tying down 530,000 Italian troops. Metaxas tended to favor Germany but after he died in January 1941 Greece accepted British troops and supplies.  In March 1941, a major Italian counterattack failed, humiliating Italian military pretensions.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sadkovich, "The Italo-Greek War in Context: Italian Priorities and Axis Diplomacy," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1993) 28#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;439–464 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/260641  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany needed to secure its strategic southern flank in preparation for an invasion of the USSR, Hitler reluctantly launched the [[Battle of Greece]] in April 1941. Axis troops successfully invaded through Yugoslavia, quickly overcoming Greek and, British defenders. Greece was partitioned under German, Italian, and Bulgarian occupation. A Greek government-in-exile was formed in Cairo (it moved to London), and Germany set up a puppet government in Athens. The latter attracted numerous anti-Communist elements.

Wartime conditions were severe for civilians; famine was rampant as grain production plunged and Germany seized food supplies for its own needs. Malaria became epidemic. The Germans retaliated brutally for sabotage by the [[Greek Resistance]]. Multiple resistance groups organized, but they often opposed each other. They included the [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES), the [[National and Social Liberation]]  (EKKA). Strongest of all was the Communist [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM); its military arm, the National Popular Liberation Army (ELAS) had 50,000 soldiers. The rivalries set the stage for a civil war after the Germans left in September 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yugoslavia and Croatia====
Yugoslavia signed on as a German ally in March 1941, but within days an anti-Nazi coup, led by Serbians with British help, overthrew the prince regent, repudiated the Nazis, and installed the 17-year-old heir as [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Lampe, ''Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country'' (2nd ed. 2000) pp 201-232.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mussolini and Pavelic 1941.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Croatia's dictator [[Ante Pavelić]] (left) with Mussolini in 1941; Independent State of Croatia (not to be confused with the present-day Republic of Croatia) was a new Axis state]]

Germany immediately bombarded the capital Belgrade and invaded in force on April 6. Within days the Germans were in full control; the new king fled as did many party leaders. However some prominent politicians supported the Germans, and others were passive. The German invasion set off an extremely bloody, long civil war that killed over a million people.  Germany dismembered Yugoslavia, with slices going to Germany and Italy. Kosovo was given to Albania (then under Italian control). Macedonia went to Bulgaria and Vojvodina was given over to Hungary. Serbia became a German puppet state and was the cockpit of the resistance.  In Slovenia, Germans deported Slovenes to Serbia, enrolled them in the German army, or deported them to Germany to work in war factories and labor camps. In Serbia the Germans set up General [[Milan Nedić]] in charge of a "government of national salvation" but did not permit it to maintain a regular army or foreign affairs ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pavlowitch, ''Hitler's New Disorder: The Second World War in Yugoslavia'' (2008) [https://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-New-Disorder-Yugoslavia-Columbia/dp/0231700504/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

What was left of Yugoslavia became the new [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) under the rule of [[Ante Pavelić]] and his fascist [[Ustashe]] party. It became an Axis ally and controlled Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ustaše murdered around 90,000 people (mostly Serbs, along with 37,000 Jews), expelled 250,000, and forced another 200,000 to convert to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Tomislav Dulić, "Mass killing in the Independent State of Croatia, 1941–1945: a case for comparative research."

Two major anti-German anti-fascist guerrilla movements emerged, the first in Europe self-organised anti-fascist movement (started in Croatia) partisans led by a Croat [[Josip Broz Tito]] had the initial support from the Kremlin. The [[Chetniks]] led by the Serbian chetnik Colonel [[Draža Mihailović]] was loyal to the royal government in exile based in London.  Tito's movement won out in 1945, executed its enemies, and reunited Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Roberts, ''Tito, Mihailović, and the allies, 1941-1945'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{Further|History of Japanese foreign relations}}
[[File:Hitler+JapAmbassadormeet.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] meeting Japanese ambassador to Germany [[Hiroshi Ōshima]], 1942]]
Japan had conquered all of Manchuria and most of China by 1939 in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], but the Allies refused to recognize the conquests.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Feis, ''China Tangle: The American Effort in China from Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Mission'' (1953) [http://press.princeton.edu/TOCs/c517.html contents]&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan joined the Axis with Germany, but shared little information.  Japan depended on imports from the Allies for 90% of its oil, and the cutoff of oil shipments in mid-1941 left Japan with supplies for only a year or two of serious combat by its warships and warplanes unless it came to terms regarding China, or seized oil fields controlled by Britain and the Netherlands. The latter course meant war, and was urged by army officials who had been bloodied in [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|border conflicts]] and were reluctant to engage the Soviets. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister [[Konoe Fumimaro]], believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power. Diplomats proposed political compromises in the form of the "Amau Doctrine", dubbed the "Japanese Monroe Doctrine" which would have given the Japanese free rein with regard to  China. These proposals were rejected by the U.S.; the Japanese Army now demanded a military solution.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Borg, ''The United States and the Far Eastern crisis of 1933–1938'' (1964) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haruo Tohmatsu and H. P. Willmott, ''A Gathering Darkness: The Coming of War to the Far East and the Pacific'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imperial conquests====
[[File:Japanese Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|300px|The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in 1942.]]
Japan launched its own blitzkriegs in East Asia. In 1937, the Japanese Army invaded and captured most of the coastal Chinese cities such as Shanghai. Japan took over [[French Indochina]] (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia), [[British Malaya]] (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore) as well as the [[Dutch East Indies]] (Indonesia). [[Thailand]] managed to stay independent by becoming a satellite state of Japan. In December 1941 to May 1942, Japan sank major elements of the American, British and Dutch fleets, captured [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Lindsay, ''The Battle for Hong Kong, 1941–1945: Hostage to Fortune'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and reached the borders of India and began bombing Australia. Japan suddenly had achieved its goal of ruling the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].

====Imperial rule====
[[File:Manchukuo011.jpg|thumb|200px|1935 poster of the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] promoting harmony among peoples. The caption reads: "With the help of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, the world can be in peace."]]
The ideology of Japan's colonial empire, as it expanded dramatically during the war, contained two contradictory impulses.  On the one hand, it preached the unity of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], a coalition of Asian races, directed by Japan, against the imperialism of Britain, France, the Netherlands, United States, and Europe in general.  This approach celebrated the spiritual values of the East in opposition to the crass materialism of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Davidann, "Citadels of Civilization: U.S. and Japanese Visions of World Order in the Interwar Period," in Richard Jensen, et al. eds., ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'' (2003) pp&amp;nbsp;21–43&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it was a euphemistic title for grabbing land and acquiring essential natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Spector]], ''Eagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan'' (1985) pp 42, 62-64&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese installed organizationally-minded bureaucrats and engineers to run their new empire, and they believed in ideals of efficiency, modernization, and engineering solutions to social problems.  It was [[fascism]] based on technology, and rejected Western norms of democracy.  After 1945, the engineers and bureaucrats took over, and turned the wartime techno-fascism into entrepreneurial management skills.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Moore, ''Constructing East Asia: Technology, Ideology, and Empire in Japan's Wartime Era, 1931–1945'' (2013) pp&amp;nbsp;226–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan set up puppet regimes in Manchuria ("[[Manchukuo]]") and China; proper; they vanished at the end of the war. The Japanese Army operated ruthless governments in most of the conquered areas, but paid more favorable attention to the Dutch East Indies. The main goal was to obtain oil, but Japan sponsored an Indonesian nationalist movement under [[Sukarno]].&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Sluimers, "The Japanese military and Indonesian independence," ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'' (1996) 27#1 pp&amp;nbsp;19–36&lt;/ref&gt;  Sukarno finally came to power in the late 1940s after several years of battling the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hering, ''Soekarno: Founding Father of Indonesia, 1901–1945'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch destroyed their oil wells but the Japanese reopened them. However most of the tankers taking oil to Japan were sunk by American submarines, so Japan's oil shortage became increasing acute.

[[File:Showa Steel Works.JPG|thumb|Shōwa Steel Works was a mainstay of the [[Economy of Manchukuo]]]]

Manchuria, the historic homeland of the Manchu dynasty, had an ambiguous character after 1912.  It was run by local warlords.  The Japanese Army seized control in 1931, and set up a puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932 for the 34,000,000 inhabitants.  Other areas were added, and over 800,000 Japanese moved in as administrators.  The nominal ruler was [[Puyi]], who as a small child had been the last Emperor of China.  He was deposed during the revolution of 1911, and now the Japanese brought him back in a powerless role.  Only Axis countries recognized Manchukuo.  The United States in 1932 announced the [[Stimson Doctrine]] stating that it would never recognize Japanese sovereignty.  Japan modernized the economy and operated it as a satellite to the Japanese economy.  It was out of range of American bombers, so its factories continued their output to the end.  Manchukuo  was returned to China in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Prasenjit Duara, ''Sovereignty and Authenticity: Manchukuo and the East Asian Modern'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Japan seized control of China proper in 1937–38, the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army set up the [[Reorganized National Government of China]], a puppet state, under the nominal leadership of [[Wang Jingwei|Wang Ching-wei]] (1883–1944). It was based in  Nanjing. The Japanese were in full control; the puppet state declared war on the Allies in 1943.  Wang was allowed to administer the International Settlement in Shanghai.  The puppet state had an army of 900,000 soldiers, and was positioned against the Nationalist army under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].  It did little fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald E. Bunker,  Peace Conspiracy: Wang Ching-wei and the China War, 1937–41'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David P. Barrett and Larry N. Shyu, eds. ''Chinese Collaboration with Japan, 1932–1945: The Limits of Accommodation'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military defeats====
The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] initially appeared to be a major success that knocked out the American battle fleet—but it missed the aircraft carriers that were at sea and ignored vital shore facilities whose destruction could have crippled US Pacific operations. Ultimately, the attack proved a long-term strategic disaster that actually inflicted relatively little significant long-term damage while provoking the United States to seek revenge in an all-out [[total war]] in which no terms short of [[unconditional surrender]] would be entertained.

[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic cloud over Hiroshima]], 1945]]
However, as Admiral Yamamoto warned, Japan's six-month window of military advantage following Pearl Harbor ended with the Japanese Navy's offensive ability being crippled at the hands of the American Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]].  As the war became one of mass production and logistics, the U.S. built  a far stronger navy with more numerous warplanes, and a superior communications and logistics system. The Japanese had stretched too far and were unable to supply their forward bases—many soldiers died of starvation. Japan built warplanes in large quantity but the quality plunged, and the performance of poorly trained pilots spiraled downward.&lt;ref&gt;Eric M Bergerud, ''Fire In The Sky: The Air War In The South Pacific'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Navy lost a series of major battles, from Midway (1942) to the Philippine Sea (1944) and Leyte Gulf (1945), which put American long-range B-29 bombers in range. A series of massive raids burned out much of Tokyo and 64 major industrial cities beginning in March 1945 while [[Operation Starvation]] seriously disrupted the nation's vital internal shipping lanes. Regardless of how the war was becoming hopeless, the circle around the Emperor held fast and refused to open negotiations. Finally in August, two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria demonstrated the cause was futile, and [[Hirohito]] authorized a surrender whereby he kept his throne with his powers taken away.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the making of modern Japan'' (2001)  pp. 487–32&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deaths====
Total Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war. Starvation or malnutrition-related illness accounted for roughly 80 percent of Japanese military deaths in the Philippines, and 50 percent of military fatalities in China. The aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities appears to have taken a minimum of 400,000 and possibly closer to 600,000 civilian lives (over 100,000 in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths in the battle of Okinawa). Civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;John Dower  "Lessons from Iwo Jima".

===Finland===
{{Main|Winter War|Continuation War|}}
[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb|Hitler and Finnish commander-in-chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Field Marshal
Mannerheim]] (right)]]
Finland [[Military history of Finland during World War II|fought two major wars]] against the USSR: the [[Winter War]] after the USSR invaded, of 1940–41 and the [[Continuation War]] of 1941–44, in which Finland teamed with Germany in seeking revenge. It lost both. It fought one small one, the [[Lapland War]] to successfully drive German forces out of Lapland in 1944–45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vehviläinen |first1=Olli |title=Finland in the Second World War |year=2002 |publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henrik O. Lunde, ''Finland's War of Choice: The Troubled German-Finnish Alliance in World War II'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence. Finland before 1918 had been a province of Russia, and many Finnish speakers lived in neighboring parts of Russia. After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939 starting the [[Winter War]]. Finland won very wide popular support in Britain and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Forster, "Finland's Foreign Policy 1940–1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy," ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp&amp;nbsp;109–123&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet success in Finland would threaten Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region. The Soviets overwhelmed the Finnish resistance in the [[Winter War]], and a peace treaty was signed in March 1940. It ceded some Finnish territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Jakobson, ''The Diplomacy of the Winter War: An Account of the Russo-Finnish War, 1939–1940'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Winter War, Finland sought protection and support from the Britain and Sweden without success. Finland drew closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories. Finland declared war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941 in what is called the [[Continuation War]].&lt;ref&gt;Mauno Jokipii. "Finland's Entrance into the Continuation War," ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1982), Issue 53, pp&amp;nbsp;85–103.&lt;/ref&gt; To meet Stalin's demands, Britain reluctantly declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti–Ribbentrop Agreement]]. The arms-length collaboration with Germany stemmed from a precarious balance struck by the Finns in order to avoid antagonizing Britain and the United States. In the end Britain declared war to satisfy the needs of its Soviet policy, but did not engage in combat against Finland. Finland concluded armistice negotiations with the USSR under strong German pressure to continue the war, while British and American acted in accord with their own alliances with the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomo Polvinen, "The Great Powers and Finland 1941–1944," ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1985), Issue 62, pp&amp;nbsp;133–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk.&lt;ref name="MannJörgensen2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Mann and Christer Jörgensen|title=Hitler's Arctic War: The German Campaigns in Norway, Finland, and the USSR 1940–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhZoR0N6UgMC&amp;pg=PA69|year=2003|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.

After Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, in 1944 Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, opened negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under its terms Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.

==Governments in Exile==
Britain welcomed governments in exile to set up their headquarters in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Conway and José Gotovitch, eds.|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain, 1940–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxN5K9pAG1gC|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others were set up in neutral or other allied territory. Recognition for these bodies would vary and change over time.

===Poland: in exile and underground===
{{Main|Polish government-in-exile}}
[[File:The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied.pdf|thumb|right|"[[The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland]]", note of [[Polish government-in-exile]] addressed to the [[Allies of WWII|wartime allies]] of the then-[[Declaration by United Nations|United Nations]], 1942]]
[[File:Protest-inc-w-ghetcie-warszawskim-za-murem-odcinajacym-od-swiata-kilkaset-tysiecy-0.jpg|thumb|[[Protest!|Protest against killing Jews in Poland]] of [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka|Kossak-Szczucka]] printed in occupied Poland - 28 August 1942.]]
When the Polish forces were demolished by Germany in the first three weeks of September 1939, the government vanished and most Polish leaders [[Romanian Bridgehead|fled to Romania]], where they were interred. Other leaders escaped to France, and later to London, where the [[Polish government-in-exile]] was set up by [[Władysław Sikorski|General Sikorski]]. It was recognized by the Allies until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadeta Tendyra, ''The Polish Government in Exile, 1939–45'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halik Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War'' (2014) ch 11-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[Polish Underground State|underground resistance movement]] formed inside Poland; it nominally reported to the government in exile. During the war about 400,000 Poles joined the underground [[Polish Home Army]], about 200,000 went into [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|combat on western fronts]] in units loyal to the Polish government in exile, and about 300,000 [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling Army: 1943-1945|fought under Soviet command]] in the last stages of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'' (2006)  pp.&amp;nbsp;264–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the start of the war the body protested on the international stage against the German occupation of their territory and the treatment of their civilian population. In 1940 the Polish Ministry of Information produced a list of those it believed had been murdered by the Nazis. On 10 December 1942, the [[Polish government-in-exile]] published a 16-page report addressed to the Allied governments, titled ''The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland''.{{Efn|See: Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (10 December 1942), ''[[:File:The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied.pdf|The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland.]] Note to the Governments of the United Nations.''}} The report contained eight pages of [[Raczyński's Note]], which was sent to foreign ministers of 26 governments who signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] on 1 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Engel (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
After Germany swept to control in April 1940, the government in exile, including the royal family, was based in London.  Politics were suspended and the government coordinated action with the Allies, retained control of a worldwide diplomatic and consular service, and operated the huge Norwegian merchant marine. It organized and supervised the resistance within Norway. One long-term impact was the abandonment of a traditional Scandinavian policy of neutrality; Norway became a founding member of NATO in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Erik J. Friis, "The Norwegian Government-In-Exile, 1940-45" in ''Scandinavian Studies. Essays Presented to Dr. Henry Goddard Leach on the Occasion of his Eighty-fifth Birthday'' (1965), p422-444.&lt;/ref&gt;  Norway at the start of the war had the world's fourth largest merchant fleet, at 4.8 million tons, including a fifth of the world's oil tankers. The Germans captured about 20% of the fleet but the remainder, about 1000 ships, were taken over by the government.  Although half the ships were sunk, the earnings paid the expenses of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Dear and Foot, ''Oxford Companion'' (1995) pp&amp;nbsp;818–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johs Andenaes, ''Norway and the Second World War'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The government in 1940 fled to London, where it had command of some colonies as well as the Dutch navy and merchant marine.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Woodruff, ''Relations between the Netherlands Government-in-Exile and occupied Holland during World War II'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived in London the Government in exile considered itself still neutral but found its desire for the liberation of the Netherlands coinciding with the war aims of the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;van Panhuys, HF (1978) International Law in the Netherlands, Volume 1, T.M.C. Asser Instituut P99&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of France the Dutch Prime Minister [[Dirk Jan de Geer]] advocated negotiating a separate peace between the Netherlands and the Third Reich. [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] fearing that the loss of the [[Dutch East Indies]] to Japan would be a term of any treaty vetoed any agreement. On 3 September 1940 the Queen dismissed her prime minister and replaced him with [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy]], who worked with Churchill and Roosevelt on ways to smooth the path for an American entry. [[Aruba]] together with [[Curaçao]] the then world-class exporting oil refineries were the main suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945. On November 23, 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States occupied [[Suriname|Dutch Guiana]] to protect the bauxite mines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html World War II Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czechoslovakia===

The [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] was an informal title given to the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee originally created by the former Czechoslovak President, [[Edvard Beneš]] in Paris in October 1939.&lt;ref name=Crampton&gt;Crampton, R. J. ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century — and after''. Routledge. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsuccessful negotiations with [[France]] for diplomatic status, as well as the impending [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation of France]], forced the Committee to withdraw to [[London]] in 1940. The body was eventually considered, by those countries that recognized it, as the legal continuation of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]].

===Belgium===
{{main|Belgium in World War II}}
The German invasion lasted only 18 days in 1939 before the Belgian army surrendered. The king remained behind, but the government escaped to France and then to England in 1940.  Belgium was liberated in late 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Eliezer Yapou, ''Governments in Exile, 1939–1945: Leadership from London and Resistance at Home'' (1998) ch 4 [http://governmentsinexile.com/yapoubelgium.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium had two holdings in Africa, the very large colony of the [[Belgian Congo]] and the mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgian Congo was not occupied and remained loyal to the Allies as a useful economic asset. The government in exile sold 3.4 million pounds of uranium ore from the Congo to the U.S. for the atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan E. Helmreich|title=United States Relations with Belgium and the Congo, 1940–1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvsynDQxpekC&amp;pg=PA54|year=1998|publisher=U. of Delaware Press|pages=43–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troops from the Belgian Congo participated in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] against the Italians. The colonial ''[[Force Publique]]'' also served in other theatres alongside British forces.

===Yugoslavia in exile===
{{Main|World War II in Yugoslavia}}
Yugoslavia had a weak government in exile based in London that included [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]]. However, power inside the country was divided three ways between the Germans and their allies, and two Serbian resistance groups. The royalist anti-Communist [[Chetniks]] under [[Draža Mihailović]], was nominally under the control of the government in exile. Chetniks were Serbians opposed to the Nazis but sometimes did collaborate with the Germans and Ustaša in their fierce guerrilla battles with the [[National Liberation Army (Yugoslavia)|National Liberation Army]], a Communist-controlled resistance headed by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Tito's strength grew in 1943, and Mihailović and the monarchists fell far behind. Churchill reversed course in December 1943, ended his support for the forces of Mihailović, and backed instead Tito. The government in exile followed suite and supported Tito.&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill, ''Closing the Ring'' (vol. 5 of ''The Second World War'') (1952) ch 26&lt;/ref&gt; Tito drove out the Germans in 1945, repudiated the government in exile, liquidated the Mihailovic forces. This allowed the formation of a Communist state of Yugoslavia that was independent of Moscow, with Tito in full control.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Roberts, ''Tito, Mihailović, and the Allies, 1941-1945'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===
Based in the Chinese city of [[Shanghai]] and later [[Chongqing]] the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea acted as the Korean government-in-exile from 13 April 1919 until the [[Republic of Korea]] was established in 1948.

==List of all War Declarations and other outbreaks of hostilities==
{{main|Declarations of War during World War II}}
Regarding ''type'' of war outbreak (fourth column): 
'''A''' = Attack without a declaration of war, '''U''' = State of war emerged through ultimatum, '''WD''' = State of war emerged after formal declaration of war, '''D''' = Diplomatic breakdown leading to a state of war. In some cases a diplomatic breakdown later led to a state of war. Such cases are mentioned in the comments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14044">[[Image:Eamcilhenny.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Avery McIlhenny, circa 1930.]]
'''Edward Avery "Ned" McIlhenny''' (29 March 1872 &amp;ndash; 8 August 1949), son of [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco brand pepper sauce]] tycoon [[Edmund McIlhenny]], was an American [[businessman]], [[explorer]], [[Bird ringing|bird bander]] and [[conservation movement|conservationist]]. He established a private wildlife refuge around his family estate on [[Avery Island]] and helped in preserving a large coastal marshland in Louisiana as a bird refuge. He also introduced several exotic plants into [[Jungle Gardens]], his private wildlife garden. McIlhenny is sometimes blamed for the introduction of exotic [[coypu]] into Louisiana where they are a major ecological problem although it is now known that he was neither the first to introduce their farming in the area or to release them into the wild.

==Biography ==
Born in 1872 at [[Avery Island]], [[Louisiana]], where the families of his father Edmund McIlhenny and his mother Mary Eliza Avery had lived since 1813,  McIlhenny was educated privately before attending Wyman's Military Academy in Illinois and [[Dr. Holbrook's Military School]] in Sing Sing (now [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]]), [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 1892, McIlhenny enrolled at [[Lehigh University]], where he joined the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity, but he dropped out of school to join [[Frederick Cook]]'s 1894 Arctic expedition as an [[ornithologist]]. The expedition ended when their ship ''Miranda'' was wrecked off Greenland. In 1897, he financed his own Arctic expedition to [[Point Barrow]], [[Alaska]],&lt;ref name="copeia"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cagle, Fred R.|year=1950|title=Edward Avery McIlhenny|journal=Copeia|issue=3|pages=245–246|jstor=1438530}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he leased an old government station, built to accommodate 100 men in an emergency and now owned by the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. During the famous rescue of a stranded Japanese [[whaling]] fleet, McIlhenny refused to house any of the rescued sailors except a few officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Harper's New Monthly Magazine| title=The Rescue Of The Whalers. A Sled Journey Of 1600 Miles In The Arctic Regions.|author=Bertholf, Lt. Ellsworth P.| date=June 1899|url=http://www.arcticwebsite.com/WhalerRescue.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[adventurer]] and [[entrepreneur]] [[Jujiro Wada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Bockstoce|title=The Arctic Whaling Disaster of 1897|year=1978|place=New York|publisher=Explorers Club|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, ''Tabasco: An Illustrated History'' (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; He did provide cotton intended for taxidermic purposes for bedding.&lt;ref name="auk"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lowery, George H., Jr.|year=1951|title=Edward Avery McIlhenny|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v068n01/p0135-p0137.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=68|issue=1|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return from the second Arctic expedition, he married Mary Givens Matthews, daughter of William Henry Matthews and Mary Campbell Given, on June 6, 1900, in New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;ref name="copeia" /&gt;

==Businessman==
[[Image:Tabad(ca1905).jpg|thumb|left|150px|An advertisement for [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco]] pepper sauce from circa 1905, during Edward Avery McIlhenny's tenure as president of McIlhenny Company.]]
In 1898, Edward's elder brother John enlisted in the U.S. Army, eventually joining the [[Rough Riders]]. Edward took over the family business, McIlhenny's Son Corporation, which produced Tobasco, the hot-pepper sauce invented by his father some 30 years previously. Edward renamed the firm [[McIlhenny Company]] and began to expand, modernize, and standardized sauce production. He also experimented with new ways of promoting the world-famous product, such as advertising on [[radio]].

In 1927, McIlhenny replaced the cork-topped Tabasco bottles used for nearly six decades with the now-ubiquitous screw-top bottle. He also redesigned the iconic Tabasco diamond logo trademark, largely creating the version known today.

In 1939, McIlhenny and the governor of Louisiana [[Richard W. Leche|Richard Leche]] were sued for transgressions in the issue of a contract to McIlhenny for the landscaping of Louisiana State University campus. An amount of $27,351.01 was claimed but nobody was convicted after the Supreme Court held that special skills did not require competitive bidding and that services worth that amount had been delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/louisiana-v-mcilhenny|title=Louisiana v. McIlhenny, 201 La. 78 (La. 1942)|last=|first=|date=|website=CaseText|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutria farming and release==
In a venture unrelated to Tabasco sauce, McIlhenny also operated a [[Coypu|nutria]] (''Myocastor coypus'') farm on Avery Island from 1938 until his death. The nutria introduction began in collaboration with Armand P. Daspit, director of the Louisiana Department of Conservation's Fur and Wild Life Division who approached McIlhenny after reading a bulletin on them from Buenos Aires. Another couple, Susan and Captain H. Conrad Brote began a nutria farm at St. Tammany Parish from around 1933. The captain served on merchant ships running between New Orleans and Buenos Aires. Their farm did well but there were no sales and they let out their nutria even before McIlhenny had begun his operations from locally acquired stock. Another nutria farm was also begun around the same time in St. Bernard Parish from where McIlhenny's first nutria were obtained in 1938. McIlhenny's nutria farm quickly grew too large for their one-acre pen and he was surprised both by their prolific breeding and the difficulties in confining them to their pens. On June 1, 1940 he freed about twenty nutria. In 1945 he released all his nutria claiming that it would help establish a fur industry in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=233862|first=Shane K. |last=Bernard|title=M'sieu Ned's Rat? Reconsidering the Origin of Nutria in Louisiana: The E. A. McIlhenny Collection, Avery Island, Louisiana|journal=Louisiana History|volume= 43 |year=2002|pages= 281–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, state and federal agencies advocated these releases. They believed nutria would provide a profitable new [[fur]] resource and help manage the spread of overly abundant plants such as [[water hyacinth]] and [[alligator weed]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After these releases, the [[feral]] population became unmanageable, and its overwhelmingly harmful impact on Louisiana's wetlands became apparent. Nutria feed on vegetation that is crucial to sustaining Louisiana's [[coastline]] and protecting the state's [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]] fields. By 1960, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries estimated the nutria population along coastal regions to exceed 20 million. The latest report from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] estimates that {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} of Louisiana's coastal wetlands are currently being occupied by nutria.

[[File:E_A_McIlhenny.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait from ''Bird Lore'' (1916)]]
After the first Arctic expedition, he noticed on returning to Avery Island, a great decline in the number of egrets. This led him to conduct experiments in captive breeding. McIlhenny founded the [[Bird City (wildfowl refuge)|Bird City]] [[wildlife refuge|wildfowl refuge]] on Avery Island around 1895, which helped to save the [[snowy egret]] from extinction. In 1910, McIlhenny and [[Charles Willis Ward]] bought {{convert|57000|acre|km2}} of marshland and later an additional {{convert|13000| acre|km2}}; on November 4, 1911, they dedicated the marsh to the state of Louisiana as a wildlife refuge. McIlhenny persuaded Mrs [[Russell Sage Foundation|Russell Sage]] to purchase {{convert|75000|acre|km2}} of Marsh Island on July 22, 1912, and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to acquire an additional {{convert|86000| acre|km2}} nearby.

McIlhenny was keen to study the birds on his estate and began bird ringing in 1912, initially using his own bands made of tin and lead on ducks, but he received few recoveries. In February 1916, he began to use bands issued by the American Bird Banding Association. Over 22 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/4077660 |jstor=4077660 |title=Twenty-Two Years of Banding Migratory Wild Fowl at Avery Island, Louisiana |journal=The Auk |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=328 |year=1934 |last1=McIlhenny |first1=E. A }}&lt;/ref&gt; he [[bird banding|banded]] more than 189,298 birds.&lt;ref name="auk" /&gt; Based on his ringing studies he camed to the conclusion that sex-ratios in ducks were skewed in the wild with males surviving to a greater age than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McIlhenny, E.A.|year=1940|title=Sex Ratio in Wild Birds|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v057n01/p0085-p0093.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=57|issue=1|pages=85–93|doi=10.2307/4078851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies based on McIlhenny's ringing data have yielded considerable information on the movements of [[black vulture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmalee, P.W.|author2=Parmalee, B.G.|year=1967|title=Results of banding studies of the black vulture in eastern North America|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v069n02/p0146-p0155.pdf|journal=Condor|volume=69|issue=2|pages=146–155|doi=10.2307/1366604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, he wrote on the potential extinction of the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]], noting its presence in his estate on Avery Island and suggesting that the destruction of old growth forests was key to its demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/4078664|jstor=4078664|title=The Passing of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker|journal=The Auk|volume=58|issue=4|pages=582|year=1941|last1=McIlhenny|first1=E. A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subspecies of [[white-tailed deer]] on Avery Island was named after McIlhenny as ''Odocoileus virginianus mcilhennyi'' by Frederic W. Miller in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Frederic W.|date=1928|title=A New White-Tailed Deer from Louisiana|jstor=1373358|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=9|issue=1|pages=57–59|doi=10.2307/1373358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIlhenny used his {{convert|170|acre|km2|adj=on}} personal estate, known as [[Jungle Gardens]], to propagate both Louisiana-native and imported plant varieties, including [[azaleas]], [[iris (plant)|irises]], [[camellias]], [[papyrus]], and [[bamboo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McIlhenny, E.A.|year=1945|title=Bamboo Growing for the South.|journal=The National Horticultural Magazine|volume=24|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McIlhenny, E.A.|year=1945|title=Bamboo: A Must for the South.|journal=The National Horticultural Magazine|volume=24|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote numerous academic articles, mainly about [[birds]] and [[reptiles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIlhenny|first=E.

Jordan's unfinished manuscript ''The Wild Turkey and Its Hunting'' (a book often mistakenly attributed to McIlhenny). He supported the equality of women but suggested that there were evolutionary handicaps standing in the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a103852|title=A Brief for the Y-Chromosome|journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=25|issue=10|pages=406|year=1934|last1=McIlhenny|first1=E.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote books about [[alligators]] (in which he claimed to have shot the longest American alligator 19 feet long), [[egrets]], and [[African-American]] [[gospel music]], including:

==Death and legacy==

McIlhenny died in 1949, three years after suffering a debilitating [[stroke]]; he is buried on Avery Island. Today, Jungle Gardens and Bird City continue to serve as havens for bird and plant species; they are also popular tourist destinations.  Furthermore, the nearly {{convert|175000|acre|km2}} of coastal marshland he helped to set aside as wildfowl refuges continue to exist as state wildlife areas.  McIlhenny's illustrated and written documentation of plant and animal life on Avery Island was donated as a collection to [[Louisiana State University]]. The E. A. McIlhenny Collection of natural history books at [[Louisiana State University]] is named in his honor.

'''Fernando de Noronha''' ({{IPA-pt|feʁˈnɐ̃du d(ʒ)i noˈɾoɲɐ}}) is an [[archipelago]] of 21 [[island]]s and [[islet]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], {{convert|354|km|mi|abbr=on}} offshore from the [[Brazil]]ian coast. The archipelago's name is a corruption of the name of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] merchant [[Fernão de Loronha]], to whom it was given by the Portuguese crown for services rendered regarding wood imported from Brazil. Only the homonymous main island is inhabited; it has an area of {{convert|18.4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a population estimated at 2,718 in 2012.&lt;ref name='IBGE2012'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?codmun=260545&amp;idtema=75 | title = IBGE - Cidades - Pernambuco - Fernando de Noronha - Estimativa da População - 2012 | accessdate = 2013-10-20 | author = IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) | authorlink = Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics | date = 2012 | language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago's total area is {{convert|26|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

Administratively, the islands are a unique case in Brazil of a special "state district" ({{lang-pt|distrito estadual}}) that is not part of any [[municipality]] and is administered directly by the government of the [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Pernambuco]] (despite being closer to the state of [[Rio Grande do Norte]]).&lt;ref name="Pernambuco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pe.gov.br/orgaos/administracao-geral-de-fernando-de-noronha/ |title=Administração Geral de Fernando de Noronha |language=Portuguese |trans-title=General Administration of Fernando de Noronha |author=Government of the State of [[Pernambuco]] |accessdate=2017-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state district's jurisdiction also includes the very remote [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], located {{convert|625|km|mi}} northeast of Fernando de Noronha. 70% of the islands' area were established in 1988 as a national maritime park.

In 2001 [[UNESCO]] designated it as a [[World Heritage Site]] because of the importance of its environment. Its [[time zone]] is [[UTC−02:00]] all year round.

==Geography==

===Geology===
The islands of this archipelago are the visible parts of a range of submerged mountains. It consists of 21 islands, islets and rocks of volcanic origin. The main island has an area of {{convert|18|sqkm|abbr=on}}, being {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|km|abbr=on}} wide at its maximum. The base of this enormous volcanic formation is {{convert|756|m}} below the surface. The volcanic rocks are of variable though mainly silica-undersaturated character with [[basanite]], [[nephelinite]] and [[phonolite]] among the lava types found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rbg.sbgeo.org.br/index.php/rbg/article/view/30305/19049 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811051251/http://www.rbg.sbgeo.org.br/index.php/rbg/article/view/30305/19049 |archivedate=2015-08-11 |df= }} Geochemistry of the alkaline volcanic-subvolcanic rocks of the Fernando de Noronha Archiapelago, southern Atlantic Ocean&lt;/ref&gt; The main island, from which the group gets its name, makes up 91% of the total area; the islands of Rata, Sela Gineta, Cabeluda and São José, together with the islets of Leão and Viúva make up the rest. The central upland of the main island is called the Quixaba.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Secchin, Clóvis Barreira e Castro, ''Arquipélago de Fernando de Noronha'', 2nd ed. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
The United Nations Environment Programme lists 15 possible [[Endemism|endemic]] plant species, including species of the genera ''[[Capparis]] noronhae'' (2 species), ''[[Ceratosanthes]] noronhae'' (3 species), ''[[Cayaponia]] noronhae'' (2 species), ''[[Moriordica]] noronhae,'' ''[[Cereus (plant)|Cereus]] noronhae'', ''[[Palicourea]] noronhae'', ''[[Guettarda]] noronhae'', ''[[Bumelia]] noronhae'', ''[[Physalis]] noronhae'', and ''[[Ficus noronhae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islands.unep.ch/IXD.htm Fernando de Noronha], Islands of Brazil, [[UN System-wide Earthwatch]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
The islands have two [[Endemism in birds|endemic birds]] — the [[Noronha elaenia]] ''(Elaenia ridleyana)'' and the [[Noronha vireo]] ''(Vireo gracilirostris)''. Both are present on the main island; Noronha vireo is also present on Ilha Rata. In addition there is an endemic subspecies of [[eared dove]], ''Zenaida auriculata noronha''. Subfossil remains of an extinct [[Endemism|endemic]] [[Rallidae|rail]] have also been found.&lt;ref&gt;Sazima, I. and Haemig, P.D. 2012.

===Marine life===
The life above and below sea is the main attraction of the island. [[Sea turtle]]s, [[cetacean]]s (most common among these are [[spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s, followed by many others such as [[pantropical spotted dolphin]]s, [[short-finned pilot whale]]s, [[melon-headed whale]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.car-spaw-rac.org/IMG/pdf/Brazil_Progress_report_on_cetacean_research_March_2006_to_February_2007_with_statistical_data_for_the_calendar_year_2006_or_season_2006-2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), [[albatross]]es, and many other species are frequently observed.

===Climate===
The climate is tropical, with two well-defined seasons for rainfall, if not temperature. The rainy season lasts from February to July; the rest of the year sees little rain. The temperature ranges, both diurnal and monthly, are unusually slight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fernando de Noronha |url=http://www.ilhadenoronha.com.br/ailha/clima_em_fernando_de_noronha.php |title=Clima em Fernando de Noronha |publisher=Ilhadenoronha.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many controversies mark the discovery of the archipelago by Europeans. At least three names – ''São Lourenço'', ''São João'', and ''Quaresma'' – have been associated with the island around the time of its discovery. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Based on the written record, Fernando de Noronha island was discovered on August 10, 1503, by a [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] expedition, organized and financed by a private commercial consortium headed by the Lisbon merchant [[Fernão de Loronha]].  The expedition was under the overall command of captain [[Gonçalo Coelho]] and carried the Italian adventurer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, who wrote an account of it.&lt;ref&gt;The Coelho expedition is also known as the "Fourth Voyage" of Vespucci, and is related in the letter of Amerigo Vespucci to [[Piero Soderini]], {{circa}} 1504–05.  See the English translation of the [https://books.google.com/books?id=boQKAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false account] in ''Letter to Soderini''&lt;/ref&gt; The flagship of the expedition hit a reef and foundered near the island, and the crew and contents had to be salvaged. On Coelho's orders, Vespucci anchored at the island, and spent a week there, while the rest of the Coelho fleet went on south.  In his letter to Soderini, Vespucci describes the uninhabited island and reports its name as the "island of St. Lawrence" (August 10 is the feast day of [[St. Lawrence]]; it was a custom of Portuguese explorations to name locations by the [[liturgical calendar]]). {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Its existence was reported to Lisbon sometime between then and January 16, 1504, when King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] issued a charter granting the "island of St. John" (''São João'') as a hereditary captaincy to [[Fernão de Loronha]].&lt;ref&gt;An actual copy of this charter has never been found.  Its contents and date, however, are summarized in a royal letter of March 3, 1522, confirming it, and yet another royal letter of May 20, 1559, identifying the location of ''São João'' precisely as Fernando de Noronha island.  See Duarte Leite (1923: p.276–278) and Roukema (1963: p.21).&lt;/ref&gt;  The date and new name in the charter has presented historians with a puzzle. As Vespucci did not return to Lisbon until September 1504, the discovery must have been earlier.  Historians have hypothesized that a stray ship of the Coelho fleet, under an unknown captain, may have returned to the island (prob. on August 29, 1503, feast day of the [[beheading of St. John the Baptist]]) to collect Vespucci, did not find him or anyone else there, and went back to Lisbon by itself with the news.&lt;ref&gt;Roukema (1963: p.22)&lt;/ref&gt; (Vespucci in his letter, claims he left the island August 18, 1503, and upon his arrival in Lisbon a year later, on September 7, 1504, the people of Lisbon were surprised, as they "had been told" (presumably by the earlier captain?) that his ship had been lost.)&lt;ref&gt;Roukema (1963: p.21)&lt;/ref&gt;  The captain who returned to Lisbon with the news (and the St. John name) is unknown. (Some have speculated this captain was Loronha himself, the chief financier of this expedition, but that is highly unlikely.)

This account, reconstructed from the written record, is severely marred by the cartographic record.  An island, named ''Quaresma'', looking very much like Fernando de Noronha island, appears in the [[Cantino planisphere]]. The Cantino map was composed by an anonymous Portuguese cartographer, and completed before November 1502, well before the Coelho expedition even set out.  This has led to speculation that the island was discovered by a previous expedition.  However, there is no consensus on which expedition that might have been.  The name "Quaresma" means [[Lent]], suggesting it must have been discovered in March or early April, which does not correspond well with the known expeditions.  There is also a mysterious red island to the left of Quaresma in the Cantino map that does not fit with Fernando de Noronha island. Some have explained these anomalies away by reading ''quaresma'' as ''anaresma'' (meaning unknown, but sidesteps the Lent timing),&lt;ref&gt;For an early reading of Quaresma as "Anaresma", see Henry Harrisse (1891) ''The Discovery of North America'' (1961 ed., p.319) and Orville Derby (1902) "Os mappas mais antigos do Brasil", ''Revista do Instituto Historico e Geografico de São Paulo'', vol. 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6MCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.244]. This reading was insisted upon later by historian Marcondes de Sousa (1949) ''Américo Vespúcio e suas viagens'' (São Paulo). It provoked a brief and surprisingly bitter controversy with other historians, e.g. Damião Peres, Duarte Leite.&lt;/ref&gt; and proposing that the red island is just an accidental inkblot.&lt;ref&gt;The inkblot theory was suggested by Duarte Leite (1923: p.275–278).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cantino west.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Detail from the 1502 Cantino planisphere, showing the island of "Quaresma" (Fernando de Noronha?) off the Brazilian coast.]]

Assuming Quaresma is indeed Fernando de Noronha, then who discovered it?  One proposal is that it was discovered by a royal Portuguese mapping expedition that was sent out in May 1501, commanded by an unknown captain (possibly [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]]) and also accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci.&lt;ref&gt;The 1501 mapping expedition is also known as the "Third Voyage" of Amerigo Vespucci (and his first under the Portuguese flag). Amerigo Vespucci relates the account of this expedition twice - first in a letter to Lorenzo Pietro Francesco di Medici, written in early 1503 (see ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false account]) in ''Letter do Medici''), and then again in his letters to Piero Soderini, written 1504-05 ([account] in ''Letter to Soderini'').  In his account, Vespucci does not mention the name of the captain of this 1501 mapping expedition, and his identity has been widely speculated on.  The 16th-century chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]] suggests it was [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] (''Lendas da India'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.152]).  Greenlee (1945) reviews various possible names – and settles on the conjecture that it might be Fernão de Loronha himself (a hypothesis also suggested by Duarte Leite (1923)). But this is strongly disputed by other authors, e.g. Roukema (1963). It would be highly unlikely a prominent and wealthy merchant like Loronha would absent his businesses to go personally command vessels himself.  Loronha's support (if any) to the mapping expedition was probably limited to financing.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Vespucci, this expedition returned to Lisbon in September 1502, just on time to influence the final composition of the Cantino map.  Unfortunately, Vespucci does ''not'' report discovering this island then – indeed he is quite clear that the first time he (and his fellow sailors) saw the island was on the 1503 Coelho expedition. However, there is a letter written by an Italian saying that a ship arrived "from the land of Parrots" in Lisbon on July 22, 1502 (three months before Vespucci).&lt;ref&gt;This letter was written by Venetian emissary Pascualigo on October 12, 1502, and is quoted in the diary of [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marino Sanuto]]. See Greenlee (1945: p.11n) and Roukema (1963:p.19).&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be a stray ship from the mapping expedition that returned prematurely, or another expedition altogether, about which we have no information.&lt;ref&gt;Roukema (1963) accepts the hypothesis of a unrecorded separate expedition in 1501 -  and that this might be the one led by André Gonçalves.  However, Greenlee (1945) rejects the unrecorded expedition theory, deeming it superfluous, and instead embraces the stray ship theory (and that this stray ship was precisely the flagship personally commanded by Fernão de Loronha).&lt;/ref&gt;  The timing of its reputed arrival (July 1502), makes it possible that it stumbled on the island sometime in March 1502, on the homeward voyage, well within Lent. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A third possible (but unlikely) theory is that the island was discovered already in 1500, shortly after the discovery of Brazil by the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second India Armada]] under [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]].  After his brief landfall at [[Porto Seguro]], Cabral dispatched a supply ship under either [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]]  (sources conflict) back to Lisbon, to report the discovery.  This returning supply ship would have returned north along the Brazilian coast and might have come across Fernando de Noronha island, and reported its existence in Lisbon by July 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Roukema (1963) rejects this theory.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this contradicts the Quaresma name, since the returning supply ship was sailing well after Lent.

A fourth (but also unlikely) possibility is that it was discovered by the [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|Third India Armada]] of [[João da Nova]], which set out from Lisbon in March or April 1501, and arrived back in September 1502, also in time to influence the Cantino map.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]] asserts that on the outward voyage, the Third Armada made a stop on the Brazilian coast around [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape Santo Agostinho]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar Correia, ''Lendas da India'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.235])&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other chroniclers ([[João de Barros]] and [[Damião de Góis]]) do not mention a landfall, but do report they discovered an island (which they believe to be identified as [[Ascension island]], but this is not certain).&lt;ref&gt;João de Barros, ''Decadas da Asia'', vol.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA466#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.466]; Damião de Góis, ''Chronica de D.Manuel'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=0vTmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84].  See Roukema (1963) on the possible problems of identifying the island discovered by the Third Armada on its outward leg as Ascension island.&lt;/ref&gt;  So it is possible that the Third Armada may indeed have discovered Fernando de Noronha island on their outward leg.  However, the timing is very tight: Easter landed on April 11, 1501,  while the estimated departure date of the Third Armada from Lisbon ranges from March 5 to April 15, not leaving enough time to reach those environs within Lent.

As a result of these anomalies, some modern historians have proposed that Fernando de Noronha is ''not'' depicted on the 1502 Cantino map at all. Instead, they have proposed that Quaresma island and the accompanying red "inkblot" are in fact the [[Rocas Atoll]], slightly misplaced on the map. This reserves the discovery of Fernando de Noronha island itself as indeed on August 10, 1503, by the Gonçalo Coelho expedition, as originally reported by Vespucci.&lt;ref&gt;Roukema (1963: p.19-22).  Roukema concludes that it was the Rocas atoll that was discovered by the returning stray ship/unrecorded expedition on March 16, 1502, well within Lent.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition of the name from "São João" to "Fernando de Noronha" was probably just natural usage. A royal letter dated May 20, 1559, to descendants of the Loronha family, still refers to the island by its official name of ''ilha de São João''.,&lt;ref&gt;Duarte Leite (1923: p.276–278)&lt;/ref&gt; but already in other places, e.g. the logbook of [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]] in the 1530s,  it was referred to as the "island of Fernão de Noronha" ("Noronha" being a common misspelling of "Loronha"). The informal name eventually displaced the official name.

===1500–1700===
[[File:2009 fev 10 forte santana.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Fort Santana]]
The Lisbon merchant [[Fernão de Loronha]] held not only Fernando de Noronha island as a hereditary captaincy but also (from 1503 to around 1512) a commercial monopoly on trade in Brazil. Between 1503 and 1512, Noronha's agents set up a string of warehouses (''feitorias'') along the Brazilian coast, and engaged in trade with the [[indigenous peoples in Brazil]] for [[brazilwood]], a native red dye wood highly valued by European clothmakers.  Fernando de Noronha island was the central collection point of this network.  Brazilwood, continuously harvested by the coastal Indians and delivered to the various coastal warehouses, was shipped to the central warehouse on Fernando de Noronha island, which was intermittently visited by a larger transport ship that would carry the collected loads back to Europe. After the expiration of Loronha's commercial charter in 1512, the organization of the brazilwood enterprise was taken over by the Portuguese crown, but Loronha and his descendents retained private ownership of Fernando de Noronha island itself as a hereditary [[captaincy]], at least down to the 1560s.

Captain [[Henry Foster (scientist)|Henry Foster]] stopped at Fernando de Noronha during his scientific survey expedition as commander of [[HMS Chanticleer (1808)|HMS ''Chanticleer'']], which had set out in 1828. As well as surveying coasts and ocean currents, Foster used a [[Kater's pendulum|Kater invariable pendulum]] to make observations on gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10422221&amp;screenwidth=1359 |title=Image of ‘sketches of the island of fernando noronha’, south atlantic, 1828-1831. |work=Science Museum |publisher=Science &amp; Society Picture Library |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the island as the point of junction of his double line of [[longitude]]s setting out his survey.

(1839) ''Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836'', London: Henry Colburn, pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=47 24–26].&lt;/ref&gt; The longitude of [[Rio de Janeiro]] taken by Foster was among those on one side of a significant discrepancy, which meant that the charts of South America were in doubt.
[[File:Mapa do Arquipélago de Fernando de Noronha.tif|thumb|Map of Fernando de Noronha, 1886.]]
To resolve this, the [[Admiralty]] instructed Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] to command {{HMS|Beagle}} on a survey expedition. One of its essential tasks was a stop at Fernando Noronha to confirm its exact longitude, using the [[List of chronometers on HMS Beagle|22 chronometers]] on board the ship to give the precise time of observations.&lt;ref name="admiralty 1" /&gt; They arrived at the island in the late evening of 19 February 1832, anchoring at midnight. On 20 February FizRoy landed a small party to take the observations, despite difficulties caused by heavy surf, then sailed on for [[Bahia, Brazil|Bahia]], [[Brazil]] that evening.&lt;ref&gt;FitzRoy, R. (1839) ''Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836'', London: Henry Colburn, pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=89 58–60].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the day, the island was visited by the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], who was one of the Beagle's passengers. He took notes for his book on geology. He wrote about admiring the woods: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The whole island is one forest, &amp; this is so thickly intertwined that it requires great exertion to crawl along. — The scenery was very beautiful, &amp; large Magnolias &amp; Laurels &amp; trees covered with delicate flowers ought to have satisfied me. — But I am sure all the grandeur of the Tropics has not yet been seen by me. — We had no gaudy birds, No humming birds. No large flowers".&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, R. D. ed. (2001) ''Charles Darwin's Beagle diary''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=71 p. 39].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His experiences on Fernando de Noronha were recorded in his journal, later published as ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. (1839) ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and remarks. 1832-1836]]''. London: Henry Colburn, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.3&amp;pageseq=29 10–11].&lt;/ref&gt; He also included a short description of the island in his 1844 ''[[Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. (1844) ''Geological observations on the volcanic islands visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle'', London: Smith Elder and Co., pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F272&amp;pageseq=37 23–24].&lt;/ref&gt;

The island was also used as a penal colony in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Clare Anderson, (2015), ''Convicts, Collecting and Knowledge Production in the Nineteenth Century'', [http://staffblogs.le.ac.uk/carchipelago/2015/07/27/convicts-collecting-and-knowledge-production-in-the-nineteenth-century/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the first prisoners were sent to Fernando de Noronha. A prison was built. In 1897 the government of the state of Pernambuco took possession of the prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noronha.com.br/site/a_ilha.php?noticia=22 Noronha História] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425230959/http://www.noronha.com.br/site/a_ilha.php?noticia=22 |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1938 and 1945, Fernando de Noronha was a political [[prison]]. The former governor of Pernambuco, Miguel Arraes, was incarcerated there. In 1957 the prison was closed and the archipelago was visited by President [[Juscelino Kubitschek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/turismo/noticias/ult338u4963.shtml Fernando de Noronha: História da ilha remete ao inferno e ao paraíso]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the British arrived to provide technical cooperation in [[telegraphy]] (''The [[South American Company]]''). Later the French came with the ''[[French Cable]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/France/scsa.htm History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications, French cable companies]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italians with ''[[Italcable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/Italcable/ History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications, Italcable]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, during [[World War II]], the archipelago was made a [[Federal territory]], which included [[Rocas Atoll]] and [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]]. The government sent political and ordinary prisoners to the local prison.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

An airport was constructed in September 1942 by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] for the Natal-[[Dakar]] air route. It provided a transoceanic link between Brazil and [[French West Africa]] for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel during the Allies campaign in Africa. Brazil transferred the airport to the jurisdiction of the [[United States Navy]] on 5 September 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/001/957.xml USAFHRA Document 00001957]&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, the administration of the airport was transferred back to the Brazilian Government. [[Fernando de Noronha Airport]] is served by daily flights from [[Recife]] and [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] on the Brazilian coast.

In 1988, Brazil designated approximately 70% of the archipelago as a maritime [[national park]], with the goal of preserving the land and sea environment. On October 5, 1988, the Federal Territory was dissolved and added to the state of Pernambuco (except Rocas Atoll, which was added to the state of Rio Grande do Norte).

Today Fernando de Noronha's economy depends on tourism, restricted by the limitations of its delicate [[ecosystem]]. In addition to the historical interest noted above, the archipelago has been the subject of the attention of various scientists dedicated to the study of its [[Flora (plants)|flora]], [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[geology]], etc.  The jurisdiction is considered to be a separate "entity" by the [[DX Century Club]], and so is visited rather often by [[amateur radio]] operators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 2001, [[UNESCO]] declared Fernando de Noronha, with Rocas Atoll, a [[World Heritage Site]]. It cited the following reasons: 
:a) the island's importance as a feeding ground for several species, including [[tuna]], [[billfish]], cetaceans, sharks, and marine turtles, 
:b) a high population of resident [[spinner dolphin]]s and 
:c) protection for endangered species, such as the [[hawksbill sea turtle]] (critically endangered) and various birds.

In 2009, [[Air France Flight 447]] disappeared off the northeast coast of Brazil. It was presumed to have crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Fernando de Noronha. Rescue and recovery operations were launched from this island.

==Conservation and environmental threats==
Most of the original large trees were cut down in the 19th century, when the island was used as a prison, for firewood and to keep the prisoners from hiding and making rafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article-abstract/27/181/1/2904761
2018-02-03 }} &lt;Ridley, H. N., M.A., F.L.S. The Journal of the Linnean Society, read 7 June 1888&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, exotic species have been introduced:

* [[Linseed]], intended for use as cattle feed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
* [[Tupinambis|Tegu]] lizards (''[[Tupinambis merianae]]'', locally known as ''teju'') introduced in the 1950s to control a rat infestation. It did not work because Tegus are diurnal and rats, nocturnal. The lizards are now considered a plague, feeding mostly on bird eggs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institutohorus.org.br/download/fichas/Tupinambis_merianae.htm Tupinambis merianae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622005940/http://www.institutohorus.org.br/download/fichas/Tupinambis_merianae.htm |date=2006-06-22 }}, Instituto Hórus de Desenvolvimento e Conservação Ambiental (The Nature Conservancy), 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rock cavy|Rock cavies]] (''Kerodon rupestris'', locally known as ''mocó'') introduced by the military in the 1960s as hunting game for soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institutohorus.org.br/download/fichas/Kerodon_rupestris.htm Kerodon rupestris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807163607/http://www.institutohorus.org.br/download/fichas/Kerodon_rupestris.htm |date=2006-08-07 }}, Instituto Hórus de Desenvolvimento e Conservação Ambiental (The Nature Conservancy), 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Domestic cats]], introduced as pets, now they spread throughout the whole island and several acquired a feral status, surviving only by preying on native birds, rock cavies and [[synanthropic]] rodents.

From these, the domestic cat and the tegu lizard have become invasive.

The island is divided between the [[Fernando de Noronha Marine National Park]] and the [[Fernando de Noronha Environmental Protection Area]]. The latter covers the urban, tourist area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Área de Proteção Ambiental ...

==Economy==

Tourism including [[whale watching|dolphin watching]], diving and charter fishing comprise the majority of the island’s economy.

The archipelago of Fernando de Noronha in 2005 had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of R$22,802,000 and a per capita income of R$10,001.  The Human Development Index (HDI) district's state was estimated at 0.862 (PNUD/2000).  The only banking center in the archipelago is a branch of [[Santander Brasil|Banco Santander Brasil]]. There are one or two additional ATMs around the main island.

==Tourism==
[[File:EDUARDO MURUCI - PRAIA DO CACHORRO.jpg|center|800px|thumb|Cachorro Beach]]

The beaches of Fernando de Noronha are promoted for tourism and recreational diving. The most popular ones include Baía do Sancho, Pig Bay, Dolphins Bay, Sueste Bay and Praia do Leão. Due to the [[South Equatorial Current]] that pushes warm water from Africa to the island, diving to depths of {{convert|30|to|40|m}} does not require a wetsuit. The visibility underwater can reach up to {{convert|50|m}}.

The part of the island facing the mainland has the beaches in the following order: Baía do Sancho, Baía dos Porcos, Praia dos Americanos, Praia do Boldró, Praia da Conceição, Praia do Meio and Praia do Cachorro. The part of the island facing the Atlantic Ocean has only 03 beaches: Praia do Leão, Praia do Sueste and Praia do Atalaia. A great way to get to know the island is to walk from Praia dos Americanos, pass by Praia do Boldró, Praia da Conceição, Praia do Meio and finish the walking at Praia do Cachorro.

The island is served by [[Fernando de Noronha Airport|Gov. Carlos Wilson Airport]] with regular flights to [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] and [[Recife]].

"'''Five Trees'''" in [[Paradise]] is a mysterious allegory or concept from famous [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[Gospel of Thomas]] NHC 2: ([[gnostic]] library from [[Nag Hammadi]] in [[Egypt]]) 19th saying/[[logia]] of [[Jesus]] and other sources of religious [[mythology]].

Blatz Translation: &lt;blockquote&gt;(19) Jesus said: Blessed is he who was before he came into being. If you become disciples to me (and) listen to my words, these stones will minister to you. For you have '''five trees''' in Paradise which do not change, either in summer or in winter, and their leaves do not fall. He who knows them shall not taste of death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Blessed is he who was before he came into being," is similar to other enigmatic statements commonly found in [[mysticism]] across cultures, referring to the benefits of self-awareness (knowledge of one's true nature) before development of ego identity beliefs.  "If you...listen..., these stones will minister to you," may refer to both "listening" to the true self within – which would allow one to accurately trace internal/cause from observing external/effects (physical reality/stones), or that only through this "self-awareness" are we able to understand Jesus' symbolic language and master external reality.  The word, tree, is a creative (manifesting) symbol in Jewish and Christian sacred texts, descriptive of both ingesting (taking in) fruits and/or producing fruits ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Four Gospels]]). 

In the [[Acts of Thomas]], Chapter 27, during an anointing ceremony, the apostle implores, "Come, elder of the five members of mind, communicate with these young men;" the five words for 'mind' according to [[Theodore Bar Konai]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cumont|first= Franz|date= 1908|title= Recherches sur le manichéisme, Volume 1|location= Bruxelles|publisher= H. Lamertin|page= 19, note 3|author-link= Franz Cumont}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the equivalents of ''hauna'' (sanity), ''mad'a'' (reason), ''re'yana'' (mindfulness), ''mahshebhatha'' (imagination), ''tar'itha'' (intention) – considered the Five Manifestations of the Father of Greatness which may provide the clue to the meaning of the five trees.  These five would therefore be the causal factors in the experience of the Real.

Marvin Meyer writes: "The "five trees" in paradise are mentioned frequently in gnostic texts, ordinarily without explanation or elaboration. In [[Manichaean]] Psalm Book 161,17-29, it is said that various features of life and faith are put together in groups of five. This section opens with the statement, 'For [five] are the trees that are in paradise ... in summer and winter.' On the trees in paradise according to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], see Genesis 2:9."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Meyer | first = Marvin | author-link = Marvin Meyer | title = The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus | publisher = [[HarperOne]] | edition = 2nd Revised | location = San Francisco | date = 2004 | page = 77–78 | isbn = 006065581X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senses==
According to the [[Naassenes]], paradise was the human head.  It has been suggested that the "five trees" may parallel the five human senses which produce one's internal world view and belief system – knowledge of which is a requirement for purification and thus enlightenment or return to paradise/unity.  However, the body's five senses – more synonymous with lower level egoism and learned misperception, would more likely be referenced as an impediment to reunion with the divine.

==Kabbalah==
The "five trees" also could be interpreted as referring to the [[Five Worlds]] of the mystical Jewish [[Kabbalah]]: Asiyah, Yetzirah, Beriah, Atzilut &amp; Adam Kadmon – descriptive of dimensional levels related to the soul's progress toward unity with or return to the Creator. Generally understood as developmental levels of intentionality related to man's natural "desire to receive".  The methodology for accomplishing this is considered the secret [[Science of Kabbalah]] – how to receive by correcting intention until a state of unity with pure altruism is achieved.  One then becomes pure Creator (experience of the divine).  Related to this, the concept of "reality as a mirror of desire" (pure desire = perfect results/impure desire = negative results), would correlate to the tree symbol as "productive" of paradise.

These developmental levels are in parallel with five [[Sephirot#Reconfiguration of the Sephirot as full Partsufim-Personas|Partsufim]]. And these are same as soul levels: [[Nefesh]], [[Ruach|Ruah]], Neshama, Haya and Yehida. Possibly these important Judaico-Biblical concepts are most similar to "five trees".

==Hindu parallels==
As noted from a Hindu reference page, which may also relate to The Gospel of Thomas's reference of the Five Trees, are the five trees of Indra's paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salagram.net/Sacred-trees.html|title=Sacred Trees|first=|last=JTCd|website=www.salagram.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a theory that Jesus traveled to India during his "missing" years from in the Bible. This could support that theory.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The five trees (panca-vrksa) which adorn Lord Indra's garden (Nandana) in his paradise (Svarga) are:
#mandara (''[[Erythrina stricta]]'') with scarlet flowers in horizontal clusters at the ends of branches; its shade relieves one of physical ailments and mental stress;
#parijata (''[[Nyctanthes arbor-tristis]]'') with bark of gold, leaves of copper color, and fragrant, rejuvenate fruit; it arose out of the ocean of milk and was taken away by Indra to his paradise from where it was brought to Dvaraka by Lord Krsna at the instance of his wife Satyabhama. After the passing away of the Lord and the submerging of Dvaraka in the ocean, it was taken back to heaven;
#[[samtanaka]], a tree of wonder having leaves which promote fertility in men; its identification remains obscure;
#haricandana or sandalwood (''[[Santalum album]]'') well known for its fragrance and cooling effect, it keeps evil spirits at bay; and
#kalpa vrksa or [[kalpa taru]], the tree of eternity which emerged as a result of the churning of the ocean of milk; it was lifted to Svarga by Indra, and is frequently mentioned in Sanskrit literature for its wish-fulfilling quality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:GravityPotential.jpg|thumb|300px|Plot of a two-dimensional slice of the gravitational potential in and around a uniform spherical body. The [[inflection point]]s of the cross-section are at the surface of the body.]]
In [[classical mechanics]], the '''gravitational potential''' at a location is equal to the [[Work (physics)|work]] ([[energy]] transferred) per unit mass that would be needed to move the object from a fixed reference location to the location of the object. It is [[analogous]] to the [[electric potential]] with [[mass]] playing the role of [[charge (physics)|charge]]. The reference location, where the potential is zero, is by convention [[infinitely]] far away from any mass, resulting in a negative potential at any [[wikt:finite|finite]] distance.

In mathematics, the gravitational potential is also known as the [[Newtonian potential]] and is fundamental in the study of [[potential theory]]. It may also be used for solving the electrostatic and magnetostatic fields generated by uniformly charged or polarized ellipsoidal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electrostatics and magnetostatics of polarized ellipsoidal bodies: the depolarization tensor method|first1=C.E.|last1=Solivérez|edition=1st English|year=2016|publisher=Free Scientific Information|isbn=978-987-28304-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential energy==
{{main|Gravitational potential energy}}
The gravitational potential (''V'') at a location is the gravitational [[potential energy]] (''U'') at that location per unit mass:

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{U}{m},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the object. Potential energy is equal (in magnitude, but negative) to the work done by the gravitational field moving a body to its given position in space from infinity. If the body has a mass of 1 unit, then the potential energy to be assigned to that body is equal to the gravitational potential. So the potential can be interpreted as the negative of the work done by the gravitational field moving a unit mass in from infinity.

In some situations, the equations can be simplified by assuming a field that is nearly independent of position. For instance, in a region close to the surface of the Earth, the [[Gravity of Earth|gravitational acceleration]], ''g'', can be considered constant. In that case, the difference in potential energy from one height to another is, to a good approximation, linearly related to the difference in height:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U \approx mg \Delta h.&lt;/math&gt;

==Mathematical form== 
The [[Scalar potential|potential]] ''V'' of a unit mass ''m'' at a distance ''x'' from a [[point particle|point mass]] of mass ''M'' can be defined as the work ''W'' that needs to be done by an external agent to bring the unit mass in from infinity to that point:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Dynamics of particles and systems|first1=J.B. |last1=Marion |first2=S.T. |last2=Thornton|edition=4th |page=192|year=1995|publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|isbn=0-03-097302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods For Physicists International Student Edition |edition=6th |first1=George B. |last1=Arfken |first2=Hans J. |last2=Weber |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-08-047069-6 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNtijk2iBSMC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=tNtijk2iBSMC&amp;pg=PA72 Extract of page 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge International AS and A Level Physics Coursebook |edition=illustrated |first1=David |last1=Sang |first2=Graham |last2=Jones |first3=Gurinder |last3=Chadha |first4=Richard |last4=Woodside |first5=Will |last5=Stark |first6=Aidan |last6=Gill |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-69769-0 |page=276 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SjsDBAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=SjsDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276 Extract of page 276]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A-level Physics |edition=illustrated |first1=Roger |last1=Muncaster |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-7487-1584-8 |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Knov8XAyf2cC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Knov8XAyf2cC&amp;pg=PA106 Extract of page 106]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{W}{m} = \frac{1}{m} \int\limits_{\infty}^{x} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{x} = \frac{1}{m} \int\limits_{\infty}^{x} \frac{G m M}{x^2} dx = -\frac{G M}{x},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], and '''F''' is the gravitational force. The potential has units of energy per unit mass, e.g., J/kg in the [[MKS system of units|MKS]] system. By convention, it is always negative where it is defined, and as ''x'' tends to infinity, it approaches zero.

The [[gravitational field]], and thus the acceleration of a small body in the space around the massive object, is the negative [[gradient]] of the gravitational potential. Thus the negative of a negative gradient yields positive acceleration toward a massive object. Because the potential has no angular components, its gradient is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = -\frac{GM}{x^3} \mathbf{x} = -\frac{GM}{x^2} \hat{\mathbf{x}},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''x''' is a vector of length ''x'' pointing from the point mass toward the small body and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector pointing from the point mass toward the small body. The magnitude of the acceleration therefore follows an [[inverse square law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{a}| = \frac{GM}{x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The potential associated with a [[mass distribution]] is the superposition of the potentials of point masses. If the mass distribution is a finite collection of point masses, and if the point masses are located at the points '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and have masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then the potential of the distribution at the point '''x''' is
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^n -\frac{Gm_i}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x_i}|}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Mass distribution line segment.svg|right|thumb|Points '''x''' and '''r''', with '''r''' contained in the distributed mass (gray) and differential mass ''dm''('''r''') located at the point '''r'''.]]

If the mass distribution is given as a mass [[Borel measure|measure]] ''dm'' on three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, then the potential is the [[convolution]] of &amp;minus;G/|'''r'''| with ''dm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vladimirov|1984|loc=§7.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In good cases this equals the integral
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = -\int_{\mathbf{R}^3} \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{r}|}\,dm(\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt;
where |'''x'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;'''r'''| is the [[Euclidean distance|distance]] between the points '''x''' and '''r'''. If there is a function ''&amp;rho;''('''r''') representing the density of the distribution at '''r''', so that {{nowrap|''dm''('''r'''){{=}} ''&amp;rho;''('''r''')''dv''('''r''')}}, where ''dv''('''r''') is the Euclidean [[volume element]], then the gravitational potential is the [[volume integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = -\int_{\mathbf{R}^3} \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{r}|}\,\rho(\mathbf{r})dv(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''V'' is a potential function coming from a continuous mass distribution ''&amp;rho;''('''r'''), then ''&amp;rho;'' can be recovered using the [[Laplace operator]], Δ:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{4\pi G}\Delta V(\mathbf{x}).&lt;/math&gt;
This holds pointwise whenever ''&amp;rho;'' is continuous and is zero outside of a bounded set. In general, the mass measure ''dm'' can be recovered in the same way if the Laplace operator is taken in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s. As a consequence, the gravitational potential satisfies [[Poisson's equation]]. See also [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation]] and [[Newtonian potential]].

The integral may be expressed in terms of known transcendental functions for all ellipsoidal shapes, including the symmetrical and degenerate ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theory of the Potential|first1=W.D. |last1=MacMillan|year=1958|publisher=Dover Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the sphere, where the three semiaxes are equal; the oblate (see [[reference ellipsoid]]) and prolate spheroids, where two semiaxes are equal; the degenerate ones where one semiaxis is infinite (the elliptical and circular cylinder) and the unbounded sheet where two semiaxes are infinite. All these shapes are widely used in the applications of the gravitational potential integral (apart from the constant ''G'', with 𝜌 being a constant charge density) to electromagnetism.

==Spherical symmetry==
A spherically symmetric mass distribution behaves to an observer completely outside the distribution as though all of the mass was concentrated at the center, and thus effectively as a [[point mass]], by the [[shell theorem]]. On the surface of the earth, the acceleration is given by so-called [[standard gravity]] ''g'', approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although this value varies slightly with latitude and altitude: The magnitude of the acceleration is a little larger at the poles than at the equator because Earth is an [[oblate spheroid]].

Within a spherically symmetric mass distribution, it is possible to solve [[Gauss' law for gravity#Relation to gravitational potential and Poisson's equation|Poisson's equation in spherical coordinates]]. Within a uniform spherical body of radius ''R'' and density ρ, the gravitational force ''g'' inside the sphere varies linearly with distance ''r'' from the center, giving the gravitational potential inside the sphere, which is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marion|Thornton|2003|loc=§5.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V(r) = \frac {2}{3} \pi G \rho (r^2-3R^2),\qquad r\leq R,&lt;/math&gt;

which differentiably connects to the potential function for the outside of the sphere (see the figure at the top).

==General relativity==
{{see also|Gravitational acceleration#General relativity|Gravitational field#General relativity}}

In [[general relativity]], the gravitational potential is replaced by the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. When the gravitational field is weak and the sources are moving very slowly compared to light-speed, general relativity reduces to Newtonian gravity, and the metric tensor can be expanded in terms of the gravitational potential.&lt;ref name="Newtonian or gravitoelectric potential"&gt;Grøn, Øyvind; Hervik, Sigbjørn [https://books.google.com/books?id=IyJhCHAryuUC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=%22%CF%86+is+the+Newtonian+or+gravitoelectric+potential%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jzzmTaS-HYPTsgaZ4rmfCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Einstein's general theory of relativity: with modern applications in cosmology] Springer, 2007, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multipole expansion==
{{main|spherical multipole moments|Multipole expansion}}
The potential at a point '''x''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = - \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{r}|}\ dm(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Massdistribution xy.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of a mass distribution (grey) with center of mass as the origin of vectors '''x''' and '''r''' and the point at which the potential is being computed at the tail of vector '''x'''.]]
The potential can be expanded in a series of [[Legendre polynomials]]. Represent the points '''x''' and '''r''' as [[position vector]]s relative to the center of mass. The denominator in the integral is expressed as the square root of the square to give

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= - \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{G}{ \sqrt{|\mathbf{x}|^2 -2 \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{r} + |\mathbf{r}|^2}}\,dm(\mathbf{r})\\
{}&amp;=- \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} G \, \left/ \, \sqrt{1 -2 \frac{r}{|\mathbf{x}|} \cos \theta + \left( \frac{r}{|\mathbf{x}|} \right)^2}\right.\,dm(\mathbf{r})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where, in the last integral, r = |'''r'''| and θ is the angle between '''x''' and '''r'''.

The integrand can be expanded as a [[Taylor series]] in ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''/|'''x'''|, by explicit calculation of the coefficients. A less laborious way of achieving the same result is by using the generalized [[binomial theorem]].&lt;ref name="AEM"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. R., Jr. |last=Wylie |date=1960 |title=Advanced Engineering Mathematics |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |edition=2nd |page=454 [Theorem 2, Section 10.8] |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting series is the [[generating function]] for the Legendre polynomials:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1- 2 X Z + Z^2 \right) ^{- \frac{1}{2}} \ = \sum_{n=0}^\infty Z^n P_n(X)&lt;/math&gt;

valid for |''X''|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and |''Z''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. The coefficients ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the Legendre polynomials of degree ''n''. Therefore, the Taylor coefficients of the integrand are given by the Legendre polynomials in ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos θ. So the potential can be expanded in a series that is convergent for positions '''x''' such that ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;|'''x'''| for all mass elements of the system (i.e., outside a sphere, centered at the center of mass, that encloses the system):
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
V(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= - \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x}|} \int \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{r}{|\mathbf{x}|} \right)^n P_n(\cos \theta) \, dm(\mathbf{r})\\
{}&amp;= - \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x}|} \int \left(1 + \left(\frac{r}{|\mathbf{x}|}\right) \cos \theta + \left(\frac{r}{|\mathbf{x}|}\right)^2\frac {3 \cos^2 \theta - 1}{2} + \cdots\right)\,dm(\mathbf{r})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The integral &lt;math&gt;\int r\cos \theta dm&lt;/math&gt; is the component of the center of mass in the '''x''' direction; this vanishes because the vector '''x''' emanates from the center of mass. So, bringing the integral under the sign of the summation gives
:&lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf{x}) = - \frac{GM}{|\mathbf{x}|} - \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x}|} \int \left(\frac{r}{|\mathbf{x}|}\right)^2 \frac {3 \cos^2 \theta - 1}{2} dm(\mathbf{r}) + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that elongation of the body causes a lower potential in the direction of elongation, and a higher potential in perpendicular directions, compared to the potential due to a spherical mass, if we compare cases with the same distance to the center of mass. (If we compare cases with the same distance to the ''surface'', the opposite is true.)

==Numerical values==
The absolute value of gravitational potential at a number of locations with regards to the gravitation from {{Clarify|date=May 2012}} the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], and the [[Milky Way]] is given in the following table; i.e. an object at Earth's surface would need 60 MJ/kg to "leave" Earth's gravity field, another 900 MJ/kg to also leave the Sun's gravity field and more than 130 GJ/kg to leave the gravity field of the Milky Way. The potential is half the square of the [[escape velocity]].
&lt;!--
 theoretically, the square of the escape velocity is the potential relatively to infinity (i.e. where the inverse distance vanishes), but what means "with respect" to the central body is unclear.
 --Incnis Mrsi 
Isn't the rows the location of the observer and the column the centre of the potential well? (I rephrased the sentence somewhat; though I am not sure if it is any clearer now)

'''Green House Data''' is a [[data center]] services provider headquartered in [[Cheyenne]], [[Wyoming]], United States. Cheyenne is home to a campus with 45,000 square feet of data center space, as well as administrative and technical support offices. The company has additional data center locations in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Colorado]], [[Oregon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Texas]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], with sales and marketing offices in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] and in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact Us|url=http://www.greenhousedata.com/about-us/contact-us/|publisher=Green House Data|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2007, three friends hatched the idea for a data center powered exclusively by [[renewable energy]] over coffee and soon after began the process of retrofitting a former office building to provision 3000 square feet of colocation space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alger|first=Douglas|title=The Art of the Data Center: A Look Inside the World's Most Innovative and Compelling Computing Environments|year=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=US|isbn=978-1587142963|pages=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2012, Green House Data had doubled the footprint in the Cheyenne location, added [[cloud hosting]] products, and expanded its footprint to the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Justin|title=Green House Data Expands Cloud Hosting to West Coast with Oregon Data Center|url=http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/green-house-data-expands-cloud-hosting-to-west-coast-with-oregon-data-center|work=article|publisher=the WHIR|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, an east coast expansion was announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Rich|title=Green House Data Expands to New Jersey|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/12/13/green-house-data-expands-to-new-jersey/|publisher=Data Center Knowledge|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by August 2013, the company had broken ground on a new facility in Cheyenne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Annie|title=Local Data Center to Break Ground on Expansion|url=http://cheyenneleads.org/local-data-center-to-break-ground-on-expansion/|publisher=Cheyenne LEADS|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Cheyenne location officially opened on July 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bryan|first1=Miles|title=Data Center Expansion Opens In Cheyenne|url=http://wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/data-center-expansion-opens-cheyenne|accessdate=8 August 2014|publisher=Wyoming Public Media|date=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, 1547 Critical Systems Realty and Green House Data announced that the company would be an anchor tenant in a redevelopment at 1 Ramland Road in [[Orangeburg, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green House Data to Launch New Data Center at 1547’s 1 Ramland Road location in New York|url=http://www.hostingjournalist.com/colocation/green-house-data-to-launch-new-data-center-at-1547s-1-ramland-road-location-in-new-york|accessdate=9 September 2014|publisher=Hosting Journalist|date=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the company acquired FiberCloud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green House Data Buys Three Washington Data Centers|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/04/06/green-house-data-buys-three-washington-data-centers/|accessdate=6 April 2015|publisher=Data Center Knowledge|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Seattle, Washington based provider of colocation, cloud hosting, and other data center services. With this acquisition, Green House Data added three data centers in Washington state, as well as nearly 20 employees and several hundred customers.

In April 2017, the company acquired Cirracore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mcgee-Abe|first1=Jason|title=Green House Data acquires Cirracore|url=http://www.capacitymedia.com/Article/3709609/News/Green-House-Data-acquires-Cirracore.html|website=Capacity Media|publisher=Capacity Media|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a cloud-focused infrastructure provider based in Atlanta, Georgia. In November 2017, the company acquired Ajubeo, a cloud hosting service provider based in Denver.

Green House Data announced a merger via acquisition of Infront Consulting Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Rich|title=Green House Data Boosts its Azure Mojo with Infront Acquisition|url=https://datacenterfrontier.com/green-house-data-boosts-its-azure-mojo-with-infront-acquisition|website=Data Center Frontier|publisher=Data Center Frontier|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May of 2018, expanding operations to Toronto and Las Vegas, as well as other satellite sites, while adding over 30 IT consulting staff focusing on Microsoft Azure, cloud automation, and IT consulting.

==Emerging Markets==
The company is part of a new surge in data center construction in the Cheyenne region and across the Rocky Mountains.

== Sustainable energy ==
As a whole, the data center industry has been highly criticized for heavy electrical use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Data Center Facilities and Estimates of Power Demand|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Climate-Reports/How-Clean-is-Your-Cloud/|work=Report|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glanz|first=James|title=Power, Pollution and the Internet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?_r=0|work=Article|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent years has actively tried to reduce power consumption by improving facility design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources on Data Center Energy Efficiency|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/program/dc_resources.html|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing server [[virtualization]]. As a key element of their business model, Green House Data purchases [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|renewable energy credits, or RECs]], for [[wind power]] and documents purchases with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA's]] [[Green Power Partnership]]. In 2013, Green House Data was part of EPA's "Leadership Club" for sustainable power purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partner List|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/partners/|publisher=EPA|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common measure for data center power consumption is [[Power usage effectiveness]], often abbreviated PUE.

Beginning in 2014, Green House Data was the first company to participate in WyoRECs, the first renewable energy credit program based out of Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coyle|first1=Pamela|title=Wyoming Renewable Energy Credit Program Helps Companies 'Green' Their Power|url=http://businessclimate.com/wyoming-economic-development/wyoming-renewable-energy-credit-program-helps-companies-green-their-pow|website=http://businessclimate.com/|publisher=Journal Communications|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Green House Data joined the [[EPA]]'s Top 30 Tech &amp; Telecom list of the largest green power users, retiring over 8 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Green House Data Joins Top 30 Tech &amp; Telecom Green Power Users|url=http://www.greenhousedata.com/press/green-house-data-joins-top-30-tech-telecom-green-power-users |publisher=Green House Data|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the company moved up 5 places on the list, retiring 20,270,000 kWhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Greenest Of Them All: The EPA Releases Index Of Top 30 Green Energy Telcos And Tech Companies|url=https://cloudscene.com/news/2017/07/greendatacenters/|website=Cloudscene|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the company's cloud and colocation facilities achieved SSAE 16 Type II Compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green House Data Achieves SSAE 16, Type II Compliance |url=http://www.greenhousedata.com/press/post/green-house-data-achieves-ssae-16-type-ii-compliance/|publisher=Green House Data|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2012, Green House Data achieved [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] IT compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runyon|first=Barry|title=Healthcare Reform Driving Cloud Services Providers Toward Maturity|url=http://www.gartner.com/id=2471917|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Centers ==
Green House Data operates a total of ten data center facilities in nine geographic regions. There are [[Cloud computing|cloud]] and [[Colocation centre|colocation]] data centers in [[Atlanta, GA]], [[Cheyenne, WY]], [[Seattle, WA]], [[Everett, WA]], and [[Bellingham, WA]] and cloud data centers in [[Dallas, TX]], [[Denver, CO]], [[Orangeburg, NY]], and [[Portland, OR]].  Each location is [[Network-neutral data center|carrier neutral]], fully compliant to [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[SSAE 16]] Type II standards, and comes with guaranteed uptime [[Service-level agreement|service level agreements]]. In March 2016, the company announced a "Hear from a Human" [[technical support]] service guarantee, which [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] called more characteristic of a "boutique cloud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darrow|title=Welcome to the World of Boutique Clouds|url=http://fortune.com/2016/03/17/welcome-to-the-world-of-boutique-clouds/|website=Fortune.com|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seattle facility is located within the [[Westin Building]], the 3rd largest carrier hotel in the United States. The Westin Building data center consists of the 18th, 19th, and 32nd floors, with participation in the [[Seattle Internet Exchange]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1369">'''The inverse Faraday effect''' is the effect opposite to the [[Faraday effect]]. A static [[magnetization]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{M}(0)&lt;/math&gt; is induced by an external oscillating [[electrical field]] with the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, which can be achieved with a high intensity [[laser]] pulse for example. The induced magnetization is proportional to the vector product of &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}^*&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\vec{M}(0)\propto[\vec{E}(\omega)\times\vec{E}^*(\omega)]&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation we see that the circularly polarized light with the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; should induce a magnetization along the [[wave vector]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; is in the [[vector product]], left- and right-handed [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] waves should induce magnetization of opposite signs. 

The induced magnetization is comparable to the saturated magnetization of the media.

'''''Le Règne Animal''''' (The Animal Kingdom) is the most famous work of the French [[naturalist]] [[Georges Cuvier]]. It sets out to describe the natural structure of the whole of the [[animal|animal kingdom]] based on [[comparative anatomy]], and its [[natural history]]. Cuvier divided the animals into four ''embranchements'' ("Branches", roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (cnidaria and other phyla).

The work appeared in four octavo volumes in 1817; a second edition in five volumes was brought out in 1829–1830 and a third, written by twelve "disciples" of Cuvier, in 1836–1849. In this classic work, Cuvier presented the results of his life's research into the structure of living and fossil animals. With the exception of the section on [[insect]]s, in which he was assisted by his friend [[Pierre André Latreille]], the whole of the work was his own. It was translated into English many times, often with substantial notes and supplementary material updating the book in accordance with the expansion of knowledge. It was also translated into German, Italian and other languages, and abridged in versions for children.

''Le Règne Animal'' was influential in being widely read, and in presenting accurate descriptions of groups of related animals, such as the living [[elephants]] and the extinct [[mammoths]], providing convincing evidence for [[evolution]]ary change to readers including [[Charles Darwin]], although Cuvier himself rejected the possibility of evolution.

==Context==

As a boy, [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769-1832) read the [[Comte de Buffon]]'s ''[[Histoire Naturelle]]'' from the previous century, as well as [[Linnaeus]] and [[Johan Christian Fabricius|Fabricius]].&lt;ref name=GentlemansMag&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anon |title=Life of Cuvier |date=1835 |pages=451–463 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JAk4AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA457&amp;lpg=PA457&amp;dq=cuvier+regne+animal+review&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l0IyLIk9-S&amp;sig=yhApwcStjwfK09rXSPw1uOIV7C4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dh6gVNPDD8fVauzugYAG&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=cuvier%20regne%20animal%20review&amp;f=false |work=Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review, Volume 3 (Google eBook)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought to Paris by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1795, not long after the [[French Revolution]]. He soon became a professor of animal [[anatomy]] at the [[Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle]], surviving changes of government from revolutionary to [[Napoleon]]ic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of [[vertebrate palaeontology]] and the accompanying comparative method. He demonstrated that animals had become [[extinction|extinct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben |title=Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an earlier attempt to improve the classification of animals, Cuvier transferred the concepts of [[Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu]]'s (1748-1836) method of natural classification, which had been presented in 1789 in ''Genera plantarum'', from [[botany]] to [[zoology]]. In 1795, from a "fixist" perspective (denying the possibility of [[evolution]]), Cuvier divided [[Linnaeus]]'s two unsatisfactory classes ("insects" and "worms") into six classes of "white-blooded animals" or [[invertebrate]]s: molluscs, crustaceans, insects and worms (differently understood), echinoderms and zoophytes.&lt;ref&gt;Cuvier, Georges. ''Mémoire sur une nouvelle distribution des animaux à sang blanc'', lu le 21 Floréal de l'an III (10 mai 1795), à la Société d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier divided the molluscs into three orders: cephalopods, gastropods and acephala.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Cuvier, ''Second Mémoire sur l'organisation et les rapports des animaux à sang blanc'', lu le 11 Prairial de l'an III (30 mai 1795), à la Société d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Still not satisfied, he continued to work on animal classification, culminating over twenty years later in the ''Règne Animal''.

[[File:Cuvier-63-Coq de bruyère et Ganga cata.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tetrao urogallus|Blackcock]] and [[Pterocles alchata|pin-tailed sandgrouse]]. 1828 edition]]

For the ''Règne Animal'', using evidence from comparative anatomy and [[palaeontology]]—including his own observations&lt;ref name="Reiss2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reiss |first=John |title=Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5bMCUU0tP0C&amp;pg=PA108 |year=2009 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-94440-4 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Cuvier divided the animal kingdom into four principal [[body plan]]s. Taking the [[central nervous system]] as an animal's principal organ system which controlled all the other organ systems such as the circulatory and digestive systems, Cuvier distinguished four types of organisation of an animal's body:&lt;ref&gt;De Wit, Hendrik Cornelius Dirk. ''Histoire du Développement de la Biologie'', Volume III, Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes, Lausanne, 1994, p. 94-96. {{ISBN|2-88074-264-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* I. with a brain and a spinal cord (surrounded by parts of the skeleton)
* II. with organs linked by nerve fibres
* III. with two longitudinal, ventral nerve cords linked by a band with two ganglia positioned below the oesophagus
* IV. with a diffuse nervous system which is not clearly discernible

Grouping animals with these body plans resulted in four "embranchements" or branches (vertebrates, molluscs, the [[articulata hypothesis|articulata]] that he claimed were natural (arguing that insects and annelid worms were related) and zoophytes ([[radiata]])). This effectively broke with the mediaeval notion of the continuity of the living world in the form of the [[great chain of being]]. It also set him in opposition to both Saint-Hilaire and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Lamarck claimed that species could transform through the influence of the environment, while Saint-Hilaire argued in 1820 that two of Cuvier's branches, the molluscs and radiata, could be united via various features, while the other two, articulata and vertebrates, similarly had parallels with each other. Then in 1830, Saint-Hilaire argued that these two groups could themselves be related, implying a single form of life from which all others could have evolved, and that Cuvier's four body plans were not fundamental.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=Robert J. |title=The Meaning of Evolution: The Morphological Construction and Ideological Reconstruction of Darwin's Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-72dKSIciEC&amp;pg=PA52|date=2 February 2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-71205-5 |pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 448 quarto plates by [[Christophe Annedouche]], Canu, [[Eugène Giraud]], Lagesse, Lebrun, Vittore Pedretti, Plée and Smith illustrated some 6200 animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guérin-Méneville|first1=Felix-Edouard|title=Iconographie du règne animal de G.

===Translations===
''Le Règne Animal'' was translated into languages including English, German and Italian.

Many English translations and abridged versions were published and reprinted in the nineteenth century; records may be for the entire work or individual volumes, which were not necessarily dated, while old translations were often brought out in "new" editions by other publishers, making for a complex publication history. A translation was made by John Edward Gray and published by Whittaker, Treacher and Co. in 1824; another by Edward Griffith and others was published by G. B. Whittaker in 1827–1832 and many times reprinted (up to 2012 and eBook format); another by Henry MacMurtrie was published by G. Henderson in 1834–1837. A translation was made and published by the ornithologist [[William MacGillivray]] in Edinburgh in 1839–1840. Another version by [[Edward Blyth]] and others was published by William S. Orr and Co. in 1840. An abridged version by an "experienced teacher" was published by Longman, Brown, Green and Longman in London, and by Stephen Knapp in Coventry, in 1844. Kraus published an edition in New York in 1969. Other editions were brought out by H.G. Bohn in 1851 and W. Orr in 1854. An "easy introduction to the study of the animal kingdom: according to the natural method of Cuvier", together with examination questions on each chapter, was made by Annie Roberts and published in the 1850s by Thomas Varty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cuvier |first1=Georges |title=The Animal Kingdom: English |url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AThe+Animal+Kingdom+au%3AGeorges+Cuvier&amp;fq=x0%3Abook+%3E+ln%3Aeng&amp;se=yr&amp;sd=asc&amp;dblist=638&amp;start=71&amp;qt=next_page |publisher=WorldCat |accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German translation by H.R. Schinz was published by J.S.

[[File:Cuvier-115-Aiguillat.jpg|file|thumb|[[Squalus acanthias|Spiny dogfish]]. 1828 edition]]

Each section, such as on reptiles at the start of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.

Next, Cuvier identifies the taxonomic divisions of the group, in this case four orders of reptiles, the chelonians ([[tortoises]] and turtles), saurians ([[lizards]]), ophidians ([[snakes]]) and batracians ([[amphibians]], now considered a separate class of vertebrates), describing each group in a single sentence. Thus the batracians are said to have a heart with a single [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], a naked body (with no scales), and to pass with age from being fish-like to being like a quadruped or biped.

There is then a section heading, in this case "The first order of Reptiles, or The Chelonians", followed by a three-page essay on their zoology, starting with the fact that their hearts have two atria. The structure then repeats at a lower taxonomic level, with what Cuvier notes is one of Linnaeus's genera, ''[[Testudo (genus)|Testudo]]'', the tortoises, with five sub-genera. The first sub-genus comprises the land tortoises; their zoology is summed up in a paragraph, which observes that they have a domed [[carapace]], with a solid bony support (the term being "charpente", commonly used of the structure of wooden beams that support a roof). He records that the legs are thick, with short digits joined for most of their length, five toenails on the forelegs, four on the hind legs.

Then (on the ninth page) he arrives at the first species in the volume, the Greek tortoise, ''[[Testudo graeca]]''. It is summed up in a paragraph, Cuvier noting that it is the commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow marbling, and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching a foot in length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, and lays 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.

[[Image:SwainsonQuinarian.jpg|thumb|[[William John Swainson|Swainson's]] [[Quinarian]] [[classification (biology)|classification]] of birds]]

The entomologist [[William Sharp Macleay]], in his 1821 book ''Horae Entomologicae'' which put forward the short-lived "[[Quinarian]]" system of classification into 5 groups, each of 5 subgroups, etc., asserted that in the ''Règne Animal'' "Cuvier was notoriously deficient in the power of legitimate and intuitive generalization in arranging the animal series".&lt;ref name=GentlemansMag/&gt; The zoologist [[William John Swainson]], also a Quinarian, added that "no person of such transcendent talents and ingenuity, ever made so little use of his observations towards a natural arrangement as M. Cuvier."&lt;ref name=GentlemansMag/&gt;

The ''[[Magazine of Natural History]]'' of 1829 expressed surprise at the long interval between the first and second editions, surmising that there were too few scientific readers in France, apart from those in Paris itself; it notes that while the first volume was little changed, the treatment of fish was considerably altered in volume II, while the section on the Articulata was greatly enlarged (to two volumes, IV and V) and written by M. Latreille. It also expressed the hope that there would be an English equivalent of Cuvier's work, given the popularity of natural history resulting from the works of [[Thomas Bewick]] (''[[A History of British Birds]]'' 1797–1804) and [[George Montagu (naturalist)|George Montagu]] (''[[Ornithological Dictionary]]'', 1802). The same review covers [[Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville]]'s ''Iconographie du Règne Animal de M. le Baron Cuvier'', which offered illustrations of all Cuvier's genera (except for the birds).&lt;ref name="LoudonCharlesworth1829"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loudon |first1=John Claudius |last2=Charlesworth |first2=Edward |last3=Denson |first3=John |title=Magazine of natural history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFVIAAAAMAAJ |year=1829 |publisher=printed for Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green |pages=360–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Foreign Review'' of 1830 broadly admired Cuvier's work, but disagreed with his classification. It commented that "From the comprehensive nature of the ''Règne Animal'', embracing equally the structure and history of all the existing and extinct races of animals, this work may be viewed as an epitome of M. Cuvier's zoological labours; and it presents the best outline, which exists in any language, of the present state of zoology and comparative anatomy."&lt;ref name=ForeignReview&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anon |title=Baron Cuvier |date=1830 |publisher=Black, Young and Young |pages=342–379 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ohTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA373&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=cuvier+regne+animal+review&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zaOpr465AJ&amp;sig=3tI3NWVob0r6PrNTjHboPGy4AZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TiygVKOXConVar3pgXA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=cuvier%20regne%20animal%20review&amp;f=false |work=The Foreign Review, Volume 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review continued less favourably, however, that "We cannot help thinking that the science of comparative anatomy is now so far advanced, as to afford the means of distributing the animal kingdom on some more uniform and philosophical principles,—as on the modifications of those systems or functions which are most general in the animal economy".&lt;ref name=ForeignReview/&gt; The review argued that the vertebrate division relied on the presence of a vertebral column, "a part of the organization of comparatively little importance in the economy"; it found the basis of the mollusca on "the general softness of the body" no better; the choice of the presence of articulations no better either, in the third division; while in the fourth it points out that while the echinoderms may fit well into the chosen scheme, it did not apply "to the entozoa, zoophyta, and infusoria, which constitute by much the greatest portion of this division."&lt;ref name=ForeignReview/&gt; But the review notes that "the general distribution of the animal kingdom established by M. Cuvier in this work, are founded on a more extensive and minute survey of the organization than had ever before been taken, and many of the most important distinctions among the orders and families are the result of his own researches."&lt;ref name=ForeignReview/&gt;

Writing in the ''Monthly Review'' of 1834, the pre-Darwinian evolutionist surgeon [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|Sir William Lawrence]] commented that "the ''Regne Animal'' of Cuvier is, in short, an abridged expression of the entire science. He carried the lights derived from his zoological researches into kindred but obscure parts of nature."&lt;ref name=Lawrence/&gt; Lawrence calls the work "an arrangement of the animal kingdom nearly approaching to perfection; grounded on principles so accurate, that the place which any animal occupies in this scheme, already indicates the leading circumstances in its structure, economy, and habits."&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;{{cite book |title=The Monthly Review |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkYDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA570 |year=1834 |publisher=Hurst, Robinson |page=570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was in the library of ''[[HMS Beagle]]'' for [[Charles Darwin]]'s voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beagle Library: The Animal Kingdom |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/BeagleLibrary/1827-35_Cuvier_A761.01.html |website=Darwin Online |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), in a chapter on the difficulties facing the theory, Darwin comments that "The expression of conditions of existence,{{efn|"Conditions d'existence" is used in Cuvier's Introduction to volume 1 of ''Règne Animal'', p. 6.}} so often insisted on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of [[natural selection]]." Darwin continues, reflecting both on Cuvier's emphasis on the conditions of existence, and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s theory of acquiring heritable characteristics from those Cuvieran conditions: "For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by having adapted them during long-past periods of time: the adaptations being aided in some cases by [[Lamarckism|use and disuse]], being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life, and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of Unity of Type."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=On the Origin of Species |publisher=John Murray |page=206 |edition=1st |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
The palaeontologist [[Philippe Taquet]] wrote that "the ''Règne Animal'' was an attempt to create a complete inventory of the animal kingdom and to formulate a natural classification underpinned by the principles of the 'correlation of parts'.." He adds that with the book "Cuvier introduced clarity into natural history, accurately reproducing the actual ordering of animals." Taquet further notes that while Cuvier rejected evolution, it was paradoxically "the precision of his anatomical descriptions and the importance of his research on fossil bones", showing for instance that mammoths were extinct elephants, that enabled later naturalists including Darwin to argue convincingly that animals had evolved.&lt;ref name=Taquet&gt;{{cite book |author1=Taquet, Philippe |title=Georges Cuvier |editor1-last=Huxley |editor1-first=Robert |work=The Great Naturalists |date=2007 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |pages=209–211 |authorlink=Philippe Taquet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lemurs of Madagascar''''' is a 2010 [[reference work]] and [[field guide]] for the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]], giving descriptions and biogeographic data for the known species.  The primary contributor is [[Russell Mittermeier]], president of [[Conservation International]], and the cover art and illustrations were drawn by [[Stephen D. Nash (illustrator)|Stephen D. Nash]].  Currently in its third edition, the book provides details about all known lemur species, general information about lemurs and their history, and also helps travelers identify species they may encounter.  Four related pocket field guides have also been released, containing color illustrations of each species, miniature range maps, and species checklists.

The first edition was reviewed favorably in the ''[[International Journal of Primatology]]'', ''[[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]]'', and ''[[Lemur News]]''.  Reviewers, including [[Alison Jolly]], praised the book for its meticulous coverage of each species, numerous high-quality illustrations, and engaging discussion of lemur topics, including conservation, evolution, and the recently extinct [[subfossil lemur]]s.  Each agreed that the book was an excellent resource for a wide audience, including [[ecotourism|ecotourists]] and lemur researchers.  A lengthy review of the second edition was published in the ''[[American Journal of Primatology]]'', where it received similar favorable comments, plus praise for its updates and enhancements. The third edition was reviewed favorably in ''Lemur News''; the reviewer praised the expanded content of the book, but was concerned that the edition was not as portable as its predecessors.

The first edition identified 50&amp;nbsp;lemur species and subspecies, compared to 71 in the second edition and 101 in the third.  The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] promoted by these books has been questioned by researchers, such as [[Ian Tattersall]], who view these growing numbers of [[List of lemur species|lemur species]] as insufficiently justified inflation of species numbers ([[taxonomic inflation]]).

== Overview ==
''Lemurs of Madagascar'' is published by Conservation International (CI), a non-profit conservation organization headquartered near Washington, D.C., and is intended as a field guide that identifies all of the known lemur species from Madagascar.{{r|1996Gould}}  The first edition of ''Lemurs of Madagascar'' was published in 1994 and contained 356&amp;nbsp;pages.  The 520-page second edition was published in 2006 and is now officially out of print, having been followed by the 767-page third edition in the fall of 2010.{{r|CI_pub_LoM3}}

For all three editions, Stephen D. Nash, winner of the 2004 [[American Society of Primatologists]] President's Award,{{r|2007Tecot}} has been the illustrator and front cover artist.  The lead author for all three editions is Russell A. Mittermeier, president of CI and a well-published [[primatology|primatologist]], [[herpetology|herpetologist]] and [[biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]].{{r|LoM2_pg5-8}} In the first edition, four other authors were also listed: Ian Tattersall, a curator in the Division of Anthropology at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]; William R. Konstant, the Director of Conservation and Science at the [[Houston Zoo]]; David M.

Mast, [[marine biology|marine biologist]], primatologist, and the founding Director of CI's Madagascar Program.{{r|LoM1_pg6-7}}

The second edition was authored by Mittermeier, Konstant, Tattersall, and Meyers, as well as seven new authors: Frank Hawkins, the Technical Director for CI in Madagascar; [[Edward E. Louis, Jr.]], the conservation geneticist for Omaha's [[Henry Doorly Zoo]]'s Center for Conservation and Research; Olivier Langrand, CI's Senior Vice President for Africa and Madagascar; Jonah H. Ratsimbazafy, the Scientific Coordinator for the [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]] - Madagascar Program; Rodin Rasoloarison, a field researcher and research coordinator at the [[German Primate Center]]; Jörg U. Ganzhorn, professor in the Department of Animal Ecology and Conservation at the [[University of Hamburg]] and Chairman for the Madagascar section of the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (IUCN/SSC) [[IUCN Species Survival Commission#Primate Specialist Group|Primate Specialist Group]] since 1998; and Serge Rajaobelina, the President of Fanamby, a Malagasy [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental environmental organization]].{{r|LoM2_pg5-8}}

The list of authors changed again with the third edition.  Returning authors included Mittermeier, Louis, Langrand, Hawkins, Rajaobelina, Ratsimbazafy, and Rasoloarison.  New authors included Matthew Richardson, writer and member of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group; Christoph Schwitzer, the Head of Research at the Bristol Zoo Gardens; Anthony Rylands, a Senior Research Scientist at Conservation International and Deputy Chair of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group; Christian Roos, a geneticist at the German Primate Center; Peter M. Kappeler, a Professor of Sociobiology and Anthropology at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany; and James MacKinnon, the Senior Technical Director of Conservation International in Madagascar.{{r|LoM3_Contributors}}

The first edition followed a 1982 volume by Tattersall, entitled ''Primates of Madagascar''.  As a field guide, the ''Lemurs of Madagascar'' is "more portable and affordable,"{{r|1996Gould}} while offering updated information to assist lemur researchers and tourists in the identification of lemur species and subspecies, according to a 1996 review published in ''Lemur News''.{{r|1996Jolly}} All three editions cover the [[natural history]] and [[conservation status]] for each known species.  They also discuss [[Lemur#Conservation|conservation strategies]], [[Evolutionary history of lemurs|lemur origins]], [[Subfossil lemur|extinct lemurs]], and the [[Lemur#Research|history of discoveries]] made by early European naturalists.  The books provide suggestions on where to see each species,{{r|1996Gould}} as well as checklists to help people keep track of their sightings.{{r|1996Jolly}}  The purpose of the book is defined in the "Introduction" as follows:

{{quote|text=Conservation International and the Primate Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union's Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) have long recognized Madagascar as one of their top priorities, and are pleased to present this guide to facilitate field identification of lemurs, to summarize available data on their ecology, distribution and conservation status, and to stimulate further interest in the survival of these animals in their natural habitats.|sign=Peter A. Seligmann &amp; Russell A. Mittermeier|source=''Lemurs of Madagascar'', First Edition{{r|LoM1_pg4}}}}

Four pocket field guides have also been published by CI, intended strictly to help people identify lemurs in the field by providing over 100 species illustrations.  All illustrations, including the detailed cover art, were drawn by Nash.  Checklists for their respective lemur species are included with these guides, along with [[thumbnail]] range maps for each species.  The four pocket guides include two editions of ''Lemurs of Madagascar Pocket Identification Guide'' (out of print), ''Nocturnal Lemurs'', and ''Diurnal and Cathemeral Lemurs''.{{r|CI_pub_pocket1}}  The ''Nocturnal Lemurs'' booklet contains 65&amp;nbsp;species from eight [[genus|genera]].{{r|CI_pub_pocket2}}  ''Diurnal and Cathemeral Lemurs'' hosts 34&amp;nbsp;species and subspecies from seven genera, along with illustrations to show male and female fur color differences in the genus ''[[True lemur|Eulemur]]'' and [[Polymorphism (biology)|color morphs]] for the [[indri]] and [[ruffed lemur]] species.{{r|CI_pub_pocket3}}  A fifth and sixth pocket field guides are planned following the publication of the third edition of the field guide.{{r|LoM3_pg674}}

All three editions are split into multiple chapters, sections, and appendices.{{r|1996Gould|2007Tecot}}  In the second and third editions, the inside of the front and back covers include a quick visual reference, with color-coded illustrations for each lemur type and colored tabs to help locate their corresponding sections. A section entitled "How to Use this Field Guide" is included between the "Introduction" and the first chapter.  In this section, the layout of the book is discussed in detail, including the quick visual reference, chapters, appendices, references, and lemur-watching checklist.  The chapter "The Living Lemurs" is discussed in great detail, including each section heading used for all the lemur species.{{r|LoM2_HowTo|LoM3_HowTo}}

The "Introduction" in the first two editions was written by Peter A. Seligmann, Chairman of the Board and CEO of CI, and Mittermeier.{{r|LoM1_Intro|LoM2_Intro}}  In the third edition, the "Introduction" was written only by Mittermeier.{{r|LoM3_Intro}}  In it, they emphasize the richness of Madagascar's primate diversity, summarize the conservation efforts and opportunities for preserving that diversity, and highlight recent discoveries, while also acknowledging the need for additional research.{{r|LoM1_Intro|LoM2_Intro}}  The chapter entitled "Origins of Lemurs" ("Origin of the Lemurs" in the third edition) briefly summarizes the theories on how lemurs came to Madagascar and the difficulty in resolving the mystery.{{r|LoM3_Ch2|LoM1_Ch2|LoM2_Ch1}}  "Discovery and Study of the Living Lemurs" reviews the history of exploration, field research, and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic nomenclature]] of lemurs,{{r|LoM3_Ch4|LoM1_Ch3|LoM2_Ch2}} starting from the 1625 description of a [[ring-tailed lemur]] to contemporary research by Western and Malagasy scientists.{{r|1996Gould}}  "The Extinct Lemurs" discusses the recently extinct subfossil lemurs, including the [[monkey lemur]]s, [[sloth lemur]]s, and [[koala lemur]]s.{{r|LoM3_Ch3|LoM1_Ch4|LoM2_Ch3}}  "Conservation of Lemurs" details the threats lemurs face, such as [[habitat destruction]] and hunting for [[bushmeat]],  and conservation efforts aimed at their protection, from the [[In-situ conservation|in-situ]] and [[Ex-situ conservation|ex-situ]] programs of the [[Madagascar Fauna Group]] to the promise by Madagascar's former president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] to triple the country's protected areas over five years, known as the [[Durban Vision]].{{r|LoM3_Ch5|LoM1_Ch5|LoM2_Ch4}}  In the third edition, a new chapter was added, entitled "Madagascar's Ancient Geological History", written by Maarten de Wit from the [[University of Cape Town]].  In it, three billion years of geological and biological history are explored in detail.{{r|LoM3_Ch1}}

The majority of the book, including the chapter "The Living Lemurs" and separate sections on each taxonomic group of lemur, providing detailed accounts of all lemur species known up until the time of publication, from the tiny [[mouse lemur]]s to the large [[indri]] and [[diademed sifaka]].  In the first and second editions, the chapter "The Living Lemurs" is broken first into sections on [[Family (biology)|families]], and then into species clumped together by [[genus]].{{r|LoM1_Ch6|LoM2_Ch5}}  In the third edition, each family is assigned its own chapter number, separate from "The Living Lemurs" chapter, yet the order and layout are the same.{{r|LoM3_ToC}}  In the second and third editions, all pages within each family section are assigned a colored tab to match those in the quick visual reference inside the covers.{{r|LoM2_Ch5|LoM3_HowTo}} Each species subsection has a distribution map, an illustration or photo (if available), a list of common names in multiple languages (including [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]), and species information broken into five sections: "Identification", "Geographic Range", "Natural History", "Conservation Status", and "Where to See It".{{r|LoM1_Ch6|LoM2_Ch5}}

{{Rquote|left|[The [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]]] is absolutely one of the more difficult lemur species to find in the wild, and indeed many experts who have worked for decades in Madagascar have yet to see one. ... The best opportunities for viewing it are at the [[Analamazaotra Special Reserve]] and the Forêt de Vohidrazana near the village of Fanovana, approximately 12&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Andasibe, Moramanga|Andasibe]], although its observation in these areas remains very unpredictable.|Mittermeier, ''et al''.|''Lemurs of Madagascar'', Second Edition{{r|LoM2_pg134}}}}
The "Identification" section for each species provides descriptive information to help identify and distinguish species, including a detailed physical description, discussions of variation in size and coloration ([[morphometrics]]), and descriptions of distinguishing vocalizations.  "Geographic Range" offers textual information to accompany the provided distribution map, although the authors note that ranges change due to habitat destruction and that species may be found in new localities outside of their known range.  "Natural History" summarizes what is known about the behavior and ecology of each species,{{r|2007Tecot|LoM3_HowTo|LoM2_HowTo}} such as the unusual feeding strategies of the [[aye-aye]]{{r|LoM2_pg412}} or the nest-building behavior of the [[ruffed lemur]]s.{{r|LoM2_pg303}}  Estimated populations densities and distributions, [[Biological life cycle|life histories]], diet, social structure, and other details are provided when known.  For many species, little information is given due to a lack of research, while others have been studied extensively allowing for more elaborate detail.  "Conservation Status" lists the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] assessment and [[protected area]]s in which a species can be found, while also discussing specific threats to each species, the effects of local ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboos), the future outlook for species survival, and its coverage within [[protected area]]s. Lastly, "Where to See It" aims to promote ecotourism by helping travelers find the best lemur watching sites that can be reached quickly and with the least effort.  Suggested modes of transportation are sometimes mentioned as well.{{r|2007Tecot|LoM3_HowTo|LoM2_HowTo}}

The appendices differ between editions.  The first edition has two appendices.  The first is entitled "Lemurs Present in Protected Areas" and discusses each region and domain of Madagascar while also providing basic information and lemur species content for each protected area.{{r|LoM1_Appx1}}  The second appendix, "Alternative Names for Towns and Sites in Madagascar" spells out a few alternative French and Malagasy names for some of the larger town and cities in Madagascar.{{r|LoM1_Appx2}}  In the second and third editions, Appendix A, "Maps of Madagascar", contains color maps that help locate towns, protected areas, topography, rivers, forest cover, regions, and lemur watching sites.{{r|LoM3_AppxA|LoM2_AppxA}}  Appendix B, entitled "Biogeographic Regions and Floristic Domains of Madagascar" discusses the regions and domains of Madagascar.{{r|LoM3_AppxB|LoM2_AppxB}}  Appendix C, "Key Sites for Watching Lemurs", covers characteristics and highlights of individual [[List of national parks of Madagascar|national parks]], reserves, and regions for lemur watching.{{r|LoM3_AppxC|LoM2_AppxC}} The third edition added Appendix D, entitled "Primate-watching and Primate Life-listing".  In it, ''primate-watching'' and ''primate life-listing'' (the act of recording personal first sightings of a species) are promoted while their benefits to conservation are discussed.{{r|LoM3_AppxD}}

All three editions provide a "References" section,{{r|LoM1_Refs|LoM2_Refs|LoM3_Refs}} with the second edition listing approximately 500 scientific papers, books, reports, and dissertations used in the creation of the book.{{r|LoM2_Refs}}  The number of references jumped to over 1,100 in the third edition.{{r|LoM3_HowTo}}  Following the "References", the first edition provides a section with the [[Color printing|color plates]].{{r|LoM1_ColorPlates}}  In contrast, the second and third editions provides color illustrations throughout the book.{{r|2007Tecot}}

== Reviews ==
In a 1996 review of the first edition in the ''International Journal of Primatology'', Lisa Gould spoke favorably of the book, citing passages about lemur descriptions from the 17th and 18th centuries that she found entertaining and informative.  She was particularly fascinated with Chapter four, "The Extinct Lemurs", and the reconstructions by Nash that accompanied the descriptions of morphology, behavior, and diet.  She praised Nash's artwork as being one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book.  The book was hailed as an excellent source for identifying lemur species for both tourists and researchers.{{r|1996Gould}}  The book was also briefly reviewed in ''[[College &amp; Research Libraries News]]'' by George Eberhart in April 1996.  The review noted Conservation International's promotion of [[ecotourism]] while also providing a count of the book's illustrations: 35 color plates, 50 distribution maps, and 135 drawings of postures and behaviors.{{r|1996Eberhart}}

[[File:Babakotia radofilai.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A giant lemur hangs from a tree limb by all four feet like a slow-moving sloth. The tail is short, and the arms are slightly longer than the legs.|''[[Babakotia|Babakotia radofilai]]'', one of the extinct giant lemur species described in the chapter entitled "The Extinct Lemurs"]]
In the 1996 edition (volume 2) of ''Lemur News'', [[Alison Jolly]] praised the first edition for its "contribution to knowledge in general" and "its effect on its intended audience."  Like Gould, Jolly praised the work as a field guide, as well as Nash's high-quality illustrations.  She noted the attraction of Nash's subfossil lemur reconstruction, claiming that it was "rapidly becoming one of the most pirated single book illustration on the primate lecture-slide circuit."  Jolly went on to praise the thoroughness of the natural history information provided for each species, including recently described species, noting that the information covered existing knowledge better than any other published literature, even when only a single paragraph was provided for poorly known species.  The book was recommended not only for lemur specialists, but also for tourists, hoping it would spark an interest in ecotourism in impoverished Madagascar.  The checklist of species, as well as the information on where to most easily spot them, earned a special mention from Jolly, who could only boast seeing 30 of the 50 known species at that time.  Finally, the "most significant and most appreciative" audience Jolly mentioned was the Malagasy researchers, to whom Mittermeier reportedly gave 50 copies of the book during a workshop in 1995.{{r|1996Jolly}}

In a 1997 review from ''Conservation Biology'' by Joelisoa Ratsirarson, the book was referred to as a "remarkable achievement" for its up-to-date information, and for being the first comprehensive lemur field guide.  Emphasizing many of the same highlights as Gould and Jolly, he went on to note the inclusion of captive management information, unpublished details, and the use of common names in English, French, German, and Malagasy.  His critique focused on the organization of the illustrations in relation to the text, the lack of an index, and a desire for more information about the roles lemurs play in their [[ecosystem]].  Though he praised it for being useful to tourists, researchers, students, resource managers, and conservationists, he expressed concern over its lack of availability in the bookstores of Madagascar.{{r|1997Ratsirarson}}

The completely revised second edition of ''Lemurs of Madagascar'' was reviewed in detail in the ''American Journal of Primatology'' by Stacey Tecot.  Each chapter, section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted as one of the more "fascinating" parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and informative illustrations.  Although the book received only praise, Tecot did suggest two additions for the next edition: the need for information about the processes of [[island biogeography]] and expansion on captive conservation programs aside from the [[Duke Lemur Center]], particularly at the [[Lemur Conservation Foundation]] and [[St. Catherines Island]].  A subject index was also recommended, along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations.  Otherwise, the book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as how to get to lemur watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area.  Tecot noted that the lemur checklist promoted competitive lemur watching, similar to [[birdwatching]], and that the color-coded sections assisted in "on-the-fly species identification."   Although very satisfied with the information provided for each species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition.  Like its predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for ecotourists and researchers.  It was also noted for its attempt to promote ecotourism as a conservation strategy.{{r|2007Tecot}}

This newer edition was also mentioned briefly in the 2006 edition (volume 11) of ''Lemur News''.  The publication announcement highlighted the extensive coverage of scientific information throughout a range of chapters and appendices.  The edition is said to contain over 200 illustrations, including drawings, photos, and maps.{{r|2006LemurNews_RecentPubs}}

The 2010 third edition was reviewed in ''Lemur News'' by Alex Dunkel. He praised the increased level of detail in the new edition, which adds additional information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|political and economic instability]] in Madagascar, and these challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.{{r|2010Dunkel}}

==Impact on lemur taxonomy==
{{further|Taxonomy of lemurs}}
[[File:Eulemur collaris 001 edit.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of collared brown lemurs sit huddled on a tree limb, with a juvenile clinging to its mother's abdomen.|[[Collared brown lemur]]s were treated as a subspecies in the first edition,{{r|LoM1_pg191-192}} but [[Lumpers and splitters|elevated]] to full species status in the second.{{r|LoM2_pg278-279}}]]

While the first edition recognized 50&amp;nbsp;lemur [[taxon|taxa]] (32&amp;nbsp;[[species]] and 25&amp;nbsp;[[subspecies]]), the second edition recognized 71 lemur taxa (68&amp;nbsp;species and 5&amp;nbsp;subspecies) just 12&amp;nbsp;years later.{{r|2007Rylands}}  The second edition followed the recommendations of [[Colin Groves]] in the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' from 2005 by recognizing newly identified nocturnal species and raising many former subspecies to species status.{{r|2007Tattersall}}  For comparison, Tattersall's book ''Primates of Madagascar'' from 1982 listed only 20&amp;nbsp;species and 29&amp;nbsp;subspecies.{{r|1982Tattersall}}  Following the publication of the second edition, Nick Garbutt recognized 87&amp;nbsp;species and 5&amp;nbsp;subspecies in his book ''Mammals of Madagascar''.{{r|2007Garbutt}}

Not all lemur researchers agree with the species promotions supported by these books. Researchers such as Tattersall and [[Anne D. Yoder]], director of the [[Duke Lemur Center]], have raised concerns about taxonomic inflation.{{r|2007Tattersall|2007Yoder}}  In particular, Tattersall has noted a steep decline in [[Monotypic taxon|polytypic]] lemur species, or species with defined subspecies, starting with the first edition of ''Lemurs of Madagascar'' and becoming more pronounced in the second edition.  He noted that more than half of the new species added in the second edition were promoted subspecies and questioned whether Madagascar could produce so many [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] species.{{r|2007Tattersall}}

Prior to the release of the third edition of ''Lemurs of Madagascar'', many of the major contributors, as well as Colin Groves, teamed up in 2008 to compile an updated lemur species list, published under the title "Lemur diversity in Madagascar" in the ''International Journal of Primatology''.  In it, 99&amp;nbsp;lemur taxa were recognized (97&amp;nbsp;species and 3&amp;nbsp;subspecies).{{r|2008MittermeierGroves}}  The third edition went on to recognize 101&amp;nbsp;lemur taxa (97&amp;nbsp;species and 6&amp;nbsp;subspecies) and suggested that future research could reveal as many as 110 to 125 taxa.{{r|LoM3_Intro}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3698">'''Liquid junction potential''' occurs when two solutions of [[electrolyte]]s of different concentrations are in contact with each other. The more concentrated solution will have a tendency to [[diffuse]] into the comparatively less concentrated one. The rate of diffusion of each [[ion]] will be roughly proportional to its speed in an [[electric field]]. If the [[anions]] diffuse more rapidly than the [[cations]], they will diffuse ahead into the dilute solution, leaving the latter negatively [[Electric charge|charged]] and the concentrated solution positively charged. This will result in an [[electrical double layer]] of positive and negative charges at the junction of the two solutions. Thus at the point of junction, a [[Voltage|potential difference]] will develop because of the [[ionic transfer]]. This potential is called liquid junction potential or [[diffusion]] potential which is non-equilibrium potential.  The magnitude of the potential depends on the relative speeds of the ions' movement.

==Calculation==

The liquid junction potential cannot be measured directly but calculated. The [[Electromotive force]] (EMF) of  a [[concentration cell]] with transference includes the liquid junction potential.

The EMF of a concentration cell without transport is:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{nt} = \frac{RT}{F} \ln \frac{a_2}{a_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Thermodynamic activity|activities]] of HCl in the two solutions, R is the [[Universal Gas Constant]], T is the temperature and F is [[Faraday's Constant]].

The EMF of a concentration cell with transport (including the [[ion transport number]]) is:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{wt} = t_M\frac{RT}{F} \ln \frac{a_2}{a_1}&lt;/math&gt;
where a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are activities of HCl solutions of right and left hand electrodes respectively and t&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; be transport number of Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Liquid Junction potential is the difference between the two EMFs of the two concentration cells, with and without ionic transport:

E&lt;sub&gt;lj&lt;/sub&gt;= E&lt;sub&gt;wt&lt;/sub&gt; – E&lt;sub&gt;nt&lt;/sub&gt; = (t&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; – 1) RT/F . ln (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

&lt;!-- Adaptation of the [[Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation]] gives the following equation which can be used to calculate the liquid junction potential. Writing Formula atm... --&gt;

==Elimination==

The liquid junction potential interferes with the exact measurement of the electromotive force of a chemical cell, so its effect should be minimized as much as possible for accurate measurement. The most common method of eliminating the liquid junction potential is to place a [[salt bridge]] consisting of a saturated solution of [[potassium chloride]] (KCl) and [[ammonium nitrate]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[lithium acetate]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOLi) between the two solutions constituting the junction. When such a bridge is used, the ions in the bridge are present in large excess at the junction and they carry almost the whole of the current across the boundary. The efficiency of KCl/NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is connected with the fact that in these salts, the [[ion transport number|transport numbers]]{{Clarify|date=June 2013}} of anions and cations are the same.

North and mid Bedfordshire are undulating claylands with broad river valleys of the [[River Great Ouse]] and its tributaries, and the [[Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge]]. [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] clays are overlaid by [[Quaternary]] glacial deposits of chalky boulder clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/4984544973291520|title=Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands|series=National Character Area profile|number=88|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=10 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211130845/http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/4984544973291520|archivedate=11 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are forty [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Bedfordshire]], designated by [[Natural England]]. Thirty-five are listed for their biological interest, and five for their geological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteList.aspx?siteName=&amp;countyCode=1&amp;responsiblePerson= |publisher=Natural England |title=Designated Sites View: SSSIs Bedfordshire |accessdate=29 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124161435/https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteList.aspx?siteName=&amp;countyCode=1&amp;responsiblePerson= |archivedate=24 November 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the sites are also [[National nature reserve]]s, twelve are in the [[Chilterns]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], and eleven are managed wholly or partly by the [[Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire]]. In 2009 Bedfordshire was divided into three [[Unitary authority|unitary local authorities]]: thirty-two sites are in [[Central Bedfordshire]], eight in [[Borough of Bedford|Bedford]] and none in [[Luton]].

[[File:Sedna orbit.svg|thumb|The orbit of Sedna (red) set against the orbits of outer Solar System objects (Pluto's orbit is purple).|alt=The orbit of Sedna lies well beyond these objects, and extends many times their distances from the Sun]]

This is a '''list of Solar System objects by greatest aphelion''' or the greatest distance from the Sun that the orbit takes it. For the purposes of this list, it is implied that the object is orbiting the Sun [[Two-body problem|in a two-body solution]] without the influence of the planets or passing stars. The aphelion can change significantly due to the gravitational influence of planets and other stars. Most of these objects are comets on a calculated path and may not be directly observable.&lt;ref  name="JPL-20000AU" /&gt; For instance, comet [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale-Bopp]] was last seen in 2013 at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 24&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;object_id=C%2F1995+O1| title=C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp)| publisher=Minor Planet Center| accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to fade, making it invisible to all but the most powerful telescopes.

The maximum extent of the region in which the Sun's [[gravitational field]] is dominant, the [[Hill sphere]], may extend to {{convert|230000|AU|ly|abbr=off}} as calculated in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Chebotarev1964"&gt;{{Citation|last = Chebotarev|first = G.A.|title = Gravitational Spheres of the Major Planets, Moon and Sun|journal = Soviet Astronomy|volume = 7|issue = 5|pages = 618–622|year = 1964|accessdate = |bibcode = 1964SvA.....7..618C}}&lt;/ref&gt; But any comet currently more than about {{convert|150000|AU|ly|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=1}} from the Sun can be considered lost to the [[interstellar medium]]. The nearest known star is Proxima Centauri at 271,000 AU which is 4.22 light years,&lt;ref name=stars&gt;[http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html NASA – Imagine the Universe: The Nearest Star]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Alpha Centauri at about 4.35 light years away according to NASA.&lt;ref name=stars/&gt;

Comets are thought to orbit the Sun at great distances, but then be perturbed by passing stars and the [[galactic tide]]s.&lt;ref name=vtphys&gt;[http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/astronomy.html Frequently Asked Questions About General Astronomy ]&lt;/ref&gt; As they come into or leave the inner Solar System they may have their orbit changed by the planets, or alternatively be ejected from the Solar System.&lt;ref name=vtphys/&gt; It is also possible they may collide with the Sun or a planet.&lt;ref name=vtphys/&gt;

==Comets with greatest aphelion (2 body heliocentric)==

The exact furthest distance from the Sun (aphelion) can be very different depending on the object's position in its orbit, as well as the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. An incoming asteroid could be slowed down by Jupiter, making its orbit closer to the Sun. The aphelion distance for heliocentric orbits (only taking into account the present location of the Sun as the orbited mass) can be highly inaccurate for objects with an [[orbital eccentricity]] approaching 1 (a hyperbolic orbit not bound to the Solar System) especially when the orbit is calculated while the object is near its closest point to the Sun and has not left the planetary region of the Solar System, where it passes closest to planets which could alter its orbit significantly. Barycentric solutions are more accurate because they account for the combined gravity of the Sun and the most massive planet Jupiter. An epoch of 2200 has all of these objects well outside of the planetary region of the Solar System. In 2200, comet C/2012 S4 will be {{Convert|178|AU|e9km|sigfig=2|abbr=unit|lk=on}} from the Sun.

It should be noted that the exact position of [[Planet Nine]] is poorly known, so some comets might have been slightly perturbed by it. However, statistically only 0.17% of distant comets should pass less than 100 AU from planet Nine, and only 0.0017% less than 10 AU.

=== Distant comets with long observation arcs and/or barycentric ===
[[File:C-west-1976-ps.jpg|thumb|Comet West in 1976]]

Examples of comets with a more well-determined orbit. Comets are extremely small relative to other bodies and hard to observe once they stop outgassing (see [[Coma (cometary)]]). Because they are typically discovered close to the Sun, it will take some time even thousands of years for them to actually travel out to great distances. The [[Whipple (spacecraft)|''Whipple'']] proposal might be able to detect Oort cloud objects at great distances, but probably not a particular object.

== Minor planets ==
{{See also|List of trans-Neptunian objects}}

A large number of [[trans-Neptunian objects]] (TNOs) – [[minor planet]]s orbiting beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]] – have been discovered in recent years. Many TNOs have orbits with an aphelion (farthest distance to the Sun) far beyond Neptune's orbit at 30.1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical units|AU]]. Some of these TNOs with an extreme aphelion are [[detached object]]s such as {{mpl|2010 GB|174}}, which always reside in the outermost region of the Solar System, while for other TNOs, the extreme aphelion is due to an exceptionally high [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] such as for {{mpl|2005 VX|3}}, which orbits the Sun at a distance between 4.1 (closer than Jupiter) and 2200&amp;nbsp;AU (70 times farther from the Sun than Neptune). The following is a list of TNOs with the largest aphelion in descending order.&lt;ref name=jpl200 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jpl800 /&gt;

The first report of an exoplanet within this range was in 1998 for a planet orbiting around [[Gliese 876]] (15.3 light-years (ly) away), and the latest as of 2017 is one around [[Ross 128]] (11 ly). The closest exoplanet found is [[Proxima Centauri b]], which was confirmed in 2016 to orbit [[Proxima Centauri]], the closest star to our Solar System (4.25 ly). [[HD 219134]] (21.6 ly) has six exoplanets, the highest number discovered for any star within this range. A planet around [[Fomalhaut]] (25 ly) was, in 2008, the first planet to be [[methods of detecting exoplanets#Direct imaging|directly imaged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/solitary-fomalhaut-guards-the-southern-sky| title=Fomalhaut had first visible exoplanet| first1=Larry| last1=Sessions| first2=Deborah| last2=Byrd| publisher=Earthsky.org| date=2017-09-22| accessdate=2018-03-15| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326230515/http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/solitary-fomalhaut-guards-the-southern-sky| archivedate=2018-03-26| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most known nearby exoplanets orbit close to their star and have highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbits]]. A majority are significantly larger than Earth, but a few have similar masses, including two planets (around [[YZ Ceti]], 12 ly) which may be less massive than Earth. Several confirmed exoplanets are hypothesized to be [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets|potentially habitable]], with Proxima Centauri b and three around [[Gliese 667 C]] (23.6 ly) considered the most likely candidates.&lt;ref name=PHL/&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] took a public survey in 2015 about renaming some known extrasolar bodies, including the planets around [[Epsilon Eridani]] (10.5 ly) and Fomalhaut.{{ref label|D|d|none}}&lt;ref name=IAUpoll&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1514/ | publisher = International Astronomical Union | title = Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released | date = 2015-12-15 | accessdate = 2018-03-17 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180515174310/https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1514/ | archivedate = 2018-05-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group on Extrasolar Planets of the International Astronomical Union adopted in 2003 a working definition on the upper limit for what constitutes a planet: not being massive enough to sustain thermonuclear fusion of [[deuterium]].

To the unaided eye, the limiting magnitude is +7.6 to +8.0 under "excellent" dark-sky conditions (with effort).&lt;ref name=nakedeye&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Sky &amp; Telescope |date = 2001|title = Light Pollution And Astronomy: The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale |first = John E. |last= Bortle|url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html|accessdate = 2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| item5_value = 5 | 5 = {{note label|E|e|none}} [[Exoplanet naming convention]] assigns uncapitalized letters starting from ''b'' to each planet based on chronological order of their initial report, and in increasing order of distance from the parent star for planets reported at the same time. Omitted letters signify planets that have yet to be confirmed, or planets that have been retracted altogether.
| item6_value = 6 | 6 = {{note label|F|f|none}}  Most reported exoplanet masses have very large error margins (typically, between 10% and 30%). The mass of an exoplanet has generally been inferred from measurements on changes in the [[radial velocity]] of the host star, but this kind of measurement only allows for an estimate on the exoplanet's orbital parameters, but not on their [[orbital inclination]] (''i''). As such, most exoplanets only have an estimated [[minimum mass]] (M&lt;sub&gt;real&lt;/sub&gt;*sin(''i'')), where their [[true mass]]es are statistically expected to come close to this minimum, with only about 13% chance for the mass of an exoplanet to be more than double its minimum mass.&lt;ref name="cumming08"&gt;{{Cite journal| first=Andrew |last=Cumming|date=2008|title=The Keck Planet Search: Detectability and the Minimum Mass and Orbital Period Distribution of Extrasolar Planets|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=120| issue=867|pages=531–554| arxiv=0803.3357|doi=10.1086/588487| bibcode=2008PASP..120..531C| first2=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5577">In electrical power engineering,  '''fault ride through''' ('''FRT'''), sometimes '''under-voltage ride through''' ('''UVRT'''), or '''low voltage ride through''' ('''LVRT'''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.iec.ch/terms/terms.nsf/0/DB2CF1567097E866C1257E29002C35B3?OpenDocument IEC Glossary: UVRT]&lt;/ref&gt; is the capability of electric generators to stay connected in short periods of lower [[Electric power transmission|electric network]] [[voltage]] (cf. [[voltage dip]]). It is needed at distribution level ([[wind turbine|wind parks]], [[photovoltaics|PV systems]], distributed [[cogeneration]], etc.) to prevent a short circuit at HV or EHV level from causing a widespread loss of generation. Similar requirements for critical loads such as computer systems&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powerqualityworld.com/2011/04/cbema-curve-power-quality-standard.html CBEMA Curve – The Power Acceptability Curve for Computer Business Equipment, 2011-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; and industrial processes are often handled through the use of an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) or capacitor bank to supply make-up power during these events.

==General concept==
Many generator designs use electric current flowing through windings to produce the magnetic field on which the motor or generator operates. This is in contrast to designs that use [[permanent magnet]]s to generate this field instead. Such devices may have a minimum working voltage, below which the device does not work correctly, or does so at greatly reduced efficiency. Some will disconnect themselves from the circuit when these conditions apply. The effect is more pronounced in [[Doubly fed electric machine|doubly-fed induction generators]] (DFIG), which have two sets of powered magnetic windings, than in [[Squirrel-cage rotor|squirrel-cage induction generators]] which have only one. [[Synchronous generator]]s may slip and become unstable, if the voltage of the stator winding goes below a certain threshold.

==Risk of chain reaction==
In a grid containing many distributed generators subject to disconnection at under voltage, it is possible to cause a [[chain reaction]] that takes other generators offline as well. This can occur in the event of a [[Power dips|voltage dip]] that causes one of the generators to disconnect from the grid. As voltage dips are often caused by too little generation for the load in a distribution grid, removing generation can cause the voltage to drop further. This may bring the voltage down enough to cause another generator to trip, lower the voltage even further, and may cause a [[cascading failure]].

==Ride through systems==
Modern large-scale wind turbines, typically 1&amp;nbsp;MW and larger, are normally required to include systems that allow them to operate through such an event, and thereby “ride through” the voltage dip. Similar requirements are now becoming common on large [[solar power]] installations that likewise might cause instability in the event of a widespread disconnection of generating units. Depending on the application the device may, during and after the dip, be required to:

* disconnect and stay disconnected until manually ordered to reconnect
* disconnect temporarily from the grid, but reconnect and continue operation after the dip
* stay operational and not disconnect from the grid
* stay connected and support the grid with [[reactive power]] (defined as the reactive current of the positive sequence of the fundamental)&lt;ref name="Akagi_2007"&gt;{{cite book

==Testing==
For wind turbines, the FRT testing is described in the standard IEC 61400-21 (2nd edition August 2008). More detailed testing procedures are stated in the German guideline FGW TR3 (Rev. 22). Testing of devices with less than 16 Amp rated current is described in the EMC standard [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61000-4-11 and for higher current devices in IEC 61000-4-34.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15399">Sacred grove of ancient Pisaureum, '''Lucus Pisaurensis''' is a sacerdotal [[lucus]] lying just outside the coastal ''comune'' of [[Pesaro]], Italy between the Colle della Salute (Hill of Salus) and the Collina (Hillside of the Springs of Beatitude) in Santa Veneranda.&lt;ref&gt;Il Pignocco ''About Us'' http://www.ilpignocco.it/en/about-us/lucus-pisaurensis/&lt;/ref&gt;  Santa Veneranda is a hamlet in the [[Pesaro e Urbino]] Province of [[Marche]], Italy, a pre-''Imperium Romanum'' region of the Latin [[Sabini]], [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Umbrian]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Estrucan]] tribes.

==History of Discovery==

''Pisaurensia Marmora'', ("Marble of Pesaro-Umbria"), a manuscript written by 18th Century Italian aristocrat Annibale degli Abbati Olivieri Giordani, was published in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Art and Its Remains'', by Karl Otfried Müller, publ. 1847 https://books.google.com/books?id=yI8ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA248&lt;/ref&gt;  In the preface, Olivieri reports having discovered, in the prior year, a sacred grove on his estate in a farm field by the little ''Chiostro di Santo Gaetano dei Conti.''&lt;ref&gt;Saints of the Catholic Church, ''Santo Gaetano'' http://catholicsaints.info/tag/born-in-1480/&lt;/ref&gt;  He calls the site ''Lucus Pisaurensis'' (Sacred Grove of Pesaro) and provides a brief description of his findings.  Olivieri further states that he plans to publish a future manuscript entitled ''De Luco Sacred Veterum Pisaurensium'' ("The Sacred Grove of Ancient Pisaurensis"), once excavations are completed.  This work however, was never published and interest in the ''lucus'' disappeared after Oliviera's passing.

'''21st Century'''

During excavations in the 21st century, the grove was rediscovered&lt;ref&gt;M. Cardone, "New Oliveriani documents on Lucus Pisaurensis", in Studia Oliveriana Series III, III-IV, Pesaro 2003-2004&lt;/ref&gt; and archaeological interest in the site renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Teresa Di Luca Gabriele Baldelli, Pier Luigi Dall'Aglio, ''The Lucus Pisaurensis'' (Pesaro and Archaeology. Thematic Papers), Municipality of Pesaro, 2004; Gabriele Stroppa, "First to Pisauro Tombstone'', New Research in Fragments, n. 12, Pesaro 2008; "The Impact of Imperium Romanum on Luci (Sacred Glades, Clearings and Groves) in Italy", by L. Bouke van der Meer,  BABESCH 90, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Findings==

Oliveri unearthed in his field, near the ancient ''fontanine'' by the ''Chiostro di Santo Gaetano dei Conti'',&lt;ref&gt;Saints of the Catholic Church, ''Saint Gaetano'' http://catholicsaints.info/tag/born-in-1480/&lt;/ref&gt; 13 [[Votive Stones of Pesaro|votive stones]]&lt;ref&gt;Oliveriano Archaeological Museum http://www.euromuse.net/en/museums/museum/view-m/museo-archeologico-oliveriano&lt;/ref&gt; or ''cippi'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cippi of Luci'' https://www.academia.edu/15804636/The_impact_of_Rome_on_luci_sacred_glades_clearings_and_groves_in_Italy_BABESCH_90_2015_99-107&lt;/ref&gt; carved of sandstone with Sabine inscriptions in Umbrian-Estrucan; a number of terracotta and sandstone artifacts; clay &amp; copper coin;&lt;ref&gt;Il Pignocco, ''Lucus'' http://www.ilpignocco.it/en/about-us/lucus-pisaurensis/&lt;/ref&gt; and a small ''semo'' replica in bronze inscribed ''Libra''.&lt;ref&gt;''Voti of Luci'' https://www.academia.edu/15804636/The_impact_of_Rome_on_luci_sacred_glades_clearings_and_groves_in_Italy_BABESCH_90_2015_99-107&lt;/ref&gt;  The votives were inscribed with names of various Sabini-Estrucan ''semones'':  [[Salus|Salute]], [[Fides (deity)|Fide]], [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], [[Marica (mythology)|Marica]], [[Feronia (Etruria)|Feronia]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno Regina]]; as well as the later Roman Gods:  [[Janus|Iunos]], Apolenei, Diana, Mater Matuta.

In addition to the found votives, coin and idol, a terracotta borderline marker was unearthed, inscribed:  " ''δ Δ δ  luci coiirii CI  LX'' ".  ''Luci Coiiri'' means 'Coerian Grove' and the Roman numerals are taken to reference land measurements.&lt;ref&gt;''Cippi of Luci'', by L. Bouke van der Meer,  BABESCH 90, 2015, ppg 103-104, ref. Gen. 2:21 מִצַּלְעֹתָ֔יו
 https://www.academia.edu/15804636/The_impact_of_Rome_on_luci_sacred_glades_clearings_and_groves_in_Italy_BABESCH_90_2015_99-107&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivieri found numerous other artifacts on his estate, all of which are housed in the [[Biblioteca Oliveriana, Pesaro|Biblioteca Oliveriana]], a Museum and Library in Pesaro that he founded.  Among these many findings are bronze and clay coinage, carved sandstone stela from 7th C. B.C. depicting naumachia (mock naval battles), the famed bronze Tabula Fabrorum&lt;ref&gt;''La Tabula Fabrorum'' http://www.fondazione.scavolini.com/restauri-tabula-fabrorum.asp?m2=7&lt;/ref&gt; with the relief of Etruscan goddess [[Minerva]] ([[Pallas Athena]]).

The ''fontanine'', or little fountains of stone, by groves near the ''Chiostro'' where many of the votives are discoveried, give archaeologists reason to connect the ''lucus'' to a cult of water&lt;ref&gt;Strong's Hebrew Concordance 4325, Gen. 1:6 http://biblehub.com/hebrew/4325.htm&lt;/ref&gt; goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Il Pignocco, ''Chapel'' http://www.ilpignocco.it/en/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  Latin meaning of the word ''fontanine''&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fountain&lt;/ref&gt; is 'spring waters' as referenced by Decimus Iūnius Iuvenālis, a Silver Age Roman poet, (55 - c. 138 CE), ''Quaesitum ad fontem solos deducere verpus'', "To guide only the ''condūcēbāmus'' to the fountain that they seek."&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Rome, Juvenal''  http://www.ancient-literature.com/rome_juvenal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolution of Votives'''

It is of interest to note that over the millennia, as the original purpose of ''luci'' became lost, votive stones, [[Cippi of Melqart|cippi]] and [[Stele|stelae]] translated to become [[Headstone|grave markers]] and [[Samadhi (shrine)|tombs]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Stelae of Ancient Egypt'' http://m.touregypt.net/featurestories/stela.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of Sacred Groves (''Luci'')==

Ceremonies in ''luci'' were centered around classic elements of a spring and a sylvan wood or coppice.&lt;ref&gt;''Trees, Forests And Sacred Groves'', by Sarah A. Laird http://www.agroforestry.net/the-overstory/74-overstory-195-trees-forests-and-sacred-groves&lt;/ref&gt;  Trees with certain desired qualities of a mystical nature and waters of a certain [[Holy well|mineral purity]] were essential to the creating of a Sacred Grove.&lt;ref&gt;''Minoan Life in Bronze Age Crete'', by Rodney Castleden, Routledge, 1990, pg 138, ''priestés and sacred olive trees'' https://books.google.com/books?id=esSIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT117&amp;lpg=PT117&amp;dq=sacred+trees+bronze+age&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8pVNBb-av-&amp;sig=8jE3yd8Gh95EW1lMk0ObOy87wpk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisuY2t3dLPAhWF4CYKHQhODKMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sacred%20trees%20bronze%20age&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these trees is the [[Laurus nobilis]] (''lat.'' Laures, ''gr.'' Dáphnē Δάφνη), a [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] tree native to the Greek and Roman territories of the early [[List of ancient peoples of Italy|Italics]], [[Illyrians]] and [[Iberians]].  The leaves, roots, berries and bark of the [[Bay leaf|bay laurel]] contain volatile oils, [[malabathrum]],&lt;ref&gt;''Article on Properties of the Lauraceae, C. tamala'' http://www.herbwisdom.com/herb-bay.html&lt;/ref&gt; which stimulate sense glands of the nose, and were the basis&lt;ref&gt;English Oxford Dictionary, ''basis (synonym)'' starting point https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/thesaurus/basis&lt;/ref&gt; of these rituals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">'''Matthew 3:6''' is the sixth verse of the third chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. The verse occurs in the section introducing [[John the Baptist]] with this verse describing his [[baptism]]s.

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:And were baptized of him in
:Jordan, confessing their sins.

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:They were baptized by him in
:the Jordan, confessing their sins.

For a collection of other versions see here: {{Bibleverse||Matthew|3:6|1000}}

The use of the word [[baptism]] to describe what John is doing is controversial. [[Anabaptist]]s assert that the only proper translation for the Greek verb ''baptizmo'' is ''immerse''. They thus practice baptisms where the entire body is immersed in water, rather than just a sprinkling of water as is done in most other Christian churches.  Most non-Baptist scholars do agree that John the Baptist was probably immersing those that came to see him, but they disagree that this is the only valid form of baptism.

France notes that while in Luke and Mark John's baptisms have the power to forgive sins in Matthew they are merely confessed. France argues that in the Gospel of Matthew forgiveness of sins only becomes possible after Jesus' resurrection, a theology not held by the other synoptics.&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. ''The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary.'' Leicester: Inter-Varsity, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The wording of this verse gives no guidance to the Protestant/Catholic dispute over whether the act of baptism cleanses one of sins, or if it merely symbolizes that a person has already been cleansed by God. Similarly the verse is unclear on what role [[confession (religion)|confession]] plays in the process.&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. ''The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary.'' Leicester: Inter-Varsity, 1985. pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of John's baptism ritual are much discussed amongst scholars. Hill notes that various forms of baptism were practiced throughout the Jewish world at this time, but that only those of John the Baptist and [[Qumran]] are [[eschatological]]. This has many scholars to propose a link between the Baptist and those who wrote the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. There were still important difference between the baptisms of the [[Essenes]] and that of John. In Qumran baptism was a part of a regular ritual for those already purified. In John and in Christianity it is a one time event with transformative powers.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, David. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Meliboea''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|b|iː|ə}} or '''Meliboia''' ({{lang-grc|Μελίβοια}}) was a name attributed to the following individuals:

*Meliboea, the daughter of [[Oceanus]] and possible mother of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]] with [[Pelasgus]].&lt;ref name="apollodorus.3.8.1"&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 8. § 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]] 481&lt;/ref&gt; She was also loved by the river god [[Orontes river|Orontes]], who stopped his waters out of love for her, flooding the land.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oppian]], ''Cynegetica'', 2. 115 ff&lt;/ref&gt;
*Meliboea, the wife of [[Magnes (mythology)|Magnes]], who named the town of Meliboea in [[Thessaly]] after her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] on [[Homer]], p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Meliboea became a kingdom in eastern [[Thessalia]] (north [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]]). Nowadays, Meliboea ([[Melivoia]]) is a municipality of [[Larissa (regional unit)|Larissa regional unit]]. The exact place of ancient Melivia is not known.
*Meliboea, the only [[Niobid]] spared when [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] killed them. She was so horrified at the sight of her siblings' death that she stayed greenishly pale for the rest of her life, and for that reason she was dubbed [[Chloris]] ("the pale one").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 5. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 2. 21. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*Meliboea, a maiden of [[Ephesus]]. She loved a young man named Alexis, but her parents betrothed her to another man, and Alexis had to leave the city. On her wedding day Meliboea tried to kill herself by jumping off the roof, but landed unhurt. She then escaped to the seashore and found a boat, the ropes of which loosened on their own. In this boat, she was carried straight to the place where Alexis was dining with his friends. The reunited lovers, as they had promised before, dedicated two temples to [[Aphrodite]], surnamed Epidaetia "The One That Brings To The Banquet" and Automate "The Spontaneous".&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'', 1. 720&lt;/ref&gt;
*Meliboea, mother of Phellus, according to [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catalogue of Women]]'', fragment 167 M-W = [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HesiodCatalogues.html fr. 33 Evelyn-White]&lt;/ref&gt; Both mother and son are otherwise unknown.
*Meliboea is also an alternate name for [[Periboea]] or Eriboea, mother of [[Ajax the Great]], who was also said to have been married to [[Theseus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''Banquet of the Learned'', 4. p. 557a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kings of Meliboea==
Famous kings of Meliboea were:
*King [[Poeas]] ([[Argonauts|Argonaut]]), a friend of [[Hercules]].
*King [[Philoctetes]], son of Poeas, was a famous archer, and a participant in the [[Trojan War]].

'''Mikhail Rostislavovich Farikh''' (Russian: Фарих Михаил Ростиславович) (June 6 1959, Moscow — April 18 2016 [[Bely_Island|Bely]]) was a private helicopter pilot and the first Russian to go around the world by helicopter and to reach the North Pole. He held world records in helicopter competitions. He helped popularize light aviation and was a prominent activist in the world of Russian [[General aviation|GA]]. He was also an active member of the aviation organization {{ill|AOPA Russia|ru|АОПА-Россия}}.

== Biography ==
He was born in Moscow in 1959 into the family of test pilot Rostislav Fabiovich Farikh born May 12, 1922. His grandfather Fabio Farikh was a prominent polar pilot and a motoring pioneer in Russia.

In 1976, Mikhail graduated from Moscow School No. 10. He entered the law faculty of the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense (which is now, after several transformations, part of the MU RF MD), from which he graduated in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubvi.ru/birthday/13.htm|title=Перечень дней рождений и кафедр выпускников ВИМО|publisher=Клуб товарищей ВИИЯ Красной армии|author=|date=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sGv0t60m?url=http://www.clubvi.ru/birthday/13.htm|archivedate=27 July 2017|accessdate=27 July 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the armed forces as a legal officer until 1995. He retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.&lt;ref name="nomination2013"/&gt;
 
After being discharged into the reserves, he went into the automobile audio equipment business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmech.ru/made-in-russia/5651-poyushchie-dinozavry-stalnye-glotki/|title=Поющие динозавры: Стальные глотки|publisher=Популярная механика|author=Корзинов Николай|date=27 August 2006|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170420194813/http://www.popmech.ru/made-in-russia/5651-poyushchie-dinozavry-stalnye-glotki/|archivedate=20 April 2017|accessdate=20 April 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fond of multi-discipline car audio competitions and in 2006 became the Russian champion in EMMA racing, in which driving skills as well as car audio and tuning are put to the test.

After giving up his active role in business, Mikhail enrolled in cooking courses, studied Italian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rusrep.ru/article/2015/07/09/aviaprobegom--po-bezdorozhyu/ |title= Авиапробегом по бездорожью |publisher= Русский репортёр |author= Цырулева Мария |date= 9 July 2015 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20170420194943/http://rusrep.ru/article/2015/07/09/aviaprobegom--po-bezdorozhyu/ |archivedate= 20 April 2017 |accessdate= 20 April 2017 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then ended up by chance in a flying club, where he began to study flying at {{nobr|the age of 48&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMubXfrk_s Выпуск №2] телепрограмма PilotTV (22 февраля 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In sound-pressure level (SPL) competitions between 2001 and 2007, Team Prology took first place 48 times and second place twice and set 14 Russian records. The absolute Russian record of 173.4 dB, set in 2003 with the car named “Ladoga,” has yet to be surpassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=December 2003 |issue=11 |volume=27 |pages=124—129|title=Битва гигантов |trans-title=Battle of giants |url= |language=Russian |magazine=Car&amp;Music |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped to develop and build a number of mobile audio complexes (Hurricane, Typhoon, JBL Sound Cruiser, Prolozavr 1.0 and 2.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Перекуем ракеты на сабвуферы |type= журнал |edition=Мастер 12 вольт  |date=June 2004 |pages=20—21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JBL Sound Cruiser test car made a great impression at the 2005 IFA in Berlin and received worldwide acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Russishe revolution |edition=Sound off |date=January 2006 |pages=92—95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Саунд трак |type=еженедельная автомобильная газета |edition=МК Мобиль |date=June 2005 |page=30 |quote=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He immediately began flying frequently and extensively. He acquired a British pilot license in the same year, and an American one in 2010.

When Mikhail himself did not take part in the flights, he did a lot to make them possible, by sharing experience with others, rendering organizational assistance, and following his colleagues’ flights closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mir24.tv/news/society/11893574 |title= Менеджер из Москвы бросил карьеру ради путешествия на вертолёте |publisher= Мир |date= 9 January 2015 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20170420210916/http://mir24.tv/news/society/11893574 |archivedate= 20 April 2017 |accessdate= 20 April 2017 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://finparty.ru/uvlecheniya/18967/ |title= Рубен Аганбегян: «Как я облетел на вертолёте всю Европу» |work= Finparty |publisher= ООО «Информационное агентство Банки.ру» |author= Маслова Дарья |date= 13 December 2013 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20170421072658/http://finparty.ru/uvlecheniya/18967/ |archivedate= 21 April 2017 |accessdate= 21 April 2017 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of three [[Robinson R66]] helicopters participating in the “Searching for the Two Captains” expedition was flying along the route from [[Amderma Airport]] to the landing site on [[Bely Island]] in the Kara Sea. While they were approaching the island, thick, low cloud cover formed. The crew of the formation leader decided to descend into the clouds to determine their lower boundary and see if it was possible to land. While carrying out this mission, the helicopter crashed to the ground.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The IAC board’s report it states that “the most probable cause of the R66 RA-06233 helicopter’s crash was the PIC’s loss of flight altitude control during the attempt to establish visual contact with terrain under weather conditions that did not comply with VFR and the pilot’s experience level, which led to the aircraft’s collision with the icy surface of the Kara Sea”.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/fa1/report_ra-06233.pdf |title= ОКОНЧАТЕЛЬНЫЙ ОТЧЁТ ПО РЕЗУЛЬТАТАМ РАССЛЕДОВАНИЯ АВИАЦИОННОГО ПРОИСШЕСТВИЯ |publisher= МЕЖГОСУДАРСТВЕННЫЙ АВИАЦИОННЫЙ КОМИТЕТ |date= 18 April 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170420213245/http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/fa1/report_ra-06233.pdf |archivedate= 20 April 2017 |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOASS Okeanos Explorer Gulf of Mexico 2017 Expedition '''was the first of three expeditions on the [[NOAAS Okeanos Explorer]] intended to increase the understanding of the deep-sea environment in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Gulf of Mexico 2017 was a 23-day [[telepresence]]-enabled expedition focused on acquiring data on priority exploration areas identified by ocean management and scientific communities. The goal of the expedition was to use remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives and seafloor mapping operations to increase the understanding of the deep-sea ecosystems in these areas to support management decisions. Many of the areas had no (or low quality) [[sonar]] data, these areas were top priority for high-resolution [[bathymetry]] collection. The expedition established a baseline of information in the region to catalyze further exploration, research, and management activities.&lt;ref name=GOM2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Scientists Explore Deep, Dark Secrets of the Gulf of Mexico |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2018/05/14/scientists-explore-deep-dark-secrets-of-the-gulf-of-mexico|publisher=PEW|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through discussions and information stemming from [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] and other stakeholders, priority areas of exploration had been identified. The expedition explored deep [[Deep-water coral|coral]] and [[sponge]] communities, bottom fish habitats, [[seamount|seamounts]], [[submarine canyon|undersea canyons]], [[shipwreck]]s, and a variety of [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] habitats including [[Cold seep|cold seeps]], [[mud volcano|mud volcanoes]] and [[brine pool|brine pools]]. Using NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer’s unique capabilities, scientists and other audiences onshore were provided with real-time video footage from deep-water areas in important, yet largely unknown, U.S. waters.&lt;ref name=GOM2017/&gt;

==ROV Dives==
[[Image:GOM2017leptoFish.jpg|left|thumb|Fish experts on the global midwater team were blown away by the appearance of this fish from the genus ''[[Leptochilichthys]]''. The observation placed this fish at a shallow depth of 900 meters, when typical observations place this fish squarely in the [[Bathyal zone|bathypelagic zone]] at ~2,000 meters.&lt;ref name=BIGOM2017&gt;{{cite web|title = Scientists spent a month exploring the Gulf of Mexico's deep sea habitats — and the images they brought back are astonishing|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/deep-sea-creatures-from-the-gulf-of-mexico-2018-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
17 ROV dives were conducted from 300 to 2,321 [[metre|meters]] of depth to explore the diversity and distribution of deep-sea habitats and associated marine communities in the Gulf of Mexico basin. There were also four midwater exploration dives conducted at depths of 300 to 900 meters to investigate the diversity and abundance of the largely unknown [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] [[fauna]]. During these dives hundreds of different species of animals were observed including several potential new species. Several significant [[Geographic range limit|range extensions]] were observed and several organisms were seen alive for the first time. 105 biological samples (32 primary and 73 associated and commensal taxa) were collected several of which came from unknown species. As well as biological samples eight rock samples and one sediment sample were collected for use in [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] composition analysis and age dating. Several dives gathered geological data to better understand the geological composition and origin of the [[Florida Platform|Florida Escarpment]].&lt;ref name=GOM2017/&gt;

At least 20 previously unknown [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] habitats were discovered including [[Cold seep|methane seeps]] (some with visible [[Clathrate hydrate|methane hydrate]]), [[Petroleum seep|asphalt seeps]], and [[Brine pool|brine rivers]].Most of these had associated chemosynthetic communities that included large [[Siboglinidae|siboglinid tubeworm]] bushes and extensive [[mussel]] beds. There were also many areas of reduced sediments and [[Microbial mat|bacterial mats]]. Asphaltic and [[Authigenesis|authigenic carbonate]] outcrops hosting large [[Filter feeder|filter-feeding]] communities were also observed in geologically active areas.&lt;ref name=GOM2017/&gt;

A number of the ROV dives surveyed Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) proposed by the [[U.S. Regional Fishery Management Councils|Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council]]. These surveys collected baseline information for management of the area. Six proposed expansions zones to the [[Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary|Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary]] were explored and surveyed to gather information on future expansion of the sanctuary. Many high-diversity and density coral and sponge communities were discovered in these areas including a ''[[Madrepora oculata]]''-dominated coral garden.&lt;ref name=GOM2017/&gt;

===Gas Hydrate===

[[Image:Map_of_Horn_Dome.jpg|left|thumb|Dive 17 explored the northwest part of Horn Dome, a salt-cored bathymetric high that had been the focus of several previous remotely operated vehicle dives.]]
[[Image:Methane_Hydrate_Stability.jpg|left|thumb|Methane hydrate is stable to the left of the purple curve on this temperature-depth plot. Each 100-meter increase in water depth corresponds to a pressure increase of ~10 [[Pascal (unit)|megapascals]]. ]]

During dive 17 the ROV ''[[Deep Discoverer]]'' encountered large [[gas]] hydrate mounds and active gas seeps on the sea floor on the northwestern edge of a salt-cored Horn Dome, 87 kilometers from the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Louisiana]].  The low relief seafloor mounds discovered mantled gas hydrate deposits interspersed with [[carbonate|carbonates]]. Gas hydrate forms when low [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] gas (usually [[methane]]) combines with water and freezes to form "[[Methane clathrate|methane ice]]" under low temperature and moderate pressure conditions&lt;ref name=Hydrates&gt;{{cite web|title = What are gas hydrates? |url=https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-gas-hydrates?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products|publisher=USGS|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the ample supply of gas, coupled with appropriate pressure and temperature conditions, cause gas hydrate to form on or just beneath the seafloor. The blue curve on the graph shows the ocean temperatures measured by the conductivity-temperature-depth ([[CTD (instrument)|CTD]]) sensor on the Deep Discoverer ROV during Dive 17 at Horn Dome. The [[sediment]] temperatures are estimated based on a study that examined nearby well data. Gas hydrate is stable at the seafloor, in the shallow sediments, and from the seafloor to ~600 meters depth in the water column. Such conditions are typical for the deep ocean, but the Gulf of Mexico leaks such large volumes of gas that near-seafloor gas hydrate is more common there than in most locations.&lt;ref name=Gas2017&gt;{{cite web|title = Ice Worms and Gas Hydrate-Encased Bubble Tubes|url=https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1711/logs/dec20/welcome.html|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists observed dense orange-stained gas hydrate exposed in several mounds. In some places, the same outcrop had both massive gas hydrate that had probably formed below the seafloor and clear, porous gas hydrate made up of hydrate-encased bubbles. Video recording of methane emissions adjacent to one of the massive hydrate deposits provided insights into seafloor gas dynamics. For example, rapid gas emissions produced bubbles, with some bubbles emerging from clear tubes formed from gas hydrate. Slow gas emissions led to the formation of hydrate-coated gas droplets that initially blocked the gas conduit until the pressure inside the droplet increased, causing the droplet to detach. Similar phenomena were filmed on bare seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico during a [[NOAAS Okeanos Explorer Gulf of Mexico 2014 Expedition|2014 Okeanos Explorer expedition]].&lt;ref name=Gas2017/&gt;

[[Image:IceWormsGOM2017.jpg|thumb|Pink “ice worms” are visible beneath the overhang in the center left part of this photo.]] 
The only macrofauna spotted living directly on methane hydrate outcrops were ice worms, ''[[Hesiocaeca methanicola]]''. The ice worms had burrowed into the hydrate, creating small depressions. The worms graze on bacteria growing on the hydrate.Ice worms were also seen in some of the burrows in the surrounding gas hydrate, which appears orange due to impurities. In the image to the right active methane emissions occur from beneath the ledge, through [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|conduits]] at the base of the inverted droplets attached to the sediment and through a bubble tube at the right of the image. Both the bubble tubes and the inverted droplets are encased in clear gas hydrate.&lt;ref name=Gas2017/&gt;

'''''Neolamarckia cadamba''''', with English [[common name]]s '''burflower-tree''', '''laran''', and '''Leichhardt pine''',&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{citation |url=https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/taxonomydetail.aspx?id=410705 |title=USDA GRIN Taxonomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called '''kadam'''&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; locally, is an [[evergreen]], tropical tree native to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The genus name honours French naturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. It has scented orange flowers in dense globe-shaped clusters. The flowers are used in perfumes. The tree is grown as an [[ornamental plant]] and for timber and paper-making. Kadam features in [[Indian religions]] and mythologies.

==Description==
A fully mature kadam tree can reach up to {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. It is a large tree with a broad crown and straight cylindrical bole. It is quick growing, with broad spreading branches and grows rapidly in the first 6–8 years. The trunk has a diameter of 100–160&amp;nbsp;cm, but typically less than that. Leaves are {{convert|13|-|32|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Flowering usually begins when the tree is 4–5 years old. Kadam [[flower]]s are sweetly fragrant, red to orange in colour, occurring in dense, globular heads of approximately {{convert|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter. The fruit of ''N. cadamba'' occur in small, fleshy capsules packed closely together to form a fleshy yellow-orange infructescence containing approximately 8000 seeds. On maturing, the fruit splits apart, releasing the seeds, which are then dispersed by wind or rain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agricultureinformation.com/forums/questions-answers/11926-anthocephalus-kadamba.html.- Horticulture/Suryanarmada, Agriculture Arbitration Consultant, Chennai, India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/vibhaskumar/plant_ism1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:56:54 - The Environmental Information System(ENVIS), Ministry of Environment and Forests - Centre of Mining environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Stamens 5, inserted on the corolla tube, filaments short, anthers basifixed. Ovary inferior, [[locule|bi-locular]], sometimes 4-locular in the upper part, style exserted and a spindle-shaped stigma.
* Fruitlets numerous with their upper parts containing 4 hollow or solid structures. Seed trigonal or irregularly shaped.
* The [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] is white with a light yellow tinge becoming creamy yellow on exposure and is not clearly differentiated from the heartwood.

==Ecology==

It is an introduced species in [[Puerto Rico]] at [[Toro Negro State Forest]].&lt;ref name="drna.gobierno.pr"&gt;[http://www.drna.gobierno.pr/biblioteca/publicaciones/hojas-de-nuestro-ambiente/30-Toro%20Negro%20ultimo.pdf ''Bosques de Puerto Rico: Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807061645/http://www.drna.gobierno.pr/biblioteca/publicaciones/hojas-de-nuestro-ambiente/30-Toro%20Negro%20ultimo.pdf |date=2015-08-07 }} Hojas de Nuestro Ambiente. July 2008. [Publication/Issue: P-030] Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. Retrieved 13 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[larvae]] of the commander (''[[Moduza procris]]''), a [[Nymphalidae|brush-footed butterfly]], consume this species. The flowers attract pollinators.

==Taxonomy==

The [[botanical name]] of this species has been the subject of a long [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] debate, beginning in the 1930s. The problem arose because scientific names are based on [[Type (biology)|type specimens]]. In 1785 [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] described a specimen under the name ''Cephalanthus chinensis'', stating that it came from [[Madagascar]].  In 1830, [[Achille Richard]] created the name ''Anthocephalus indicus'', stating that the species came from Asia and that his description was based on the same specimen as Lamarck's ''Cephalanthus chinensis''.&lt;ref name=Raza02/&gt; (Under the rules of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], Richard should have used the name ''A.&amp;nbsp;chinensis'' rather than ''A.&amp;nbsp;indicus'', as he should not have changed the specific epithet.)

The issue is whether Richard was indeed using the same specimen as Lamarck; the geographical origin is said to be different, and the descriptions do not match; for example in Lamarck's ''Cephalanthus chinensis'' the [[inflorescence]]s are [[Axillary bud|axillary]] whereas in Richard's ''Anthocephalus'' they are terminal. If specimens were the same, then ''Anthocephalus'' is a synonym of the Madagascan ''Cephalanthus'' and cannot be a generic name for the Asian kadam tree. If they were different (in spite of Richard's claim that they were the same) then ''Anthocephalus'' could be a generic name for the kadam tree. Based on the latter view, the name ''Anthocephalus chinensis'' has been widely used for the kadam tree.&lt;ref name=Raza02&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Razafimandimbison |first=Sylvain G. |year=2002 |title=A Systematic Revision of ''Breonia'' (Rubiaceae-Naucleeae) |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=1–37 |doi=10.2307/3298655 |ref=harv|jstor=3298655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current view taken by most taxonomic sources is that Richard's ''Anthocephalus indicus'' or ''Anthocephalus chinensis''  is a synonym of ''Cephalanthus chinensis'' (now transferred to the genus ''[[Breonia]]'' as ''[[Breonia chinensis]]'' &lt;small&gt;(Lam.) Capuron&lt;/small&gt;), and that the widespread use of ''Anthocephalus chinensis'' for the kadam tree is an error. (This erroneous sense of the scientific name is shown by writing ''A.&amp;nbsp;chinensis'' auct., where "auct." is an abbreviation of the Latin for "of authors", i.e. rather than of the correct authority.)&lt;ref name=WCSP_133819/&gt;&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raza02/&gt;

Given that Richard's name for the kadam tree is incorrect, the earliest name is [[William Roxburgh]]'s 1824 ''Nauclea cadamba''. In 1984, [[Jean Marie Bosser]] created the new generic name ''Neolamarckia'', honouring Lamarck, for the Asian genus which matched Richard's description of his ''Anthocephalus'', transferring ''Nauclea cadamba'' as ''Neolamarckia cadamba'' &lt;small&gt;(Roxb.) Bosser&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Raza02/&gt; However, not all botanical sources have accepted this taxonomic analysis and the name ''Anthocephalus'' is still in use for the Asian genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ridsdale |first=C. |year=1998 |chapter=Rubiaceae |pages=158–159 |editor-last=Dassanayke |editor-first=M.D. |title=A Revised Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon |publisher=A.A. Balkema |location=Rotterdam }} Cited in {{Harvtxt|Razafimandimbison|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The fruit and inflorescences are reportedly edible by humans. The fresh leaves are fed to cattle. 
''N. lamarckia'' is grown as an [[Ornamental plant|ornamental]], and for low-grade timber and paper. The timber is used for plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and furniture components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and [[compressive strength]]. The wood has a density of 290–560&amp;nbsp;kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is easy to work, with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. The timber air dries rapidly with little or no degrade. Kadamba wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.

Kadamba is one of the most frequently planted trees in the tropics. The tree is grown along avenues, roadsides and villages for shade. Kadamba are suitable for reforestation programs. It sheds large amounts of leaf and non-leaf litter which on decomposition improves some physical and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of soil under its canopy. This reflects an increase in the level of soil organic carbon, [[cation-exchange capacity]], available plant nutrients and exchangeable bases.

A yellow dye is obtained from the root bark. Kadamba flowers are an important raw material in the production of ‘attar’, which is Indian perfume with [[sandalwood]] (''Santalum'' spp.) base in which one of the essences is absorbed through hydro-distillation.  An extract of the leaves serves as a mouth gargle.

The leaf extract has recently been used to produce [[silver nanoparticles]] for [[surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ankamwar|first1=Balaprasad|last2=Sur|first2=Ujjal Kumar|last3=Das|first3=Pulak|title=SERS study of bacteria using biosynthesized silver nanoparticles as the SERS substrate|journal=Anal.

===Symbolism===
The kadamba flower was the emblem of [[Athmallik State]], one of the [[princely state]]s of [[India]] during the period of the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="BDG"&gt;L. E. B. Cobden-Ramsay, ''Feudatory States of Orissa: Bengal District Gazetteers'', p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

The kadamba lends its name to the [[Kadamba Dynasty]] that ruled from Banavasi in what is now the state of [[Karnataka]] from 345 CE to 525 CE, as per Talagunda inscription of c.450 CE.&lt;ref name="tree"&gt;George M. Moraes (1931), ''The Kadamba Kula, A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka'', Asian Educational Services, 1990, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The kadamba tree was considered a [[holy tree]] by the Kadamba dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/kadamba.htm |title=Kamat's Potpourri: The Deccan Plateau: The Kadambas |publisher=Kamat.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition the 27 [[nakshatra]]s, constituting 12 [[House (astrology)|Houses]] (Rasis) and nine [[planet]]s, are specifically represented precisely by 27 trees —one for each star. The kadamba tree is said to represent [[Shatabhisha]], roughly corresponding to [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chennaionline.com/astro/articles/yourstar.asp|title=Web Page Under Construction|author=|date=|website=chennaionline.com|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadamba is mentioned in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''. In [[North India]], it is associated with [[Krishna]] while in the south it is known as "[[Parvati]]’s tree". [[Radha]] and Krishna are supposed to have conducted their love play in the hospitable and sweet-scented shade of the kadamba tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iecolumnists.expressindia.comfull_column.php?content_id=71745. Kadamba vriksh]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Sangam period]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Murugan]] of Tirupparankundram Hill of [[Madurai]] was referred to as a centre of [[pantheism|nature worship]]. He was in the form of a spear under a kadamba tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ignca.nic.in/cd_08009.htm -Sacred Groves and Sacred Trees of Uttara Kannada]&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode from the life of Krishna narrates of when he stole the garments of [[gopi]]s when they were bathing in a pond near [[Vrindavan]]. [[Varuna]], the sea-god, had forbidden nude bathing in rivers, ponds and other public places, but gopis often resorted to it. One day, to teach them a lesson, Krishna reached the bank of the pond where they were taking a bath and took away their garments and spread them on the branches of nearby kadamba tree. He himself climbed the tree and hid there behind a branch. After the gopis had bathed, they looked for their garments but found them missing. Suddenly their attention was drawn to the nearby kadamba tree by the stirring of its branches. When they looked up, they saw Krishna hiding there and their garments scattered all over the branches of the tree. Krishna insisted that they come out naked to receive their garments. This episode is portrayed in song, story, painting and artifacts, in the backdrop of the kadamba tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/DC90/|title=Vastra-harana|author=|date=|website=Exotic India|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karam-Kadamba is a popular harvest festival, celebrated on the eleventh lunar day of the month [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]]. A twig of the tree is brought and worshipped in the courtyard of the house. Later in the day, young ears of grain are distributed among friends and relatives. This festive custom has been adopted by the Tulu people. [[Onam]] ([[Kerala]]) and [[Huttari]] ([[Kodagu]]) are regional variants of this festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tulu-research.blogspot.com/2007_12_01_archive.html|title=TuLu  Research &amp; Studies|author=|date=|website=tulu-research.blogspot.com|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kadambotsava'' ("The festival of Kadamba") is also the festival that is celebrated every year by the [[Government of Karnataka]] in honor of the Kadamba kingdom, the first ruling Kingdom of Karnataka, at [[Banavasi]], as it was here that the Kadamba kings organised the spring festival every year.&lt;ref name="kadambotsava"&gt;''Kadambotsava'' {{cite news|title=Kadambotsava in Banavasi |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/20/stories/2006012003990300.htm|author=Staff Correspondent|publisher=The Hindu|work=The Hindu, Friday, January 20, 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-28|location=Chennai, India|date=2006-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kadamba tree is also associated with a [[tree deity]] called Kadambariyamman.&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2007/06/02/stories/2007060250410100.htm |publisher=The Hindu |title=Nature's unsung heroes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm|title=Trees|author=|date=|website=www.khandro.net|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kadamba, which is considered the ''sthalavruksham'' ("tree of the place") of the city that is otherwise known as Kadambavanam (kadamba forest) and is present in [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]].&lt;ref name=TheHindu/&gt; A withered relic of the kadamba is also preserved there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/hindu-sadhanas/176782-tripura-sundari-ashtakam.html|title=Tripura Sundari Ashtakam|author=|date=|website=IndiaDivine.org|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows''' is a [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] of the elevations of the northwestern [[Himalaya]] of  [[China]], [[India]], and [[Pakistan]].

==Setting==
Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows cover {{convert|49400|sqkm|mi2}} at elevations between {{convert|3300|and|3600|m|ft}} in the northwestern Himalayas. They are found in [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in northwestern India and northern Pakistan, particularly in [[Kashmir]].

==Flora==
This ecoregion's flora is composed mostly of [[krummholz]] and [[herbaceous plant]]s. 

Various [[rhododendron]]s live in the scrub habitat near timberline, as do [[juniper]]s and [[birch]]es. Although several species of rhododendron are recorded in this ecoregion, they are represented by a lesser greater diversity than in the eastern Himalaya, where 60 species are reported in the [[Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]].

[[Genera]] of herbaceous plants include ''[[Doronicum]], [[Delphinium]], [[Gentiana]], [[Meconopsis]], [[Pedicularis]], [[Anemone]], [[Aster (genus)|Aster]], [[Polygonum]], [[Primula]]'', and ''[[Mertensia]]''. [[Scree]] habitats include ''[[Caragana]], [[Saxifraga]], [[Draba]]'', and ''[[Gypsophila]]''.

==Fauna==
Eighty mammals species are reported in this ecoregion. It contains prime habitat for the [[Uncia uncia|snow leopard]] and the [[Canis lupus chanco|Tibetan wolf]]. Other mammals include the [[Capra ibex|ibex]], [[Capra falconeri|markhor]], [[Pseudois nayaur|blue sheep]], [[Hemitragus jemlahicus|tahr]], and [[Marmota himalayana|Himalayan marmot]].

There are 172 bird species in this ecoregion. Important birds include the [[Gypaetus barbatus|lammergeier]], [[Aquila chrysaetos|golden eagle]], [[Gyps himalayensis|Himalayan griffon vulture]], [[Lerwa lerwa|snow partridge]], [[Tetraogallus tibetanus|Tibetan snowcock]], and [[Tetraogallus himalayensis|Himalayan snowcock]].

There are 27 known amphibian species. Some of these species include [[Rhacophorus bipunctatus]], [[Scutiger mammatus]], [[Xenophrys pachyproctus]], and [[Theloderma asperum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Species : Search : Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows|url=http://globalspecies.org/indices/advanced/_/V/_/1429/1/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/0/0/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/_/_/0/page:1|website=globalspecies.org|publisher=Myers Enterprises II|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 24 known reptilian species. Some of these species include [[Trachischium tenuiceps|yellowbelly worm-eating snake]], [[Sinonatrix percarinata|eastern water snake]], [[Ophiophagus hannah|king cobra]], and [[Lycodon laoensis|Laotian wolf snake]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Species : Search : Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows|url=http://globalspecies.org/indices/advanced/_/V/_/1429/1/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/0/0/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/_/_/0/page:7|website=globalspecies.org|publisher=Myers Enterprises II|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
This ecoregion is well preserved because of high elevation, difficult climate, and lack of trees. Protected areas include:
*[[Pin Valley National Park]]
*[[Great Himalayan National Park]]
*[[Kishtwar National Park]]

'''''Nyctanthes arbor-tristis''''', the  '''night-flowering jasmine''' or '''parijat''', is a species of ''[[Nyctanthes]]'' native to [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=WCSP&gt;[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=354899 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, ''Nyctanthes arbor-tristis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grin&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fop&gt;Flora of Pakistan: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=5&amp;taxon_id=200017801 ''Nyctanthes arbor-tristis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wafc&gt;AgroForestry Tree Database: [http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/sea/Products/AFDbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=18063 ''Nyctanthes arbor-tristis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nyctanthes arbor-tristis'' is a [[shrub]] or a small [[tree]] growing to {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} tall, with flaky grey bark. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, simple, {{convert|6–12|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2–6.5|cm|abbr=on}} broad, with an entire margin. The [[flower]]s are fragrant, with a five- to eight-lobed white [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] with an orange-red centre; they are produced in clusters of two to seven together, with individual flowers opening at dusk and finishing at dawn. The [[fruit]] is a flat brown heart-shaped to round [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, with two sections each containing a single [[seed]].&lt;ref name=fop/&gt;&lt;ref name=wafc/&gt;

==Names and symbolism==
[[File:Nyctanthes arbor-tristis fruit, Burdwan, West Bengal, India 25 10 2012.jpg|right|thumb|Fruit in [[Bardhaman]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]]]
[[File:Saplings of coral jasmine.jpg|thumb|Saplings of coral jasmine tree, udumalpet, Tamilnadu, India]]
The tree is sometimes called the "tree of sorrow", because the flowers lose their brightness during daytime; the scientific name ''arbor-tristis'' also means "sad tree". The flowers can be used as a source of yellow [[dye]] for clothing. The flower is called Gangaseuli and some where Jharaa sephali in [[Odisha]], India. The flower is the official flower of the state of [[West Bengal]], India, which is also known as Parijat and Siuli in local [[West Bengal]] region in India, and for [[Kanchanaburi Province]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nyctanthes arbor-tristis'' (sometimes incorrectly cited as ''Nyctanthes arbortristis'' or ''Nyctanthes arbor tristis'') is commonly known as night-flowering jasmine or coral jasmine.

==Significance in Hinduism==
[[File:Krishna Uproots the Parijata Tree, Folio from a Bhagavata Purana (Ancient Stories of the Lord) LACMA M.72.1.26.jpg|right|thumb|[[Krishna]] Uproots the Parijata Tree, manuscript from a Bhagavata [[Purana]].]]
''Parijat'' (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis), appears in several [[Hindu]] religious stories and is often related to the [[Kalpavriksha]]. In one story, which appears in [[Bhagavata Purana]], the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Vishnu Purana]], ''parijat'' appeared as the result of the [[Samudra manthan]] ([[Churning of the Milky Ocean]]) and [[Lord Krishna]] battled with [[Indra]] to win ''parijat''. Further on, his wife [[Satyabhama]] demanded the tree be planted in the backyard of her palace. It so happened that in spite of having the tree in her backyard, the flowers used to fall in the adjacent backyard of the other queen [[Rukmini]], who was favourite of [[Lord Krishna]], because of her superior devotion and humility.

'''Physical science''' is a branch of [[natural science]] that studies [[abiotic component|non-living]] systems, in contrast to [[life science]]. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together called the "physical sciences".

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Definition ==

Physical science can be described as all of the following:
* A branch of [[outline of science|science]]  (a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[Outline of knowledge|knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]]).&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-511229-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |title=science |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science |accessdate=2011-10-16 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc |quote='''3 a:''' knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method '''b:''' such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned with the physical world and its phenomena }}&lt;!--{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=3}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
** A branch of [[Outline of natural science|natural science]] – natural science is a major branch of [[science]] that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on [[empirical evidence]]. In natural science, [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: [[life science]] (for example biology) and [[physical science]]. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

== Branches of physical science ==
* [[Outline of physics|Physics]] – natural and physical science that involves the study of [[matter]]&lt;!--
   --&gt;&lt;ref name="feynmanleightonsands1963-atomic"&gt;At the start of ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', [[Richard Feynman]] offers the [[Atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]] as the single most prolific scientific concept: "If, in some cataclysm, all [] scientific knowledge were to be destroyed [save] one sentence&amp;nbsp;[...] what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is&amp;nbsp;[...] that ''all things are made up of atoms&amp;nbsp;– little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another''&amp;nbsp;..." {{harv|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=I-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--            --&gt;and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.&lt;!--

   --&gt;{{efn|The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them.

==General principles of the physical sciences==
* [[Principle]] – law or rule that has to be, or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.

           --&gt;  Physics is one of the "[[fundamental science]]s" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:

*Describing the nature, measuring and quantifying of bodies and their motion, dynamics etc.
**Newton's laws of motion
**Mass, force and weight

*The life and characteristics of [[stars]] and [[galaxies]]
*Origins of the universe. Physical science uses the [[Big Bang]] theory as the commonly accepted scientific theory of the origin of the universe.
*A [[heliocentric]] Solar System. Ancient cultures saw the Earth as the centre of the Solar System or universe (geocentrism). In the 16th century, Nicolaus [[Copernicus]] advanced the ideas of heliocentrism, recognizing the Sun as the centre of the Solar System.
*The structure of [[solar system]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and [[meteor]]s

{{Expand Swedish|Bergart|date=June 2018}}
'''Rock''' or '''stone''' is a natural substance, a solid [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] of one or more [[mineral]]s or [[mineraloid]]s. For example, [[granite]], a common rock, is a combination of the minerals [[quartz]], [[feldspar]] and [[biotite]]. The Earth's outer solid layer, the [[lithosphere]], is made of rock.

Rock has been used by humankind throughout history. The minerals and metals in rocks have been essential to human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://earth.rice.edu/mtpe/geo/geosphere/topics/rocks_a.html | title=Rocks and classifications | work=Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara | accessdate=11 November 2012 | author=Roberts, Dar | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031010819/http://earth.rice.edu/mtpe/geo/geosphere/topics/rocks_a.html | archivedate=31 October 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major groups of rocks are defined: [[Igneous rock|igneous]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]]. The scientific study of rocks is called [[petrology]], which is an essential component of geology.

==Classification==
{{See also|Formation of rocks}}
[[File:DirkvdM rocks.jpg|right|thumb|Rock [[outcrop]] along a mountain creek near [[Orosí]], [[Costa Rica]].]]
Rocks are composed of grains of minerals, which are [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous solids]] formed from a [[chemical compound]] arranged in an orderly manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cipriani |first1=Nicola |title=The encyclopedia of rocks and minerals |date=1996 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |location=New York |isbn=978-0760702918}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2018}} The [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] minerals forming the rock are held together by [[chemical bond]]s. The types and abundance of minerals in a rock are determined by the manner in which it was formed.

Many rocks contain [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); a compound of [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]] that forms 74.3% of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. This material forms [[crystal]]s with other compounds in the rock. The proportion of silica in rocks and minerals is a major factor in determining their names and properties.&lt;ref name="Wilson1995"/&gt;

Rocks are classified according to characteristics such as mineral and chemical composition, [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], [[Texture (geology)|texture]] of the constituent particles, and [[Particle size (grain size)|particle size]]. These physical properties are the result of the processes that formed the rocks.&lt;ref name=Blatt/&gt; Over the course of time, rocks can transform from one type into another, as described by a geological model called the [[rock cycle]]. This transformation produces three general classes of rock: [[igneous rock|igneous]], [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]].

Those three classes are subdivided into many groups. There are, however, no hard-and-fast boundaries between allied rocks. By increase or decrease in the proportions of their minerals, they pass through gradations from one to the other; the distinctive structures of one kind of rock may thus be traced gradually merging into those of another. Hence the definitions adopted in rock names simply correspond to selected points in a continuously graduated series.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igneous rock===
{{Main|Igneous rock}}
[[File:GabbroRockCreek1.jpg|thumb|Sample of igneous [[gabbro]]]]
[[Igneous rock]] (derived from the [[Latin]] word ''igneus,'' meaning ''of fire,'' from ''ignis'' meaning ''fire)'' is formed through the cooling and [[freezing|solidification]] of [[magma]] or [[lava]]. This magma may be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a [[planet]]'s [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] or [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Typically, the melting of rocks is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition.

Igneous rocks are divided into two main categories:

* [[Plutonic]] or [[Intrusion|intrusive]] rocks result when magma cools and [[crystallization|crystallizes]] slowly within the [[Earth]]'s crust. A common example of this type is [[granite]].
* Volcanic or [[extrusive (geology)|extrusive]] rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as [[lava]] or ''fragmental ejecta'', forming minerals such as [[pumice]] or [[basalt]].&lt;ref name=Blatt&gt;{{cite book |last=Blatt |first=Harvey |first2=Robert J. |last2=Tracy |date=1996 |title=Petrology |location= |publisher=W. H. Freeman |edition=2nd |isbn=0-7167-2438-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical abundance and the rate of cooling of magma typically forms a sequence known as [[Bowen's reaction series]]. Most major igneous rocks are found along this scale.&lt;ref name="Wilson1995"/&gt;

About 64.7% of the Earth's crust by volume consists of igneous rocks, making it the most plentiful category. Of these, 66% are basalts and [[gabbro]]s, 16% are granite, and 17% [[granodiorite]]s and [[diorite]]s. Only 0.6% are [[syenite]]s and 0.3% [[peridotite]]s and [[dunite]]s. The oceanic crust is 99% basalt, which is an igneous rock of [[mafic]] composition. Granites and similar rocks, known as meta-granitoids, form much of the continental crust.&lt;ref name="BucherGrapes2011"/&gt; Over 700 types of igneous rocks have been described, most of them having formed beneath the surface of [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]]. These have diverse properties, depending on their composition and the temperature and pressure conditions in which they were formed.

===Sedimentary rock===
{{Main|Sedimentary rock}}
[[File:SandstoneUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Sedimentary [[sandstone]] with [[iron oxide]] bands]]
[[Sedimentary rock]]s are formed at the earth's surface by the accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier rocks, minerals, and organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDQLAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=sedimentary+rock+formed+at+surface+by+the+accumulation+and+cementation+of+fragments+of+earlier+rocks,+minerals,+and+organisms&amp;dq=sedimentary+rock+formed+at+surface+by+the+accumulation+and+cementation+of+fragments+of+earlier+rocks,+minerals,+and+organisms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU_a-i1f_TAhUP3WMKHaEICFgQ6AEIKDAB|title=Principles of Geology|last=Gilluly|first=James|date=1959|publisher=W.H. Freeman|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107151743/https://books.google.com/books?id=NDQLAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=sedimentary+rock+formed+at+surface+by+the+accumulation+and+cementation+of+fragments+of+earlier+rocks,+minerals,+and+organisms&amp;dq=sedimentary+rock+formed+at+surface+by+the+accumulation+and+cementation+of+fragments+of+earlier+rocks,+minerals,+and+organisms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU_a-i1f_TAhUP3WMKHaEICFgQ6AEIKDAB|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water ([[sedimentation]]). This process causes [[clastic]] [[sediment]]s (pieces of rock) or [[organic matter|organic]] particles ([[detritus]]) to settle and accumulate, or for minerals to chemically [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] ([[evaporite]]) from a [[solution]]. The particulate matter then undergoes compaction and [[cementation (geology)|cementation]] at moderate temperatures and pressures ([[diagenesis]]).

Before being deposited, sediments are formed by [[weathering]] of earlier rocks by [[erosion]] in a source area and then transported to the place of deposition by [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[Mass wasting|mass movement]] or [[glacier]]s (agents of [[denudation]]). Mud rocks comprise 65% ([[mudstone]], [[shale]] and [[siltstone]]); [[sandstone]]s 20 to 25% and [[carbonate rock]]s 10 to 15% ([[limestone]] and [[dolostone]]).&lt;ref name=Blatt /&gt; About 7.9% of the crust by volume is composed of sedimentary rocks, with 82% of those being shales, while the remainder consists of limestone (6%), sandstone and [[arkose]]s (12%).&lt;ref name="BucherGrapes2011"/&gt; Sedimentary rocks often contain [[fossil]]s. Sedimentary rocks form under the influence of gravity and typically are deposited in horizontal or near horizontal layers or [[strata]] and may be referred to as stratified rocks. A small fraction of sedimentary rocks deposited on steep slopes will show cross bedding where one layer stops abruptly along an interface where another layer eroded the first as it was laid atop the first.

===Metamorphic rock===
{{Main|Metamorphic rock}}

[[File:Skagit-gneiss-Cascades.jpg|thumb|Metamorphic banded [[gneiss]]]]
[[Metamorphic rock]]s are formed by subjecting any rock type—[[sedimentary rock]], [[igneous rock]] or another older metamorphic rock—to different [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] conditions than those in which the original rock was formed. This process is called [[metamorphism]], meaning to "change in form". The result is a profound change in physical properties and chemistry of the stone. The original rock, known as the [[protolith]], transforms into other mineral types or other forms of the same minerals, by [[Recrystallization (geology)|recrystallization]].&lt;ref name=Blatt /&gt; The temperatures and pressures required for this process are always higher than those found at the Earth's surface: temperatures greater than 150 to 200&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures of 1500&amp;nbsp;bars.&lt;ref&gt;Blatt, Harvey and Robert J. Tracy, ''Petrology'', W.H.Freeman, 2nd ed., 1996, p.355 {{ISBN|0-7167-2438-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metamorphic rocks compose 27.4% of the crust by volume.&lt;ref name="BucherGrapes2011"/&gt;

The three major classes of metamorphic rock are based upon the formation mechanism. An intrusion of magma that heats the surrounding rock causes contact metamorphism—a temperature-dominated transformation. Pressure metamorphism occurs when sediments are buried deep under the ground; pressure is dominant, and temperature plays a smaller role. This is termed burial metamorphism, and it can result in rocks such as [[jade]]. Where both heat and pressure play a role, the mechanism is termed regional metamorphism. This is typically found in mountain-building regions.&lt;ref name="Wilson1995"/&gt;

Depending on the structure, metamorphic rocks are divided into two general categories. Those that possess a texture are referred to as [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]]; the remainders are termed non-foliated. The name of the rock is then determined based on the types of minerals present. [[Schist]]s are foliated rocks that are primarily composed of [[Lamella (materials)|lamellar minerals]] such as [[mica]]s. A [[gneiss]] has visible bands of differing [[lightness]], with a common example being the granite gneiss. Other varieties of foliated rock include [[slate]]s, [[phyllite]]s, and [[mylonite]]. Familiar examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks include [[marble]], [[soapstone]], and [[Serpentine group|serpentine]]. This branch contains [[quartzite]]—a metamorphosed form of [[sandstone]]—and [[hornfels]].&lt;ref name="Wilson1995"/&gt;

==Human use==

[[File:Hochbeet aus Naturstein.jpg|thumb|[[Raised-bed gardening|Raised garden bed]] with natural stones]]
The use of rocks has had a huge impact on the cultural and technological development of the human race. Rocks have been used by humans and other [[hominids]] for at least [[paleolithic|2.5&amp;nbsp;million years]].&lt;ref&gt;William Haviland, Dana Walrath, Harald Prins, Bunny McBride, ''Evolution and Prehistory: The Human Challenge'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithic technology]] marks some of the oldest and continuously used technologies. The [[mining]] of rocks for their [[metal]] [[ore]] content has been one of the most important factors of human advancement, which has progressed at different rates in different places in part because of the kind of metals available from the rocks of a region.

===Mining===
{{Main|Mining}}

Mining is the extraction of [[value (economics)|valuable]] [[mineral]]s or other [[geology|geological]] materials from the earth, from an [[ore]] body, [[vein (geology)|vein]] or ([[coal mining|coal]]) seam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Shekhar |last1=Gajul |title=Underground Mining Equipment Market 2017 Global Key Players, Share, Challenges, Industry Size, Growth Opportunities &amp; Forecast To 2021 |url=https://www.journalistbook.com/2018/07/28/underground-mining-equipment-market-2017-global-key-players-share-challenges-industry-size-growth-opportunities-forecast-to-2021/ |newspaper=Journalist Book |date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term also includes the removal of soil. Materials recovered by mining include [[base metals]], [[precious metals]], [[iron]], [[uranium]], [[coal]], [[diamond]]s, [[limestone]], [[oil shale]], [[Sodium chloride|rock salt]] and [[potash]]. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through [[agriculture|agricultural]] processes, or created [[Chemical synthesis|artificially]] in a [[laboratory]] or [[factory]]. Mining in a wider sense comprises extraction of any [[resource]] (e.g. [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[salt]] or even [[water]]) from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Botin|editor1-first=J.A.|title=Sustainable Management of Mining Operations|date=2009|publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration|location=Denver, CO, USA|isbn=9780873352673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining of rock and metals has been done since [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times. Modern mining processes involve [[prospecting]] for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials and finally reclamation of the land to prepare it for other uses once mining ceases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Arthur|title=The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Developing Civilization|date=1996|publisher=[[Woodhead Publishing]]|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=1855733013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of mining processes creates a potential negative impact on the environment both during the mining operations and for years after the mine has closed. This impact has led to most of the world's nations adopting regulations to manage negative effects of mining operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Terrascope|title=Environmental Risks of Mining|url=http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/finalwebsite/problems/mining.html|website=The Future of strategic Natural Resources|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=10 September 2014|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920190206/http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/finalwebsite/problems/mining.html|archivedate=20 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandalwood''' is a class of [[wood]]s from trees in the [[genus]] ''[[Santalum]]''. The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. [[Sandalwood oil]] is extracted from the woods for use. Sandalwood is the second-most expensive wood in the world, after [[Dalbergia melanoxylon|African blackwood]].&lt;ref&gt;

Sandalwoods are medium-sized [[Parasitic plant|hemiparasitic]] trees, and part of the same botanical family as European [[mistletoe]]. Notable members of this group are Indian sandalwood (''[[Santalum album]]'') and Australian sandalwood (''[[Santalum spicatum]]''); others in the genus also have fragrant wood. These are found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, Indonesia, Hawaii, and other [[Oceania|Pacific Islands]].
* ''[[Santalum album|S. album]]'' is a threatened species indigenous to South India, and grows in the [[Western Ghats]] and a few other mountain ranges such as the [[Kalrayan]] and [[Shevaroy Hills]]. Although sandalwood trees in India, Pakistan, and Nepal are government-owned and their harvest is controlled, many trees are illegally cut down. Sandalwood oil prices have risen to $2,000 per kg recently. [[Pterocarpus santalinus|Red sanders]] is endemic in Seshachalam, Veliganda, Lankamala, and Palakonda hill ranges, distributed in districts of [[Kadapa]], [[Chittoor]], and [[Kurnool]] in [[Rayalaseema]] region and parts of [[Nellore]] and [[Prakasam district|Prakasam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Mysore (region)|Mysore region]] of [[Karnataka]] (formerly Mysore State), and marayoor forest in [[Kerala]], [[southern India]], is high in quality. New [[plantation]]s were created with [[Foreign aid|international aid]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] for economic exploitation. In [[Kununurra]] in Western Australia, Indian sandalwood is grown on a large scale. This species is the primary source of sandalwood used in commercial oil production and should not be confused with West Indian Sandalwood, ''Amyris balsamifera''.
* ''[[Santalum ellipticum|S. ellipticum]]'', ''[[Santalum freycinetianum|S. freycinetianum]]'', and ''[[Santalum paniculatum|S. paniculatum]]'', the [[Hawaii]]an sandalwood (''{{okina}}iliahi''), were also used and considered high quality. These three species were exploited between 1790 and 1825 before the supply of trees ran out (a fourth species, ''[[Santalum haleakalae|S. haleakalae]]'', occurs only in subalpine areas and was never exported). Although ''S. freycinetianum'' and ''S. paniculatum'' are relatively common today, they have not regained their former abundance or size, and ''S. ellipticum'' remains rare.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, W. L., D. R. Herbst, and S. H. Sohmer (1990). Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Rock|Rock, J. F.]] (1913). The Indigenous Trees of the Hawaiian Islands. Honolulu.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Santalum spicatum|S. spicatum]]'' is used by [[Aromatherapy|aromatherapists]] and perfumers. The oil concentration differs considerably from other ''Santalum'' species. In the 1840s, sandalwood was Western Australia’s biggest export earner. Oil was distilled for the first time in 1875, and by the turn of the 20th century, production of Australian sandalwood oil was intermittent. However, in the late 1990s, Western Australian sandalwood oil enjoyed a revival and by 2009 had peaked at more than {{convert|20000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year – much of which went to the fragrance industries in Europe. Although overall production has decreased, by 2011, a significant percentage of its production was heading to the chewing tobacco industry in India alongside Indian sandalwood – the chewing tobacco market being the largest market for both oils in 2012.
* Other species: Commercially, various other species, not belonging to ''Santalum'' species, are also used as sandalwood.

Various unrelated plants with similarly scented wood or oil include:
*''[[Adenanthera pavonina]]'' - sandalwood tree, red or false red sandalwood
*''[[Baphia nitida]]'' - camwood, also known as African sandalwood
*''[[Eremophila mitchellii]]'' - sandalwood; false sandalwood (also sandalbox)
*''[[Myoporum platycarpum]]'' - sandalwood; false sandalwood
*''[[Myoporum sandwicense]]'' - bastard sandalwood, false sandalwood
*''[[Osyris lanceolata]]'' - African sandalwood
*''[[Osyris tenuifolia]]'' - east African sandalwood

==Production==
[[File:Sandal leaf.jpg|thumb|Sandalwood leaf]]
Producing commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils requires ''Santalum'' trees to be a minimum of 15 years old (''S. album'') the age at which they will be harvested in [[Western Australia]] – the yield, quality and volume are still to be clearly understood. Yield of oil tends to vary depending on the age and location of the tree; usually, the older trees yield the highest oil content and quality. Australia likely will be the largest producer of ''S. album'' by 2018, the majority grown around [[Kununurra]], Western Australia. Western Australian sandalwood is also grown in plantations in its traditional growing area in the wheatbelt east of Perth, where more than {{convert|15000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} are in plantations. Currently, Western Australian sandalwood is only wild harvested and can achieve upwards of AU$16,000 per tonne, which has sparked a growing illegal trade speculated to be worth AU$2.5 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-30/illegal-sandalwood-trade-in-wa/4342570 |title=Illegal sandalwood trade growing in WA - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2012-10-30 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandalwood is expensive compared to other types of woods, so to maximize profit, sandalwood is harvested by removing the entire tree instead of sawing it down at the trunk close to ground level.  This way wood from the stump and root, which possesses high levels of sandalwood oil, can also be processed and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Tony Page, Hanington Tate, Joseph Tungon, Michael Tabi and Phyllis Kamasteia |url= http://aciar.gov.au/files/node/14881/mn151_vanuatu_sandalwood_growers_guide_for_san_46020.pdf |title= Vanuatu sandalwood: growers’ guide for sandalwood production in Vanuatu |publisher=Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research |page= 47 |year= 2012|accessdate= May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

===Fragrance===
[[Image:SandalwoodEssOil.png|thumb|Sandalwood (''S. album'') [[essential oil]]]]
[[Sandalwood oil]] has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy, and milky precious-wood scent. It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, ''fougère'', and ''chypre'' families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. When used in smaller proportions in a [[perfume]], it acts as a [[fixative (perfumery)|fixative]], enhancing the longevity of other, more volatile, materials in the composite. Sandalwood is also a key ingredient in the "floriental" (floral-[[ambery]]) fragrance family – when combined with white florals such as [[jasmine]], [[ylang ylang]], [[gardenia]], [[plumeria]], [[orange blossom]], [[tuberose]], etc.

Sandalwood oil in India is widely used in the [[cosmetic industry]]. The main source of true sandalwood, ''S. album'', is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as "sandalwood". The genus ''Santalum'' has more than 19 species. Traders often accept oil from closely related species, as well as from unrelated plants such as West Indian sandalwood (''[[Amyris balsamifera]]'') in the family [[Rutaceae]] or bastard sandalwood (''Myoporum sandwicense'', [[Myoporaceae]]). However, most woods from these alternative sources lose their aroma within a few months or years.

[[Isobornyl cyclohexanol]] is a synthetic fragrance chemical produced as an alternative to the natural product.

Sandalwood's main components are the two isomers of [[Santalol (disambiguation)|santalol]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; (about 75%). It is used in [[aromatherapy]] and to prepare [[soap]]s.&lt;ref name="fpc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpc.wa.gov.au/content_migration/_assets/documents/about_us/publications/the_good_oil_sandalwood_brochure_Nov2011.pdf|title=The Good Oil|website=www.fpc.wa.gov.au|publisher=The Forest Products Commission, Western Australia|accessdate=18 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227182007/http://www.fpc.wa.gov.au/content_migration/_assets/documents/about_us/publications/the_good_oil_sandalwood_brochure_Nov2011.pdf|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[Sandalore]]® and [[hindinol]] ([[Madrol]]) are a couple of the other sandalwood cmps.

 --&gt;

=== Technology ===
Due to its low [[fluorescence]] and optimal [[refractive index]], sandalwood oil is often employed as an immersion oil within ultraviolet and [[fluorescence microscopy]].

=== Food ===
[[Australian Aboriginals]] eat the seed kernels, nuts, and fruit of local sandalwoods, such as ''quandong'' (''S. acuminatum'').&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nullarbornet.com.au/themes/quandongs.html|title=Nullabor Net|website=Quondong - Australian Bush Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early Europeans in Australia used ''quandong'' in cooking [[damper (food)|damper]] by infusing it with its leaves, and in making jams, pies, and chutneys from the fruit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In [[Scandinavia]], pulverised bark from red sandalwood (''[[Pterocarpus soyauxii]]'') is used - with other tropical spices - when marinating [[Anchovies as food|anchovies]] and some types of [[pickled herring]] such as ''[[matjes]]'', [[European sprat|sprat]], and certain types of traditional ''spegesild'', inducing a redish colour and slightly perfumed flavour.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Selling (2008): ''Så länge skutan kan gå'', p.120 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://politikensforlag.dk/abracadabra/t-39/9788740016949|title=Abracadabra|author=Camilla Plum|language=Danish|publisher=Politikens Forlag|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nordisk-handelshus.dk/sildekrydderi-til-rode-sild.html|title=Sildekrydderi til Røde Sild [Herring-spice for Red Herrings]|language=Danish|publisher=Nordisk Handelshus|date=|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Present-day chefs have begun experimenting in using the nut as a substitute for [[macadamia]] nuts or a [[bush food]] substitute for almonds, hazelnuts, and others in Southeast Asian-styled cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodfood.com.au/eat-out/news/secrets-of-sandalwood--furniture-and-good-eating-too-20140115-30unk.html|title=Good Food|website=Secrets of Sandalwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil is also used as a flavor component in different food items, including candy, ice cream, baked food, puddings, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and gelatin. The flavoring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.

== Distillation ==
Sandalwood must be distilled so that the oil can be extracted from within. Many different methods are used, including [[steam distillation]], water distillation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extraction, and solvent extractions. Steam distillation is the most common method used by sandalwood companies. It occurs in a four-step process, incorporating boiling, steaming, condensation, and separation. Water is heated to high temperatures (140-212°F) and is then passed through the wood. The oil is very tightly bound within the cellular structure of the wood, so the high heat of the steam causes the oil to be released. The mixture of steam and oil is then cooled and separated so that the essential oil can be collected. This process is much longer than any other essential oil's distillation, taking 14 to 36 hours to complete, but generally produces much higher quality oil. Water, or hydro, distillation is the more traditional method of sandalwood extraction which involves soaking the wood in water and then boiling it until the oil is released. This method is not used as much anymore because of the high costs and time associated with heating large quantities of water.

== Religion ==
===Hinduism===
[[File:Ganesh in legno di sandalo.jpg|thumb|left|90px|Sandalwood carved statue of lord [[Ganesha]]]]
Indian sandalwood is very sacred in the Hindu [[Ayurveda]] and is known in Sanskrit as ''vhandana.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ayurveda-sedona.com/knowledge-center/herbs-plants-medicine/sandalwood/|title=Significance of Sacred Sandalwood Chandan in Ayurvedic Remedies, Spiritual Rituals and Medicine|website=ayurveda-sedona.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wood is used for worshipping the god Shiva, and it is believed that goddess Lakshmi lives in the sandalwood tree. The wood of the tree is made into a paste using sandalwood powder, and this paste is integral to rituals and ceremonies, to make religious utensils, to decorate the icons of the deities, and to calm the mind during meditation and prayer. It is also distributed to devotees, who apply it to their foreheads or necks and chests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandalwood - spiritual|url=http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/sandalwood_spiritual.html|website=Kew.org|accessdate=17 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510063821/http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/sandalwood_spiritual.html|archive-date=10 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preparation of the paste is a duty fit only for the pure, so is entrusted in temples and during ceremonies only to [[Brahmin|priests]].

The paste is prepared by grinding wood by hand upon granite slabs shaped for the purpose. With the slow addition of water, a thick paste results (called ''kalabham'' "കളഭം" in  [[Malayalam language]] and ''gandha'' ಗಂಧ in [[Kannada]]), which is mixed with [[saffron]] or other such pigments to make ''chandanam''. ''Chandanam'', further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments, and some other compounds, results in ''javadhu''. ''Kalabham, chandanam,'' and ''javadhu'' are dried and used as ''kalabham'' powder, ''chandanam'' powder, and ''javadhu'' powder, respectively. ''Chandanam'' powder is very popular in India and is also used in Nepal. In Tirupati after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In [[Hinduism]] and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies.

===Jainism===
[[File:Mahamastakabhisheka in 2006.jpg|thumbnail|[[Mahamastakabhisheka]] at Shravanabelagola ]]
Sandalwood use is integral part of daily practices of Jainism. Sandalwood paste mixed with saffron is used to worship ''[[tirthankar]]'' Jain deities. Sandalwood powder is showered as blessings by Jain monks and nuns (''sadhus'' and ''sadhvis'') to their disciples and followers. Sandalwood garlands are used to dress the body during Jain cremation ceremonies. During the festival of [[Mahamastakabhisheka]] that is held once in every 12 years, the [[Gommateshwara statue|statue of Gommateshwara]] is then bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of [[sandalwood]], [[turmeric]], and [[vermilion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Qqei_Wo1qXwC|title=Pilgrimage Centres of India|first=Brajesh|last=Kumar|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|date=2003|isbn=9788171821853|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
Sandalwood is mentioned in various ''suttas'' of the [[Pāli Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/search_results.html?cx=015061908441090246348:dj4lxnh4dda&amp;cof=FORID:9;NB:1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=sandalwood&amp;sa=Search|title=Access to Insight Search Results|website=Accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Buddhist traditions, sandalwood is considered to be of the ''padma'' ([[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]) group and attributed to  [[Amitabha Buddha]]. Sandalwood scent is believed by some to transform one's desires and maintain a person's alertness while in [[meditation]]. It is also one of the most popular scents used when offering [[incense]] to the Buddha and the guru.

===Sufism===
In ''[[sufism|sufi]]'' tradition, sandalwood paste is applied on the ''sufi''’s grave by the disciples as a mark of devotion. It is practiced particularly among the [[Indian Subcontinent]] disciples. In the Tamil culture irrespective of religious identity, sandalwood paste or powder is applied to the graves of sufis as a mark of devotion and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now, All roads lead to Mumbai's Mahim Dargah fair|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1627175/report-now-all-roads-lead-to-mumbai-s-mahim-dargah-fair|work=dnaindia.com|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=21 April 2013}}

===Chinese, Korean, and Japanese religions===
Sandalwood, along with [[agarwood]], is the most commonly used incense material by the [[Religion in China|Chinese]] and [[Religion in Japan|Japanese]] in worship and various ceremonies. However,  some sects of Taoists, following the Ming Dynasty Taoist Manual, do not use sandalwood (as well as [[benzoin resin]], [[frankincense]], foreign produced) incense and instead either use [[agarwood]], or better still ''[[Acronychia pedunculata]]'', in worship.&lt;ref&gt;The Ming Dynasty Taoist manual 《天皇至道太清玉冊》 states: 「降真香，乃祀天帝之靈香也。除此之外，沉速次之。信靈香可以達天帝之靈。所忌者，安息香、乳香、檀香，外夷所合成之香，天律有禁，切宜慎之。」 ["Acronychia pedunculata is the spiritual incense of offering to the Heavenly Emperor. Apart from this type, agarwood/aloeswood ([[Aquilaria malaccensis]]) then [[Aquilaria sinensis]] are the next best. It is believed that this spiritual incense can ascend to reach the spirit of the Heavenly Emperor. Those that are to be avoided are benzoin resin, frankincense, sandalwood, foreign produced incense that violate the Heavenly Law and so one must be careful to observe this."]&lt;/ref&gt; In Korean Shamanism, sandalwood is considered the [[holy tree|Tree of Life]].

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] offer sandalwood twigs to the ''afarganyu,'' the urn in which the fire is kept at the [[fire temple]] (called ''agiyari'' in Gujarati and ''dar-e mehr'' in Persian), to keep the fire burning during religious ceremonies. After the [[mobad|firekeeping priests]] complete the ceremony, attendees are allowed to come up to the ''afarganyu'' and place their own pieces of sandalwood into the fire. Fire has been a sacred symbol in the Zoroastrian religion since ancient times and it is considered very important to keep the fires in the temples constantly burning. Because of its high sensitivity to fire, sandalwood works very well for this. Also, the wood has been accepted by the [[Yasna]] and Yashts as an appropriate fuel for the fire. It is offered to all of the [[Fire temple#Classification|three grades of fire]] in the [[fire temple]], including the [[Atash Dadgah]]s. Sandalwood is not offered to the ''divo'', a smaller lamp that is kept in the homes of Zoroastrians. Often, money is offered to the ''[[mobad]]'' (for religious expenditures) along with the sandalwood. Sandalwood is called ''sukhad'' in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian community.]] The sandalwood in the fire temple is often more expensive to buy than at a Zoroastrian store. It is often a [[revenue|source of income]] for the fire temple.

==Geological history==
Sri Lanka is a [[continental island]], separated from the [[Asia]]n continent only by shallow [[Palk Strait]].&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; Sri Lanka was once a part of [[Gondwanaland]], until the [[Cretaceous Period]]. Then as a part of the [[Indian Plate]], it detached and drifted northward. The Indian Plate collided with the [[Eurasian Plate|Asian mainland]] about 55 million years later. Therefore, there are many ancient Gondwana [[taxonomic groups]] present in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka first became separated from the mainland Indian subcontinent during the late [[Miocene Epoch]]. Due to climatic changes, an intermittent drier region emerged between the moist forests in southwest Sri Lanka and the [[Western Ghats]] in India, the closest other moist forests.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; Although the island has been connected with the mainland repeatedly by land bridges since the initial separation, Sri Lanka's moist forests and its wet forest-adapted [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] have been identified as being ecologically isolated.

==Features==
The ecoregion partially encircles the Central Massif, which reach above {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} and detached  [[Knuckles Mountain Range]].&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; These mountains are represented by their own ecoregion, [[Sri Lanka montane rain forests]]. The [[Soil type|type of the soil]] of the ecoregion is red-yellow [[podzolic]] soil.&lt;ref name="Senarathna, 2005" /&gt; The extended [[Monsoon#Southwest monsoon|Southwestern monsoon]] in May to September brings more than {{convert|5000|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} of rainfall to the ecoregion. The temperature remains constantly between {{convert|27|-|30|C|F}} throughout the year. Due to the proximity to the [[Indian Ocean]] daily temperatures are relieved by the ocean breezes. [[Relative humidity]] ranges between 75%-85%.&lt;ref name="Senarathna, 2005"/&gt;

==Flora==
The vegetation of the region is determined primarily by climate, with [[topography]] and [[edaphic]] conditions contributing secondarily.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; Two [[Community (ecology)|floral communities]] dominate in the Sri Lankan lowland rain forests - the ''[[Dipterocarpus]]''-dominated ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] "''Hora''") community and the ''[[Mesua]]-[[Shorea]]'' community (Sinhalese "''Na-Doona''"). The ''Dipterocarpus'' community comprises ''[[Dipterocarpus zeylanicus]]'', ''Dipterocarpus hispidus'', ''Vitex altissima'', ''Chaetocarpus castanocarpus'', ''Dillenia retusa'', ''Dillenia triquetra'', ''[[Myristica dactyloides]]'', and ''[[Semecarpus gardneri]]''. The ''Mesua-Shorea'' community comprises ''[[Anisophyllea cinnamomoides]]'', ''[[Cullenia rosayroana]]'', ''[[Mesua ferrea]]'' (the national tree of Sri Lanka), ''[[Mesua nagassarium]]'', ''[[Myristica dactyloides]]'', ''[[Palaquium petiolare]]'', ''[[Shorea affinis]]'', ''[[Shorea congestiflora]]'', ''[[Shorea disticha]]'', ''[[Shorea megistophylla]], [[Shorea trapezifolia]]'', ''Shorea worthingtoni'', ''Syzygium rubicundum'', and a sub canopy of ''Chaetocarpus castanocarpus'', ''[[Garcinia hermonii]]'', ''[[Syzygium neesianum]]'', and ''Xylopia championi''. Virgin forests of this ecoregion have four strata, a main [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] at {{convert|30|-|40|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, a sub-canopy at {{convert|15|-|30|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, a {{convert|5|-|15|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[understory]], and a sparse shrub layer.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; Trees of the [[emergent layer]] reach above the main canopy to {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.

Swamp forests situated closer to the coastlines are a distinct habit area within the ecoregion. ''[[Avicennia]]-[[Rhizophora]]-[[Sonneratia]]'' dominated [[mangrove]]s fringe the coastlines.

==Biodiversity==
Almost all the [[endemism|endemic]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of Sri Lanka are confined to the southwestern rain forests.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; Due to the warm and moist climate and long physical isolation, wet forest adopted species have promoted a high degree of endemism and specialization. More than 60 percent of 306 endemic tree species of Sri Lanka are restricted to this ecoregion. A further 61 species are shared with the montane rain forests and [[Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests|dry forests]]. The dominant tree family in Asian rain forests, the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]] shows a special endemicity.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; All but one species of the 58 species of the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]] can only be found in these rain forests, including two endemic genera, [[Shorea]] and [[Stemonoporus]]. ''Anoectochilus setaceus'' or ''Wanaraja'' (Sinhalese for "King of forest"), an endemic orchid, is only found in undisturbed forests of this ecoregion. Several plant species show highly localized distribution. The lowland and sub montane forests are the floristically richest in Sri Lanka and of all [[South Asia]].

==Fauna==

===Mammals===
Sri Lanka lacks the land area to support large animals. Although fossil records of ancestral forms of [[rhinoceros]]es, [[hippopotamus]]es, and [[lion]]s have been found. Despite the small number of species, this ecoregion is home to several near-endemic mammals, including one strict endemic species, the jungle shrew.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; The two endemic shrews, the Asian highland shrew and the jungle shrew are listed as vulnerable and endangered respectively. The [[Sri Lanka leopard]], the largest carnivore of the island, is identified as threatened. [[Asian elephant]]s live in small numbers in these rain forests and are listed as endangered. Unlike in dry-zone forests, where they live in large numbers, this ecoregion's elephant population is faced with [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]]. The [[Indian hare]], [[fishing cat]] and [[rusty-spotted cat]] are some of the other mammals who dwell in this ecoregion.&lt;ref name="dailynews" /&gt;

The near-endemic and strict endemic mammals live in the areas listed below. Strict endemic species are marked with an asterisk.

*[[Asian highland shrew]]
*[[Jungle shrew]]*
*[[Thailand roundleaf bat]]
*[[Purple-faced langur]]
*[[Golden palm civet]]
*[[Layard's palm squirrel]]
*[[Travancore flying squirrel]]
*[[Ceylon spiny mouse]]
*[[Nolthenius's long-tailed climbing mouse]]

===Birds===
This ecoregion is completely contained within the [[Endemism in birds|Endemic bird area of Sri Lanka]]. Out of sixteen bird species categorized as near-endemic, two species, the green-billed coucal and the white-throated flowerpecker are indigenous. The green-billed coucal and the [[Sri Lanka whistling-thrush]] are listed as threatened.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; The [[ashy-headed laughingthrush]], red-faced malkoha and [[scaly thrush]] are the other threatened species.&lt;ref name="sundayobserver"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2009/03/15/rev09.asp|title=Not a ‘bird-brained’ plan!|last=Dole|first=Nilma|date=2009-03-15|work=sundayobserver.lk|publisher=Sunday Observer|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The near-endemic and strict endemic birds live in the areas listed below. Strict endemic species are marked with an asterisk.

*[[Sri Lanka wood pigeon]]
*[[Sri Lanka grey hornbill]]
*[[Red-faced malkoha]]
*[[Green-billed coucal]]*
*[[Sri Lanka spurfowl]]
*[[Sri Lanka junglefowl]]
*[[Sri Lanka blue magpie]]
*[[Spot-winged thrush]]
*[[White-faced starling]]
*[[Sri Lanka myna]]
*[[Kashmir flycatcher]]
*[[Brown-capped babbler]]
*[[Orange-billed babbler]]
*[[White-throated flowerpecker]]*
*[[Yellow-fronted barbet]]
*[[Sri Lanka hanging parrot]]
*[[Layard's parakeet]]
*[[Chestnut-backed owlet]]

===Reptiles, fishes and amphibians===
Sri Lanka's reptile fauna includes 204 species with 114 endemic species. A further 17 taxa are endemic at subspecies level.&lt;ref name="Somaweera 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdn.ac.lk/socs/zaup/reptiles/srilanka.html|title=Sri Lanka - a world Reptile Hotspot|last=Somaweera|first=Ruchira|year=2004|work=pdn.ac.lk|publisher=[[University of Peradeniya]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mugger crocodile]] and the [[spineless forest lizard]] are listed as endangered along with eight [[freshwater fish]] species. Sri Lanka has the highest [[Species richness|density]] of [[amphibian]] species worldwide (3.9 species per {{convert|1000|km2|sqmi|0}}). These include 250 species of [[frog]]s belonging to the family [[Rhacophoridae]]. Many of these species have only limited range distributions, often less than {{convert|0.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|2}}. These species are also faced with habitat fragmentation and loss.

==Threats and conservation==
Most of the Sri Lanka's rain forests were cleared for plantations, originally for [[coffee]] and [[cinchona]] and then [[tea]] and [[rubber]].&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/ghats/Pages/impacts.aspx|title=Human Impacts|work=biodiversityhotspots.org|publisher=[[Conservation International]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining forests cover only 4.6 percent of the [[Geography of Sri Lanka#Ecological zones|wet zone]]. Between 1990-2005, Sri Lanka [[Deforestation in Sri Lanka|has showed one of the highest deforestation rates]] of primary forests in the world.&lt;ref name="Senanayake 2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/070909/Plus/plus0011.html|title=Regrowing lost Rainforests|last=Senanayake|first=Dr. Ranil|date=September 9, 2007|work=sundaytimes.lk|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Senanayake 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2006/1106-interview_ranil.html|title=An interview with Dr. Ranil Senanayake, chairman of Rainforest Rescue International:|last= Butler|first=Rhett A.|date=November 6, 2006|work=mongabay.com|publisher=[[Mongabay]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A survey carried out in 2005 found that 17 of Sri Lanka's frogs have become extinct in the past decade and another 11 species face imminent threat of extinction unless their habitat is secured.&lt;ref name="Senanayake 2006"/&gt; These remaining forests exist as highly fragmented patches.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt; Most of them are less than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|2}} in extent. Poaching and the extraction of forest products (timber, firewood, medicinal plants) are a problem in almost all forest reserves.

Nevertheless, if the existing forests are preserved the condition can be improved, as many of the species of this ecoregion have small habitat needs.&lt;ref name="Wikramanayake"/&gt; There are several protected areas that overlap with the ecoregion. The two most notable are the world heritage site the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. Altogether, protected areas of this ecoregion accounts for only {{convert|260|km2|sqmi|2}}.

The '''Te Mihi Power Station''' is a 166 MW [[geothermal power]] station owned and operated by [[Contact Energy]], located north of [[Taupo]] in [[New Zealand]].

The [[resource consent]] for the power station was "called in" by the [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Minister for the Environment]] [[Trevor Mallard]] under the terms of the [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]]. The appointed Board of Enquiry granted the consent with a set of stipulated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/call-in-temihi/board-of-inquiry/index.html|title=Board of Inquiry for the Te Mihi Geothermal Power Station Proposal|date=2008-09-13|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Te Mihi Power Station uses geothermal energy from the [[Wairakei]] geothermal field, which lies in the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]].  It is part of a plan to gradually replace the [[Wairakei Power Station]] which will be phased out of production.  With Te Mihi in operation, output from Wairakei is decreased by approximately 45 MW, resulting in a net increase of about 114 MW.&lt;ref name="Stuff2011" /&gt;

The project was designed and constructed by a joint venture of [[McConnell Dowell]], [[SNC-Lavalin]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.macdow.com.au/key-projects/te-mihi-geothermal-power-station| title=Te Mihi Geothermal Power Station| publisher=McConnell Dowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plant includes two 83 MW steam turbines supplied by Toshiba. The project cost $623 million&lt;ref name="Stuff2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/4687332/Contact-kicks-off-Mihi-project|title=Contact kicks off Mihi project|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially opened in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/10380953/Te-Mihi-geothermal-station-to-boost-Contact| title=Te Mihi geothermal station to boost Contact| date=14 August 2014| first=James| last=Weir| publisher=Dominoin Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Emigrants''''' ({{lang-sv|Utvandrarna}}) is a novel by [[Vilhelm Moberg]] from 1949. It is the first part of [[The Emigrants (novels)|''The Emigrants'' series]].

== Plot ==
The story takes place in the 1840s up to 1850. The first part of the novel describes the hardships faced by rural families in [[Sweden]]. Karl Oskar Nilsson and his wife, Kristina, own a farm in ''Ljuder socken'' in [[Småland]]. They have four children and work hard to make a living, but the poor harvests lead to famine, a catalyst for the beginnings of emigration to the United States in search of a better life. Karl Oskar and his brother Robert want to go, but Kristina doesn't want to leave her home country, knowing that she will never see the rest of their family again. But after the death of their oldest child, she accepts her husband's plans when she realizes that they are in just as much danger from their lives in Sweden as on the big sea and in a [[New World]].

They pack up all their belongings and book passage in a group with others from their parish. The characters illustrate some of the motives that prompted people to leave Sweden in the 19th century. The travelers include:

* Karl-Oskar, Kristina and their children – seeking to escape poverty and famine and finding a place where their work pays off.
* Robert, Karl Oskar's adventurous brother – landless, as the second son of a farmer whose holdings are too small to sub-divide. He seeks escape from the harsh conditions of being a hired farmhand.
* Danjel Andreasson with family, Kristina's maternal uncle, who has been banished from the country due to his religious "delusions". The state Lutheran church was very powerful, and dissent, even in the simple form of home Bible study, is not tolerated. They bring their farmhand Arvid, who is a friend of Robert.
* Jonas Petter Albrektsson, who seeks to escape from an unhappy marriage at a time when divorce was not possible.
* Ulrika of Västergöhl, a former [[prostitute]], looking to leave her past behind and start afresh with her daughter Elin.

The second part of the book tells how they board the ship in [[Karlshamn]], and then how the life goes on during the ten weeks they spend on board – battling sea-sickness and [[scurvy]], travelling across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] before finally reaching [[New York City]] in midsummer of 1850. The novel ends with the travellers marvelling at the technological wonders of their new home, emblematised in the almost-complete [[Hudson River Railroad]] (which would grow into the [[New York Central]]) finally opened October 3, 1851.
