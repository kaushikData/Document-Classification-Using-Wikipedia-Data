      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2627">On 2006-11-16, '''France, Italy and Spain announced a new Middle East peace plan''' proposed by [[Prime Minister of Spain|Spanish Premier]] [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] during talks with [[President of France|French president]] [[Jacques Chirac]]. Later on, the plan was introduced to [[Romano Prodi]], Italy's prime minister who gave his full support to the plan. The peace move came after [[Israel]] invaded the [[Gaza Strip]] in [[Operation Autumn Clouds]].

==Plan==
The plan is a five-point blueprint for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. The plan calls for:

* an immediate [[ceasefire]], 
* an exchange of prisoners, 
* an international peace conference (similar to the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], which was held by Spain and led to the [[Oslo Accords]]), while it also 
* backs a prospective Palestinian unity government, and 
* an international mission in the Gaza Strip to monitor the ceasefire.

==Reaction==
Senior [[Palestinian National Authority]] negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]]&lt;!--is this an official statement?--&gt; welcomed the plan in principle, but added that there was no need for a new initiative, but rather that it could serve as a realistic political track to a [[two-state solution]]. An Israeli official said parts of the plan were being discussed, but that it was not being taken seriously as it was not coordinated with the EU or Israel. Israel supports direct negotiations over an international conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6157144.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4241">'''Above the Influence''' originated as a government-based campaign of the [[National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign]] conducted by the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] in the [[United States]] that included broad messaging to focus on substances most abused by teens, intended to deliver both broad prevention messaging at the national level and more targeted efforts at the local community level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/about]&lt;/ref&gt;

The media campaign had two distinct areas of focus: a teen-targeted Above the Influence Campaign, and a young-adult-targeted anti-meth campaign. By law, the purpose of the media campaign was to prevent drug abuse among teens in the United States; increase awareness of adults of the impact of drug abuse on young people; and encourage parents and other interested adults to discuss with young people the dangers of illegal drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t21t25+624+0++%28National+Youth+Anti-Drug+Media+Campaign%29 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317074427/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t21t25+624+0++%28National%20Youth%20Anti-Drug%20Media%20Campaign%29 |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of this campaign was to help teens stand up to negative pressures, and influences. The more aware one becomes about the influences around them, the more prepared they will be to face them, including the pressure to use drugs and alcohol. 

"Above the Influence" is symbolized by its campaign logo featuring an arrow pointing up with a circle around it.

As of March 2014, federal funding and oversight of Above the Influence ceased, and it transitioned to become a program of the not-for-profit [http://www.drugfree.org Partnership for Drug-Free Kids].

==Studies==
In 2006, the [[Government Accountability Office]] released the results of 5-year-study, concluding that the previous, “My Anti-Drug”, campaign was ineffective, and likely counterproductive, leading those exposed to an increased perception that others use marijuana, stating, "analysis also indicated that among current, non-drug-using youth, exposure to the campaign had unfavorable effects on their anti-drug norms and perceptions of other youths’ use of marijuana — that is, greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06818.pdf page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Ohio State University]] released the results of an independent scientific study stating that the ''Above the Influence'' campaign appears to have effectively reduced marijuana use by teenagers. 
"Evidence for the success of ''Above the Influence'' is especially heartening because the primary independent evaluation of its predecessor campaign, 'My Anti-Drug', showed no evidence for success", said Michael Slater, principal investigator of the new study and professor of communication at [[Ohio State University]].
“The ‘Above the Influence’ campaign appears to be successful because it taps into the desire by teenagers to be independent and self-sufficient,” Slater said.  He also mentioned the limitations of the study.  These include the fact that findings regarding the ONDCP campaign were based on survey results and not a randomized, experimental design in which some youth saw the ONDCP campaign and others did not.  Another limitation was that the study, while taking place in 20 communities around the U.S., did not use a random sample of U.S. youth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">An '''allocation questionnaire''' is a form used in [[English language|English]] [[legal practice]].  After a claim is made, if a defence is filed each party is required to complete and return an allocation questionnaire to the court so that the judge may properly allocate the claim to a track and give further directions towards a final hearing.

==Forms on the Internet==

Sample allocation questionnaires are available on the [[Internet]]. The official UK Courts web site has many forms available, including the allocation questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/claims/index.htm |title=UK Courts forms |access-date=2007-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706220941/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/claims/index.htm |archive-date=2010-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual form is available, as of March 2007, as a [[pdf]] file.&lt;ref name="Form"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/n150_1001.pdf PDF file of the allocation questionnaire ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] provides a generic [[legal advice]] web site with information about the words and phrases used in small claims procedure in UK Courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/your_rights/legal_system/small_claims.htm AdviceGuide.org.uk] from the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The form itself==

The allocation questionnaire is a Pivotal Point in the judicial process requesting the following information:
* Whether you wish to have a month to settle the case.
* What is the location or [[Venue (law)|venue]] of the case, and why it is chosen.
* Whether any '''pre-action protocols''' applied, and whether these were complied with.
* What is the amount of the claim in dispute.
* Who you will call as lay or [[expert witness]]es.
* Whether the case should be considered small claims, or another track.
* How long you think the trial will take.
* How much your costs will be (in Pounds sterling).&lt;ref name="Form" /&gt;

==Tracks==

There are three tracks:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/part26.htm#rule26_1 CPR 26.1(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Small claims - any claim up to £10,000 and certain [[personal injury]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] claims under £1,000.
# Fast track - disputes involving between £10,000 and £25,000.
# Multi-track - disputes that are claimed to be over £25,000, or in certain cases where the claim is for less than £25,000 but the complexity of the evidence and/or legal issues to be decided means the claim is better suited to the Multi-track, particularly where a claim will take more than 1 day to try.  All Part 8 proceedings are allocated to the Multi-track.&lt;ref name="Form" /&gt;

The Woolf Report had recommended these changes in 1999 to the [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/de/privateinvestigator/woolf.html Woolf Report online]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
'''Anticipatory repudiation''', also called an '''anticipatory breach''', is a term in the [[law]] of [[contract]]s that describes a declaration by the promising party to a contract that he or she does not intend to live up to his or her obligations under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Which might entitle the other party to claim damages. International principle: [http://www.trans-lex.org/945500 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repudiation and retraction== 
A party is considered to have repudiated a contract when they evidence a lack of willingness or an inability to perform their contractual obligations. A repudiation of a contract by one party (the repudiating party) will entitle the other party (the aggrieved party) to elect to terminate the contract. This is based on objective intentions i.e. the repudiating party's words or conduct.;&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Cargo Carriers Corp v Citati'' [1957] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 401; See also {{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1953|litigants=Carr v JA Berriman Pty Ltd |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1953/31.pdf (1953) 89 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 327] |courtname=auto |date=}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|23|1989|litigants=Laurinda Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1989) 166 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 623 at p647 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially the whole of the benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1985|litigants=Progressive Mailing House v Tabali |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 17 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When such an event occurs, the performing party to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations. However, the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the performing party in the interim. A retraction of the repudiation restores the performer's obligation to perform on the contract.

Another rationale for the doctrine of repudiation is based on the breach of an implied term not rendering future performance futile: "[O]ne essential promise which is implied in every contract is that neither party will without just cause repudiate his obligations under the contract, whether the time for performance has arrived or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|632|1938|litigants=Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Repudiation of the contract by one party entitles the other party the right to terminate and claim for damages. However, it is possible that the repudiating party does not repudiate the entire contract but only certain obligations. In this case, the aggrieved party will only acquire the right to terminate if the repudiating party repudiates an obligation which, if breached, would grant a right to terminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|51|1989|litigants=Foran v Wight |parallecite=(1989) 168 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 385 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the promising party's repudiation makes it impossible to fulfil its promise, then retraction is not possible and no act by the promising party can restore the performing party's obligations under the contract. For example, if A promises to give B a unique sculpture in exchange for B painting A's house, but A then sells the sculpture to C before B begins the job, this act by A constitutes an anticipatory repudiation which excuses B from performing. Once the sculpture has left A's possession, there is no way that A can fulfil the promise to give the sculpture to B.

The question arises as to why any party would want to provide notice of anticipatory breach.  The reason is that once the performing party is informed of the anticipatory breach, a duty is then created for the performing party to mitigate damages as a result of the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the other party will perform (see UCC 2-609(1)).  If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the performing party has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral [[executory contract]] with non-performed duties on both sides.  Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.

== Measuring damages ==
{{original research|section|date=January 2017}}
According to UCC 2-713(1) damages are to be measured at the time when the buyer learned of the breach. This is easy with a one transaction sale, e.g. a widget at the purchaser's door step on X date,; but when does the purchaser learn of the breach in an anticipatory repudiation? There are three main views:

# When the buyer learns of the repudiation
# When the buyer learns of repudiation plus a commercially reasonable time
##UCC 2-610(a) gives this indication, the purchaser would be waiting at your risk if the vendor determined the market price at the time you learn of repudiation.
##UCC 2-723(1) would indicate this, but it would be superfluous with 2-713 so 2-713 must have something other than the plain meaning.
##(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to 2-723 trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price (Section  UCC 2-708 or Section UCC 2-713) shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.
##This is the majority view: when repudiation is accepted or within a commercial reasonable time
#Time of performance, when the trail that occurs after the time of performance
##This is different than the plain reading for UCC 2-713.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">The '''Ashwander rules''', articulated by [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Louis D. Brandeis]], are a set of principles used by the [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] for avoiding constitutional rulings.

== Rules for Judicial Self-Restraint and Avoiding Constitutional Questions ==
Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Louis D. Brandeis]], concurring in ''[[Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority]]'', 297 U.S. 288 (1936), summarized some prudential rules for exercising judicial self-restraint and avoiding ruling on the constitutionality of congressional legislation:

[[Supreme Court of the United States|The Court]] developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its [[jurisdiction]], a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision. They are:

# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions "is legitimate only in the last resort, earnest and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the  [[Act of Congress|legislative act]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk Ry. v. Wellman'', 143 U.S. 339 (1892)&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Court will not "anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it." &lt;ref name="Liverpool, N.Y. 1885"&gt;''Liverpool, N.Y. &amp; P.S.S. Co. v. Emigration Commissioners'', 113 U.S. 33 (1885)&lt;/ref&gt; "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case." &lt;ref&gt;''Burton v. United States'', 196 U.S. 283 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Court will not "formulate a rule of  [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]] broader than is required by the Precise facts to which it is to be applied." &lt;ref name="Liverpool, N.Y. 1885" /&gt;
# The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of [[statutory construction]] or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]] are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.
# The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right to challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. (While not mentioned in ''Ashwander'', there are exceptions in the case of a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] challenge where the party may raise the effect of a law on other person's First Amendment rights, the so called "[[chilling effect]]" doctrine.)
# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.
# "When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided." &lt;ref&gt;''Crowell v. Benson'', 285 U.S. 22 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly''' was the main elected representative body of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] between 1975 and 1986, when preparations began to be made for the granting of self-government to the Territory. It served a largely advisory role, with most powers over the Territory still lying in the hands of the relevant federal minister through the life of the Assembly.

==Background==
Three years after the seat of government was established at [[Canberra]] and after the opening of the first Parliament House in 1927, an appointed [[Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council|Advisory Council]] was established to administer the capital. In 1974 this was replaced by a fully elected Legislative Assembly, advising the Department of the Capital Territory. In 1979 this became a House of Assembly of 18 elected members, which was dissolved in 1986. In 1978 a [[referendum]] on self-government was defeated, with 68 per cent of voters recording a No vote. The federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] set up a Self-Government Task Force in 1986 to report on the government of the ACT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Creation of the Assembly==
The assembly was first created in 1975 by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government, as a response to frequent criticism about the lack of representation for the citizens of the territory. Whitlam had appointed the local federal MP, [[Kep Enderby]], as Minister for the ACT, and Enderby sought to create a new representative body along the lines of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]], which had been created in 1974. Elections were held for the first Legislative Assembly that year, with representatives of the [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|Labor Party]], [[Liberal Party of Australia (Australian Capital Territory Division)|Liberal Party]], [[Australia Party]], and several independents taking seats in the Assembly. Unlike its Northern Territory counterpart, it was not made self-governing in 1977.

The new Assembly began sitting in the then-Civic Offices, later renovated to become the current [[Legislative Assembly Building, Canberra|Legislative Assembly Building]]. An independent MLA, [[Jim Pead]], took office as the first President (the equivalent of the Speaker) of the new body. [[Gordon Walsh]] became the first leader of the Labor caucus, with Dr [[Peter Hughes (Australian politician)|Peter Hughes]] leading the Liberal caucus. Both were replaced in 1977; Walsh joined the nascent [[Australian Democrats]], and was replaced as leader by [[Peter Vallee]], Hughes quit the Liberal Party and was replaced as leader by [[Jim Leedman]]. [[Ivor Vivian]] became the leader of the [[Australia Party]], before being replaced by Walsh in 1977. The first Assembly saw two prominent members on its benches: future federal ministers [[Ros Kelly]] and [[Susan Ryan]]. Ryan resigned during the first term, successfully seeking a seat in the Senate.

The second election for the Assembly was held in 1979, and saw a change in name from the Legislative Assembly to the House of Assembly. The election saw the addition of a fourth party, with the conservative [[Family Team]] led by [[Bev Cains]] winning a seat. It also saw the election of future self-government ministers [[Greg Cornwell]] and [[Paul Whalan]]. A third election was held in 1982, which saw the introduction of a more partisan system. The Liberals held a majority in the Assembly, with Leedman becoming Leader of the House, and new Labor leader [[Ken Doyle]] becoming the minority leader. He was to be short-lived as leader, with [[Maurene Horder]] succeeding him after only two years.

The last Assembly also saw the creation of an office of Speaker, filled by independent MHA [[Harold Hird]]. The final election also saw the election of future Liberal Chief Minister [[Trevor Kaine]]. It was allowed to expire in 1986 due to plans to introduce full self-government for the territory. After some years of discussions, the House of Assembly was replaced with the current Legislative Assembly in 1989, with new Labor leader [[Rosemary Follett]] becoming the first [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory]].

Voting was not compulsory for the House of Assembly, and its influence was limited. Many of its prominent figures retired rather than contest the elections for the new Legislative Assembly in 1989; several others, including outgoing Speaker [[Harold Hird]] and [[Family Team]] leader Bev Cains were soundly defeated. Three MHAs, however—Greg Cornwell, Trevor Kaine, and Paul Whalan—went on to be elected to the new parliament, and later served in major roles.

'''Automotive Energy Supply Corporation''' (AESC) is a manufacturer of [[Lithium ion battery|lithium ion batteries]] for electric vehicles established 2007 as a joint venture between [[Nissan]], [[NEC]] and [[TOKIN Corporation]].

==History==
In 2007 [[NEC Corporation]], [[Nissan Motor Company]], and [[NEC Tokin]] agreed to establish a lithium-ion battery company focused on development to production of batteries for electric vehicles;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2007/_STORY/070413-01-e.html| title = NISSAN AND NEC TO FORM NEW COMPANY FOR ADVANCED BATTERIES| type = press release| date = 13 Apr 2007| publisher = Nissan }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 the company was established with a capital of ¥1.5 billion ($14.3million) with a 51:42:7 Nissan:NEC:NEC TOKIN shareholding; the business was to establish a manufacturing site at Nissan's facility in [[Zama, Kanagawa]]  c.2009, with an initial capacity of 13,000 units per year, rising to 65,000 units per year on an investment of ¥12 billion ($114.6 million). The plant was to be supplied with lithium manganese electrode from NEC TOKIN's factory in [[Sagamihara]], Kanagawa; itself upgraded at a cost of ¥11 billion  ($128million). Initial markets were to be [[forklift]] trucks, followed by electric and hybrid vehicles manufactured by Nissan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2008/_STORY/080519-01-e.html| title =NISSAN AND NEC JOINT VENTURE - AESC - STARTS OPERATIONS| type = press release| date =19 May 2008| publisher = Nissan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url  =http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20080520/152035/| title = NEC Group, Nissan Announce Li-ion Battery Production Plan| date = 20 May 2008| first = Yasuto| last = Toudou| publisher = Nikkei Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial production was based on a manganese spinel cathode, with batteries formed from laminated cells. The  battery  (L3-10) was a {{convert|251x144.2x9.2|mm}} unit of 13Ah, 3.6V  with a power density of 2060W/kg (2.5V @ 20°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/05/aesc-lithium-io.html| title = AESC: Lithium-ion Batteries for Nissan-Renault’s Hybrids, PHEVs and EVs| date  =16 May 2008| work = www.greencarcongress.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008 the joint owners announced they were investing a further ¥100 billion ($1.1 billion) in AESC, establishing an additional factory to increase capacity for around 200,000 vehicles per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url  =http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/12/report-nissan-n.html| date = 28 Dec 2008| title = Report: Nissan, NEC to Invest $1.1B or More to Increase Li-ion Supply for EVs and HEVs | work = www.greencarcongress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trial production at Zama began mid 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2009/_STORY/090716-01-e.html | title =AUTOMOTIVE ENERGY SUPPLY CORPORATION BEGINS TRIAL  PRODUCTION OF LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES| type = press release| date =16 July 2009| publisher = Nissan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Nissan Leaf]] electric vehicle began production, using batteries from AESC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/101022-01-e.html| title = Production of 100% Electric, Zero-Emission  Nissan LEAF begins at Oppama, Japan| type = press release| date = 22 Oct 2010| publisher = Nissan| access-date = 2016-02-14| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110101234458/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/101022-01-e.html| archive-date = 2011-01-01| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 AESC was the second largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer worldwide (after [[Panasonic]]), with 21% of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/lg-chem-is-not-the-largest-auto-battery-supplier-in-the-world| title = Who Is the World’s Biggest Electric Vehicle Battery Supplier?| first = Jason| last = Deign| date = 10 Apr 2015| work = www.greentechmedia.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014 [[Reuters]] reported conflict within the [[Renault–Nissan Alliance|Nissan / Renault carmaker alliance]] over sourcing of battery packs for its [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK]] and [[Nissan Smyrna assembly plant]] (USA) car battery plants due to lack of price competitiveness with rival cell manufacturer [[LG_Chem#Energy_solutions|LG Chem]] - Nissan was reported to have signed contracts to take all of NEC's electrode production, irrespective of sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-sa-nissan-batteries-exclusive-idUSKBN0HA0CA20140915| title = Exclusive: Nissan faces battery plant cuts as electric car hopes fade| first = Laurence| last = Frost| date = 12 Sep 2014| work = www.reuters.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Nissan decided to sell its 51% stake in AESC, preferring external suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Nissan-s-battery-pullout-may-energize-rivals Nissan's battery pullout may energize rivals]" ''Nikkei'', 6 August 2016. &lt;/ref&gt;

In December, 2016 Carlos Ghosn explains that being tied to internal battery manufacturing does not allow for the flexibility of buying cheaper third party batteries.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.forbes.com/sites/bertelschmitt/2016/12/16/carlos-ghosn-explains-why-making-your-own-batteries-is-dumb &lt;/ref&gt;

However, this sale did not actually happen and after three delays was canceled in July 2018 as intended buyer GSR Capital did not pay on time.&lt;ref&gt;https://insideevs.com/nissan-stuck-with-aesc-as-sale-of-battery-unit-to-gsr-was-canceled/&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the new deal with the Envision Group, Nissan will retain 25% stake in AESC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://insideevs.com/nissan-to-sell-battery-division-to-envision-group/|title=Nissan To Sell Battery Division To Envision Group|website=insideevs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Ontario v. Quon''''', 560 U.S. 746 (2010), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the extent to which the [[right to privacy]] applies to electronic communications in a government workplace. It was an appeal by the city of [[Ontario, California]], from a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] decision holding that it had violated the [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights of two of its police officers when it disciplined them following an audit of [[pager]] [[text message]]s that discovered many of those messages were personal in nature, some sexually explicit. The Court unanimously held that the audit was work-related and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable [[search and seizure]].

Ontario police sergeant Jeff Quon, along with other officers and those they were exchanging messages with, had sued the city, their superiors and the pager service provider in federal court. They had alleged a violation of not only their constitutional rights but federal telecommunications privacy laws. Their defense was that a superior officer had promised the pager messages themselves would not be audited if the officers reimbursed the city for fees it incurred when they exceeded a monthly [[character (computing)|character]] limit.

Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the [[majority opinion]] signed by seven of his fellow justices. It decided the case purely on the reasonableness of the pager audit, explicitly refusing to consider "far-reaching issues" it raised on the grounds that modern communications technology and its role in society was still evolving. He nevertheless discussed those issues at some length in explaining why the Court chose not to rule on them, in addition to responding, for argument's sake, more directly to issues raised by the respondents. [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote a separate [[concurring opinion]], as did [[Antonin Scalia]], who would have used a different test he had proposed in an earlier case to reach the same result.

Outside commentators mostly praised the justices for this display of restraint, but Scalia criticized it harshly in his concurrence, calling it vague. He considered his fellow justices in "disregard of duty" for their refusal to address the Fourth Amendment issues. A month after the court handed down its decision, an appellate court in Georgia similarly criticized it for "a marked lack of clarity" as it narrowed an earlier ruling to remove a finding that there was no [[expectation of privacy]] in the contents of email.&lt;ref name="Rehberg v. Paulk 2"&gt;[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=14664334731541524467 ''Rehberg v.

==Underlying dispute==

In 2001 the Ontario Police Department (OPD) acquired 20 [[alphanumeric paging|alphanumeric pagers]] to distribute to officers in its [[SWAT]] unit so they could better coordinate their activities.&lt;ref name="en banc denial dissent"&gt;[[Sandra Segal Ikuta|Ikuta, Sandra Segal]]; {{cite web|url= http://case.lawmemo.com/9/quon2.pdf |title=Dissent from Denial of En Banc rehearing, Quon v.

Arch Wireless Operating Company]'', 529 F.3d 892 (9th Cir., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; above which an overage fee would be charged. Pager use was covered by the OPD's computer and [[Internet]] use policy, under which employees agreed that "the city reserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or without notice". The policy did not specifically mention [[text message]]s, but employees were told both verbally, at a staff meeting and through a [[memorandum]] that they were included and that only "light personal communications" were allowed during work hours.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg story"&gt;{{cite news| last=Woolner |first=Ann|title= Cheating Husband Texting on Office Pager Sues Boss |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3sv48wm5FvI| work =[[Bloomberg News]]| date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated that "inappropriate, derogatory, obscene, suggestive, defamatory, or harassing language in the e-mail system will not be tolerated".&lt;ref name="Ninth Circuit decision" /&gt;

Several officers, including Sgt. Jeff Quon, a 20-year veteran of the department,&lt;ref name="Quon LinkedIn page"&gt;{{cite web|last=Quon|first=Jeff|title=Jeff Quon |url = http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeff-quon/7/b32/138|publisher =[[LinkedIn]]|year=2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; exceeded the limit during the first two billing cycles. He was allowed to reimburse the city for the fee. Lt. James Duke, head of the department's Administrative Bureau, told him that his communications would not be monitored if he paid the overage,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg story" /&gt; but that he should stop using the pager so much. When Quon and another officer continued to exceed the limit and reimburse the city, Duke told then-Chief Lloyd Scharf he was "tired of being a bill collector". The OPD began to consider whether the character limit it had contracted for was too low and it was forcing officers to pay for work-related communications, as had sometimes happened in the past.

At Scharf's direction, Duke requested from Arch transcripts of text messages sent by Quon and the other officer. After verifying that the city was the subscriber on the account, an Arch employee sent Duke the transcripts. Many messages were personal and some were [[sexting|sexually explicit]], sent by the married Quon to his girlfriend at work. In one month as few as 8% of Quon's texts had been work-related. A transcript from which messages sent when Quon and the other officer were off-duty had been [[Sanitization (classified information)|redact]]ed was sent to the OPD's [[internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sergeant, and after an investigation Quon and the other officer were allegedly disciplined.

==Existing law==

The case would involve two areas of law, both coming under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The first was the privacy rights Quon and the other officers had over text messages sent on equipment paid for by their employers. The other was their rights as public employees, since their superiors were also agents of the state.

Congress had passed the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] in 1986, which addressed issues raised as more and more companies stored records with highly personal data about individual consumers in off-site [[database]]s operated by third parties. A key section, known as the [[Stored Communications Act]] (SCA), distinguished between electronic communications services which actively transmitted and received data and remote communications services whose only role was to archive and [[backup]] transmitted data for at least some period of time. The former could release transmitted data only to its sender or recipient; the latter could also release that information to the subscriber regardless of who had sent or received it.&lt;ref name="SCA text"&gt;{{usc|18|2702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, 1987, the Supreme Court had first dealt with the Fourth Amendment rights of government employees under administrative investigation in ''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'', a case arising from the search of a supervising physician's office and records at a California public hospital. By a 5-4 margin the court had ruled that while public employees had Fourth Amendment protections, the search was reasonable and constitutional and that other such warrantless searches of public employees' belongings or workspace, where applicable, were similarly permissible as long as they were reasonably work-related in inception and scope.&lt;ref name="Ortega cite"&gt;''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'', {{ussc|480|709|1987}}, O'Connor, J., at 717.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The justices in that majority differed on what standards to use for evaluating the reasonableness of a search of a public employees' personal space and belongings. [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] wrote for a four-justice [[plurality opinion|plurality]] declaring that government employees did not lose their Fourth Amendment rights at work. In the latter instance, since the working environments of public employees can be drastically different, leading to some where no reasonable [[expectation of privacy]] could be argued to exist, lower courts should consider the "operational realities" of the work environment when determining if a public employee's rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated.&lt;ref name="Ortega cite" /&gt; Following the principle laid out in ''[[Connick v. Myers]]'', an earlier decision concerning the constitutional rights of public employees, that "government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter",&lt;ref name="Connick v. Meyers cite"&gt;''[[Connick v. Myers]]'' {{ussc|461|138|1983}}, White, J., at 143.&lt;/ref&gt; the majority distinguished between searches "merely incident to the primary business of the agency," such as the retrieval of a document or tool from a desk or locker and thus not requiring a warrant at all, from those conducted to investigate a possible violation of workplace rules and procedures.&lt;ref name="O'Connor 722"&gt;''O'Connor'', at 722.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[concurring opinion]], [[Antonin Scalia]] rejected the plurality analysis, saying instead that "government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules — searches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private employer context — do not violate the Fourth Amendment".&lt;ref name="Scalia O'Connor concurrence"&gt;''O'Connor'', at 732, Scalia, J., concurring.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Scalia's opinion had provided the case's deciding vote, either it or the plurality could be used by lower courts until another such case were to come to the court and force a resolution of the question. The court would consider the Fourth Amendment rights of public employees again two years later, in 1989's ''[[Treasury Employees v. Von Raab]]''. In that case another divided court upheld the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]]'s requirement that applicants for positions that involved carrying a firearm and the possibility of [[drug interdiction]] undergo [[drug test]]s by [[urinalysis]].

==Litigation==

The case began in federal court. After a district court found in favor of the defendants, a three-judge appellate panel reversed the decision. The circuit court denied a petition for an ''[[en banc]]'' rehearing; a simultaneous ''[[certiorari]]'' petition to the Supreme Court was granted.

A major issue at all levels was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's practice of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace. If it was the former, Quon had no reasonable [[expectation of privacy]] for his pager messages. The city and department argued that Duke could not set or amend policy so what he said was irrelevant. And even if it was, it did not matter since the pager messages could be disclosed under the [[California Public Records Act]]. The [[plaintiff]]s argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was all that mattered.&lt;ref name="Ninth Circuit decision" /&gt;

For Quon's co-plaintiffs, there was what one commentator later called "the really tricky question in the case",&lt;ref name="Kerr on correspondent privacy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Orin |authorlink= Orin Kerr|title =Some Thoughts on the Reply Brief in ''City of Ontario v.

Two of the other plaintiffs were OPD employees who had not had pager overuse problems, and the third, his estranged wife, had left the OPD's employment and was using her own pager.

===Trial===

In 2003 Quon, his ex-wife, girlfriend&lt;ref name="Bloomberg story" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The girlfriend, [[dispatcher]] April Florio, had been one of several in her position fired by the department following an investigation into the alleged use of their personal cell phones to tip off the boyfriend of one, a member of a local [[motorcycle gang]] suspected of drug trafficking.({{cite web|last1=Shaw |first1=Jennifer Brown |last2=Norfleet |first2=Matthew J. |title=Workplace Privacy and Text Messages: Quon v.

Arch was granted [[summary judgment]] in its favor on the SCA claim since it was found to be a remote computing service, not subject to the statute's provisions.

The court ruled that Quon and his fellow [[plaintiff]]s had a [[reasonable expectation of privacy]]. It ordered a [[jury trial]] to determine whether the purpose of the audit was, as the department maintained, to find out whether it needed higher character limits or, as Quon claimed, to expose the personal nature of the texts. When the jury found in favor of the OPD, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants.

===Appeal===

On appeal in 2008, a panel of two [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] judges, [[Kim McLane Wardlaw]] and [[Harry Pregerson]], along with [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|Western Washington]] district judge [[Ronald B. Leighton]]. Wardlaw, writing for all three, noted that "[t]he recently minted standard of electronic communication via e-mails, text messages, and other means opens a new frontier in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that has been little explored".&lt;ref name="Appellate decision at 10"&gt;''Quon v. Arch Wireless'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They agreed with the district court that Quon and his co-appellees had a reasonable expectation of privacy due to the assurances from Duke.

But they reversed since they found the search unreasonable as a matter of law. "The OPD surreptitiously reviewed messages that all parties reasonably believed were free from third-party review", Wardlaw wrote. The OPD could have obtained the information it sought in a number of less intrusive ways without viewing the content of the messages, such as warning Quon ahead of time or asking him to redact personal messages from an unreviewed transcript, she observed.&lt;ref name="Ninth Circuit decision" /&gt;

The ruling was applauded by online privacy advocates. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] called it a "tremendous victory...the Fourth Amendment applies to your communications online just as strongly as it does to your letters and packages".&lt;ref name="NYT blog post on appellate decision"&gt;{{cite news| last=Nizza|first=Mike|title=Who's Snooping on You at Work?|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/whos-snooping-on-you-at-work/| work =The New York Times| date=June 22, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ars Technica]]'' said it "provide[d] an extensive space for workspace privacy".&lt;ref name="Ars Technica"&gt;{{cite news |last=Timmer|first=John| title=X-rated SMS case gives employees some privacy guarantees |url= https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/06/x-rated-sms-case-gives-employees-some-privacy-guarantees.ars| work=[[Ars Technica]]| publisher=[[Condé Nast Digital]] |date =June 20, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The George Washington University Law School|George Washington University law professor]] [[Orin Kerr]], a Fourth Amendment scholar who was cited in the opinion, called it "a noteworthy holding that I think is correct and very important" at the ''[[The Volokh Conspiracy|Volokh Conspiracy]]'' [[blawg]].&lt;ref name="Kerr on appellate ruling"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kerr|first=Orin|authorlink=Orin Kerr |title=Ninth Circuit Finds Fourth Amendment Protection in Text Messages | work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]url=http://volokh.com/2009/12/14/supreme-court-grants-cert-on-fourth-amendment-protection-in-text-messages/||publisher=[[Eugene Volokh]]|date=June 18, 2008|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also overturned the summary judgment granted to Arch on the SCA claim, finding the company to be an electronic communications service and thus subject to stricter privacy requirements. The police chief was granted [[qualified immunity]] due to the lack of clearly established law in the area, while the city and department were denied their claim to statutory immunity. The SCA claims were [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] to district court.&lt;ref name="Ninth Circuit decision" /&gt;
[[File:SandraIkuta.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Judge Ikuta|alt=A woman with curly dark red hair and glasses smiling against a purple background]]
The appellees petitioned for an ''[[en banc]]'' rehearing and were denied early in 2009. Six justices&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Carlos T. Bea]], [[Consuelo Maria Callahan]], [[Sandra Segal Ikuta]], [[Andrew J. Kleinfeld]], [[Diarmuid O'Scannlain]], [[Norman Randy Smith]], and [[Richard C. Tallman]].&lt;/ref&gt; on the circuit dissented. [[Sandra Segal Ikuta]], writing for them, criticized her colleague for two errors. Ikuta insisted the department's policy, and California's [[California Public Records Act|Public Records Act]], mooted any discretionary interpretation of the policy that Duke may have conveyed to Quon, thus denying him a reasonable expectation of privacy. She also reminded Wardlaw that the Supreme Court had several times&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Specifically, she cited ''[[Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association]]'' ({{ussc|489|602|1990}}), ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' ({{ussc|515|646|1995}}) and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' ({{ussc|536|822|2002}})&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the test on which she read Wardlaw's opinion relying on, that governments must use the least intrusive method of obtaining information available in order to protect employees' Fourth Amendment rights, a rule followed by seven other circuits as well.&lt;ref name="en banc denial dissent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Enterprise News en banc denial story"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellis|first=Steven|title= Ninth Circuit Denies En Banc Review in Text Message Privacy Case|url= http://www.metnews.com/articles/2009/quon012809.htm| work=Metropolitan News Enterprise |date= January 28, 2009|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Wardlaw wrote a rare concurrence with the order, criticzing the dissent for ignoring the facts of the case. "[N]o poet ever interpreted nature as freely as [[Sandra Segal Ikuta|Judge Ikuta]] interprets the record on this appeal", she said.  As a matter of law, it was the dissenters, not her, who had ignored ''O'Connor'': "By stripping public employees of all rights to privacy regardless of the actual operational realities of each workplace, the dissent would have us create a far broader rule than Supreme Court precedent allows. The majority of our court properly rejected the dissenting judge's efforts to do so."&lt;ref name="Enterprise News en banc denial story" /&gt;

===''Certiorari'' petition===

Concurrent with the ''en banc'' petition, the appellees filed a ''[[certiorari]]'' petition to the Supreme Court, requesting it hear the case. They reiterated many of Ikuta's points, particularly her criticism of the panel's apparent adoption of the rejected least-intrusive-means test, and said it would be an "excellent vehicle" for revisiting ''O'Connor'' in light of new technology that complicated the workplace privacy issue.&lt;ref name="Certiorari petition"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/ontario_v_quon/certpetition.pdf |title=Petition for a Writ of Certiorari }};  April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A month later the [[California State Association of Counties]] and the [[League of California Cities]] filed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief in support of the petition making the same arguments, but in particular saying the opinion mischaracterized the operational realities of the case.&lt;ref name="Cities and counties amicus brief for certiorari"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/ontario_v_quon/citiesamicus.pdf |title="Brief of the League of California Cities and California State Association of Counties as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioners City of Ontario, Ontario Police Department and Lloyd Scharf" }}, May 29, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition, Quon and the other respondents argued, as Wardlaw's concurrence had, that Ikuta and petitioners had greatly exaggerated the role that the less-intrusive-means test had played in the panel opinion, and that the facts of the case did not present any constitutional issues.&lt;ref name="Respondents' brief opposing certiorari"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/ontario_v_quon/opppet114.pdf |title=Brief in Opposition of Respondents Jeff Quon, et al }}, November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In a reply brief, the petitioners noted that other commentators on the case agreed&lt;ref name="Conforti paper"&gt;Conforti, Justin; {{cite web|url= http://law.shu.edu/Students/academics/journals/circuit-review/upload/conforti_justin_circuit_review.pdf |title=Somebody's Watching Me: Workplace Privacy Interests, Technology Surveillance, and the Ninth Circuit's Missapplication of the Least Intrusive Means test in Quon v.

Late that year, the Supreme Court granted ''[[certiorari]]'' to the city, OPD and Chief Scharf, making the case into ''Ontario v. Quon''.&lt;ref name="NYT cert grant story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cert granted"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121409zor.pdf |title=Order list; December 14, 2009 }}; U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr found this "an odd grant", since he had not expected the Supreme Court to find any issues making the case worth hearing. He suspected the justices were responding to a common issue with cases from the Ninth Circuit, where the minority of judges with politically [[conservatism|conservative]] leanings had reacted vigorously to a perceived excess on the part of the circuit's dominant [[liberalism|liberals]].&lt;ref name="Kerr on cert grant"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kerr| first=Orin|authorlink=Orin Kerr|title= Supreme Court Grants Cert on Fourth Amendment Protection in Text Messages | url = http://volokh.com/2009/12/14/supreme-court-grants-cert-on-fourth-amendment-protection-in-text-messages | publisher=[[Eugene Volokh]]|work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]|date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oral argument]]s were scheduled for April, with a decision expected in June.&lt;ref name="EDiscovery blog"&gt;{{cite news | title = United States Supreme Court Hears Argument on Expectation of Privacy as to Text Messages on Work Pager | url = http://www.ediscoverylaw.com/2010/04/articles/case-summaries/united-states-supreme-court-hears-argument-on-expectation-of-privacy-as-to-text-messages-on-work-pager | publisher=[[K&amp;L Gates]]|date= April 22, 2010| accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the Court==

The decision to hear ''Quon'' attracted attention from several quarters. It would be the first case touching on the workplace privacy rights of public employees since ''Von Raab'', and raised the possibility that the Court would resolve the ''O'Connor'' conflict between Scalia's private-workplace standard and the plurality's "operational realities" consideration. It had not been an issue in the case, but Scalia was the only justice from that majority still on the court.&lt;ref name="Kerr on possible O'Connor revisit"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kerr|first=Orin|authorlink=Orin Kerr|title=Will the Supreme Court Rethink Public Employee Privacy Rights in Quon? |url=http://volokh.com/2009/12/14/will-the-supreme-court-rethink-public-employee-privacy-rights-in-quon | publisher=[[Eugene Volokh]]|work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; New justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] was expected to favor the city's side, since she had ruled for New York State's right to search an employee's computer in a similar case as a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]].&lt;ref name="Double X post on Sotomayor"&gt;.{{cite news| last=Sweck| first=Jessica| title=No More Sexting With Sotomayor on the Court| url=http://www.doublex.com/blog/xxfactor/no-more-sexting-sotomayor-court| work=XXFactor| publisher=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]| date=December 18, 2009| accessdate=November 24, 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417082337/http://www.doublex.com/blog/xxfactor/no-more-sexting-sotomayor-court| archivedate=April 17, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic privacy advocates agreed with Wardlaw that the case was a "new frontier" for Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, since personal communications technology had advanced considerably since 1987, intertwining personal and work lives much more closely. It was expected that the court's ruling, though it would only directly affect government workplaces, would affect the private workplace as well.&lt;ref name="NPR op-ed"&gt;{{cite news| last=Halloran|first=Liz |title=Text-Message Case Could Redefine Workplace Privacy

Kerr told ''The New York Times'' that despite the novelty of the issue, he expected the resulting decision to be narrow due to the unusual circumstances from which the case arose.&lt;ref name="NYT cert grant story" /&gt; Elsewhere, he said the Court would be better off avoiding the question of whether the department violated the privacy of the people Quon was texting due to the lack of clear precedent for such a ruling with older technologies and the minimal treatment of the issue in the lower-court opinions.&lt;ref name="Kerr on hard question" /&gt;

===Briefs===

The parties' briefs reiterated their earlier arguments. "The City and Department should not be punished because a legitimate workplace search happened to turn up sexually explicit messages that plaintiffs need not and should not have sent on government-issued equipment in the first place", the city stated.&lt;ref name="Petitioners' brief"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/ontario_v_quon/briefofpetitioners.pdf |title=Brief for Petitioners }}, February 2010, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The respondents urged the Court to use the case to adopt the ''O'Connor'' plurality's "operational realities" standard, and set forth a more extensive response to the pettioners' claim that the text messages' status as public records was fatal to any reasonable expectation of privacy by any correspondent.&lt;ref name="Respondents' brief"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/ontario_v_quon/briefofrespondents.pdf |title=Brief of Respondents }}, March 2010, 28, 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Amici'' briefs were filed by several interested organizations for both sides. The city was joined by the federal government, represented by the [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]]'s office,&lt;ref name="US amicus"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/ontario_v_quon/USamicusbrief.pdf |title=Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Supporting Reversal }}, February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National League of Cities]] and other organizations representing municipal and county governments&lt;ref name="Cities and counties amicus"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epic.org/privacy/quon/08-1332_PetitionerAmCu5City-StateOrgs.pdf |title="Brief for the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties, International City/County Management Association, U.S. Conference of Mayors and International Municipal Lawyers Association as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners" }}, February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and school-governance organizations led by the [[National School Boards Association]].&lt;ref name="School boards brief"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epic.org/privacy/quon/08-1332_PetitionerAmCu3SchoolBdAssns.pdf |title=Amici Curiae brief for National School Boards Association, the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the California School Boards Association in Support of Petitioners }}; February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; All believed their ability to function effectively as government bodies would be impeded if the Ninth Circuit was upheld. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and other media organizations also urged reversal on the grounds that the public interest was served by as broad a definition of public records as possible, particularly where police operations were concerned.&lt;ref name="Media amicus"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epic.org/privacy/quon/08-1332_PetitionerAmCu8Publishing-NewsGrps.pdf |title=Brief of Amici Curiae Los Angeles Times Communications LLC, the Press-Enterprise Company, the Associated Press, E.W.

The [[New York Intellectual Property Law Association]] (NYIPLA), whose members litigate privacy claims, called on the Court to refrain from setting down any clear rules as technology, and social expectations of privacy related to it, were still evolving.&lt;ref name="NYIPLA brief"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epic.org/privacy/quon/08-1332_RespondentAmCuNYIPLA.pdf |title=Brief for Amicus Curiae New York Intellectual Property Law Association in Support of Respondents }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s brief, signed by technical experts as well as lawyers, focused on the importance of data minimization to both security and privacy protection.&lt;ref name="EPIC amicus"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epic.org/privacy/quon/Quon_Brief_Draft_final.pdf |title=Brief of Amici Curiae Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Legal Scholars and Technical Experts In Support of Respondents }}; March 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] and [[Public Citizen]] filed a joint brief.&lt;ref name="EFF/ACLU/CDT/PC amicus"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epic.org/privacy/quon/08-1332_RespondentAmCu4FreeSpeechOrgs.pdf |title=Brief of Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, American Civil Liberties Union, and Public Citizen As Amici Curiae in Support of Respondents }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative [[Rutherford Institute]] filed a motion requesting leave to file their ''amicus'' in favor of respondents since one withheld permission.&lt;ref name="Rutherford amicus and motion"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epic.org/privacy/quon/08-1332_RespondentAmCuRutherfordInstmotion.pdf |title=Motion for Leave to File Amicus Curiae Brief and Brief for the Rutherford Institute in Support of Respondent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral argument===

[[Oral argument]]s were heard on April 19, 2010. Kent Richland, the city's lawyer, who had previously argued before the justices on behalf of [[Anna Nicole Smith]] in ''[[Marshall v. Marshall]]'',&lt;ref name="Richland page at firm"&gt;{{cite web|title=GMSR: Attorney Profile: Kent L. Richland, partner|url=http://www.gmsr.com/attorneys_profile.cfm?id_attorney=1008|publisher=Greines, Martin, Stein and Richland LLP|year=2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711102412/http://www.gmsr.com/attorneys_profile.cfm?id_attorney=1008|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal argued for petitioners; Dieter Dammeier, a former police officer himself,&lt;ref name="Dammeier page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dieter C.

Quon }}; April 17, 2010; retrieved November 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators, looking for signs as to how the Court would rule, felt the justices' questions suggested a narrow focus on the issue of whether the search was reasonable. Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] surprised some with his apparent strong sympathy for Quon's claims.&lt;ref name="Kerr on oral argument"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kerr|first=Orin|authorlink=Orin Kerr|title=Thoughts on the Oral Argument in ''City of Ontario v.

====Petitioners====

During Richland's argument, the justices inquired closely about the city's contention that Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy over his text messages. Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]] asked Richland about a hypothetical scenario in which a sergeant knew that various officers engaged in sexually explicit texting with romantic partners and decided to look at the transcripts out of sheer salacity. "Does that officer have any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just listen in out of prurient interest?" Richland answered that the motive of the examiner should not affect a privacy expectation. "[W]hen the filthy-minded police chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not—it's not offending your right of privacy," concluded Justice [[Antonin Scalia]].&lt;ref name="Transcript 10–11"&gt;''Oral Argument'', p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] asked how the OPD could have examined the transcripts lawfully if the SCA forbade their release. Richland replied that the statute was complex and highly technical, and cited the Court's 1980 ''[[United States v. Payner]]''&lt;ref name="Payner cite"&gt;''[[United States v. Payner]]'', {{ussc|447|727|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the effect that "a complicated law ... simply cannot be the basis for a reasonable expectation of privacy".&lt;ref name="Transcript 17"&gt;''Oral Argument'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned over the rest of his time to Katyal.

During the Deputy Solicitor General's argument, another recent appointee, Justice [[Samuel Alito]] talked about the uncertainties of modern communications technology. "There isn't a well-established understanding about what is private and what isn't private. It's a little different from putting garbage out in front of your house,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An allusion to the Court's holding in ''[[California v. Greenwood]]'' ({{ussc|486|35|1988}}) that warrantless searches of garbage left out for pickup were not unreasonable and thus constitutional.&lt;/ref&gt; which has happened for a long time". After Katyal agreed that these things were "in flux" and thus the Court should avoid making any broadly applicable rules on the first hearing, Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] speculated that that principle cut both ways and that perhaps the Court should at least say the Constitution applied in this case and make rules later.&lt;ref name="Transcript 21"&gt;''Oral Argument'', p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Respondents====

When Dammeier argued for the respondents, Ginsburg and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]] pressed him on why it was unreasonable for the department to review the content of the messages if it wanted to find out if it needed a higher character limit. The lawyer reiterated the jury's finding and said "they didn't need to do that". In response to further questioning from Breyer, he restated the other ways Judge Wardlaw had suggested the department could have obtained the information without reviewing the messages themselves. Justice Sotomayor was skeptical. "You're relying on the very person you're auditing to do the audit for you. That doesn't seem either practical or business-wise."&lt;ref name="Transcript 30–36"&gt;''Oral Argument'', p. 30–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] brought up the issue of public review. His colleague [[Anthony Kennedy]] noted that attorneys challenging [[probable cause]] for a police raid would probably request the pager messages among other things, which Quon would certainly have been aware of, affecting his expectation of privacy. Dammeier responded that any mail he or anyone else sends would certainly be [[discovery (law)|discoverable]] in litigation, but that possibility did not materially affect his expectation of privacy over it. He further reminded Scalia that in ''O'Connor'' the Court had found a reasonable expectation of privacy over the contents of a public employee's desk. Stevens pointed out that it was more likely that law enforcement communications would be reviewed by third parties than documents in doctors' desks. "I don't think we're taking away the government's ability to do searches under proper circumstances," Dammeier told him.&lt;ref name="Transcript 38–41"&gt;''Oral Argument'', p. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dammeier addressed the SCA and Richland's argument that it was too complex to bear on the reasonableness of Quon's expectation of privacy. "It certainly may be not the end-all to the question, but it should be a factor in determining whether or not there’s going to be an expectation of privacy". Scalia said he had not been aware of the statute, and asked if it was reasonable to assume that Quon did. "Petitioners make an argument that because there is this California Public Records Act, that that may diminish one's expectation of privacy", Dammeier said. "Certainly, if we're going to have that, then we should also be having the Stored Communications Act."&lt;ref name="Transcript 44–46"&gt;''Oral Argument'', p. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of Dammeier's argument was devoted to the issue of the other respondents' privacy expectations in communicating with Quon, after Sotomayor asked him if they could prevail even if Quon did not. Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. "[W]hen I get a piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well", the lawyer replied, "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it". Richland replied in his rebuttal argument that "the truth is that all of these plaintiffs admitted that they knew that this was a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a post office".&lt;ref name="Transcript 46–57"&gt;''Oral Argument'', p. 46–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==

The Court handed down its decision in June, near the end of its term. Unanimously, the justices ruled for the city that the review of the texts had been a reasonable work-related search, discussing the difficulties raised by the broader issues involved and ultimately declining to rule on them. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion; Scalia and Stevens added concurrences of their own.

===Majority===

Kennedy began by setting forth the facts of the case, its legal history and the relevant laws and precedent. In the opinion's third section, he cautiously considered the question of Quon's privacy expectation. "The judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear," he observed, referencing the Court's ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' decision in 1928,&lt;ref name="Olmstead cite"&gt;''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'', {{ussc|277|438|1928}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it had permitted warrantless [[wiretapping]] on the grounds that the wiretaps did not actually enter the property of the [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]s under investigation, and the ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' decision&lt;ref name="Katz cite"&gt;''[[Katz v. United States]]'', {{ussc|389|347|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which overruled it four decades later.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion"&gt;''{{cite web|url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1332.pdf |title=Ontario v. Quon }}'', 560 U.S. ___ (2010), Kennedy, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that latter case, he wrote, the Court had the "knowledge and experience" to conclude that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in a telephone booth. "It is not so clear that courts at present are on so sure a ground". He elaborated on these uncertainties, referring to the ''amici'' briefs filed by the EFF and [[New York Intellectual Property Law Association|NYIPLA]]:

{{quote|Prudence counsels caution before the facts in the instant case are used to establish far-reaching premises that define the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations enjoyed by employees when using employer-provided communication devices.

Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission are evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior. As one ''amici'' brief notes, many employers expect or at least tolerate personal use of such equipment by employees because it often increases worker efficiency. At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms, and the law's treatment of them, will evolve.

Even if the Court were certain that the ''O'Connor'' plurality's approach were the right one, the Court would have difficulty predicting how employees' privacy expectations will be shaped by those changes or the degree to which society will be prepared to recognize those expectations as reasonable.}}

For instance, he noted that the ready availability of cell phones made them potentially "necessary instruments for self-expression, even self-identification", strengthening a privacy claim. But at the same time they were affordable enough that anyone wanting one for such a purpose could buy their own rather than use one provided by an employer&lt;ref name="Majority opinion" /&gt;

"A broad holding concerning employees' privacy expectations vis-à-vis employer-provided technological equipment might have implications for future cases that cannot be predicted," Kennedy wrote. "It is preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds." He accepted, for argument's sake, three points: that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his pager messages, that the review of them constituted a search and that the same principles governing a physical search of a public employee's workspace applied to electronic privacy.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion" /&gt;
[[File:Anthony Kennedy Official.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Justice Kennedy|alt=A balding old man with glasses, wearing a black robe and seated in front of a red curtain]]
On those grounds, the search had been reasonable under ''O'Connor''. Its inception, to see whether the city needed a higher character limit, was legitimately work-related. Review of the content of the messages was an "efficient and expedient" way of achieving that goal, Kennedy wrote. The OPD's decision to limit the review to just two months' worth of messages, and redact those sent when Quon was off duty further bolstered its case.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion" /&gt;

While Quon could have had some expectation of privacy, Kennedy continued, it could not have been enough to prevent a review of the messages. Not only had he been told of the possibility of an audit, but as a police officer "he would or should have known that his actions were likely to come under legal scrutiny, and that this might entail an analysis of his on-the-job communications". And, in particular, since the city had purchased pagers for SWAT team members to improve their performance in that capacity, it was reasonable to expect that the city might audit those pagers to assess the performance of both the units and the pagers in SWAT situations.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion" /&gt;

Citing the same precedent cases that Ikuta had in her dissent from the rehearing denial, Kennedy said the Ninth Circuit erred in suggesting less intrusive means would have yielded the same information. After quoting from those cases to the effect that the text was not required and that letting judges apply it would make effective investigations almost impossible, he concluded that "[e]ven assuming there were ways that OPD could have performed the search that would have been less intrusive, it does not follow that the search as conducted was unreasonable."&lt;ref name="Majority opinion" /&gt;

He could not find any legal authority or precedent for the respondents' argument that the SCA violation, which was not before the Court, rendered the search ''per se'' unconstitutional. To the contrary, he pointed to the ''[[Virginia v. Moore]]'' case&lt;ref name="Moore cite"&gt;''[[Virginia v. Moore]]'', {{ussc|553|164|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; decided the previous term, in which evidence from a search conducted after an illegal arrest was ruled admissible since statutory violations did not inherently constitute Fourth Amendment violations. Nor would an SCA violation have rendered the actions of petitioners unconstitutional since they themselves did not violate it. "The otherwise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreasonable by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by turning over the transcripts".&lt;ref name="Majority opinion" /&gt;

Lastly, he ruled that the other respondents beside Quon had not suffered a violation of their privacy. The respondents had, Kennedy wrote, simply argued that a violation of Quon's privacy necessarily violated that of those he exchanged messages with, and did not make a case that they could have suffered a violation even if Quon had not. Since the Court had found that Quon's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated, it therefore had to hold that the others' were not, either.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion" /&gt;

===Concurrences===

Stevens' brief concurrence approved of the Court's decision not to resolve the split in standards left by ''O'Connor''. He noted that the facts of the case argued more strongly for the standard proposed by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] in his dissent, which Stevens had joined. Blackmun had said the justices should adopt neither the plurality's  "operational realities" standard nor Scalia's reasonable-in-the-private-sector alternative, but instead consider the circumstances of each particular search. In this case, he reiterated his line of reasoning from oral argument, that Quon's position as a police officer would have seriously limited his expectation of privacy.&lt;ref name="Stevens concurrence"&gt;''Quon'', Stevens, J., concurring.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia, too, began by addressing ''O'Connor''. The intervening years had not changed his position that the plurality's position in that case was "standardless and unsupported." Nor, a footnote responding to Stevens added, was the approach of that case's dissent relevant unless it was overruled at some point. Applying the test from his concurrence in that case to the instant case, he wrote, "the proper threshold inquiry should be not whether the Fourth Amendment applies to messages on ''public'' employees' employer-issued pagers, but whether it applies ''in general'' to such messages on employer-issued pagers". But it was unnecessary to answer that question since he agreed with the majority that the search had been reasonable.&lt;ref name="Scalia concurrence"&gt;''Quon'', Scalia, J., concurring.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, he felt, that was all the Court needed to say, the majority's "[[wikt:excursus|excursus]] on the complexity and consequences of answering ... that admittedly irrelevant threshold question" was similarly a waste of effort. "To whom do we owe an ''additional'' explanation for declining to decide an issue, once we have explained that it makes no difference?" He then excoriated the majority's "exaggerated" case for restraint:
{{quote|Applying the Fourth Amendment to new technologies may sometimes be difficult, but when it is necessary to decide a case we have no choice. The Court's implication ... that where electronic privacy is concerned we should decide less than we otherwise would (that is, less than the principle of law necessary to resolve the case and guide private action)—or that we should hedge our bets by concocting case-specific standards or issuing opaque opinions—is in my view indefensible. The-times-they-are-a-changin' is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty.}}
It was "a heavy-handed hint" to lower courts and future litigants that was likely to encourage even more such suits in the future. "In short, in saying why it is not saying more, the Court says much more than it should."&lt;ref name="Scalia concurrence" /&gt;
[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Justice Scalia|alt=A photographic portrait of the head and upper body of a man with a receding dark hairline, wearing glasses and a black robe]]
Lastly, he found it ironic that the Court had relied on the plurality standard in ''O'Connor'', since its discussion would make it even harder to assess what the operating realities of the workplace were. "Any rule that requires evaluating whether a given gadget is a 'necessary instrumen[t] for self-expression, even self-identification,' on top of assessing the degree to which 'the law's treatment of [workplace norms has] evolve[d],' ... is (to put it mildly)  unlikely to yield objective answers."&lt;ref name="Scalia concurrence" /&gt;

==Reaction==

Commentary on the decision focused on the broader issues the Court did not decide. An [[editorial]] in ''The New York Times'' praised the majority's restraint.&lt;ref name="NYT decision editorial"&gt;{{cite news|title=Privacy in the Cellular Age|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/opinion/19sat2.html |accessdate=November 30, 2010| work =The New York Times| date= June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Holding off from making broad pronouncements in the midst of a rapidly changing technology environment is a wise display of restraint by the court," agreed ''[[The Washington Post]]'' three weeks later.&lt;ref name="WashPost editorial"&gt;{{cite news| title= Police were right to monitor personal use of office cellphone|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/11/AR2010071103119.html| accessdate=November 30, 2010| work =[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF likewise praised the limited scope of the decision and found "hopeful hints" in Kennedy's explanation of the cautious approach suggesting that the Court would "cautiously make such decisions based on society's privacy expectations and its level of reliance on new communications technologies". It called on Congress to pass proposed legislation that addressed these issues.&lt;ref name="EFF response"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bankston|first=Kevin|title= Hopeful Signs in Supreme Court's New Text Messaging Privacy Decision, ''City of Ontario v.

EPIC president [[Marc Rotenberg]] was dismayed by the Court's caution. "[T]he court could have done what it has done in the past and updated constitutional safeguards in light of new technology", as it did in ''Katz'', he said in a letter responding to the ''Times'' editorial. That case had influenced privacy law internationally, and "the court's reluctance to assess these privacy issues also means that it will have less influence on other high courts that address similar questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rotenberg|first=Marc|title=Privacy and Text Messages |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/opinion/l23privacy.html|accessdate=November 30, 2010| work =The New York Times|date=June 23, 2010|authorlink=Marc Rotenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent jurisprudence==

Scalia's criticism was echoed by [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]] judge [[Frank M. Hull]] in a case reheard to take ''Quon'' into account. In March 2010, she had written for a panel deciding ''Rehberg v. Paulk'', a case in which a Georgia man had sued the [[Dougherty County, Georgia|Dougherty County]] [[district attorney]] alleging [[malicious prosecution]] for an investigation into harassing faxes sent to a local hospital. Rehberg had also claimed his privacy was violated by his [[Internet Service Provider]]'s (ISP) release of his emails from its [[server (computing)|server]] in response to a [[subpoena]].&lt;ref name="Rehberg v. Paulk 1"&gt;''Rehberg'', at 839.&lt;/ref&gt;

No appeals court [[first impression (law)|had yet been called upon to decide]] whether users had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the content of email. Hull's opinion extrapolated from older precedents on postal and telephone communications, along with more recent cases from district courts and a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit]] ruling on email addresses, to assert that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy over email content once it reached a third-party server, since it was transmitted from there to other servers and copied and archived along the way. There was at the time no settled law on the subject, and privacy advocates expressed concern and criticized the decision.&lt;ref name="Kerr criticism of Rehberg 1"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kerr|first=Orin|authorlink =Orin Kerr|title=Eleventh Circuit Decision Largely Eliminates Fourth Amendment Protection in E-Mail|url= http://volokh.com/2010/03/15/eleventh-circuit-decision-largely-eliminates-fourth-amendment-protection-in-e-mail | publisher=[[Eugene Volokh]]|work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]|date=March 15, 2010|accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Quon'', the panel granted rehearing.

The new decision, handed down a month after ''Quon'', followed it in declining to establish a precedent. "The Supreme Court's more-recent precedent shows a marked lack of clarity in what privacy expectations as to content of electronic communications are reasonable...Given the lack of precedent, we now question whether it would be prudent in this case and on this limited factual record to establish broad precedent as to the reasonable privacy expectation in email content". The panel thus limited its decision to finding for the appellees on [[qualified immunity]] grounds.&lt;ref name="Rehberg v. Paulk 2" /&gt;

The criticism from within and without led to an article by ''New York Times'' Supreme Court reporter [[Adam Liptak]] finding ''Quon'' emblematic of two trends observers found increasingly problematic in [[Roberts Court]] opinions: vagueness, and apparent unanimity undermined by multiple concurring opinions. It had been among the record 77% of unanimous decisions from the term with at least one concurrence; as for the former issue, he characterized Hull's description of ''Quon'' as calling it "almost aggressively unhelpful to lawyers and judges".&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

==Analysis and commentary==

A ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' article criticized the decision, concurring with Scalia and Hull that it provided "no helpful guidance" to lower courts in resolving similar cases. "[I]ts reluctance to devise an intelligible principle for Fourth Amendment rights regarding technology will have the negative effect of causing lower courts to rely on ''O'Connor'' to an even greater extent, [allowing] judges...to reach whatever conclusion they want. The Court should have ruled that public employees do not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy when sending text messages from government-issued devices."&lt;ref name="Harvard Law Review article"&gt;{{Cite journal |title =Reasonable Expectation of Privacy: ''City of Ontario v. Quon'' |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] | volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=179–188|url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/media/pdf/vol_12401city_ontario_v_quon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article noted the irony of Kennedy's musings about the difficulty of crafting privacy standards with technology evolving at a rapid pace when applied to a case that turned on text messages sent on "two-way pager devices that were issued to employees a decade ago and that would likely be deemed antiquated by today's teenagers and young professionals", who largely tend to use cell phones for texting. "Presumably, [[Norm (social)|societal norms]] with respect to pagers are as developed as they will ever be." Nor could it see work-related employer-issued pagers or other devices being used for self-expressive purposes as Kennedy suggested, since they were functionally no different from any other such item a police department might issue to officers, "much like a police officer's [[Police car|patrol cruiser]] or [[Side arm|sidearm]]".&lt;ref name="HLR 185"&gt;''Harvard'', 185.&lt;/ref&gt; It did concede that the conflict between the department's written policy and Lt. Duke's verbal assurances to Quon made the issue more complex in this particular case.&lt;ref name="HLR 186–88"&gt;''Harvard Law Review'', 186–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's apparent suggestion that "any technology can be seen as emerging", the ''Review'' suggested, would not only lead to muddled future jurisprudence, but was in contrast to various lower courts' more successful efforts to do so.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Specifically, it cited ''Biby v. Board of Regents'' (419 F.3d 845 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Cir]]. 2005), in which a public university's written policy was held to foreclose any expectation of privacy on employee's computers, and ''United States v. Simons'' (29 F.Supp. 2d 324 ([[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|E.D. Va.]] 1998), where it was held that actual office policies and procedures may reduce a public employee's privacy expectations over their desks, files and computers.&lt;/ref&gt; "While it may be true that technological advances and the increased availability of advanced mobile handsets to individual consumers have blurred the line between private life and the workplace", the article concluded, "it does not necessarily follow that a user has a reasonable expectation of privacy on workplace equipment provided by the employer". As Kennedy had also noted, the proliferation of personal communications devices could make workers more respectful of those distinctions. The ''Review'' cited as an example the widespread use of [[email]] from work computers.&lt;ref name="HLR 186–88" /&gt;

Another commentator took it upon herself to address the issues the Court left unresolved, even before it had heard oral arguments. "Because this holding is so limited, it practically begs for a new case to address the issue more broadly", wrote Amanda Higgins of the Ninth Circuit's opinions, in the ''Oklahoma Journal of Law and Technology''. She agreed with Ikuta's criticism of the panel decision, but argued that the panel should have devoted more attention to the larger issues of Quon's expectation of privacy. "To focus the analysis elsewhere is less than helpful in this already murky area of law".&lt;ref name="Higgins OKJOLT paper"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Not So Fast: ''Quon v. Arch Wireless'' Is Not Employees' Right to Text the Day Away| url= http://www.okjolt.org/images/pdf/2010okjoltrev48.pdf|journal= Oklahoma Journal of Law &amp; Technology |volume= 6|pages=48–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury's finding that the audit was legitimately work-related and not an investigation of misconduct may ultimately have hurt the city, Higgins wrote, since it focused attention on whether it was necessary to read the messages. Had it been found to be investigatory, there would have been more grounds to rule the audit a reasonable search. Other public employers facing similar litigation "will want to get on the court record that their search was for some purpose that will not only pass as reasonable at its inception under the facts of the case...and will also allow the court to find that the actual method was not excessive in relation to the purpose". They would be best served, she concluded, by making clear, explicit policies on personal use of communications devices and rigorously enforcing those policies. Informal policies in partial or complete conflict with formal ones had created problems for employers in other areas of the law, and it was better to prevent such lawsuits from arising altogether.&lt;ref name="Higgins 71–72"&gt;Higgins, 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">In the law, a '''close case''' is generally defined as a ruling that could conceivably be decided in more than one way.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Maureen Armoor, ''Rethinking Judicial Discretion: Sanctions and the Conundrum of the Close Case'', 50 {{smallcaps|S.M.U. L. Rev.}} 493, 496 (1997); Ward Farnsworth, ''[http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/volume86n5/documents/farnsworthv.2.pdf The Role of Law in Close Cases: Some Evidence from the Federal Courts of Appeals]'', 86 {{smallcaps|B.U. L. Rev.}} 1083, 1095 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Various scholars have attempted to articulate criteria for identifying close cases,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''The Selection of Interim Justices in California: An Empirical Study'', 32 {{smallcaps|Stan. L. Rev.}} 433, 437 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and commentators have observed that reliance upon [[precedent]] established in close cases leads to the gradual expansion of legal doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Calabresi, ''[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3105&amp;context=fss_papers The Exclusionary Rule]'', 26 {{smallcaps|Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y}} 111, 112 (2003) (characterizing this process as a "slippery slope").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying close cases==
Although some scholars have suggested that "a close case is in the eye of the beholder",&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Jr. Watkins; Daniel G. Kyle, ''A Proposal for the Operation of Section 534 with Section 535'', 52 {{smallcaps|Taxes}} 240, 248 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have attempted to articulate specific criteria for identifying close cases.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''The Selection of Interim Justices in California: An Empirical Study'', 32 {{smallcaps|Stan. L. Rev.}} 433, 437 (1980); Maureen Armoor, ''Rethinking Judicial Discretion: Sanctions and the Conundrum of the Close Case'', 50 {{smallcaps|S.M.U. L. Rev.}} 493, 496 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Armoor, for example, defines close cases as "the articulable outer limit of judicial discretion that most closely approximates the phenomenological experience of a sitting judge, in particular the dimension of discretion called into play when a judge is uncertain about an outcome".&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Armoor, ''Rethinking Judicial Discretion: Sanctions and the Conundrum of the Close Case'', 50 {{smallcaps|S.M.U. L. Rev.}} 493, 496 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ward Farnsworth]], dean of the [[University of Texas School of Law]], has suggested that close cases could be defined as either "cases close enough to provoke dissent" or cases that "are flexible enough to comfortably admit of more than one reading".&lt;ref&gt;Ward Farnsworth, ''[http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/volume86n5/documents/farnsworthv.2.pdf The Role of Law in Close Cases: Some Evidence from the Federal Courts of Appeals]'', 86 {{smallcaps|B.U. L. Rev.}} 1083, 1088, 1095 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a 1980 comment in the ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'' defined close cases as appellate decisions that generated multiple dissenting opinions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Selection of Interim Justices in California: An Empirical Study'', 32 {{smallcaps|Stan. L. Rev.}} 433, 437 (1980); see also Stephen R. Barnett; Daniel L. Rubinfeld, ''The Assignment of Temporary Justices in the California Supreme Court'', 17 {{smallcaps|Pac. L. J.}} 1045, 1064–67 (1986) (critiquing the methodology of the Stanford study).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of close cases==
Northwestern University law professor John E. Coons observed that "[u]nder a system of winner-take-all the one-sided result reached upon principle in the close case must continue to trouble the conscience of the law".&lt;ref&gt;John E. Coons, ''[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2242&amp;context=facpubs Approaches to Court Imposed Compromise-The Uses of Doubt and Reason]'', 58 {{smallcaps|Nw. U. L. Rev.}} 750, 751 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Guido Calabresi]], a former dean of [[Yale Law School]], noted that close cases create a "[[slippery slope]]", where the "next close case comes up and the precedent [established in the last close case] is applied: same thing, same thumb on the scale, same decision".&lt;ref&gt;[[Guido Calabresi]], ''[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3105&amp;context=fss_papers The Exclusionary Rule]'', 26 {{smallcaps|Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y}} 111, 112 (2003) (noting that Chief Judge [[John M. Walker, Jr.]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] described this process as "[t]he hydraulic effect").&lt;/ref&gt; Calabresi argued that this process ultimately leads to the ongoing expansion of doctrine that was originally established only on a narrow basis.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Calabresi, ''[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3105&amp;context=fss_papers The Exclusionary Rule]'', 26 {{smallcaps|Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y}} 111, 112 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Ward Farnsworth has argued that judges often resolve close cases "according to beliefs the judges bring to the case that don’t owe much to law".&lt;ref&gt;Ward Farnsworth, ''[http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/volume86n5/documents/farnsworthv.2.pdf The Role of Law in Close Cases: Some Evidence from the Federal Courts of Appeals]'', 86 {{smallcaps|B.U.

'''''Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda''''', 2012 SCC  17, is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] that has brought greater certainty to the question of a [[real and substantial connection]] in the assumption of civil jurisdiction by Canadian courts in matters concerning the [[conflict of laws]].

==The facts==

In separate cases, two individuals were injured while on vacation outside of Canada.  Van Breda suffered [[Catastrophic injury|catastrophic injuries]] on a beach in [[Cuba]], and Charron died while scuba diving there. Actions were brought in Ontario against a number of parties, including Club Resorts Ltd., a company incorporated in the [[Cayman Islands]], that managed the two hotels where the accidents occurred.

Club Resorts sought to block those proceedings, arguing that:

:* the Ontario courts lacked jurisdiction, and, in the alternative,
:* a Cuban court would be a more appropriate forum on the basis of the doctrine of ''[[forum non conveniens]]''.

In both cases, the judges at first instance held that Ontario courts did have jurisdiction, and that an Ontario court was the more appropriate forum. The two cases were heard together by the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]], where the appeals were both dismissed. Both were subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

==At the Supreme Court of Canada==

In a 7-0 ruling, both appeals were dismissed.

Lebel J. observed that the case concerned the elaboration of the [[real and substantial connection]] test as an appropriate common law conflicts rule for the assumption of jurisdiction.  In determining whether a court can assume jurisdiction over a certain claim, the preferred approach in Canada has been to rely on a set of specific factors which are given presumptive effect, as opposed to a regime based on an exercise of almost pure and individualized judicial discretion.

Jurisdiction must be established primarily on the basis of objective factors that connect the legal situation or the subject matter of the litigation with the forum. In a case concerning a tort, the following factors are presumptive connecting factors that, ''[[prima facie]]'', entitle a court to assume jurisdiction over a dispute:

:* the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;
:* the defendant carries on business in the province;
:* the tort was committed in the province; and
:* a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.

The list above is not an exhaustive one. In identifying new presumptive factors, a court should look to connections that give rise to a relationship with the forum that is similar in nature to the ones which result from the listed factors.  Relevant considerations include:

:* Similarity of the connecting factor with the recognized presumptive connecting factors;
:* Treatment of the connecting factor in the case law;
:* Treatment of the connecting factor in statute law; and
:* Treatment of the connecting factor in the [[private international law]] of other legal systems with a shared commitment to order, fairness and [[comity]].

A clear distinction must be drawn between the existence and the exercise of jurisdiction.  Once jurisdiction is established, if the defendant does not raise further objections, the litigation proceeds before the court of the forum.  The court cannot decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless the defendant invokes ''forum non conveniens''.  The decision to raise this doctrine rests with the parties, not with the court seized of the claim.  If a defendant raises an issue of ''forum non conveniens'', the burden is on him or her to show why the court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction and displace the forum chosen by the plaintiff. Ultimately, the decision falls within the reasoned discretion of the trial court.  This exercise of discretion will be entitled to deference from higher courts, absent an error of law or a clear and serious error in the determination of relevant facts which takes place at an interlocutory or preliminary stage.

===Application to the appeals at hand===

In the ''Van Breda'' case:

:* a contract was entered into in Ontario
:* Club Resorts failed to rebut the resulting presumption of jurisdiction
:* Club Resorts failed to show that a Cuban court would clearly be a more appropriate forum
:* issues related to the fairness to the parties and to the efficient disposition of the claim must be considered, as a trial held in Cuba would present serious challenges to the parties.

Therefore, the Ontario court was the more appropriate venue.

In the ''Charron'' case:

:* Club Resorts was carrying on a business in Ontario
:* its activities in Ontario went well beyond promoting a brand and advertising
:* it benefitted from the physical presence of an office in Ontario
:* Club Resorts failed to rebut the resulting presumption of jurisdiction
:* Club Resorts failed to show that a Cuban court would clearly be a more appropriate forum

Therefore, considerations of fairness to the parties weighed heavily in favour of the plaintiffs.

==Aftermath==

''Van Breda'' builds upon the jurisprudence the SCC has established in this matter, which includes the previous rulings issued in:

:* ''[[Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye]]''
:* ''[[Hunt v. T&amp;N plc]]'' and
:* ''[[Beals v. Saldanha]]''

It also replaces a previous attempt by the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] to standardize the jurisprudence in this area in ''Muscutt v. Courcelles''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iijcan.org/on/cas/onca/2002/2002onca10271.html ''Muscutt v. Courcelles'', (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20 (Ont. C.A.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Van Breda'' was immediately applied to two other judgments handed down by the SCC on the same day, which were concerned with [[libel]]:

:* ''Éditions Écosociété Inc. v. Banro Corp.'', 2012 SCC 18&lt;ref&gt;{{lexum-scc|2012|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''Breeden v. Black'', 2012 SCC 19&lt;ref&gt;{{lexum-scc|2012|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both of these cases, the Ontario court was determined to be the most appropriate forum as well. This has raised the concern that the incidence of [[libel tourism]] to Canadian courts may increase as a result. In addition, the question of which substantive law should be applied in multijurisdictional claims has been left unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supreme Court Clarifies Law of Assumed Jurisdiction Over Foreign Defendants|author1 = Paul B. Schabas|author2 = Ryder L. Gilliland|author3 = Erin Hoult|author4 = Max Shapiro|url = http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=5319|date = 2012-04-19|publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP]]|accessdate = 2012-04-19|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120721014113/http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=5319|archivedate = 2012-07-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The determination of whether an entity is carrying on a business in a Canadian jurisdiction is also impacted, as the SCC expressed a preference for a physical presence, as opposed to a virtual presence. This may need to be explored further in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supreme Court of Canada Revamps the Test for Jurisdiction over Foreign Defendants|author1=Larry Lowenstein |author2=Andrea Laing |author3=Mary Paterson |author4=Robert Carson |url = http://www.osler.com/NewsResources/Supreme-Court-of-Canada-Revamps-the-Test-for-Jurisdiction-over-Foreign-Defendants/|date = 2012-04-19|publisher = [[Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt]]|accessdate = 2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Van Breda'' also confirms that foreign companies that reside, conduct business or enter into agreements in a Canadian province will be subject to its jurisdiction, unless they can rebut the presumption of a real and substantial connection to the Canadian jurisdiction, or include exclusive forum or arbitration clauses in their contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Restraining the long arm of Ontario courts: Supreme Court of Canada clarifies private international law|author1 = Robert Wisner|author2 = Laura Stefan|url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/restraining-the-long-arm-of-Ontario-courts-Supreme-Court-of-Canada-clarifies-private-international-law|date = 2012-04-19|publisher = [[McMillan LLP]]|accessdate = 2012-04-19|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121106035313/http://mcmillan.ca/restraining-the-long-arm-of-Ontario-courts-Supreme-Court-of-Canada-clarifies-private-international-law|archivedate = 2012-11-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1724">The '''Comisión Federal de Competencia''' (CFC), or '''Federal Competition Commission''', is an agency of the government of [[Mexico]], under the Ministry of Economy. Established in 1993, it is responsible for implementation of the [[Federal Economic Competition Law]] (LFCE).

The CFC was established in 1993. It is headed by five commissioners who serve 10-year terms, who are appointed by the [[President of Mexico|Mexican president]]. One commissioner serves as president of the commission. The CFC also employs 175 other people, including 41 support staff.

The mission of the CFC is to "protect the process of competition and free access to markets, through the prevention and elimination of monopolistic practices and other restrictions to market efficiency, in order to contribute to societal welfare." Functions of the CFC include approval of [[mergers and acquisitions]], investigating and penalizing [[monopoly|monopolistic]] conduct, authorizing business activities in regulated sectors, and advocacy for competition in the marketplace. Article 28 of [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexico's constitution]] prohibits monopolies, but a more complete competition policy was set out in the LFCE (1993).

The '''Convention on the issue of multilingual extracts from civil status records ({{Lang-fr|Convention du 8 septembre 1976 relative à la délivrance d'extraits plurilingues d'actes de l'état civil }})''' is a multilateral convention, drafted by the [[International Commission on Civil Status]] which defines a uniform format for extracts on [[civil status]] ([[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]], [[death certificate|death]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Commission on Civil Status|La Commission Internationale de l'État Civil]] (accessed 26 July 2010) [http://www.ciec1.org/Conventions/Conv16Angl.pdf Convention Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112143/http://www.ciec1.org/Conventions/Conv16Angl.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention was signed in [[Vienna]] 8 September 1976 by 12 European states, and entered into force 30 July 1983 upon the ratification of the 5th state. As 17 October 2015, the convention is in force in 23 European countries and Cape Verde; the convention is open for accession to any state.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs (accessed 28 March 2011) [http://www.minbuza.nl/en/Key_Topics/Treaties/Search_the_Treaty_Database?isn=001693 Detailpage treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obligations==
State parties are obliged to issue multilingual extracts on request and accept the abstracts of other countries and handle them not differently from national extracts: "they shall be handled without legislation or equivalent formality in the territory of each state". They should provide translations of basic items on status records (e.g. Death of the husband) for inclusion by the other state parties.

==Format==
Extracts are to be produced in the language of the issuing country, in French and one other language on the front with optional translations in the other deposited languages on the back. The certificates are known as ''Formule A'' for births, ''Formule B'' for marriages and ''Formule C'' for deaths.

==History==

At its launch in May 2007, the Copyright Alliance was founded by four Board members, ASCAP, Broadcast Music Inc., the Motion Picture Association of America and Universal. It was initially created and masterminded by the President and CEO Jack Valenti, of the Motion Picture Association of America. Music Legends Steve Cropper and Lamont Dozier attended the launch, that included a membership of 29 organizations purporting to represent 11 million workers, including the [[Association of American Publishers]], [[Microsoft]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], [[Viacom]] and [[Walt Disney]].&lt;ref name="Broache"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Backers+of+stronger+copyright+laws+form+lobby+group/2100-1028_3-6184604.html?part=rss&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20&amp;subj=news|title=Backers of stronger copyright laws form lobby group|last=Broache|first=Anne|date=May 17, 2007|work=CNET News.com|accessdate=2007-09-09}}  (also available from [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707190504/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-6184604.html])&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the Copyright Alliance was supported by [[U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee]] Chairman [[John Conyers]] (D-MI), ranking Representative [[Howard Coble]] (R-NC), and Representative [[Howard Berman]] (D-CA), members of the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet]].  Berman, speaking of his inspiration by the late [[Jack Valenti]], spoke of "the constant assaults on copyright law" and called the group's launch "a tremendous idea".&lt;ref name=Broache /&gt; Coble said that "Digitization and related technologies beg some changes to the copyright laws, and I wish you the best of luck and my support as you roll out the Copyright Alliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3678611|title=Will Copyright Alliance's Wax Trigger YouTube's Wane? |first=Clint|last= Boulton |date=May 18, 2007| work=internetnews.com| accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copyright Alliance was launched in opposition to the [[Digital Freedom Campaign]], formed the preceding October, whose members include the [[Consumer Electronics Association]], [[Public Knowledge]], and the [[Electronic Freedom Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Broache /&gt;

Patrick Ross served as executive director for four years until succeeded by [[Sandra Aistars]] on December 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightalliance.org/news.php?id=101|title=Sandra Aistars named executive director, Alliance board announces|publisher=Copyright Alliance|date=December 20, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to taking the position Aistars was Vice President and Associate General Counsel at Time Warner. On September 15, 2015, it was announced that Keith Kupferschmid would succeed Sandra Aistars as CEO of the Copyright Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=Copyright Alliance Names New CEO|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/copyright-alliance-new-ceo-keith-kupferschmid-1201593987/|website=Variety|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kupferschmid previously served as General Counsel and Senior Vice President for Intellectual Property at the [[Software and Information Industry Association]] (SIIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright Alliance Leadership|url=http://copyrightalliance.org/about/leadership/|website=Copyright Alliance|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

In 2009, the organization presented a letter to the White House asking it to pursue policies supportive of artists' rights signed by 11,000 artists and creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/artists-lobby-copyright-support-91358| title=Artists lobby for copyright support |journal=The Hollywood Reporter | date=November 16, 2009 | author=Georg Szalai| accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the Copyright Alliance has collaborated with various groups. In 2014, it helped the [[US Copyright Office]] present its 2014 [[World IP Day]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-069.html | title=2014 World Intellectual Property Day Celebration to Focus on Movies | publisher=Library of Congress | date=April 18, 2014 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, it also hosted a briefing on Capitol Hill with the Creative Rights Caucus to "discuss the challenges photographers and visual artists face in the internet age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://creativerightscaucus-chu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/crc-copyright-alliance-host-briefing-on-challenges-to-photography-in-the | title=CRC, Copyright Alliance host Briefing on Challenges to Photography in the Digital Age| date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=September 12, 2015|publisher=Creative Rights Caucus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also works with groups such as [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Public Knowledge]] to develop voluntary best practices for addressing online copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/sony-google-hollywood-piracy-113720.html | title=Google vs Hollywood on Sony hack| author=Alex Byers | publisher=Politico|date=December 20, 2014 | accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political issues==

The group supported an IP-PRO bill establishing a "copyright czar" in June 2008 [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0842621320080608?src=RSS-ENT|title=Nancy Sinatra joins the fight for radio royalty|author=Brooks Boliek|publisher=Reuters|date=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PRO-IP]] bill was introduced in the Senate shortly thereafter and passed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.3325:|title=S. 3325 at thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ars Technica]] called the bill a victory for "Big Content", though a provision for the Department of Justice to join suits for the benefit of copyright holders was stripped from the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/10/bush-signs-pro-ip-act-big-content-gloats.ars|title=Big Content gloats as Bush signs PRO-IP Act|author=Nate Anderson|publisher=Ars Technica|date=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2009, the Copyright Alliance was joined by some of its grassroots members in hand-delivering a letter to the White House signed by more than 11,000 artists and creators, calling on President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden to defend the rights of artists and creators.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In May 2009, it launched the Creators Across America campaign, which includes videos of artists and creators across the United States speaking about their arts and their rights under [[copyright]] law.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Copyright Alliance received $600,000 from the MPAA in 2012, which that year had also donated $475,000 to the [[Center for Copyright Information]] and $100,000 each to the [[Democratic Governors Association]] and [[Republican Governors Association]] as part of an anti-piracy campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dodd-pay-20131120,0,2539792.story|title=MPAA's Chris Dodd earned $3.3&amp;nbsp;million in 2012|publisher=L.A.

'''Crofting''' is a form of [[land tenure]]&lt;ref name="chamberscrofting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers's encyclopaedia: a dictionary of universal knowledge for the people|publisher=W. and R. Chambers|page= 575|year=1901|edition=revised|volume=Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zooAAAAYAAJ&amp;|accessdate=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small-scale [[food production]] particular to the [[Scottish Highlands]], the [[islands of Scotland]], and formerly on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Farmers &amp; Crofting | url = http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/story/farmingcrofting.xml | accessdate = 4 August 2011 | publisher = Manx National Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the 19th century townships, individual [[croft (land)|crofts]] are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the [[crofters]] of the township for grazing of their livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ca/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=crofting+scotland+sheep|title=crofting scotland sheep - Google Search|website=www.google.ca|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
Crofting is a traditional social system in Scotland defined by small-scale food production. Crofting is characterised by its common working communities, or "townships". Individual crofts are typically established on {{convert|2|-|5|ha|frac=2}} of [[wikt:inbye|in-bye]]&lt;ref&gt;Pertaining to the direction towards the house.&lt;/ref&gt; for better quality forage, arable and vegetable production. Each township manages poorer-quality hill ground as common grazing for cattle and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ2lBgAAQBAJ|title=Land, Faith and the Crofting Community: Christianity and Social Criticism in the Highlands of Scotland, 1843-1893|last=MacColl|first=Allan W.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748623822|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land use in the crofting counties is constrained by climate, soils and topography. Since the late 20th century, the government has classified virtually all of the agriculture land in the Highlands and Islands as Severely Disadvantaged, under the terms of Less Favoured Area (LFA) Directive, yet these areas still receive the lowest LFA payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rksa8P81il0C|title=The review of the less favoured areas scheme: 13th report of session 2008-09, report with evidence|last=Committee|first=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Lords: European Union|date=2009-06-04|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780108444357|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most crofters cannot survive economically by crofting agriculture alone, and they pursue a number of activities to earn their livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=8W-1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=lfa+payments+crofting&amp;dq=lfa+payments+crofting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZh_Wt2c_LAhVD2T4KHYldANMQ6AEINzAE|title=Local enterprises on the North Atlantic margin: selected contributions to the Fourteenth International Seminar on Marginal Regions|last=Byron|first=Reginald|last2=Hutson|first2=John|date=1999-08-01|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781840149326|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its challenges, crofting is important to the Highlands and Islands. In 2014-15 there were 19,422 crofts, with 15,388 crofters.&lt;ref name="Crofting Commission website"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crofting.scotland.gov.uk/facts-and-figures | title=Crofting facts and figures | publisher=Crofting Commission | accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some crofters have the tenancy of more than one croft, and in-croft absenteeism means that tenancies are held but crofts are not farmed.
About 33,000 family members lived in crofting households,&lt;ref name="Crofting Commission website"/&gt; or around 10% of the population of the Highlands and Islands. Crofting households represented around 30% those in the rural areas of the Highlands, and up to 65% of households in Shetland, the Western Isles and Skye.
There were 770,000 hectares under crofting tenure, roughly 25% of the agricultural land area in the Crofting Counties. Crofters held around 20% of all beef cattle (120,000 head) and 45% of breeding ewes (1.5 million sheep).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=OyPSc-oXxa0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=crofting+scotland+sheep&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZztrQ2c_LAhUEcz4KHQy7CdUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=crofting%2520scotland%2520sheep&amp;f=false|title=Changing life in Scotland and Britain: 1830s-1930s|last=Doogan|first=John|last2=Girvan|first2=Edith|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9780435326920|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==

Tenants and owner-occupier crofters are required to comply with a range of duties specified in sections 5AA to 5C and 19C of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 as amended. There is a duty to be ordinarily resident within 32km of the croft. If the croft is the sole dwelling and the crofter's family are resident while the croft is away this would probably be accepted as ordinarily resident. Other circumstances involving other places of residence would require to be assessed individually. In addition to the duty of residence tenants and owner occupier crofters are required to ensure the croft is cultivated, maintained and not neglected or misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crofting.scotland.gov.uk/faq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Crofting communities were a product of the [[Highland Clearances]] (though individual crofts had existed before the clearances). They replaced the farms or ''bailtean'', which had common grazing and arable [[Open field system|open fields]] operated on the [[Run rig|run rig]] system. This change was typically associated with two things. Firstly the tacksmen were steadily eliminated over the last quarter of the 18th century. A tacksman (a member of the ''daoine uaisle'', sometimes described as "gentry" in English) was the holder of a lease or "tack" from the landowner. Where a lease was for a ''baile'', the tacksman usually sublet to the farming tenants and may have provided some management oversight. By preventing this section of society from sub-letting, the landlords obtained all of the rent paid by those who worked the land. Secondly, landowners replaced the older farming methods with [[Pastoral farming|pastoral]] systems. In early cases, these were based on cattle. Much more common was the introduction of extensive sheep farms. In many clearances, the tenants of inland farms were moved to crofting communities in coastal areas, leaving the land they had left for sheep. This type of clearance was carried out mostly until the 1820s.

The crofts created by clearance were not intended to support all the needs of those who lived there, and consequently were restricted in size to a few acres of arable land with a surrounding shared grazing. Landlords intended their crofting tenants to work in various industries, such as fishing or kelp. A contemporary estimate was that a crofter needed to carry out 200 days work away from his croft in order to avoid destitution. In the second half of the 19th century, many crofters provided a substantial migrant workforce, especially for lowland farms.

Crofting communities were badly hit by the [[Highland Potato Famine]]. The small arable plots had meant that the potato was an essential crop, due to its high productivity. The arrival of [[Phytophthora infestans|potato blight]] (and the collapse of the kelp industry a few years before) made some crofting communities inviable. This gave rise to the second phase of the Highland Clearances, when many tenants left the Highlands, often emigrating.&lt;ref name="Devine 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=T M|title=Clanship to Crofters' War: The social transformation of the Scottish Highlands|date=1994|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9076-9|edition=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–49}}  

In the 21st century, crofting is found predominantly in the rural Western and Northern isles and in the coastal fringes of the western and northern Scottish mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland|publisher=edited by John Keay and Julia Keay|pages= 205–206|year=2000|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6AUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=collins+encyclopedia+scotland&amp;dq=collins+encyclopedia+scotland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bVgkU_DuMMrX0QG91YCwBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwAA&amp;|accessdate=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886]] provided for security of tenure, a key issue as most crofters remain tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/49-50/29 |title=Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886 |publisher=[[Legislation.gov.uk]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act encouraged tenants to improve the land under their control, as it ensured that the control could be transferred within families and passed to future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXwRAgAAQBAJ|title=Scottish Law of Leases|last=McAllister|first=Angus|date=2013-02-26|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847665669|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croft work was hard, back-breaking work which yielded a subsistence living.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Abrams '' Myth and Materiality in a Woman's World: Shetland 1800-2000'' 0719065925 2005  "As the nineteenth-century visitors correctly observed, croft work was hard, back-breaking work which yielded a subsistence living at best. The small agricultural holdings tenanted by most rural Shetlanders in the nineteenth century consisted of a dwelling, a small area of arable or cultivable ground (which, while runrig was still practised, could be scattered and fragmented around"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] gives crofters the right to buy their land.

The '''defense of infancy''' is a form of [[defense (legal)|defense]] known as an [[excuse]] so that [[defendant]]s falling within the definition of an "[[infant]]" are excluded from [[crime|criminal]] [[legal liability|liability]] for their [[action (philosophy)|action]]s, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an age of criminal responsibility. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed.

Under the English common law the defense of infancy was expressed as a set of presumptions in a doctrine known as '''''doli incapax'''''. A child under the age of seven was presumed incapable of committing a crime. The presumption was conclusive, prohibiting the prosecution from offering evidence that the child had the capacity to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of what they had done. Children aged seven to under fourteen were presumed incapable of committing a crime but the [[Rebuttable presumption|presumption was rebuttable]]. The prosecution could overcome the presumption by proving that the child understood what they were doing and that it was wrong. In fact, capacity was a necessary element of the state's case. If the state failed to offer sufficient evidence of capacity, the infant was entitled to have the charges dismissed at the close of the state's evidence. ''Doli incapax'' was abolished in England and Wales in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldjudgmt/jd090429/jtb-1.htm|title=House of Lords - R v JTB (Appellant) (on appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division))|first=Law Lords|last=Department|date=|website=publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but persists in other common law jurisdictions.

==Terminology==
The terminology regarding such a defense varies by jurisdiction and sphere. Instances of usage have included the terms '''age of accountability''',&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, Stewart. "Public accountability in the age of neo‐liberal governance." J. Education Policy 18.5 (2003): 459-480.&lt;/ref&gt; '''age of responsibility''',&lt;ref&gt;Platt, Anthony, and Bernard L. Diamond. "The origins of the right and wrong test of criminal responsibility and its subsequent development in the United States: An historical survey." Cal. L. Rev. 54 (1966): 1227.&lt;/ref&gt; '''age of criminal responsibility'''&lt;ref&gt;STATTIN, HEKAN, and David Magnusson. "Stability and change in criminal behaviour up to age 30." British Journal of Criminology 31.4 (1991): 327-346.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''age of liability'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, Nuno. "Putting the age of criminal and tort liability into context: A dialogue between law and psychology." The International Journal of Children's Rights 16.1 (2008): 29-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind the ''age of accountability'' laws are the same as those behind the insanity defense, insinuating both the mentally disabled and the young lack apprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Caton F., Stephen L. Golding, and Frank D. Fincham. "Implicit theories of criminal responsibility: Decision making and the insanity defense." Law and Human Behavior 11.3 (1987): 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The age of criminal responsibility==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
[[Government]]s enact laws to label certain types of activity as wrongful or illegal. Behaviour of a more antisocial nature can be stigmatized in a more positive way to show society's disapproval through the use of the word ''criminal''. In this context, laws tend to use the phrase, "age of criminal responsibility" in two different ways:
#As a definition of the process for dealing with an alleged offender, the range of ages specifies the exemption of a [[child]] from the [[adult]] system of [[prosecution]] and [[punishment]]. Most [[Jurisdiction (area)|states]] develop special [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]] justice systems in parallel to the adult criminal justice system. Here, the hearings are essentially welfare-based and deal with children as in need of compulsory measures of treatment and/or care. Children are diverted into this system when they have committed what would have been an offense as an adult.
#As the physical capacity of a child to commit a crime. Hence, children are deemed incapable of committing some sexual or other acts requiring abilities of a more mature quality.
Thus, each state is considering whether any given [[child]] has committed an offense, and given that answer, what the most appropriate measures would be for dealing with a child who has done what this child did. It is noted that, in some states, a link is made between infancy as a defense and defenses that diminish responsibility on the ground of a mental illness. Distinctions between children, young offenders, juveniles, etc. are used to denote matching levels of incapacity. The majority view is that this linkage is not constructive in that it implies that children are in some way mentally defective whereas they merely lack the judgment that comes with age and experience.

==Discussion==
{{See also|Criminal responsibility in French law}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
This is an aspect of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of ''[[parens patriae]]''. In the [[criminal law]], each state will consider the nature of its own society and the available evidence of the age at which antisocial behaviors begins to manifest itself. Some societies will have qualities of indulgence toward the young and inexperienced, and will not wish them to be exposed to the criminal law system before all other avenues of response have been exhausted. Hence, some states have a policy of ''[[doli incapax]]'' (i.e. incapable of wrong) and exclude liability for all acts and omissions that would otherwise have been criminal up to a specified age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dalby JT. |title=Criminal liability in children |journal=Canadian Journal of Criminology |year=1985 |volume=27 |pages=137–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, no matter what the infant may have done, there cannot be a criminal [[prosecution]]. However, although no criminal liability is inferred, other aspects of law may be applied. For example, in Nordic countries, an offense by a person under 15 years of age is considered mostly a symptom of problems in child's development. This will cause the social authorities to take appropriate administrative measures to secure the development of the child. Such measures may range from counseling to placement at special care unit. Being non-judicial, the measures are not dependent on the severity of the offense committed but on the overall circumstances of the child.

The policy of treating minors as incapable of committing crimes does not necessarily reflect modern sensibilities. Thus, if the rationale of the excuse is that children below a certain age lack the capacity to form the ''mens rea'' of an offense, this may no longer be a sustainable argument. Indeed, given the different speeds at which people may develop both physically and intellectually, any form of explicit age limit may be arbitrary and irrational. Yet, the sense that children do not deserve to be exposed to criminal punishment in the same way as adults remains strong. Children have not had experience of life, nor do they have the same mental and intellectual capacities as adults. Hence, it might be considered unfair to treat young children in the same way as adults.

In [[Scotland]] the age of criminal responsibility is currently eight years, however age of criminal prosecution was raised to 12 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, s 52; Easton S and Piper C (2012). ''Sentencing and Punishment: The Quest for Justice'' (3rd ed.) Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 256. {{ISBN|0-19-969353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] the age of responsibility is ten years and in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Canada]], the age of responsibility is twelve years. [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Norway]] all set the age at fifteen years. In the [[United States]], the age varies between [[U.S. state|states]], being as low as six years in South Carolina and seven years in 35 states; 11 years is the minimum age for federal crimes.

As the treaty parties of the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]] could not agree on a minimum age for criminal responsibility, they chose to solve the question procedurally and excluded the jurisdiction of the Court for persons under eighteen years.

Some countries refuse to set a fixed minimum age, but leave discretion to [[prosecutor]]s to argue or the [[judge]]s to rule on whether the [[child]] or [[adolescent]] ("juvenile") defendant understood that what was being done was wrong. If the defendant did not understand the difference between ''right'' and ''wrong'', it may not be considered appropriate to treat such a person as [[Culpability|culpable]]. Alternatively, the lack of real fault in the offender can be recognized by rulings that dispense mitigated criminal [[Sentence (law)|sentences]] or address more practical matters of [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibility]] by adjusting the rights of [[parent]]s to unsupervised custody, or by separate criminal proceedings against the parents for breach of their [[parental responsibility (criminal)|duties]] as parents.

*10 in '''England, Wales and Northern Ireland'''.  Usually persons aged 10–11 will only be imprisoned in very serious cases, such as murder. Even more so the outcome for youth (12–17) criminal proceedings are usually age categorised (currently it will depend on whether the offender is under 12, under 14, under 16 or under 18, with the older the offender the more severity of punishment, especially for serious crimes).
*8–12 in '''Scotland'''. If a compulsory intervention is considered necessary, a child aged between 8 and 12 years may be dealt with through the Children's Hearings system.

Currently, persons aged 10–17 are usually dealt with differently under UK law as "juveniles" and in most criminal cases, attend a Youth Court, as opposed to an adult Magistrate Court (for minor offences, such as petty shoplifting/theft, common assault, etc.) or Crown Court (for serious offences, such as murder, rape, robbery, etc.). By the current way UK law and courts work, it would be very rare that a person under 15 would get a custodial sentence for a minor offence, and it would be almost non existent for a person under 12 to get a custodial sentence for a minor offence, unless they are a "constant offender" and are regarded a danger to the public. In serious criminal cases such as murder, rape, etc. a person under 18 will be dealt with by the law and courts in the same way as a person 18 or over, most probably in a Crown Court.}}

==Child imprisonment==
Child imprisonment is a concept in [[criminal law]] where people are considered not old enough to be held responsible for their criminal acts. The main problem in most countries is whether children should be punished as an adult for crimes committed as a juvenile, or if special treatment is a better solution for the offender.

===Juvenile courts===
In some countries, a [[juvenile court]] is a court of special jurisdiction charged with adjudicating cases involving crimes committed by those who have not yet reached a specific age.  If convicted in a juvenile court, the offender is found "responsible" for their actions as opposed to "guilty" for a criminal offense. Sometimes, in some jurisdictions (such as the United States) a minor may be [[tried as an adult]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">The '''Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps''' was a [[police force]] created by the [[Tanggu Truce]] to patrol and maintain order in the [[demilitarized zone]] extending from south of the [[Great Wall]], to a line north east of the [[Bai River]] in [[Hebei]] province in [[North China|northern China]] during the late 1930s.

==Background and history==
Per the terms of the Tanggu Truce, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] withdrew to the line of the [[Great Wall]], and regular units of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] of the [[Kuomintang]] government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] was withdrawn to south of the new demilitarized zone. Within the zone itself, which partially encompassed the major cities of [[Tianjin]] and [[Beijing]], [[public order]] was to be maintained by a lightly armed “Peace Preservation Corps”. Per the terms of the Tanggu Truce, any disputes that could not be resolved by the Peace Preservation Corps would be settled by agreement through direct discussions between the Japanese and Chinese governments.

A secret clause of the Tanggu Truce excluded any of the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] from the Peace Preservation Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby, Chiang kai Shek pp,282&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively meant that the Japanese Army was able to dominate the Peace Preservation Corp with demobilized troops from the collaborationist proxy Chinese armies which had participated in the [[Battle of Rehe]] and the subsequent [[Defense of the Great Wall|attack on the Great Wall and the intrusion into Hebei]]. Some 1,000 men were recruited into the Corps from the former troops of [[warlord]] [[Shih Yusan]] and a further 2,000 men from the forces of [[Li Chi-chun]].&lt;ref&gt;Jowett,Rays of the Rising Sun, pg. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1935, with the proclamation of the [[Autonomous Government of Eastern Hopei]], the Peace Preservation Corps was disbanded, and its forces were absorbed into the new [[East Hopei Army]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5850">'''Elder law''' is an area of legal practice that specializes on issues that affect the aging population.  The purpose of elder law planning is to prepare the elderly person for financial freedom and autonomy through proper financial planning and long-term care options.&lt;ref name="krooks2014"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/probate_property_magazine_2012/2014/may_june_2014/2014_aba_rpte_pp_v28_3_article_krooks_kirkevold_why_elder_law.html  |title=Why Elder Law |last1=Krooks |first1=Bernard | last2=Kirkevold | first2=Kameron |date=June 2014 |website= |publisher=American Bar Association | volume=28 | number=3  |access-date=March 9, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
The three major categories that make up elder law are:

# [[Estate planning]] and [[Estate administration (law)|administration]], including tax questions;
# [[Medicaid]], [[disability]] and other long-term care issues; and
# [[Legal guardian|Guardianship]], conservatorship and commitment matters, including [[fiduciary]] administration.

Other issues found under the umbrella of elder law include such areas as [[estate planning]]; [[Will (law)|wills]]; [[Trust law|trust]]s; [[legal guardian|guardian]]ships; protection against [[elder abuse]], [[neglect]], and [[fraud]]; end-of-life planning; all levels of disability and medical care; [[retirement plan]]ning; [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits; [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and Medicaid coverage; [[Medicaid planning (United States)]]; [[consumer protection]]; [[nursing home]]s and in-home care; [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]]; physicians' or [[medical care directive]]s, [[medical care declaration (law)|declarations]] and [[medical care power of attorney (law)|powers of attorney]]; [[landlord/tenant law (United States)(law)|landlord/tenant]] needs; [[real estate law|real estate]] and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] assistance; various levels of advice, counseling and advocacy of [[right (law)|rights]]; [[tax]] issues; and [[discrimination]].

==History==
Elder law developed as a specialty because as [[Life expectancy| lifespans increased]] there was an increased need for medical care, care giving, and financial management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frolick |first=Lawrence |last2=Kaplan |first2=Richard   |date=April 29, 2014 |title=Elder Law in a Nutshell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkDaCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq  |location= |publisher=West Academic |page=2–3 |isbn= |author-link= |edition=6th   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the [[Older Americans Act]] (OAA), originally signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on July 14, 1965 (the same year Medicare was created), claims credit for creating the [[Administration on Aging]] (AOA), a division within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]]. The OAA also authorized grants to States for community planning and services programs, funding for research, and demonstration and training projects in the field of aging.

In 1972 Amendments to the OAA added the national nutrition program for the elderly. The OAA of 2000 was amended on November 13, 2000, to include the National Family Caregiver Support Program, which was intended to help hundreds of thousands of family members who are struggling to care for their older loved ones who are ill or who have disabilities. This program provides grant funding for combined services between state and local agencies for such things as counseling, support groups, [[respite care|respite]] and other community-based services. These services are focused on the care of the frail and aging members of society. The program also provides services geared towards the family units of grandparents and other older relatives now in the stages of care-taking for related children eighteen years of age and under.

Elder law is an expansion of the traditional trust and estates practice.&lt;ref name="krooks2014"/&gt;

==Careers in or associated with elder law==

Careers that are developing around the area of Elder Law include social workers, [[lawyer]]s, [[paralegal]]s, [[legal assistant]]s, legal secretaries, [[Legal guardian|''guardians ad litem'' (GAL)]], various types of [[psychologist]]s, care givers, [[financial planner]]s, policy makers and legal advocates, benefit specialists, [[Better Business Bureau]], [[Attorney General]]'s Office, Consumer Protection Agency, political watch-dog groups, health care providers, researchers, funeral planners, grief counselors, case workers, abuse &amp; fraud investigators, educators, product developers, transportation providers, entertainment and tour guides, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, insurance providers, or simply elder companions.

Essentially any career field can create a benefit to the aging of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Careers deal with how to properly and legally manage elderly care|url=http://patellawokc.com/elder-law-a-better-quality-of-life/|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=patellawokc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816095708/http://patellawokc.com/elder-law-a-better-quality-of-life/|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Engine Alliance''' ('''EA''') is an American [[aircraft engine]] manufacturer based in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="ea_bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/Research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=7917458 |title=Engine Alliance, LLC: Private Company Information |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is a 50/50 joint venture between [[GE Aviation]], a subsidiary of [[General Electric]], and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]],&lt;ref name="ea_bloomberg"/&gt; a subsidiary of [[United Technologies]]. Engine Alliance was established in August 1996 to develop, manufacture, sell, and support a family of modern technology aircraft engines for new high-capacity, long-range [[aircraft]].&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;[http://www.enginealliance.com/en/about/default.aspx About Us | Engine Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314175424/http://www.enginealliance.com/en/about/default.aspx |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main application for such an engine, the [[Engine Alliance GP7000|GP7200]], was originally the [[Boeing 747]]-500/600X projects, before these were cancelled due to lack of demand from [[airlines]].

Instead, the GP7000 has been re-optimized for use on the [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo. In that market it is competing with the [[Rolls-Royce Trent 900]], the launch engine for the aircraft. The two EA variants are the GP7270 and the GP7277.

On September 30, 2017, an [[Engine Alliance GP7000#Notable Incidents|Engine Alliance GP7270]] engine suffered from an uncontained failure during a passenger flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11928312 Air France plane loses engine cover above the Atlantic Ocean, New Zealand Herald, October 1 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/world/plane-engine-explodes.html Engine Explodes on an Air France Plane, Forcing an Emergency Landing.

'''Everyday carry''' ('''EDC''') or '''every day carry''' are  items that are carried on a consistent basis to assist in dealing with normal everyday needs of modern society, including possible emergency situations.  

== Examples ==

Some of the most common EDC items are [[knives]], [[flashlights]], [[multitools]], [[wallets]], [[smartphones]], [[notebook]]s, and [[Pen|pens]]. The type and quantity of such items may vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=18 March 2010 |url= |title=How to Choose the Best Everyday Carry Bag |publisher=Survival News Online |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While often distributed among pockets in everyday clothing, carry options are frequently expanded by the addition of clothing accessories like a [[fanny pack]], [[Handbag|purse]], small day pack, bracelets, or even footwear like long boots or a vest with pockets.  The multiple large pockets of [[cargo pants]] make them a popular choice among people who carry EDC items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancopmagazine.com/tactical-toters/ |title=Tactical Toters |publisher=American Cop Magazine |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Farming''' or '''tax-farming''' is  a technique of [[financial management]], namely the process of commuting (changing), by its assignment by [[contract|legal contract]] to a third party, a future uncertain revenue stream into fixed and certain periodic rents, in consideration for which commutation a discount in value received is suffered. It is most commonly used in the field of [[public finance]], where the state wishes to gain some certainty about its future taxation revenue for the purposes of  medium-term budgetting of expenditure. The tax collection process requires considerable expenditure on administration and the yield is uncertain both as to amount and timing, as taxpayers delay or default on their assessed obligations, often the result of unforeseen external forces such as bad weather affecting harvests. Governments (the [[lease|lessors]]) have thus frequently over history resorted to the services of an entrepreneurial financier (the farmer) to whom they lease or assign the right to collect and retain the whole of the tax revenue due to the state in return for his payment into the [[treasury]] of fixed sums (sometimes called "rents", but with a different meaning from the common modern term). Sometimes ([[Miguel de Cervantes]] is an example) the tax farmer was a government employee, paid a salary, and all monies collected went to the government.

Tax farmers did not usually deal with individuals; the tax was imposed on a community or other polity, and how the community raised the funds to pay the tax was its own business. Tax farming usually required on-site tax-collecting visits, as postal and banking systems were inadequate or non-existent.

Farming in this sense has nothing to do with [[agriculture]], other than metaphorically.

==Etymology==
There are two possible origins for ''farm''.

===Derivation from classical Latin===
Some sources derive "farm" with its French version ''ferme'', most notably used in the context of the [[Farmers-General|Fermiers Generaux]],  from the mediaeval Latin ''firma'', meaning "a fixed agreement, contract", ultimately from the classical Latin adjective ''firmus'', ''firma'', ''firmum'', meaning "firm, strong, stout, steadfast,  immoveable, sure, to be relied upon".&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise ''Lexis'', Paris, 1993 "Ferme: contrat par lequel un proprietaire abandonne a un locataire l'exploitation d'un domaine moyennant le paiement d'un loyer" (contract by which a proprietor transfers the exploitation of a holding to a tenant by means of the payment of a rent);  Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern agricultural sense of the word stems from the same origin, in that  a medieval land-"holder" (none "owned" land but the king himself under his [[allodial]] title) under [[feudal land tenure]] might let  it (i.e. lease it out) under a contract as a [[going concern]] (not as a [[Subinfeudation|sub-infeudated]] [[Fief|fee]]), that is to say as a unit producing a revenue stream, together with its workers, livestock and deadstock (i.e. implements), for exploitation by a tenant who was licensed by the contract, or ''firma'', to keep all the revenue he could extract from the holding in exchange for fixed rents. Thus the rights to the revenue stream produced by the land had been farmed by the lessor (therefore strictly perhaps the "farmor") and the tenant became the "holder of the farm", or to coin a word, "farmee". Because this was the form of the farming transaction most known to popular society, the word "farmer" became synonymous with a tenant of an agricultural holding.

===Derivation from Old English===
According to other sources, the word ''farm'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''ferme'' ("farm, rent, revenue; revenue collected from a farmer; factor, stewardship, meal, feast"), from [[Old English]] ''feorm, farm'' ("provision, stores of food, supplies, possessions; provisions supplied to the king or a lord by a tenant or vassal; rent, feast, benefit, assylum"), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''firmō, *firχumō'' ("means of living, subsistence"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;u-'' ("life, strength, force"). It is related to other Old English words such as ''feormehām'' ("farm"), ''feormere'' ("purveyor, grocer"), ''feormian'' ("to provision, sustain"), and ''feorh'' ("life, spirit"). The Old English word is stated by these sources as having unusually been  borrowed by [[Medieval Latin]] as ''firma'' or ''ferma'' and to have provided the [[Old French]] ''ferme'' "farm", [[Occitan]] ''ferma'' "farm". This is refuted by those sources which state ''firma'' to derive from classical Latin ''firmus''.&lt;ref&gt;Larousse, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The word continued the same senses of "rent, farmed office, source of revenue, feast". The meaning "rent, fixed payment", which was already present in the Old English word, was further strengthened due to the word's resemblance to the unrelated (so say these sources) [[Latin language|Latin]] ''firmus'' ("firm, solid"), and ''firmitas'' ("security, firmness").&lt;ref&gt;Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, "farm".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mantello, Rigg, ''Medieval Latin: an introduction and bibliographical guide'', 11.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation of a farm==
The tenant of a farm can only make a profit if he makes a careful assessment of its value. Although modern [[Finance|financial management theory]] has reduced such calculations to scientific formulae, the mind of the astute financier of past ages would have well understood the calculations involved, whether they were performed mentally or by making marks in the sand. An estimate is made of the  long-term average yearly gross value of the revenue stream in question, which can be derived from examination of past records and accounts, adjusted for any new circumstances affecting the future. Then a discount for a risk element is deducted with a further discount deducted for the [[time value of money]].  The risk in question relates to the possibility of some of the debts forming the revenue stream being defaulted on or paid late. This causes variability in the revenue stream. These concepts must always have been second-nature to the successful merchant throughout the ages. The resultant figure forms the maximum rent the tenant is willing to pay to the lessee of the farm. His profit becomes the excess of whatever revenues he can extract from the farm less the rents payable, less his administration, levying and collection expenses. The skill of the tenant of a farm is therefore firstly in negotiating a favourable rent which he does by overstating the riskiness (variability) of the cash flow stream in question and secondly in his management of the debts thus assigned to him, that is to say his skills as a debt-collector and  manager in general. He must also be satisfied that he has the ability to enforce payment of the debts, ultimately  by use of a court of law, in which he must pay the standard fee for bringing a suit, under the legal system generally instituted by the government authority which is the lessor of the farm. He does not act as the lessor's agent but as a principal.

==Historical use==

===Roman Empire===
{{Main|Publican}}
Tax farming was originally a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] practice whereby the burden of [[tax collection]] was reassigned by the Roman State to private individuals or groups. In essence, these individuals or groups paid the taxes for a certain area and for a certain period of time and then attempted to cover their outlay by collecting money or saleable goods from the people within that area.&lt;ref&gt;Howatson M. C.: Oxford Companion to Classical Literature, Oxford University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-866121-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was set up by [[Gaius Gracchus]] in 123 BC primarily to increase the efficiency of tax collection within [[Rome]] itself but the system quickly spread to the [[Roman Province|Provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;Balsdon J.: Roman Civilization, Pelican, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Roman Empire, these private individuals and groups which collected taxes in lieu of the bid (i.e. rent) they had paid to the state were known as ''[[publicani]]'', of whom the best known is  the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], a ''publicanus'' in the village of [[Capernaum]] in the province of [[Galilee]]. The system was widely abused, and reforms were enacted by [[Augustus]] and [[Diocletian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrv.com/economy/roman-taxes.php ''Roman-taxes'' at unrv.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tax farming practices are believed to have contributed to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Thomas. ''How the Irish saved civilization: the untold story of Ireland's heroic role from the fall of Rome to the rise of medieval Europe.'' Anchor Books, Doubleday, 1996, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feudal England===
Mediaeval English kings frequently made grants "in [[fief|fee]]-farm", a form of [[feudal land tenure|feudal tenure]]. An example is the following [[writ]] of King [[William II of England|William II]] (1087–1100) granting a [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred court]] to be held in fee-farm by  [[Thorney Abbey]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;William, king of the English, to all the [[sheriff]]s and [[English feudal barony|barons]] of [[Huntingdonshire]], greeting. Know that I have granted the hundred of Normancross to the [[abbot]] and monks of Thorney to be held in fee-farm for an annual rent of 100 [[shilling]]s which I order them to pay to my sheriff at Huntingdon. And I forbid any of my officers to do them injury or insult in respect of this.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, David C. &amp; Greenaway, George W., (eds.),  English Historical Documents 1042-1189, London, 1959. Part II, Government &amp; Administration, part C, The Sheriff &amp; Local Government, p.433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other uses===
Besides the Romans, historical examples include the tax collection methods of the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], [[Seljuks]], [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[Ancien Régime|French State prior to Louis XVI]] (see [[ferme générale]]), and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] prior to 1862. In many cases, such as the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] practice of [[Iqta]], these rights were granted by an authority, in this example the caliph, for services rendered or promised. In the Byzantine ''pronoia'' system, similar rights were often purchased from the crown. Though such arrangements in some respects seem similar to the feudal system, there are significant disparities, including continuance of state power and, at least in the case of ''pronoia'', theoretical time limits on the grant. In many cases, including those mentioned, tax rights were not transferable or divisible, unlike feudal fiefdoms.

==Advantages==
Tax farming was an important step in the history of [[economic development]] by providing a method for collecting taxes across a large area without the need for a tax-collecting [[bureaucracy]], or during periods when such a bureaucracy is unworkable or impossible to maintain. Systems of tax farming similar to the Roman model were used in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], various medieval Western European countries, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires, and in [[Qing Dynasty]] China.  As states become stronger, buoyed up by revenues brought in by tax farming, the practice was discontinued in favour of centralized tax collection systems. In part this was because tax farming systems tended to rely on wealthy individuals outside the state machinery, [[gang]]s, and [[secret societies]].&lt;ref&gt;John Butcher and Howard Dick, ''The Rise and Fall of Revenue Farming: Business Elites and the Emergence of the Modern State''. St. Martin's Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
The key flaw in the tax farming system is the tension between the state, which seeks a long-term source of taxation revenue, and the tax farmers, who seek to make a profit on their investment in as short a time as possible. As a result, tax-farmers often abuse the taxpayers in various ways, tending them to switch their economic activity from strategic long-term projects to short-term revenue generation. A common abuse by tax farmers is the undervaluation of  goods received  in lieu of taxes, allowing the tax-farmer to re-sell the goods to create a second profit source. Such abuses stifle economic growth by restricting the ability of the tradesman to reinvest in his business, thereby limiting the quantity of taxes generated over the long-term.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In Bangladesh and India tolls on bridges and roads and dues from public properties such as lakes and forests are often leased to private persons or firms.

==Disambiguation==

===Privatized tax collection===
Tax farming is not synonymous  with modern [[privatized tax collection]], where private individuals or companies collect taxes and pass them to the state in return for a commission or fee, without bearing any risk consequent of default by the taxpayer. Tax farming is [[Speculation|speculative]], meaning that the tenant of the farm bears the full risk of defaulted debts. In addition, a tenant is often required as a term of the lease to make an early rent payment, which must be financed from his own resources until the revenue stream subject to the farm has started to be collected.

===Factoring===
In the [[United Kingdom]], some tax collection of "lower value debts" by [[HMRC]] has been outsourced to [[Debt collection agency|debt collection agencies]] from July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&amp;ReleaseID=414723&amp;SubjectId=2] [http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2267273/taxman-farms-debt-collection]&lt;/ref&gt; However, debt collection agencies, like invoice factors, are not truly farmers of revenue streams, as they do not bear any risk of default. Rather they make loans in expectation of future receipts, such loans being always recoverable and secured on the income stream itself.

===Simple commutation===
In 1999 the National Board of Revenue in Bangladesh (NBR) negotiated with cigarette producing firms a minimum amount of [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT) that should be paid per month even though  VAT is an ''[[ad valorem tax|ad valorem]]'' tax, that is to say of variable yield. The NBR took this step because under the self-clearance system monitoring of production and sales of cigarettes proved to be difficult. It was agreed that if the cigarette producing firms paid the minimum revenue fixed by the NBR, physical monitoring would be withdrawn. The NBR resorted to this technique of financial management  to avoid the large costs of monitoring while gaining more in revenue with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhury, Faizul L.

In [[France]] the jurisdictions of the ''ordre judiciaire'', of the French court system are empowered to try either litigation between persons (civil law) or criminal law cases. They may intervene: 
* in the matter of contention in litigation between persons
* in the ''[[Matière gracieuse en droit français|domaine gracieux]]'' (when the jurisdiction is asked to authorize something, a change of marital status for example)
On an exceptional basis the judiciary may also become involved in certain litigation between an individual and the State or some other [[public person]]. Such litigation would include matters of [[Eminent domain|expropriation]], for example, where the expropriated party does not agree with the indemnification amount. Traffic accidents in which one of the vehicles belongs to the government would also fall under the jurisdiction of this court, as well, in this instance, as that of the ''juge civil'', who also has the power to act; another example would be a case when the propriety of a ''contrôle d'identité'' is contested and needs to be determined.

== Legal context ==
Two ''[[Judiciary of France|degrés de juridiction]]'', (degrees of jurisdiction), often exist in French law:

* One jurisdiction where the facts of the matter are judged For example, in penal law: did the defendant in fact do what he is accused of? 
* The other jurisdiction is law. For example, also in penal law: if the defendant did do that, what legal rules apply?

The [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] hears appeals of the verdicts rendered by the courts of the above two jurisdictions. The Court of Cassaction itself only judges matters of law; it does not re-try the facts a third time.

The French legal system distinguishes between
* civil jurisdictions charged with litigation between persons, and 
* penal jurisdictions, which judge accusations of criminality and may apply ''sanctions pénales'', criminal penalties.

== Evolution since the French Revolution ==
The organization of the French judiciary was first addressed by the [[loi des 16 et 24 août 1790]], (law of August 16 and 24 1790), which established the ''[[Clerk of the Peace|justices de paix]]'', (justices of the peace), as well as the ''tribunaux de districts'', (district tribunals). The justices and the tribunaux served in turn as courts of first instance, ''(première instance'') and appeal courts, in rotation. The same law also provided for ''tribunaux de commerce'', commercial tribunals.

For criminal and penal matters, ''tribunaux criminels'' (criminal tribunals), which included a [[jury]], were created.

''The [[Constitution of the Year VIII]]'' reorganized the court system. It retained the justices of the peace but separated the courts of first instance from the appeal tribunals, which would become the appeal courts.

The first ''juridictions de prud'hommes'' were created in 1806. In penal matters, judgment by a jury is reserved for ''[[crimes]]'', a serious crime punishable by ten years or more in prison.

In 1958, justices of the peace were eliminated and replaced by the'' tribunaux d'instance,'' ''[[Police Tribunal (France)|tribunaux de police]]'', and the ''tribunaux de grande instance'' (also ''tribunaux correctionnels''). Les ''juridictions de proximité'' were introduced in 2002, but were scheduled to be eliminated starting January 1, 2013.

== First-degree civil jurisdictions ==
[[File:Justice_civile_francaise.png|thumb|550x550px|Organization '''of the French judiciary''' for civil matters.]]
The first-degree civil jurisdiction is so specific that it may be divided into several subjects areas (commercial, social, rural, etc.). These courts then have the deciding word in those subjects.

Other first-degree civil jurisdictions have a more general purview, but are divided by the ''taux de ressort'', most often as the applicant requests.

This is the case in the following jurisdictions:
* [[Tribunal de grande instance (France)|Tribunal de grande instance]]
* [[Tribunal d'instance]]
* [[Juridiction de proximité]]
Where litigation is not specifically assigned by legislation to another jurisdiction, the ''tribunal de grande instance'' is responsible for litigation on matters involving more than 10 €000. But for litigation arising from real estate, the ''tribunal d'instance'' has authority over litigation evaluated where potential damages range between 4 €000 and €10,000, and the ''juridiction de proximité'' for litigation evaluated at 4 000 € or less.

In the overseas French possessions ([[Overseas collectivity|collectivités d'outre-mer]]), naming sometimes differs from this pattern and a court of first instance ([[Trial court|tribunal de première instance]]) exercises a general review power over first-degree civil jurisdiction.

The [[Agricultural Land Tribunal|Agricultural land tribunals]] are responsible for some types of rural litigation.

=== Social jurisdictions ===

=== Commercial jurisdictions ===

=== Jurisdictions of Sécurité sociale and of aid sociale ===

=== Civil juvenile jurisdiction ===
The [[juge des enfants]] (juvenile judge),  according to Article 151-3 of the Code de l'organisation judiciaire, may rule in any matter that concerns educational assistance measures under the conditions specified at Article 375 &lt;span class="citation"&gt;« pour tout ce qui concerne les mesures d'assistance éducative dans les conditions prévues aux articles 375 et suivants du [[Napoleonic Code|code civil]]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="citation"&gt;»&lt;/span&gt;

== First Degree Penal Jurisdictions ==
[[File:Justice_penale_francaise.png|thumb|400x400px|'''Organization of the French judiciary''' for criminal matters.]]
There are two categories of criminal jurisdiction: jurisdictions '''''d'instruction''' ''and the jurisdictions ''de jugement''. This distinction is notably echoed by the Code de procédure pénale, (Code of Penal Procedure), which nevertheless does not define how to distinguish the one from the other. The distinction is even more nuanced to make, since in French procedural law the "judgment" jurisdictions also have powers of investigation ('''''d'instruction''')''.

A jurisdiction ''d'instruction'' has powers of criminal investigation and can proceed or cause to proceed different investigations: it can hear witnesses and civil parties ('''''parties civiles'''''), search, seal, appoint and expert, put a suspect in temporary detention or in detention under judiciary supervision, and rule on the different questions that arise in the course of criminal investigation, such as the return of seized assets.

A judge in a court ''de jugement'' has the same powers, but generally makes only limited use of them, since the juge d'instruction has already done so. The essential function of a '''cour de judgement''' is to determine the guilt of defendants under criminal law and to sentence those it finds guilty.

Penal jurisdictions judge '''''infractions''''', and they also determine the civil consequences of committing the infraction.

=== First-degree jurisdictions d'instruction ===

=== First-degree jurisdictions de jugement ===
The ''[[Police Court (France)|tribunal de police]]'' judges ''[[contravention]]s''. The ''tribunal correctionnel'' judges ''[[Délit pénal en France|délits]]''. The ''[[cour d'assises]]'' and the ''criminal tribunal ''(in Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon) judge '''''crimes''''', according to where they were committed. The ''commercial maritime tribunal'' is a '''''jurisdiction d'exception''''', but it has been composed in the same way as jurisdictions of common law such as the correctional tribunal since the decision of the constitutional council of July 2, 2010.

=== First-degree jurisdictions for penalty application ===
The ''[[Surveillance court|judge of l'application des peines]]'' and the '''''tribunal de l'application des peines''''' decide the application of criminal penalties, especially with respect to prisoners.

Eight regional jurisdictions for rétention de sûreté decide matters of retention, after their periods of incarceration, of persons found guilty of certain serious offences and who are adjudged to still be dangerous.

=== Military jurisdictions ===
The elimination of the ''tribunal aux armées de Paris'', the last peacetime military tribunal, was announced for 2011, when they were to be replaced by the common-law correctional tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/sga/rubrique-actualites/transfert-des-competences-du-tribunal-aux-armees-de-paris-a-une-formation-specialisee-du-tgi-de-paris Defense ministry website&lt;br&gt; ]&lt;/ref&gt; It took effect 1 January 2012 as a result of the law of 13 December 2011.

=== Juvenile criminal jurisdictions ===
Infractions committed by a minor are judged, depending on their severity and also the age of the minor, by the juge des enfants, by the ''[[Juvenile court|tribunal pour enfants]]'' or by the ''Cour d'assises des mineurs''.

== Appeal jurisdictions ==
[[File:DSC_4764-MR_187-coursdappel.jpg|right|thumb|350x350px|Court of Appeal in Aix-en-Provence.]]

=== Court of Appeal ===
The Court of Appeal retries the facts of a disputed case previously tried in a court of first instance. This is known as the double degree of jurisdiction ([[Judiciary of France|double degré de juridiction]]).

At the Court of Appeal level litigation is considered by a single court—although in separate divisions—whether the matter is civil or criminal. Depending on the volume of appeals the number of divisions may vary. There is always, however, at least one civil division, social division, commercial division, and correctional appeals division.

There are a total of [[Court of Appeal (France)|36 courts of appeal]] on French territory.

At the courts of appeal, in criminal law matters:
* the ''chambre de l'instruction'' is the appeal court's jurisdiction ''d'instruction'';
* the [[Court of Appeal (France)|chambre des appels correctionnels]] is the jurisdiction ''judgement d'appel'', concerning ''délits'' and ''[[Contravention#France|contraventions]]''. For a contravention the case is heard by a single judge.
* the ''chambre de l'application des peines'' is an appeal jurisdiction for matters of sentencing, particularly if a loss of liberty is involved.

=== Tribunal supérieur d'appel ===
[[Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]] has a '''''{{Interlanguage link multi|tribunal supérieur d'appel|fr}}''''', which hears the appeals from that jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gouv.fr/organisation-de-la-justice-10031/lordre-judiciaire-10033/juridictions-judiciaires-doutre-mer-24277.html   |title=Juridictions judiciaires d'outre-mer|date=10 June 2013 |publisher=Ministère de la Justice, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Juridictions criminelles d'appel ===
Since the 2000 {{Interlanguage link multi|Loi sur la présomption d'innocence|fr}}, known as the ''loi Guigou'', a special form of d'appeal (called ''"tournant"'') been available against the '''''arrêts''''' of the Assises court, and the Criminal and Army tribunals: appeals are heard in a different criminal jurisdiction with additional '''''jurés''''' in the case of an Assises court or Criminal tribunal, or '''''assesseurs-jurés''''' in [[Mayotte]]). (Although appeals filed against a criminal jurisdiction ruling in an overseas department, [[New Caledonia]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] or [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], the appeal may be heard in the same jurisdiction that heard it in first instance, but different judges should sit on the panel that re-tries the case.

=== Rétention de sûreté ===
The judicial panel of the national jurisdiction for ''{{Interlanguage link multi|rétention de sûreté|fr|3=Rétention de sûreté en France}}'' ([[preventive detention]]) is composed of three councillors from the [[Court of Cassation (France)]]. It hears appeals of decisions to impose '''''preventive detention''''' on convicted prisoners who have completed their sentence but are still considered dangerous.

=== Cour nationale de l'incapacité et de la tarification de l'assurance des accidents du travail ===
This jurisdiction judges cases where appeals concern incapacitation and work-related injury, sometimes called technical appeals, rendered by the Social Security administration.

== High jurisdiction - Court of Cassation ==
The Court of Cassation does not constitute a third degree of jurisdiction, because unlike the [[Court of Appeal (France)|Courts of Appeal]], it only addresses the legal form of the [[verdict]]. Thus the ''juges du fond'' designation for first and second degree judges, which sometimes appears in cassation court verdicts.

The Cour de cassation renders two types of verdict: '''''confirmatif''''' or ''''' infirmatif'''''.

The former confirms a verdict by a court of appeal, (or of another court if the case has exhausted the first and last degrees of jurisdiction). The trial theoretically ends at this point, all avenues of recourse having been exhausted. Still, other jurisdictions may be invoked, such as the [[European Court of Human Rights]], but this remains rare.

If the court's verdict is on the other hand ''infirmatif'', the judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammarist.com/spelling/judgment-judgement/|title=Judgment vs. Judgement}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "cassé", or broken, essentially quashed or canceled. There are then several possibilities:
* The judgment is quashed and sent back to a jurisdiction of the same degree as the one that issued the overturned judgment, but in a different place.
* The judgment is quashed and sent back to the same jurisdiction that issued it, but is then heard by a court composed of different judges.
* The judgment is quashed, but not sent back to the lower courts.
If the matter is sent back to the lower courts, both the facts and the law are retried. The resulting new judgment may also be appealed. The next higher court would be cassation. Here the bench sometimes quashes a verdict without returning it to the lower court, or where a lower court may bow to the ''Cour de cassation ''by rendering a judgment that takes the cassation court's ruling into account.

Unlike the [[Court of Appeal (France)|Courts of Appeal]], there is only one Cour de cassation, which sits in Paris.

Mexican President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] said “We must move beyond prohibition to effective prevention” and that Mexico was considering legalizing [[medical marijuana]] and limited decriminalization of the drug. GCDP member Branson was quoted as saying the conference outcome was "out of step with world sentiment and doubles down on status quo”.&lt;ref&gt;Fassihi, Farnaz, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-conference-on-drugs-ends-without-shift-in-policy-1461299583 "U.N.

Commission Chair Dreifuss said about the report:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After years of denouncing the dramatic effects of prohibition and the criminalization of people that do no harm but use drugs on the society as a whole, it is time to highlight the benefits of well-designed and well-implemented people-centered drug policies. These innovative policies cannot exist as long as we do not discuss, honestly, the major policy error made in the past, which is the criminalization of personal consumption or possession of illicit psychoactive substances in national laws.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 2 October 2017, the Global Commission published a position paper on the opioid crisis in North America&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/position-papers/opioid-crisis-north-america-position-paper/&lt;/ref&gt;. This opioid-driven public health crisis has reached alarming proportions, contributing in 2016 to an estimated 64,000 deaths from drug overdoses in the US, and some 2,500 in Canada. The members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, several of whom faced similar crises while occupying the highest levels of government in their own countries, share in this position paper their views and recommendations on how to mitigate this epidemic.

== [http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/reports/changing-perceptions/ 2017 report] ==

While previous reports by the Global Commission on Drug Policy showed how the potential harms of drugs for people and communities are exacerbated by repressive drug control policies at local, national and international levels, the Global Commission's 2017 report, "The World Drug PERCEPTION Problem - Countering Prejudices About People Who Use Drugs" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/reports/changing-perceptions/&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on how current perceptions of drugs and people who use them feed into and off prohibitionist policies. Indeed, drug policy reforms have been difficult to design, legislate or implement because current policies and responses are often based on perceptions and passionate beliefs, and what should be factual discussions leading to effective policies are frequently treated as moral debates. The present report aims to analyze the most common perceptions and fears, contrast them with available evidence on drugs and the people who use them, and provides recommendations on changes that must be enacted to support reforms toward more effective drug policies.

AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD WEDNESDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 2018

The Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 are meant to be a transformational agenda to eradicate poverty, achieve gender equity or save the planet through their implementation. This implementation, based on coherent public policies, is still lacking at the national, regional and international levels. This is most visible in drug policy, where voices from health, human rights and science call for reform, while most countries continue to privilege ideology through law-enforcement and militarization.

The members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy draw from their experience at the highest policy and political levels to provide an analysis of how - beyond powerful words and slogans - sustainable development is impeded by drug control while providing a single, groundbreaking recommendation to address this situation.

== [http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/reports/regulation-the-responsible-control-of-drugs/ 2018 Report] ==

The Global Commission on Drug Policy released its newest report in [[Mexico City]], Regulation: The Responsible Control of Drugs. This report examines in detail how governments can take control of currently illegal drug markets through responsible regulation, thereby weakening criminal organizations that now profit from them.

This new report provides a practical roadmap that tackles the real implications and recognizes the difficulties of transitioning from illegal to legally regulated drug markets. It offers concrete answers regarding the organizational capacity of state institutions to regulate and control a legal market of potentially dangerous products. It highlights the challenges facing impoverished populations that constitute the “working class” of the illegal drug markets. It offers possible ways forward to deal with the risks inherent to the resilience of organized crime. Finally, this report calls for a reform of the prohibition-based international drug control system, which is compromising a universal and holistic approach to the “drug problem”.

'''''Gopala Gopala''''' is an Indian 2015 [[Telugu language|Telugu]] [[wikt:devotional|devotional]] [[satire|satirical]] [[drama (genre)|drama film]] directed by Kishore Kumar Pardasani. The film was jointly produced by [[Daggubati Suresh Babu]] and Sharrath Marar under the [[Suresh Productions]] and North Star Entertainment banners. It features [[Pawan Kalyan]] and [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]] in the lead roles and [[Shriya Saran]], [[Mithun Chakraborty]] and [[Posani Krishna Murali]] in supporting roles. [[Anoop Rubens]] composed the music while [[Jayanan Vincent]] was the film's cinematographer.

The film is a remake of the 2012 Hindi film ''[[OMG&amp;nbsp;– Oh My God!]]'' which was itself based on the Gujarati stage play ''Kanji Viruddh Kanji'' and on the 2001 film ''[[The Man Who Sued God]]''. It follows the story of an [[atheist]], Gopala Rao, who sues God after losing his shop in an earthquake. Religious organisations revolt against him and [[Vishnu|Bhaghvan Vishnu]] visits him as his human guide, under his incarnation [[Krishna]].

''Gopala Gopala'' was made with a budget of {{INR}}120 million. Production began on 9 June 2014. It was predominantly shot in and around [[Vishakhapatnam]], with a few sections filmed in [[Hyderabad]] and [[Varanasi]]. The film was released worldwide on 10 January 2015 as a [[Sankranthi]] release. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed {{INR}}660 million, with a distributor share of {{INR}}411 million.

== Plot ==
Kanneganti Gopala Rao is an atheist who owns a shop selling Hindu idols alongside his wife Meenakshi and son Moksha as well as his assistant Otthu. He obstructs a holy ritual involving his family, conducted by Siddheswar Maharaj, a fake [[Godman (India)|godman]]. A sudden earthquake destroys his shop.

Rao approaches his insurance company who deny him assistance, claiming that an earthquake is an act of God. Rao decides to sue God but cannot find a lawyer willing to take the case on. He eventually engages Akbar Bhai, a disabled lawyer, who helps him file the case. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to Siddheshwar the priest and others from his group, as representatives of God. The court accepts the case, but Rao finds himself trapped among armed fundamentalists, with a creditor Ramji occupying the house and his wife having left him.

Rao is rescued by Gopala Govinda Hari, a consultant, who is revealed to the audience to be the deity [[Vishnu]], under his incarnation [[Krishna]] in disguise. Gopala buys Rao's house from Ramji but allows Rao to stay with him. The lawsuit caused a public outcry, so on Gopala's advice, Rao gives an interview to the media about his views, which turns viral; public opinion swings in his favour. Hundreds of people whose insurance claims were rejected due to an Act of God clause turn up at Akbar's house and join the fight. Rao agrees to fight on behalf of all of them.

In the next court session, defending lawyer Shankar Narayana points out that Rao has no document that can prove the disaster was an Act of God. The judge orders Rao to present a written proof that will support his claim. Gopala gives Rao the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Bible]] and [[Quran]] in which to find the answers. Rao subsequently points out a passage saying that "This world is a creation of God, and it is his will to allow it to grow or destroy", which strengthens his case. As he nears the end of his argument, he is stabbed by a staunch follower of Leeladhara.

Rao is rushed to the hospital where he slips into a coma due to heavy blood loss. Leeladhara then plans to make Rao a messenger of God and elevate him to a divine figure across the country after killing him. The lawsuit's verdict goes in Rao's favour and religious organisations are ordered by the court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs. After a month, Rao is rescued by Gopala, who later reveals his identity as [[Lord Vishnu]] by showing his [[Vishvarupa|Vishwaroopam]]. Rao starts to believe in the existence of God. Meanwhile, Leeladhara, Gopika Matha, and Siddheshwar open a temple dedicated to Rao and accumulate millions in donations. Rao learns that his death is planned for [[Vijayadashami]] which coincides with the death of [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Shirdi Sai Baba]]. He escapes with Gopala but is attacked by the priests' henchmen. Gopala manages to show them his 4th incarnation [[Lord Narasimha]] in place of Rao, scaring them off.

Rao arrives to find his statues erected at the place where his shop once stood. He wades through the stunned crowd and breaks the statue, then admonishes the crowd about trusting in godmen. He advises them to search for God inside themselves rather than worshipping statues. Rao prevents the crowd from attacking the priests, asking for them to be allowed to leave unharmed but also insisting that they stop believing in them. After the completion of [[Ramlila]], Rao goes back to Gopala to thank him, only to find him gone.

Rao's family arrive and they are reunited. He sees Gopala's key chain on the floor. When he is about to take it back, he hears Gopala's voice telling him to get rid of it. He throws it away, seeing it disappear into the sky with a flash as Gopala "signs off", promising him they will meet again.

== Themes and influences ==
The film is an official remake of the 2012 Hindi film ''[[OMG&amp;nbsp;– Oh My God!]]'' directed by [[Umesh Shukla]] which tells the story of an atheist who sues God for causing an earthquake in which he loses his shop. The film focuses mostly on exploiting people's faith in the name of business and money-making.&lt;ref name="TOI RH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Gopala-Gopala-Telugu-Movie-Review-Highlights/articleshow/45832578.cms|title=Gopala Gopala Telugu Movie Review Highlights|last=Kumar|first=Hemanth|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=10 January 2015|accessdate=10 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110154037/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Gopala-Gopala-Telugu-Movie-Review-Highlights/articleshow/45832578.cms|archivedate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daggubati Venkatesh said in an interview to ''[[The Hindu]]'' that this film would focus on the tensions between Indian rituals and spirituality. In the film, the deity involved, Krishna, teaches the atheist protagonist to use the principles of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Bible]] and [[Quran]] to win his case. A song introducing the atheist's character, his family and his views on rituals was added in which was not a part of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/actor-venkatesh-interview-gopala-gopala-is-an-ideal-vehicle-to-express-his-thoughts-on-the-difference-between-rituals-and-spirituality/article6760368.ece|title=A grain of thought|last=Devi Dundoo|first=Sangeetha|publisher=''The Hindu''|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=10 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110091213/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/actor-venkatesh-interview-gopala-gopala-is-an-ideal-vehicle-to-express-his-thoughts-on-the-difference-between-rituals-and-spirituality/article6760368.ece|archivedate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several new scenes were included in the Telugu version, including two songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Gopala-Gopala-gets-thunderous-response/articleshow/45835274.cms|title=Gopala Gopala gets thunderous response|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=10 January 2015|accessdate=10 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110153603/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Gopala-Gopala-gets-thunderous-response/articleshow/45835274.cms|archivedate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also deals with the issue of fake godmen. Daggubati Venkatesh said in an interview with Suresh Kavirayani of the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]], ''"We all know about these people. Media also publishes stories about them all the time. We wanted to create some awareness among the people, so we touched on the theme of fake godmen. But there are genuine people too, who give wonderful messages and enlighten people with their preaching".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150108/entertainment-tollywood/article/we-have-exposed-fake-godmen-venkatesh|title=We have exposed fake godmen: Venkatesh|last=Kavirayani|first=Suresh|publisher=''Deccan Chronicle''|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=10 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110153019/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150108/entertainment-tollywood/article/we-have-exposed-fake-godmen-venkatesh|archivedate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of the song ''Enduko Enduko'' question the superstitions people believe in.&lt;ref name="TOI RH" /&gt;

Dialogues written for and uttered by Kalyan's character in the film were linked to the politics of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Comments such as "Nenu time ki Raavadam Kaadu Tammudu, Nenu Vachake time avutondi" ("I don't come on time; time starts when I come"){{efn|These dialogues are translated from [[Telugu language|Telugu]] to English.|name = "translate"}} and "Samardhulu Intlo undipothe Asamardhulu Rajyamelutaru" ("The unskilled will rule if the skilled stay at home"){{efn|name = "translate"}} appeared to refer to the change in government and Kalyan's own entry into politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Pawans-punch-dialogues-in-Gopala-Gopala/articleshow/45841940.cms|title=Pawan's punch dialogues in Gopala Gopala|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=11 January 2015|accessdate=11 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111130356/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Pawans-punch-dialogues-in-Gopala-Gopala/articleshow/45841940.cms|archivedate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemanth Kumar of ''[[The Times of India]]'' rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote "''Gopala Gopala'' begins as a story about an atheist, who seems to offend a lot of people around him, and in the end, the film drives home the point that when you help others, it is as good as worshiping God himself. And in doing so, the film churns out plenty of thought provoking questions which force you to look for answers within yourself and this is perhaps the film's biggest achievement.

In contrast, [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]] rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote "It would've been nice if the core plot was retained and changes were made to the film and its characters. But you can't watch ''Gopala Gopala'' with such expectations because it successfully reproduces scenes and characters from the original as though remaking is misunderstood as copying frame-to-frame. One way it's commendable that the makers didn't try to make many changes since the remake features popular stars such as Daggubati and Pawan, who usually play to the gallery. But all this has been done at the cost of creativity and that's what makes the remake less exciting, if not boring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/gopala-gopala-a-faithful-remake-sans-creativity-ians-telugu-movie-review-115011100265_1.html|title='Gopala Gopala': A faithful remake sans creativity (IANS Telugu Movie Review)|author=IANS|publisher=[[Business Standard]]|date=11 January 2015|accessdate=11 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111082206/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/gopala-gopala-a-faithful-remake-sans-creativity-ians-telugu-movie-review-115011100265_1.html|archivedate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of rent control in England and Wales''' is a part of [[English land law]] concerning the development of [[rent regulation in England and Wales]]. Controlling the prices that landlords could make their tenants pay formed the main element of [[rent regulation]], and was in place from 1915 until its abolition (excluding some [[council house]]s) by the [[Housing Act 1988]].

There have been significant changes in attitudes and legislation toward the [[right to housing]] in [[mainland Britain]]. Concepts, such as [[rent control]], 'security of tenure', [[statutory tenancy]], [[regulated tenancy]], [[fair rent]], rent officer, [[Rent Officer Service]] and [[assured tenancy]]  were introduced in the twentieth century, and have developed in the years since. It concerns the intervention of public law rights in private relations between landlord and tenant, and was put in place to counteract the [[inequality of bargaining power]] between landlords and tenants.

==1915 to 1939==
Rent control and security of [[tenure]] were first introduced on 23 December 1915 with the [[Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act 1915]] and were intended to be temporary measures (due to expire six months after the end of the First World War) to deal with excessive increases in rents caused by the wartime housing shortage due to the cessation of building.

The Act attempted to remedy this evil by restricting the right of landlords to eject their tenants and prevented them from raising the rent except for limited purposes. At the same time, in fairness to the landlords, mortgagees of houses controlled by the Act were prevented from increasing the rate of interest and restricted in their rights to enforce the security. This was the first comprehensive European enactment controlling rent; since then many other Acts have been passed in Great Britain, and of course, in other European countries.

Before the 1915 Act, the relationship between landlord and tenant had been purely contractual; at the expiration or termination of the contract, the landlord could recover possession.

===Scope of control===
The new form of control was relatively simple and inflexible. The Act applied to separate dwellings with rateable values or standard rents not exceeding £35 in [[London]], £30 in [[Scotland]] and £26 elsewhere.

Specifically excluded were:
*dwellings let with land other than a garden or let with other premises;
*lettings at a rent of less than two thirds the rateable value;
*lettings where the rent included payment for board, attendance or furniture.

====Standard rent====
The controlled rent was known as the standard rent. It was the rent of a letting on 3 August 1914; or, where there was no letting on that date, the rent the dwelling had last been let for before that date; or, in the case of a first letting after 3 August 1914, the rent at which it was first let.

====Security of tenure====
Under the provisions of the Act, a tenant who paid the rent and observed other conditions of the tenancy, could only be evicted if the landlord could satisfy the Courts on certain grounds specified in the Act.

These were:
* that the tenant had committed waste or caused nuisance or annoyance to neighbours; or,
* that the premises were reasonably required by the landlord for his own occupation, or that of an employee.

In addition, the Courts could grant possession on any other ground it considered satisfactory.

====Premiums====
After 25 November 1915, premiums were not allowed to be paid by a tenant on the grant, renewal or continuance of any tenancy. Any amount paid was recoverable unless it was made payable by an agreement entered into before 4 August 1914. (Leases for 21 years or more were later excluded by the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act 1917).

====Rates====
The [[Statement of Rates Act 1919]] required any owner in England and Wales who received rent that included rates to show the amount in the rent book. The equivalent Scottish Act is the [[House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act 1920]].

Further extensions and amendments to the 1915 Act were made by the Acts of 1917, 1918 and two in 1919. Control was exempted from houses built alter 2 April 1919 or in process of construction at that date.

Rent control and security of tenure hardly proved to be such temporary measures as had been originally intended.

===Full control 1920 - 1923===
Following the report of the [[Salisbury Committee]] into the continuing deterioration in the housing supply, the [[Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920]] was passed, which consolidated and amended the earlier legislation. Most of the provisions were intended to be for a period of three years but they were successively extended and amended.
Any remaining provisions were repealed and consolidated by the [[Rent Act 1968]] and in Scotland by the [[Rent (Scotland) Act 1971]]. The 1920 Act is still the foundation of the modern law; most concepts of the Rent Acts are derived from it. It is suggested as a first source of reference for any original concepts which are not included in this brief summary.

====Scope of control====
The standard rent and [[rateable value]] limits were increased to £105 in London, £90 in Scotland and £78 elsewhere, and so applied to the great majority of let houses in the country. The concept of "statutory tenant" was introduced in this Act. Premises used for business, trade or professional purposes, or for the public service were brought within the Act for one year (with slightly different percentage increases to those outlined below for dwellings). New dwellings continued to be excluded from control.

The 1920 Act did not apply to houses erected, or in the course of erection, on 2 April 1919, nor to those that at that date or later were being reconstructed into two or more separate and self-contained flats or tenements.

A measure of control was introduced for the first time to a furnished letting of a dwelling covered by the Act. This control related to abnormal or excessive profits. In the latter case, the landlord was liable to a fine of up to £100.

====Standard rent====
The Act allowed increases in rent of up to 40% and in mortgage interest of 1% (up to a maximum of six and one half per cent). The 40% was made up of two elements. An increase of 15% was allowed, to compensate the landlord for the fall in the value of money during the [[World War I|Great War]]. A further increase in rent of 25% was allowed to cover expenditure on repairs where the landlord did the repairs. This latter increase could not be levied on tenants of unfit dwellings or dwellings in disrepair. In fact, it could be levied but the tenant (or the sanitary authority) could go to court to have it suspended until the repairs had been carried out.

Increases were also permitted, as a percentage of the relevant expenditure, following improvement or structural alteration. A tenant of a furnished dwelling was able to go to the [[county court]] (in Scotland the [[Sheriff Court]]) for an order to freeze the rent at a specified level and for repayment of any rent already paid in excess of that level.

====Premiums====
The Act now made it a penal offence, liable to a fine of £100, to require a premium, but reduced the length of excluded tenancies from 21 years or more to 14 years or more.

====Security of tenure====
Distress (in Scotland "diligence") could only be levied with consent of the court. Possession could be recovered if the court saw fit on a certain number of grounds, which were widened. The court lost its powers to grant possession on some unspecified but less satisfactory grounds.

====Succession====
There was a right of succession by the tenant’s widow if she was residing with him at his death or a member of the tenant’s family who had been residing with the tenant at the time of his death. A requirement for six months’ residence except for a widow was introduced by the 1933 Act.

===Gradual decontrol 1923 - 1933===
Following the report of the Onslow Committee, the [[Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act 1923]] became the first measure to reverse the machinery of control.

====Scope of decontrol====
Premises came out of protection when tenants died or moved away. Sitting tenants remained controlled. The Acts ceased to apply to premises for which a lease or tenancy of not less than two years’ duration was granted to a sitting tenant. It extended the grounds for recovery of possession.

====Furnished tenancies====
As has been said earlier, the 1915 Act had disapplied the Act where board, attendance, or furniture was provided. The 1923 Act now quantified the amount of attendance or provided furniture so that only substantial provision in rental terms would take the letting out of control.  In other words, the value of attendance (personal services provided to the tenant) or the value of the furniture had to form a substantial part of the rental value.

Subsequent legislation made minor amendments to previous enactments, and the [[Expiring Laws Continuance Acts 1927-1932]] ensured continuity of the Rent Acts until 1933.

==Gradual decontrol 1933==
The recommendations of the Marley Committee in 1931 were implemented in the [[Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act 1933]].

They had reported that the gradual decontrol inaugurated by the 1923 Act had worked satisfactorily with regard to the medium-sized houses, but too slowly to the largest and too quickly to the smallest. So the 1933 Act divided the dwellings the Acts applied to into three categories.

=== Scope of decontrol ===
The larger houses became decontrolled where both the annual recoverable rent and the rateable value exceeded £45 in London and Scotland and £35 elsewhere.

The middle group comprised all existing controlled houses where the rateable value exceeded £20 in London £25 and 5 shillings in Scotland and £13 elsewhere. These became subject to decontrol by the 1923 Act when the landlord obtained vacant possession or granted a new minimum period two-year lease or tenancy.

The remaining controlled houses, the smallest houses, were those with rateable values not exceeding £20/£25.25/£13 as above. These could not become decontrolled piecemeal but were to remain controlled until the Rent Acts expired. If a house within these rateable value limits had become decontrolled under the 1923 Act it was not automatically brought back into control by the 1933 Act. It could remain decontrolled provided the landlord registered it as decontrolled within three months of the enactment of the 1933 Act.

Rents could be increased by a percentage of the relevant expenditure to reflect the provision of additional or improved fixtures or fittings made after enactment of the 1933 Act.

A tenant of a dwelling that had become decontrolled by this Act had to be served one month’s notice that the possession would be required on the date specified in the notice unless a new tenancy had been negotiated before the notice ran out.

Succession

As has been mentioned above, the right of succession granted in the 1920 Act now required six months’ residence except for a widow. A widower could also succeed to the tenancy as a member of his deceased wife’s family provided that the six months’ test was satisfied.

Suitable alternative accommodation

The Act also added new grounds for recovery of possession by a landlord (e.g. suitable alternative accommodation being available now became a sufficient ground for the recovery of possession).
A second attempt (the first had been made in the 1919 Amendment Act) was made to prevent a tenant from charging an excessive rent on sub-letting part of the premises. Matters were certainly becoming more complicated.

===More decontrol 1938===

After yet another report, this one by Viscount Ridley’s Committee, the [[Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1938]] was introduced.

====Scope of decontrol====
The 1938 Act automatically decontrolled all the more valuable houses in the middle value band (i.e., houses that exceeded £35 in London and Scotland and £20 elsewhere) and prevented any further creeping decontrol (introduced by the 1923 Act) of the lower range of houses in the middle-value band).

The 1938 Act did not reintroduce control of a house in the middle-value band that the 1933 Act had decontrolled, but the landlord had to get it registered as decontrolled within three months.
Failure on the part of the landlord to meet the three-month deadline meant that the houses were deemed to be still controlled, unless the courts excused his failure to do so within one year from the passing of the Act.

For the first time, in defining the application of the Act, there was no reference to rent limits. Because rateable values were now the sole criterion for the continued applicability of the Acts, the result was decontrol of a large number of houses where the recoverable rent would have kept them in control.

==1939 to 1945==

===Full control again 1939 - 1945===
Just when it must have seemed that the end of control was in sight, the threat of war revived fears of the excessive rent increases that led to the initial introduction of control in 1915, the ''Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act 1939'' was introduced.

===Scope of control===
All dwellings not already subject to control, and with rateable values that did not exceed £100 in London, £90 in Scotland and £75 elsewhere were brought back into control.

It also brought to an end the creeping decontrol under the 1933 Act (whereby the landlord had been able to obtain vacant possession or decontrol had come about by the grant of a two-year lease or tenancy). The form of control introduced for the newly controlled dwellings differed from that previously in existence and they became "new control" and "old control" respectively. The distinction is no longer of importance, now that "control" has been replaced by "regulation". For the first time [[local authority]] dwellings were excluded from control.

Like its First World War predecessor, the Second World War legislation was only intended to continue in force "the principal Acts" until six months after the emergency ended. These were the Rent And Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts 1920 - 1938 and were due to expire in 1942. The Order in Council that should have declared the end of the emergency was never made, and the Acts, as amended, continued in force until 1968 (1971 in Scotland).

==1945 to 1957==

===The post-war period===
ln the aftermath of wartime bomb damage, shortage of materials and building restrictions, the increased demand for homes from those returning from the conflict resulted in housing shortages that continued into the next decade. No attempt was made to introduce any form of rent decontrol.

The [[Building Materials and Housing Act 1945]], which was passed on 20 December 1945, limited selling and letting prices for certain houses.

The Act increased the amount of loan Treasury could raise under the ''Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944'' to £200M. Local authorities were enabled to grant loans to acquire or construct homes costing up to £1,500 each.

====Permitted Rent====
A house or a flat constructed under building licence under the Defence Regulations made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts 1939-1945 could be subject to a condition limiting the price for sale or rent (the "permitted rent").

The 1945 Act imposed a time limit of four years (subsequently raised in 1949 to eight years) during which a breach of the limit rendered the transgressor liable to a fine up to the aggregate of:-
a) the financial gain from the offence;
b) a fine of £l00; or
c) imprisonment for up to three months, or to both a fine and imprisonment.

====Furnished lettings====
A second committee set up in 1943 under Viscount Ridley to review the working of the rent restriction Acts formed a very favourable opinion of the Rent of Furnished Houses Control (Scotland) Act 1943 and recommended that England and Wales should follow suit. The [[Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946]] established a separate system of protection—modelled on Scottish legislation that involved rent tribunals setting reasonable rents—for contracts referred to them for furnished lettings. Previously these had not been subject to any effective control under the Rent Acts.

====Scope of Control====
Initially, the 1943 and 1946 Acts applied, irrespective of the dwelling’s rateable value or the rent. ln England and Wales, local authorities were required to keep registers of the rents so determined (registers were maintained by the tribunals themselves in Scotland).

This system was quite separate from the general rules as to control under the principal Acts.

====Furniture====
The rent had to include payment for the use of furniture or for services (which included attendance and any other privilege such as the right to a cycle storage space). The provision of board (but only if it formed a substantial part of the rent) took the letting outside the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal.

Both the 1943 and 1946 Acts were temporary measures but were continued in force by successive Expiring Laws Continuation Acts. In 1974 the 1946 Act principles were re-deployed as the method of protecting the tenants of resident landlords. Both survive in the Rent Act 1977 and the Rent Act (Scotland) Act 1984.

====Reasonable rents====
The [[Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949]] cured a number of defects in earlier Acts and empowered rent tribunals to determine, upon application to them by either the landlord or the tenant, a reasonable rent for any dwelling-house to which the Rent Acts applied, which was first let after 1 September 1939. The rent so determined became the standard rent.

====Security of tenure====
This Act gave rent tribunals the power to suspend the operation of a notice to quit for a successive periods of up to three months at a time. It also debarred an application to a rent tribunal for an extension of security of tenure for a furnished letting where the tribunal, on an earlier reference, had given less than the maximum statutory period of security.

====Premiums====
The 1949 Act also extended to all tenancies of dwelling-houses to which the Rent Acts applied, the penalties relating to the payment of premiums, and hidden premiums in consideration of leases of up to fourteen years

====Shared Accommodation====
It applied the provisions of the 1943 and 1946 Acts to contracts, for both furnished and unfurnished lettings, under which the tenant shared some living accommodation with the landlord. Where the tenant shared some living accommodation with persons other than the landlord, it applied the Rent Acts to the contract.

===1951 to 1956===
The [[Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Protection of Civil Interests) Act 1951]] conferred on [[Armed forces|servicemen]] the same protection as that provided under the Rent Acts in cases where their tenancies were not already within those Acts.

Incidentally, this Act has been amended on several successive occasions whenever there has been an amendment to the protection given by the Rent Acts to ensure that servicemen would have a rented home to return to.

The [[Crown Lessees (Protection of Sub-Tenants) Act 1952]] brought within the Rent Acts tenants, lessees and mortgagors of Crown property, except where the Crown was the immediate landlord, lessor or mortgagee.

The [[Accommodation Agencies Act 1953]] prohibited the taking of money from a prospective tenant simply by registering his name and requirements and prevented the making of charges simply for supplying the addresses of accommodation available to let. Local authorities in England and Wales were given power to prosecute in the magistrates’ court.

The [[Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954]] sought to encourage landlords to repair controlled houses by allowing a "repairs increase" in the rent for houses brought into. and maintained in, good repair. It also sought to encourage the building and conversion of houses for letting to tenants by excluding from control all dwelling-houses built after 30 August 1954 and all separate, self-contained dwellings produced by conversion after that date, except in cases that had attracted improvement grants.

[[Rent tribunal]]s were empowered to fix, upon application, an appropriate increase in the rent for increases in the cost of providing services in pre 1939 Act controlled tenancies.
All tenancies owned by local authorities, development corporations and housing associations and trusts were excluded from the application of the Rent Acts.

The passing on to the tenant of rates increases and limited increases in rent attributable to improvements or structural alterations carried out by the landlord to a dwelling had been permitted since the inception of the Rent Acts. The 1954 Act permitted specified increases for dwelling-houses that were kept in good repair by the landlord, but limited the total rent recoverable to twice the gross value of the dwelling-house.

It removed the ban on [[wikt:premium|premium]]s in the case of the assignment of leases granted for periods exceeding 21 years, it relaxed the rules if a premium was paid on the grant, continuance, renewal or assignment of a tenancy if it consisted of reasonable expenditure on alterations or improvements, or a reasonable amount for goodwill.

====Extension and release====
Part l of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] extended Rent Act protection to tenants under long leases at low rents, and to the sub-tenants of tenants under such leases, by providing a procedure that converted those tenants into statutory tenants on the expiry of their tenancies.

The [[Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act 1955]] released from requisition those houses where the licensed occupier was accepted by the owner as a statutory tenant. The owner of the house was compensated for giving up the right to possession.

Passed only after several particularly severe smoke-polluted fogs (called "smog") in London and the industrial towns had caused health problems, the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] (which applied north and south of the border) reimbursed expenditure spent on the adaptation of fireplaces to burn smokeless fuel. The work counted as an improvement for rent increase purposes under the Rent Act 1957. Eight percent of the cost (net of any reimbursement) could be added to the rent.

==Decontrol 1957 to 1965==
The [[Conservative Government 1957–1964|new Conservative government]] passed the [[Rent Act 1957]] which decontrolled all the more valuable houses and reintroduced a system of gradual decontrol in a revised form. lt also transformed the method of fixing the maximum rent payable by tenants by introducing a formula based upon rateable value.

Coming into effect on 6 July, the 1957 Act immediately decontrolled all dwelling houses and all contracts for furnished lettings of dwelling houses, with rateable values on 7 November 1956 exceeding £40 in the [[Metropolitan Police District]] or the [[City of London]] and Scotland, and £30 elsewhere in England and Wales; and tenancies granted for a period exceeding 21 years.
No new tenancies were to be subject to control, whatever the rateable value of the premises, unless granted to a tenant who was immediately before its creation a controlled tenant of the same premises or premises that included them.

Premiums and payments of rent in advance were forbidden to be charged to tenants of premises that had become decontrolled by the Act for a period of three years from the commencement of the Act. A minimum of four weeks’ notice to quit was introduced and the Act enabled the exchange of controlled tenancies by agreement of all parties concerned, without loss of security or rent control, The Act used the word "exchange" although "transfer" would have been more apt.

The "standard rent" was replaced with a new "rent limit" calculated by multiplying the 1956 Gross Value by a factor determined according to the repairing liabilities of the parties. For instance, where the landlord was responsible for all repairs and external decoration, (the tenant being responsible for internal decoration only) the 1956 Gross Value would be multiplied by two to produce the annual rent limit. Other multipliers were to be used for different repairing and decorating liabilities.

The "rent limit" could be increased for rates borne by the landlord and by a reasonable charge for the provision of any furniture or services. The limit was subject to periodic adjustment to take account of changes in the amount of the rates, changes in the provision of furniture or services and for improvements.

It could be reduced when the dwelling became in disrepair. Eight per cent of the net cost of any improvement (i.e. after deducting the amount of any grant received by the landlord) for works completed after 5 July 1957 could be added to the rent.

The Act gave the Minister power for future rent control by order requiring the affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were many newspaper reports of landlords victimising their (controlled) tenants to force them out of their homes. The new word "[[Rachmanism]]" (after [[Peter Rachman]], a property owner who was alleged to be responsible for many of these cruel activities) was introduced into the language.

===Suspension of possession orders===
The [[Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Act 1958]] prohibited the recovery of possession except by legal proceedings of certain dwelling houses released from control by Section 11(1) of the Rent Act 1957. It also suspended for a limited period the execution of any order made for possession for those still remaining in their homes on 1 August 1958, by postponing the effect of any earlier order for possession. lt regulated the rent payable pending recovery of possession (to twice the 1956 gross value, plus rates, and for services and furniture unless the contractual rent previously payable was higher). It made it an offence to recover possession other than by proceedings in court and to withhold services or furniture to which the tenant was entitled.

Certain grounds were provided whereby a landlord could try to satisfy the court that an order for possession should subsequently be granted.

===Excessive payments for furniture===
The [[Landlord and Tenant (Furniture and Fittings) Act 1959]], which came into force on 29 July 1959 prohibited landlords from requiring excessive payments for furniture, fittings, and other articles as a condition of the grant, renewal, continuance, or assignment of tenancies of dwellings. Such payments were an attempt to find a way round the prohibition to require a premium in the ''Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949.''

===Powers of inspection===
Offenders attempting to obtain from prospective tenants excessive amounts for furniture and fittings were liable to be punished by a fine not exceeding £l00. Local authorities were given powers to inspect dwellings where they suspected an offence had been committed.

Private street works made under the [[Highways Act 1959]], which updated earlier provisions in the [[Public Health Act 1875]] and the [[Private Street Works Act 1892]] counted as improvements. Their net cost were included in the calculation of rent increases.

===Repairing liabilities in short leases===
The effect of the neglect of repairing liabilities during and after the Second World War faced many tenants on short leases with huge bills for dilapidations to make good dwellings which had been originally let in a poor state of repair. Such tenants did not at that time have sufficient security of tenure to enable them to reap the benefit from carrying out major repairs.
Under the [[Housing Act 1961]] (see particularly sections 32 and 33) where a tenancy of a dwelling house for less than seven years was granted after 24 October 1961, the landlord was required by an implied covenant to keep in repair the structure and interior (including drains, gutters and external pipes) and to keep in repair and proper working order the installations in the house for the supply of water, gas and electricity, for sanitation, and for space heating and heating water. This applied whatever the rent or the rateable value.   The Act included a provision to prohibit the backdating of a lease.  The term of years counted from the date of lease signing.

The 1961 Act increased the percentage addition to the rent for the net cost of improvement works carried out after 24 November 1961, from eight per cent (as it had been in the Rent Act 1957) to twelve and one half per cent.

===Weekly rent books===
The [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1962]] required landlords to provide rent books for tenancies when rent was payable weekly (except where board represented a substantial part of the rent). This Act had a more general application than the 1938 Act, and consolidated certain requirements from the 1933 Act and the 1957 Act. Information to include was prescribed, and the tenant was given the right to obtain information, particularly when the landlord was a company. The penalty for an offence was a fine not exceeding £50 (or £100 for a second conviction).

The [[Housing Act 1964]] set up the [[Housing Corporation]] to assist housing associations to provide housing accommodation in England, Wales and Scotland. It authorised the [[Scottish Special Housing Association]] to act on behalf of the Housing Corporation in Scotland.

===Standard amenities and grants===
The 1964 Act conferred on local authorities the duty to compel the improvement of dwellings that were without standard amenities and amended improvement grant legislation to provide improvement grants and standard grants. The standard amenities were:

* a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom with a supply of hot and cold water;
* a wash hand basin with a supply of hot and cold water;
* a hot and cold water supply to a sink;
* a water closet; and
* satisfactory facilities for storing food.

===Protection from eviction===
The [[Protection from Eviction Act 1964]] of 17 December 1964 was an interim measure intended to run to the end of 1965 and then expire.  This to give time for an overhaul of  the legislation.

It restricted the eviction of residential occupiers from their homes. Widows and widowers and members of the family living with the residential occupier at the date of death were also covered. Agricultural service occupiers were treated as tenants for 1964 Act purposes.

It became unlawful to evict other than by proceedings in the [[County court#England and Wales|county court]] or to withdraw or withhold services or furniture. On summary conviction, the offender was liable to a fine of £100 or six months’ imprisonment, or both.

These new offences of illegal eviction and harassment were soon to be absorbed into the [[Rent Act 1965]] and eventually to be transferred into the [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]].

The courts could suspend recent possession orders, could suspend the execution of an order for possession for up to twelve months and could impose certain conditions and terms.

There were a few exceptions (e.g., tenancies the following Acts applied to: Small Landholders (Scotland) Acts 1886-1931, Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act 1949, Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949, Crofters (Scotland) Acts 1955-1961). Nothing affected the operation of the Small Tenements Recovery Act 1838 (which included brothels and premises acquired for defence purposes) or the Pluralities Act 1838 or the Lecturers and Parish Clerks Act 1844 (ecclesiastical property).
It postponed until the end of March 1966 the decontrol of dwellings requisitioned during the war.

==Rent Regulation 1965 to 1989==

===A new rent system 1965 to 1971===
The [[Labour Government 1964–1970|Labour Government elected in 1964]] had pledged to repeal the 1957 Rent Act. lt was clearly impossible to re-impose rent control in a simple way. A Committee on Housing in Greater London under the chairmanship of [[Milner Holland|Sir Milner Holland, QC]], reported in March 1965. They found that there was "an acute shortage of rented housing in London and many difficulties and hardships arising from it". This was not a situation peculiar to London. They observed that neither rigid control nor piecemeal and haphazard decontrol could relieve the situation and that any new system of control (or regulation) should provide that rents in future should be subject to periodic review.

In this situation and in these circumstances came a new piece of legislation that was a major turning point. [[Richard Crossman]], Lord Goodman, who became President of the Institute of Rent Officers and others claimed paternity rights.

The [[Rent Act 1965]] introduced the Rent Officer Service. The [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]], which later became part of the [[Department of the Environment (UK)|Department of the Environment]], and then [[Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions]], was responsible for setting up the administrative arrangements and the appointment of the first Rent Officers, in England and Wales.   Appointments were made by the "proper officer"  a designated official in each local authority (usually the chief executive or senior legal executive of the county council or of each [[London borough]] who was responsible for providing accommodation, for supervision and disciplinary matters.   The service was funded from central government by grant claims.

In practice these matters were delegated to a Senior Rent Officer in each of the seventy-seven original registration area offices.  Decisions made by individual Rent Officers were considered as to be made independently.  The system was devised so that Rent Officer’s decisions could not be influenced by local or central government.  Administrative staff  were appointed who were employed by the local authority.

The first Rent Officer appointments were made in the [[City of Westminster]] where Rent Officers appointed in other registration areas were trained. Early appointments were made from the legal profession, from the Inland Revenue valuation office, former estate agents, property managers, and retired ex-military and retired ex-policemen.  The first rent registration was made on a flat above a fishmongers shop in Paddington Street, [[Marylebone]], London W1.

The Institute of Rent Officers (IRO) was formed to promote a professional approach and to carry out education and training.   The Journal of the Institute of Rent Officers JIRO was published quarterly to encourage discussion of procedures, valuation practice and to provide information about new legislation and "case law" arising from legal decisions in the Courts relating to landlord and tenant matters.

The Educational Trust of the Institute of Rent Officers published guides and a brown-coloured Manual of Rent Regulation which provided practitioners with annotated amendments as complete reprinted pages to residential landlord and tenant legislation in loose-leaf form. This important and prompt updating service incorporated the many amendments noted in this guide. The brown manual could often be seen on the bench of high court judges and in the hands of solicitors and barristers representing landlords and tenants in the courts.

===Scope of regulation===
The 1965 Act brought within protection most houses that were decontrolled by the 1957 Act, and newer houses that had never been controlled (i.e., newly erected or produced by conversion after 30 August 1954). It gave security to tenancies of most dwelling houses with rateable values of up to £400 in Greater London and £200 elsewhere not already controlled. The 1965 Act cleverly began by stating that a tenancy under which a dwelling house (which could be a house or part of a house) was let as a separate dwelling was a protected tenancy.

There were certain exceptions (which were modified and added to in subsequent legislation).  References are those in Part I of the later consolidated Rent Act 1977:
*Section 4 	Dwelling-houses above certain rateable values
*Section 5	Tenancies at low rents
*Section 5A	Certain shared ownership leases
*Section 6	Dwelling-houses let with land other than the site of the house
*Section 7	Dwelling-houses bona-fide let at a rent that includes board (a meal or meals)and/or attendance (services personal to the tenant) where the value to the tenant forms a substantial part of the rent
*Section 8	Lettings to students pursuing a course of studies
*Section 9	Where a dwelling-house was let for the purpose of a holiday
*Section 10	Agricultural tenancies
*Section 11	Licensed premises
*Section 12	Where the landlord was resident in the same house
*Section 13	Where the interest of the landlord belonged to Her Majesty in the right of the Crown
*Section 14	Local authority tenancies
*Section 15	Housing association tenancies
*Section 16	Housing co-operative tenancies
*Section 22	Tenants sharing accommodation with persons other than the landlord
*Section 24	Premises with a business use

The [[Rent Act 1965]] introduced three major innovations. Firstly, except for furnished lettings, it was the first time that a new long-term flexible approach had been brought to the old problem of rent control. It substituted the rent-fixing formula of earlier legislation with independent rent regulation by Rent Officers. This introduced the normal valuation principles into the assessment of a fair rent (section 68 in the Rent Act 1965 and Section 70 in the consolidated Rent Act 1977) by requiring that regard should specifically be had to the age, character, locality and state of repair of the dwelling. Personal circumstances were to be disregarded as were improvements carried out voluntarily by, and any disrepair or defects attributable to, the tenant or a predecessor in title. A most fundamental concept was introduced whereby it had to be assumed that the number of persons seeking to become tenants of similar dwelling houses in the locality on the terms (other than those relating to rent) of the regulated tenancy was not substantially greater than the number of such dwelling-houses in the locality that were available for letting on such terms. This requirement to assume a roughly balanced market was described by commentators as the "scarcity factor", (words that did not appear in the Act). There was an automatic rent review (but only if applied for) at three-yearly intervals (reduced to two-yearly intervals in the 1980 Housing Act).

Secondly, it instituted rent registration, schemes for the appointment of Rent Officers and a nationwide Rent Officer Service.  Rent Officers were required, in accordance with specified procedures, upon application to determine and register fair rents. Objections to the rents determined by Rent Officers by either landlords or tenants were to be passed to a network of [[rent assessment committee]]s with appellate jurisdiction. Rent Officers appointed as "statutory officers" therefore had a quasi-judicial function.  As a tribunal of first instance they had the same duty as the former furnished rent tribunals to determine their own jurisdiction to act upon an application.   Appeals against  such decisions as to jurisdiction were to be considered by the County Court.

Thirdly, the Act made it an offence for any person unlawfully (i.e. without a court order) to evict a tenant or to harass with the intention of persuading the tenant to move out or to forego any rights in respect of the premises. The offences applied irrespective of the dwelling’s rateable value and service occupiers and other licensees whose licence was still in existence were also protected.

The percentage increase of the net cost to be added to the rent for improvements carried out after 8 December 1965 and after the rent had been agreed, was twelve and one half per cent.

The right of succession to a statutory tenancy was extended to enable the tenancy to be transmitted to a second successor on the same rules applicable to the transmission on the death of the original tenant or of the first successor.

The 1965 Act also raised to £400 in Greater London and £200 elsewhere the rateable value limits of furnished houses within the jurisdiction of [[rent tribunal]]s and extended the maximum period by which they could delay the operation of a notice to quit to six months. The presidents of rent assessment panels in England and Wales were empowered to make appointments to Rent Tribunals in their areas.

The 1965 Act provided for the conversion of statutory tenancies subsisting under the provisions of the [[Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act 1955]] by extending its time limit for this purpose. This finally tidied up one of the remaining consequences of the wartime emergency. The [[Airports Authority Act 1965]] added the net cost of soundproofing works to the list of improvements that could increase rents.

The [[Agriculture Act 1967]] contained provisions relating to the letting and recovery of farm houses that became redundant following the amalgamation of farms under that Act.

The [[Leasehold Reform Act 1967]] brought back into the Acts long tenancies (a tenancy granted for a term of years certain exceeding twenty-one years) (other than those at a low rent), but unintentionally applied to them the Rent Act inhibitions upon premiums.

The [[Caravan Sites Act 1968]] made it unlawful, without the sanction of the courts, to deprive a person who occupied a [[travel trailer|caravan]] as a residence, whether owned or rented, on a caravan pitch that was protected (one that required a site licence under the [[1960 Caravan Sites and Development Act]]). The 1968 Act gave courts the power to suspend possession orders up to twelve months and protected caravan occupiers against harassment. Local authorities had power to prosecute. Harassment and illegal eviction was punishable by a fine of £100 for the first offence and £500 and six months imprisonment (or both) for a second offence.

With the exception of section 16 of the 1957 Act (notices to quit) and Part III of the 1965 Act (illegal eviction and harassment), the [[Rent Act 1968]] consolidated all the earlier Rent Acts; the [[Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946]], the [[Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949]], Part II of the [[Housing Repairs and Rent Act 1954]] and other related enactments (some twenty-four in all), without rationalising or simplifying them.

The 1965 Act had previously provided the power by [[Ministerial Order]] for the progressive conversion of existing controlled tenancies to regulated tenancies. This power was never exercised and the Housing Act 1969 introduced a phased programme of conversion, determined by rateable values, and the qualification certificate procedure outlined below, for those controlled tenancies in good repair and equipped with standard amenities.

Grants became available to provide dwellings by conversion or for improvements of existing dwellings and there were special grants for houses in multiple occupation. Grants to provide standard amenities were specified (e.g. £30 for a bath or shower; £50 for a water closet and £30 for a hot and cold water supply at a sink) The term "improvements" included the replacement of an existing fixture or fitting.

Qualification certificates could be issued by a local authority for premises that had all the standard amenities and were in good repair. A certificate of fair rent issued by the Rent Officer stated what the fair rent would be once any missing standard amenities had been provided. A fair rent could then be determined (the application was supported by the certificate of fair rent) but the increase in rent was phased over a period of four years (two years if the work had been aided by an improvement grant). Amount attributable to services Rent Officers had previously informally shown an amount for the value of services on the register. The 1969 Act required there to be a note on the rent register of the amount attributable to the provision of services (but not if the charge for the services was variable). A note was now also required of the increase over the amount for services in the previous rent (which could be calculated by apportionment if necessary). This amount affected the phasing calculation.

The Act introduced a new definition of a [[house in multiple occupation]] (HMO) and provided for registers and orders applying a management code. Powers were given to local authorities to close an HMO (or part of it) if it was not possible to provide a fire escape. It introduced the possibility of control orders to be followed by compulsory purchase orders. Directions were made to avoid or reduce overcrowding.

In determining whether a long tenancy was a tenancy at a low rent, the sums payable by the tenant in respect of rates, services, repairs, maintenance or insurance now had to be disregarded.

The Act removed most of the unintended consequences of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 in respect of premiums and the price to be paid for enfranchisement.   Increased rents registered between 10 July 1968 and 31 December 1969 were liable to phasing under the Prices and Incomes Regulations 1968 (which only applied until the end of 1969). When those regulations expired, the Rent (Control of Increases) Act 1969 (which only applied to the end of 1971) introduced phasing of rent increases generally speaking over three equal annual increments.

Improvements to the security of tenure available to occupants of agricultural [[tied cottage]]s were made by the [[Agriculture Act 1970]]. It amended Section 33 of the Rent Act 1965 to ensure that, subject to conditions, the tenant of a tied cottage, or his widow, would automatically get at least six months’ security of tenure alter the employment ended. This Act extended the provisions of the [[Agriculture Act 1967]] to Q redundant farm houses and not only just those redundant due to amalgamation of farms under the 1967 Act.

The [[Fire Precautions Act 1971]] made amendments to the Rent Act 1968 and arrangements to amend the Rent (Scotland) Act 1971. Where a dwelling was subject to a controlled or a regulated tenancy and the dwelling was issued with a fire certificate, the amount of the expenditure (or a proportion of it approved by the county court) incurred in fire precautions work was to be considered as an improvement in an application for a certificate of fair rent. The county court could, upon application, determine an increase in the rent of controlled or regulated tenancies due to the cost of carrying out fire precaution works.

===Adjustments in 1971 to 1977===
A review under the chairmanship of Hugh Francis QC was commissioned in October 1969 to review the operation of rent regulation under the Rent Acts, especially in large centres of population where accommodation was scarce, and to consider the relationship between the furnished and unfurnished codes.

Its conclusion, published on 2 March 1971, was that rent regulation was working well. The report made 36 recommendations, four of which were enacted in the [[Housing Finance Act 1972]], an Act that in its time had a minor claim to fame—57 committee sittings taking 248 hours of debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], which, it was suggested{{by whom|date=August 2011}}, justified a place in the [[Guinness Book of Records]].

The 1972 Act introduced many new concepts:

*Rent rebates were to be provided for all local authority tenants. Each local authority had to introduce a model scheme. Rent allowances were to be provided for private tenants whether protected or statutory. These were to be administered by the local housing authority and details of the availability of these allowances had to be entered in rent books.
Previously, rent rebates had been introduced on a discretionary basis (in Scotland by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966), which had led to haphazard, piecemeal and inconsistent implementation.
*There was also a requirement for more general publicity. Private landlords had to tell existing and new tenants about the availability of rent allowances.
*Remaining controlled tenancies could be converted by stages. The conversion machinery introduced by the Housing Act 1969 had enabled controlled tenancies to be converted unto regulated tenancies where the property was in, or was improved into, the required standard. The process was speeded up by the 1972 Act, which provided for automatic conversion of all remaining controlled tenancies, whether or not they met the 1969 Act criteria, by stages (intended to be completed in two years) according to the property’s rateable value. The earlier qualification certificate procedure was not being implemented as intended. Some over zealous local authorities had been misinterpreting what constituted "good repair" and it would have taken several years to complete the intended progress.
*Local authorities were given powers to apply to the Rent Officer to consider whether a rent should be registered in respect of any regulated tenancy. The Rent Officer had to be satisfied that the highest rent payable under the tenancy agreement exceeded a fair rent before he could proceed to register a rent.
*Landlords and tenants were given the right (subject to certain conditions) to apply, jointly, for cancellation of a registered rent. Such an application could only be  entertained by a Rent Officer after the expiry of the (then) three-year registration period The cancellation was only to be permitted of the Rent Officer considered that the agreed rent did not exceed a fair rent.
*It introduced the right to apply three months before the expiry of a previously controlled tenancy for consideration of a fair rent.   This enabled the standard administrative procedures to be completed in time so that the Rent Officer’s decision could be expected to coincide with the expiry of the previous registration.
*It unfroze the contractual rent limit, which had previously been fixed until the registration of a fair rent (some of which could have been set in 1965).
*Provision was made for landlords and tenants of regulated tenancies for which no fair rent had been registered, to agree (using a special written agreement) rent increases without reference to the Rent Officer and without losing their rights to make some future application for a fair rent to be determined. But if the rent agreement was the first to take effect after the controlled tenancy had been converted into a regulated tenancy by the 1972 Act, the agreement had to be lodged with the Rent Officer who would only allow the agreement to have effect if the agreed rent did not exceed a fair rent.
*Changes were made to statutory succession. Until this Act, a new tenancy granted to a first or second statutory success or had created new succession rights. From 27 August 1972, a new tenancy granted by succession to a person who was a statutory tenant by succession did not create any new succession rights. Another of the recommendations of the Francis Committee, to increase the maximum penalties for harassment and unlawful eviction, was included in the Criminal Justice Act 1972.

The [[Housing Finance Act 1972]] also brought fundamental changes to rent legislation. It became the duty of every local authority and new town corporation to determine a fair rent (on the same basis and definition as a fair rent for regulated tenancies) for every one of their housing revenue account dwellings. This was to be done by making provisional assessments of fair rents for their properties. These assessments had to be submitted to a rent scrutiny board that could confirm them or substitute different rents. These provisions were repealed in 1976. Dwellings owned by [[housing association]]s and [[housing trust]]s (usually charities), which were registered with the Housing Corporation (but not those that were registered societies under the [[Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965]]) were brought within the fair rent system. From 1 January 1973, their rents were to be determined by Rent Officers and registered in a separate part of the Rent Register. New subsidies were introduced for housing associations and housing trusts registered with the Housing Corporation.

For the first time, tenants were entitled to information about the cost of services provided by landlords when the cost exceeded £80. Local authorities, other public sector landlords (including housing associations) and management companies run by their tenants were excepted. A failure to provide information became a criminal offence.
The [[Rent Assessment Committee (England and Wales) Regulations 1971]] was the first of many Statutory Instruments that regulated procedures to follow when dealing with appeals against Rent Officer decisions.

===Rents frozen 1972===
Orders made under the [[Counter Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972]] froze rents at their level on 6 November 1972 (as well as prices and wages) as part of the government’s counter inflation measures. The freeze lasted initially for 90 days and was extended to 150 days by a later Order. Conversions from controlled to regulated tenancies (and in general, increases in rents of housing association tenancies) were postponed until the end of the standstill period.
The freeze applied to all private residential tenancies including those with rateable values above the Rent Act limits.
The [[Counter-Inflation Act 1973]] imposed a further freeze from March 1974 (until March 1975 in England and Wales) (until May 1975 in Scotland).

The [[Furnished Lettings (Rent Allowances) Act 1973]] extended the rent allowance scheme to furnished lettings (those contracts within Part VI Rent Act 1968) and for certain housing authority furnished lettings, except where the landlord was the Crown or where substantial board was provided.

===Rateable value limits 1973===
Owing to the increased pressure of demand for housing resulting in increased house prices by a continuing trend during 1971 and 1972, a Conservative government by the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 extended the scope of Rent Act protection of the higher rated accommodation horn 23 March 1973. The rateable value limits were raised from £400 to £600 in London and from £200 to £400 elsewhere for those properties appearing in the 1963 valuation list. Those limits were raised to £1,500 in London and to £750 elsewhere from 1 April 1973 to take account of the revised valuation list that took effect on that date. It was estimated that this brought a further 16,000 tenancies into protection.    Luxury blocks of flats with extensive [[porterage]] and services were swept into control and even in Central London only a few very large individual houses in [[Regent's Park]] were found to be outside the scope of Rent Act protection.
The rateable value limits for Rent Act protection were not changed for Scotland.

===Assimilation of furnished tenancies 1974===
Three important Acts were passed in the next two years rather surprisingly by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administration. The [[Rent Act 1974]] brought full protection to those existing furnished lettings where the landlord was not resident in the same premises. Previously they had had only limited protection under the 1943, 1946 and 1949 Acts. The concept of "resident landlord" was entirely new. For all new tenancies created on or after 14 August 1974, whether furnished or unfurnished, the factor to decide their protection was to be the residency or non-residency of the landlord.

The Housing Act 1974 gave many private tenants the right to additional information as to the identity of their landlord, and there was also a new duty to inform a tenant of a dwelling of the assignment of a landlord’s interest. It extended the right to information about service charges and introduced the right to challenge them. The form and content of certain notices to quit was to be prescribed by regulations to be made by the [[Secretary of State]] and the improvement grant system was re-vamped. Housing action areas, general improvement areas and priority neighbourhoods were introduced.

Grants for the provision of standard amenities, improvements (which were compulsory in some cases) and for the repair of dwellings were introduced. The Act also extended the powers of the Housing Corporation with regard to housing associations and amended the system of providing financial assistance to them.

===Phasing 1975===
The [[Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975]] repealed the provisions of the Housing Finance Act 1972 in relation to public sector dwellings and by and large gave local authorities a free hand in determining their rent policies. The gradual decontrol process based on rateable values was stopped, and a system of phased rent increases was introduced for all tenancies. Apart from the temporary provisions in the counter-inflation legislation in 1972 and 1973, mentioned earlier, there had been previously no phasing of increases of rent following re-registration of a fair rent.

These phasing arrangements required a careful scrutiny of the cost of providing services and assessment of the value of services. The Social Security (Consequential Provisions) Act 1992 required the amount attributable to services to be noted on the Rent Register to assist the assessment of housing benefit.

New amenities or improvements to a locality that were not provided at the landlords expense were to be disregarded in determination of a fair rent—and by a very late amendment, any deterioration in a locality that was not the fault of the landlord were to be disregarded. Semantics came into the valuation process. Fortunately these disregards were subsequently repealed.

===Agricultural workers protected 1976===
Some agricultural workers, forestry workers and members of their families had enjoyed security of occupation under the Rent Acts. The Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 conferred on occupiers of "tied cottages" protection similar to that enjoyed by Rent Act statutory tenants. Rents became eligible for registration under the fair rent system and such decisions kept in a separate part of the Rent Register.

===The great consolidation 1977===
In 1977 previous legislation (except the [[Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976]] was consolidated into the [[Rent Act 1977]] (which embodied the "temporary" counter inflation device of phasing) and the [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]] (which contained special provisions in respect of agricultural workers) consolidated the provisions of previous Rent Acts (chiefly the Acts of 1957 and 1965), which protected all residential occupiers from eviction without due process of law.

===Definitions===
"Sitting tenant" is not used in the legislation but is in general use to mean anyone who has a tenancy protected by legislation.   These are usually considered to be long term tenants.   A "fair rent" is a rent registered under the Rent Act 1977.  A  "Controlled tenancy" is a tenancy created before 1957.   A "Regulated tenancy" is one created after 1965 that is regulated now by the Rent Act 1977 and for which a rent can be registered by the Rent Officer (sometimes called a "Fair Rent Officer").    A "Protected tenant" is someone who has a tenancy protected by the Rent Acts.   This can either be a "Contractual tenancy" during the term of a lease (contract) or tenancy agreement.    When this contract expires the tenancy becomes a "Statutory tenancy" in which the tenant "holds over" under the protection of the statutes (Rent Acts) on the same terms as the original contract (in so far as they are not overtaken by statute).    It might be obvious but it is worth just repeating that a protected tenant with security of tenure is not much use if the rent cannot be controlled.  A fair rent is not much use unless the tenant has protection from eviction.

===1980 to 1989===
The [[Housing Act 1980]] made various amendments to the Rent Act 1977 that changed procedures for rent registration. The rent registration review period was reduced from three to two years. The periods of phasing of increases were consequently quickened. Following the referral of a decision to a Rent Assessment Committee the two-year period was made to run from the date of their decision rather than the original effective date. Registered rents were made effective from the date of registration rather than the date of the application. In those cases when the registration was made before the expiration of the two-year period, the registration took effect from the day following the expiry of the two-year period. The Act made changes to the procedures for the need for Rent Officers to call consultations in certain circumstances. The Act also made changes to the requirements necessary before a registration could be cancelled. The original registration had to be at least two years old. The landlord alone could make an application if the premises were no longer let on a regulated tenancy.

A new mandatory ground for possession (Case 20) was introduced for lettings by servicemen. Changes were made to the mandatory grounds for possession for lettings by former owner occupiers and those who own homes intended for retirement, which covered circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the time of the letting.

Rent Tribunals were abolished. Their functions, except for the power to grant security of tenure, were transferred to rent assessment committees. A more limited discretion to award security of tenure (a maximum of three months) was given to the county court, as part of the possession order proceedings.

Any remaining controlled tenancies were converted to regulated tenancies.

New protected shorthold tenancies were created that protected during the contractual term of a short fixed-term letting. A rent had to be registered at the time the tenancy was granted or a certificate of fair rent obtained before then and a registration made within twenty-eight days of the commencement of the tenancy. This requirement was removed for all registration areas outside Greater London by the Protected Shorthold Tenancies (Rent Registration) Order 1981 and for registration areas in Greater London by a similar order in 1987.

Assured tenancies were created that gave certain approved bodies the right to create assured tenancies of new dwellings outside Rent Act protection at market rents. These tenancies were subject to the provisions of Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.

Additional protection was given to council tenants and many housing association tenants, who were to be known as secure tenants.

Council tenants were granted the right to buy their homes.

Personal representatives of deceased resident landlords were given a period of two years (instead of the one year under the 1974 Act) during which they had freedom to evict.  The Act qualified the description of accommodations so that a tenancy of part of a flat in a purpose-built block occupied by a resident landlord could not be subject to a protected tenancy, an unintended effect of the wording in the Rent Act 1974.

Housing Associations registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 might now be registered with the Housing Corporation even if their objectives were to acquire, repair, improve or convert houses for eventual disposal by sale as well as by lease.
Prior to the 1980 Act, housing associations had to keep their houses available for letting and were therefore prohibited from selling them. Housing associations were now enabled to build or to improve property or to put existing properties up for sale into shared ownership.

Protection could now extend to previously protected tenancies—those that belonged to Her Majesty in right of the Crown, if managed by the [[Crown Estate]] Commissioners (largely in the right of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], tenancies that belong to the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]), statutory tenancies under the [[Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976]] and long leaseholds at low rents (Part I Landlord and Tenant Act 1954). (Tenants of the Crown direct and of government departments (which includes tenants of a Health Service Body) remain outside protection).

[[Shared ownership]] leases were not to be treated as long tenancies at a low rent for the purposes of the [[Leasehold Reform Act 1967]]. Rent Officers were asked to determine fair rents on a non-statutory basis for shared ownership properties. Initial enthusiasm was tempered when questions of some difficulty arose in the assessment of a fair rent relating to equity stakes and premiums. These were dealt with later in the [[Housing and Planning Act 1986]].
The [[Matrimonial Homes Act 1983]] consolidated certain enactments relating to the rights of a husband or wife to occupy a dwelling house that had been a matrimonial home. Occupation by one spouse was to be treated as occupation by the other spouse. The Act provided for the transfer of certain tenancies on divorce.
The [[Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976]] made provision for varying rights of occupation where both spouses (and a man and woman living together as man and wife) had rights in the matrimonial home. The 1976 Act and the 1983 Acts were further developed by the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, which also gave powers to the court in relation to the transfer of certain tenancies upon a decree of divorce, of nullity of marriage or of judicial separation.
The [[Mobile Homes Act 1983]] replaced sections 1 to 6 of the Mobile Homes Act 1976. It introduced important new rules about security of tenure to owners of residential mobile home sites and to those who owned the mobile home and rented a pitch from the site owner (including local authorities but not traveller sites). It exempted those who rent the mobile home from the site owner and those who only use it for holiday purposes.
It also dealt with sales and gifts of mobile homes, inheritance and change of site ownership, pitch fees, other terms of agreements and provided machinery for dealing with disputes.
The [[Rent (Amendment) Act 1985]] reversed the decision in Pocock v. Steel (1985 CA), which decided that an [[owner-occupier]] had to live in the house immediately before each and every letting to be able to obtain a mandatory order for possession. Words were inserted so that if it had "at any time" before the letting been occupied as the owner-occupier’s residence, Case l l Rent Act 1977 and the [[Rent (Scotland) Act 1984]] applied. This restored the original intention that had been destroyed by redrafting in the consolidation in 1968. This Act (apart from emergency legislation) broke all speed records in its passage through the Parliamentary timetables.

===Three main acts in 1985===
On 30 October 1985 there was a burst of general tidying up and consolidation with the publication of four Acts. The [[Housing (Consequential Provisions) Act 1985]] repealed 80 parts of Acts or whole Acts relating to England and Wales, 18 relating to Scotland and 4 to Northern Ireland (from the [[Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act 1891]] to Acts only just passed in 1985).

The [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] consolidated certain provisions relating to the law of landlord and tenant formerly found in the Housing Acts, Rent Acts and various other places. As such it created no new law. It incorporated sections as follows:
* Information to be given to a tenant (e.g. landlord’s identity etc.).
* Provision of rent books (information to be contained and offences).
* Implied terms as to fitness for human habitation.
* Repairing obligations.
* Reasonableness of service charges.
* Leasehold Valuation Tribunals jurisdiction in certain cases to be exercisable by Rent Assessment Committees.

The [[Housing Associations Act 1985]] consolidated certain provisions of the Housing Acts relating to housing associations and made some amendments to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commission and of the Scottish Law Commission. Its main headings were:
* The regulation of Housing Associations
* Housing association finance
* The Housing Corporation

The [[Housing Act 1985]] consolidated the Housing Acts (except the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Associations Act 1985) and certain related provisions, with amendments intended to implement the recommendations of the Law Commission. This mammoth initiative reduced the principal Acts relating to private lettings to the Rent Act 1977, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Associations Act 1985. However, it was not to be very long before further amendments were needed.

The [[Housing and Planning Act 1986]] required that lawful premiums (paid in respect of some shared ownership leases, certain long tenancies (sl27 Rent Act I977) should be taken into account in the determination of a fair rent.
Certain shared ownership leases were excluded from the operation of the Rent Act 1977, the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 and Part I of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967.

Until the mid-1970s mortgages were largely unavailable for the purchase of flats (or large deposits were required with repayments at a high rate of interest).  Large numbers of blocks of flats had been built in the 1930s usually on a leasehold basis for 99 years.  Individual flats could only be sold on long leases for the remaining sixty or so years.   Building societies did not consider this to be sufficient security for a mortgage.  Once building societies changed their policies to offer 75% or sometimes larger mortgages at the same rates as paid for those for house purchases, landlords were able to sell flats as they became vacant on long leaseholds.  Leases in older blocks with less than twenty years to run were almost impossible to sell. Landlords also began to offer long leases to sitting tenants sometimes at considerable discounts to open-market values.  Now people rushed to get on the property ladder as house and flat prices rose as demand was stimulated.   Investors from the Middle East after civil strife in Lebanon bought up many blocks of flats and moved to the UK.

Unfortunately for the new flat owners, they inherited responsibilities in their new long leases that required them to contribute to the cost of the repair and replacement.  Much of the equipment had been installed in the 1930s when the blocks built (lifts, central heating and hot water boilers, roofs and windows) which had been neglected in low rent times.   Residents’ associations were few and it took almost ten years before legislation was introduce to control exploitation by landlords and managing agents (whose fees calculated on the total cost of new work often at inflated cost also had to be paid by residents).
The Nugee Committee Report (under the chairmanship of E. G. Nugee QC), which commenced work in February 1984, finally reported in February 1986 on the management of privately owned blocks of flats. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 implemented the main recommendations and contained certain other measures relating to the rights of tenants of such flats and other dwellings. Various parts of the Act came into force on dates between February 1988 and April 1989.

* Certain qualifying tenants were given the right of first refusal to purchase their landlord’s interest on a relevant disposal.
* There was provision for the court to appoint managers to assume responsibility for the management of the premises containing flats where the landlord was in breach of any obligation owed to a tenant.
* Certain qualifying tenants were given the right to acquire their landlord’s interest without his consent by making application to the county court.
* Any party to a long lease was given the right to make an application to the county court for an order varying the terms of the lease.
* Substantial changes were made to the service charge provisions in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Service charges were to be held in trust, tenants were to be given additional rights as to insurance and recognized tenants’ associations were to be consulted about managing agents.
* A residential tenant’s right to information about the landlord was extended. The Rent (Relief from Phasing) Order 1987 removed the requirement to phase the increase in registered rents under the Rent Act I977 and for statutory tenancies under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 but did not alter the phasing arrangements for housing association tenancies. They followed suit sometime later. However, increases in rent for first registrations of old decontrolled tenancies still remained subject to phasing.

==De-regulation 1989==

===Freedom of contract===
From 15 January 1989 two systems were intended to operate side by side: one under the Rent Act 1977 and the other under the Housing Act 1988 depending upon whether the tenancy commenced before or after that date.

====Assured Tenancies====

For all new tenancies, with a few exceptions, this new Act introduced:
* assured periodic tenancies and provisions for the determination of their rents by rent assessment committees;
* [[assured shorthold tenancy|assured shorthold tenancies]] and provisions for the reference of excessive rents to rent assessment committees; and
* assured agricultural occupancies

====Stronger Penalties====

It strengthened the penalties for harassment and unlawful eviction by a system of damages by making amendments to the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. In an obscure comer (Schedule I7 "Minor and consequential amendments") it removed the final remaining provision for the phasing of increases of rent  - for housing association tenants.

====Succession and Other Changes====

The right to succession of statutory tenants was restricted, provision was made for the transfer of public sector tenancies to certain private sector landlords, Housing for Wales was established having functions relating to housing associations. The Act set up housing action trusts, made amendments to the right to buy, and provisions as to repair notices.

In Schedule 2 Part I there were mandatory grounds in which a court must order possession of an assured tenancy and other grounds in Part II in which a court may order possession.   The Ground 8 of Part I dealt with the amount of arrears at the date of the court hearing.  The amounts were reduced in the [[Housing Act 1996]].

===Housing benefit subsidy 1988===
But besides introducing changes that, in the long term, affected the future of the Rent Officer's role, the Housing Act 1988 created important new additional functions relating to the assessment of housing benefit subsidy.
Previously, housing benefit had been administered by local authorities.  There was strong evidence nationally of substantial fraudulent collusion between landlords and tenants when their tenants were claiming housing benefit .  The resulting higher rents were also having an effect to increase open market rent levels for those not claiming housing benefit.   Many millions of pounds of benefit subsidy were saved in the first year alone of Rent Officer intervention.   Although Rent Officers, to cut costs, were discouraged from inspecting premises before making a valuation, inspections were made whenever resources were available and certainly where the property was unknown to them or where the amount of rent being paid seemed unreasonable for the known accommodation.   Many fraudulent claims were discovered as a result of these inspections.

The Secretary of State was given powers to require Rent Officers to carry out these functions by [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|Statutory Instrument]]. These have proved much easier to produce and amend to promote efficient working arrangements (rather than the longer timetable required to produce Acts of Parliament).

The original Order and an amendment were made in 1989. The main Order was The Rent Officers (Additional Functions) Order 1990 (S.I. 1990 No. 428), which established procedures by which a Rent Officer, upon receipt of an application from a local authority, was required to determine whether the rent payable under an assured tenancy by a housing benefit claimant, was significantly above the market rent. The availability of housing benefit was to be disregarded and an informal definition was to ask what rent someone not claiming housing benefit would be willing to pay from their own pocket for the accommodation.  Tight timetables to be achieved in returning decisions (within four days or seven days where an inspection was necessary) so as not to create delays in payment of benefit during this additional process.

The Rent Officer was also required to determine whether the dwelling exceeded the size criteria set out in the order, which included consideration of the size of the household and the ages of its members. If the dwelling did exceed the criteria, the Rent Officer must determine a rent that accords with the size criteria for the occupiers.

There were provisions for a re-determination at the request of the local authority. The matter was to be dealt with by a maximum of two Rent Officers from adjoining registration areas who were to be advised by a Rent Officer from the original registration area (but not the person who made the original decision).

Further amendments were introduced by The Rent Officer (Additional Functions) (Amendment) Orders of 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995 amongst which there was a requirement to decide whether the rent payable was exceptionally high for the size of that accommodation in that locality.  lf it was, then the Rent Officer was required to determine a market rent that was not exceptionally high for a similar sized property.

When services are performed or facilities provided or rights made available to the tenant the Rent Officer was initially required to make a separate determination of that part of the rent attributable to those services.   Later this was changed so that it was not required to distinguish the amounts for furniture, meals or fuel charges.

===House renovation grants 1989===
Grants for the repair and improvement of residential premises were amongst many other provisions in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. These new renovation grants were also available for common parts of buildings; for the provision for facilities for the disabled; for the improvement or repair of (and conversion of houses into) houses in multiple occupation; and minor works such as thermal insulation.

Local authorities were given the opportunity to seek and act upon the advice of Rent Officers about the amount of the rent payable and of any increase in the rent payable, if the premises were already let. If unlet, advice could be sought and acted upon, of the amount of rent that might reasonably be expected to be obtained when the premises were let on an assured tenancy. Amendment was made to the Housing Act 1988 to include these additional functions for Rent Officers. A Statutory instrument later established the required procedures. Local authorities were empowered to seek the advice of Rent Officers for information to facilitate the calculation of grant payable. In respect of Scotland, there were further provisions in relation to the phasing progression to the registered rent for houses let by housing associations or Scottish Homes.

Long standing, low rent tenancies entered into after section 186 of the Act came into force were to become assured tenancies when those long tenancies came to an end. The Rent Officer (Additional Functions) (No.2) Order 1990 required Rent Officers to give advice (within 45 days of the application) about the rent increases which might reasonably be expected when the renovation works were completed.

From 4 January 1991, The Secretary of State for Wales exercised powers conferred by the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, and extended by the Welsh Language Act 1967, to prescribe certain forms for house renovation grants that could be submitted in the Welsh language, by statutory instrument, The Housing Renovation etc. Grant (Prescribed Forms and Particulars) Welsh Forms and Particulars) Regulations 1991.
There were further amendments in 1992 and 1994.

===Council tax 1993===
The [[Local Government Finance (Housing) (Consequential Amendments) Order 1993]] introduced an amendment to Section 70 Rent Act 1977 so that the registered rent should take into account any sums payable by the tenant to the landlord in respect of council tax. Certain definitions were introduced by the Council Tax (Liability for Owners) Regulations 1992 and subsequently amended by statutory instrument.
Ers Mehefin 10fed 1993 mae Ysgrifennydd Gwladol Cymru, wrth ymarfer pwerau o dan Ddeddf Rhentu 1997  a estynnwyd gan Ddeddf Iaith 1967 drwy Offeryn Stadudol 1993/1511, wedi gwneud  rheoliadau sydd yn rhagnodi fersiynau  Cymraeg o’r ffurflenni y gellir eu defnyddio yn lle fersiynau Saesneg trwy Deddf Rhentu ac yn y blaen.

On 10 June 1993, the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] in exercise of powers under the Rent Act 1977 extended by the Welsh Language Act 1967, by statutory instrument 1993/1511, made regulations that prescribed Welsh versions of the forms, which may be used in place of the English versions by the Rent Act 1977 etc.) (Welsh Forms and Particulars) Regulations 1993.

===Enfranchisement 1993===
The [[Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993]] amongst many other provisions conferred rights to collective enfranchisement and lease renewal on tenants of flats and enfranchisement by tenants of houses. Decisions were to be made by leasehold valuation tribunals.   Provision was made for auditing the management and service charges claimed for residential property and to promote codes of good management practice.

The [[Family Law Act 1996]] (which made provision with respect to divorce and separation and legal aid in connection with mediation in disputes relating to family matters) included legislation dealing with the right of occupation of certain domestic premises and the transfer of tenancies between spouses and persons who have lived together as husband and wife.

The [[Housing Act 1996]] included provisions about the social rented sector; houses in multiple occupation; the administration of housing benefit, the conduct of tenants, the allocation of housing by local housing authorities and [[homelessness]].

A landlord may not now exercise a right of re-entry or forfeiture for failure to pay a service charge unless it has been agreed by the tenant or has been the subject of a determination by a court or appeal tribunal.  New rules were made about the determination of reasonableness of service charges and the rights upon application by a tenants’ association to appoint a surveyor to advise on service charges, amending the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.   The power to appoint of a manager of property was transferred from the courts to a leasehold valuation tribunal by amendments to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987.

Section 122 enabled the Secretary of State by making a statutory order (to be made by statutory instrument) to require Rent Officers to carry out specified functions in connection with housing benefit and rent allowance subsidy.   It enabled a prospective landlord to apply to the Rent Officer for a determination for the purposes of any application for housing benefit made by a tenant of a dwelling that the landlord proposes to let.

A local authority or a housing action trust were given the right to elect to operate an introductory tenancy regime.   Introductory tenancies (and licences to occupy) were to be granted to tenants for a trial period.  There were provisions for succession to introductory tenancies after the death of the tenant to the tenant’s spouse or a member of his family who had resided with the tenant in the previous twelve months.

Chapter III gave power to the High Court or a county court on application by a local authority to grant injunctions against anti-social behaviour and gave the power of arrest for breach of injunctions. Some of the provisions of this act came into force on Royal Assent, some two months later and some on a day in the future to be appointed by order of the Secretary of State.   Some provisions additionally applied to the Isles of Scilly, Northern Island and Scotland but not all.

The [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]] made provision for renovation grants and other assistance for housing purposes for the improvement or repair of dwellings,  houses in multiple occupation or the common parts of buildings containing one or more flats. It incorporated disabled facilities grants for the provision of facilities for a disabled person. Buildings had to be more than ten years old.

There were to be grants and other assistance for regeneration and development and in connection with clearance areas, home energy efficiency schemes.    Grants were to be made available to home owners where the occupiers were entitled to social benefits and home repair assistance for mobile home or houseboat owners.   Rent Officers continued to give advice to local authorities as they had done previously in the administration of house renovation grants.   This statutory function ceased in 2000.

==Maximum Fair Rent Order==
The [[Rents Act (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999]] was introduced in Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 6 and came into force on 1 February 1999. The Rent Officer continued to determine a fair rent as previously but was then required to calculate by a formula the maximum rent payable if this was lower than the fair rent.  The formula required a comparison between the retail price index at the date of the previous registration and the retail price index for the month immediately preceding the new determination of a fair rent.   There was an addition of 0.075 for the first registration after this new order came into force and 0.05 for every subsequent registration. Variable service charges were not included in the calculation of the formula.

The Maximum Fair Rent did not apply where there had been a change in the condition of the dwelling house of the common parts as a result of repairs or improvements carried out by the landlord if the new rent determined as a result of these repairs or improvements exceeded the previous registered rent by at least 15%.  The Maximum Fair Rent was to be recalculated if the rent registered by the Rent Officer upon an application made on or after 1 February 1999, was referred to a Rent Assessment Committee. Retail Prices Index used by Rent Officers and Rent Assessment committees is the monthly United Kingdom Index of Retail Prices (for all items), which is available from the Office for National Statistics or online.

The Rent Officer Service through the Institute of Rent Officers had been consulted in the past about legislative changes and procedures.  Suggestions were made through annual reports most of which were eventually incorporated into legislation.   One such recommendation was the creation of a nation service either as an executive agency or as a Non Departmental Public Body (NDPB).

The Rent Officer Service was established as The Rent Service as an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on 1 October 1999. Significant opportunities for service improvements were able to be made in line with the government’s modernising objectives.   The Rent Service  became a single, national service with local delivery, building on existing experience to secure better performance and improved customer service.   The new organisation focused on faster processing of cases  and consistency in valuation practice and decision making.  New information technology systems were  introduced and greater openness and accountability was promoted whilst maintaining impartiality in valuations.

As no new protected tenancies had been created after 15 January 1989 after the Housing Act 1988 fewer applications for fair rents were received in most areas of the country except in central London. There had however been a substantial increase in housing benefit valuations, and on 1 April 2004 The Rent Service was transferred to the Department for Work and Pensions DWP), which was the government department responsible for housing benefit legislation.

A major change to the valuation process for housing benefit was the [[Local Housing Allowance]] (LHA) a flat rate allowance paid to housing benefit claimants, which was introduced on 7 April 2008 as part of the welfare reform programme.  It applies to private sector tenants who make a new claim for housing benefit or those claiming housing benefit who change address.  It will also apply to tenants claiming housing benefit who move from the social sector into private sector accommodation.  LHA is a standard allowance based on the number of bedrooms: shared room (room in a shared property); one bedroom, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, four bedrooms and five bedrooms, in an area known as a Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA). It is the median rent of private sector lettings for that size of accommodation in the BRMA.

The BRMA is a geographical area where a person could reasonably be expected to live, taking into account access to facilities and services for the purpose of health, education, recreation, personal banking and shopping.  The distance of travel to and from those facilities by public and private transport is taken into account and local authorities are consulted when BRMA are reviewed. BRMA boundaries do not have to match the boundaries of a local authority and often fall across more than one local authority area.

The key to the success of this LHA is the regular review of the BRMA across England by the Rent Officer and the extensive development of lettings information now held by The Rent Service. BRMA decisions and LHA levels are published monthly on a new web portal. The published data includes full details and rationales for the BRMA and the list of rents gathered for each property size in that BRMA. On 1 April 2009 the residual function of The Rent Service were transferred to become a part of the [[Valuation Office Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Diol1/DoItOnline/DG_196239 Maps and information of BRMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to the local housing allowance were announced in the June 2010 budget.  The first changes are planned to come into effect between April 2011 and October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwp.gov.uk DWP website]&lt;/ref&gt; The VOA Rent Officers now provide the BRMA and lettings data on a new facility for London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london.gov.uk/rents/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case law regarding rent control ==

In 1999, the House of Lords found in ''[[Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd]]'' that a protected tenancy could be passed on to a gay cohabiting partner (before the availability of either civil partnerships or same-sex marriage) as the couple could be considered a "family" under the [[Rent Act 1977]].

[[File:EURO 68 wooden window profile with insulated glazing 02.JPG|thumb|EURO 68 wooden window profile with insulated glazing]]
'''Insulating glass''' ('''IG'''), more commonly known as '''double glazing''' (or '''double-pane''', and increasingly triple glazing/pane), consists of two or three [[glass]] [[Paned window|window panes]] separated by a vacuum or gas filled space to reduce [[heat transfer]] across a part of the [[building envelope]].

Insulating glass units (IGUs) are manufactured with glass in range of thickness from 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm (1/8" to 3/8") or more in special applications. Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction. Most units are produced with the same thickness of glass used on both panes{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but special applications such as [[acoustic attenuation]] or&amp;nbsp;security may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.

[[File:Double Glazed Fixed Window Diagram.png|thumb|A [[Cross section (geometry)|sectioned]] diagram of a fixed insulating glass unit (IGU), indicating the numbering convention used in this article. Surface #1 is facing outside, Surface #2 is the inside surface of the exterior pane, Surface #3 is the outside surface of the interior pane, and Surface #4  is the inside surface of interior pane. The window [[Window#Frame and sash construction|frame]] is labelled #5, a [[Insulated glazing#Spacer|spacer]] is indicated as #6, seals are shown in red (#7), the internal [[molding (decorative)|reveal]] is on the right hand side (#8) and the exterior [[Window#Technical terms|windowsill]] on the left (#9)]]

==Double-hung and storm windows==
[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glass windows with uPVC frames]]
Insulating glass is an evolution from older technologies known as [[double-hung window]]s and [[storm window]]s. Traditional double-hung windows used a single pane of glass to separate the interior and exterior spaces.
* In the summer, a [[window screen]] would be installed on the exterior over the double-hung window to keep out animals and insects.
* In the winter, the screen was removed and replaced with a [[storm window]], which created a two-layer separation between the interior and exterior spaces, increasing window insulation in cold winter months. To permit ventilation the storm window may be hung from removable hinge loops and swung open using folding metal arms. No screening was usually possible with open storm windows, though in the winter, insects typically are not active.
Traditional storm windows and screens are relatively time consuming and labor-intensive, requiring removal and storage of the storm windows in the spring, and reinstallation in the fall and storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm window frame and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold the window in place while securing retaining clips around the edges.
However, current reproductions of these old-style storm windows can be made with detachable glass in the bottom pane that can be replaced with a detachable screen when desired. This eliminates the need for changing the entire storm window according to the seasons.

Insulated glazing forms a very compact multi-layer sandwich of air and glass, which eliminates the need for storm windows. Screens may also be left installed year-round with insulated glazing, and can be installed in a manner that permits installation and removal from inside the building, eliminating the requirement to climb up the exterior of the house hto service the windows. It is possible to retrofit insulated glazing into traditional double-hung frames, though this would require significant modification to the wood framed due to the increased thickness of the IG assembly.

Modern window units with IG typically completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between the upper and lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside the wall next to the windows, allowing for more insulation around the window and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection against the sun and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.

==Spacer==
[[File:Spacers 1.jpg|thumb|Spacer: 9.5/13.5/19.5 mm]]
The glass panes are separated by a "spacer". A spacer, also known as a [[warm edge]],  is the piece that separates the two panes of glass in an insulating glass system, and seals the gas space between them. Historically, spacers were made primarily of metal and fiber, which manufacturers thought provided more durability.

However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless the metal is thermally improved), undermining the ability of the '''insulated glass unit (IGU)''' to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming at the bottom of the sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces [[condensation]] on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall [[Thermal transmittance|U-value]].
* A spacer that reduces heat flow in glazing configurations may also have characteristics for sound dampening where external noise is an issue.
* Typically, spacers are filled with or contain [[desiccant]] to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering the dew point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.
* New technology has emerged to combat the heat loss from traditional spacer bars, including improvements to the structural performance and long-term-durability of improved metal (aluminum with a thermal barrier) and foam spacers.

== Construction ==
IGUs are often manufactured on a made to order basis on factory production lines, but standard units are also available. The width and height dimensions, the thickness of the glass panes and the type of glass for each pane as well as the overall thickness of the unit must be supplied to the manufacturer. On the assembly line, spacers of specific thicknesses are cut and assembled into the required overall width and height dimensions and filled with desiccant. On a parallel line, glass panes are cut to size and washed to be optically clear.

[[File:Passivhaus Fenster Beispiele (blank).svg|thumb|265px|Examples of modern plastic and wooden window profiles with insulated glazing]]

An adhesive sealant ([[polyisobutylene]]) is applied to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either [[polysulfide]] or [[silicone sealant]] or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.

The insulating glazing unit, consisting of two glass panes bound together into a single unit with a seal between the edges of the panes, was patented in the United States by Thomas Stetson in 1865.&lt;ref name=Stetson&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number= 49167 |status = patent |title = Improvement in Window Glass |gdate = 1865-08-12 |invent1 = Stetson, Thomas D. | class = ECLA classification}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed into a commercial product in the 1930s, when several patents were filed, and a product was announced by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials: History and Conservation |editor1-first=Thomas C. |editor1-last=Jester |publisher=Getty Publications |date=2014 |isbn=9781606063255 |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kn9DBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273}} See note 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Their product was sold under the Thermopane brand name, which had been registered as a trademark in 1941. The Thermopane technology differs significantly from contemporary IGUs. The two panes of glass were welded together by a glass seal, and the two panes were separated by less than the {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} typical of modern units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Wilson |title=The Revolution in Window Performance — Part 1 |work=Green Building Advisor |date=March 22, 2012  |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/revolution-window-performance-part-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The brand name Thermopane has entered the vocabulary of the glazing industry as the [[genericized trademark]] for any IGU.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Thermal performance ==
The maximum insulating efficiency of a standard IGU is determined by the thickness of the space. Typically, most sealed units achieve maximum insulating values using a space of {{convert|16|-|19|mm|in|abbr=on}} when measured at the centre of the IGU.

IGU thickness is a compromise between maximizing insulating value and the ability of the framing system used to carry the unit. Some residential and most commercial glazing systems can accommodate the ideal thickness of a double-paned unit. Issues arise with the use of triple glazing to further reduce heat loss in an IGU. The combination of thickness and weight results in units that are too unwieldy for most residential or commercial glazing systems, particularly if these panes are contained in moving frames or sashes.

This trade-off does not apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as heat loss due to [[convection]] is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and [[Heat conduction|conduction]] through the edge seal and required supporting pillars over the face area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassfiles.com/library/article.php?id=1174&amp;search=evacuated&amp;page=1 |title=Development and quality control of vacuum glazing by N. Ng and L. So; University of Sydney |publisher=Glassfiles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="VIGLBL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Insulated Glazing (VIG)|url=https://windows.lbl.gov/vacuum-insulated-glazing-vig|website=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete [[vacuum]]. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit (powdered glass) having a reduced melting point is heated to join the components. This creates a glass seal that experiences increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may limit the maximum allowable temperature differential. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35&amp;nbsp;°C. Closely spaced pillars are required to reinforce the glazing to resist the pressure of the atmosphere. Pillar spacing and diameter limited the insulation achieved by designs available beginning in the 1990s to R = 4.7 h·°F·ft2/BTU (0.83 m2·K/W) no better than high quality double glazed insulated glass units. Recent products claim performance of  R = 14 h·°F·ft2/BTU (2.5 m2·K/W) which exceeds triple glazed insulated glass units.&lt;ref name="VIGLBL" /&gt; The required internal pillars exclude applications where an unobstructed view through the glazing unit is desired, i.e. most residential and commercial windows, and refrigerated food display cases.

Vacuum technology is also used in some non-transparent [[thermal insulation|insulation]] products called [[vacuum insulated panel]]s.

An older-established way to improve insulation performance is to replace air in the space with a lower [[thermal conductivity]] gas. Gas convective heat transfer is a function of viscosity and specific heat. [[noble gas|Monatomic gases]] such as [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are often used since (at normal temperatures) they do not carry heat in rotational [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|modes]], resulting in a lower [[heat capacity]] than poly-atomic gases. Argon has a thermal conductivity 67% that of air, krypton has about half the conductivity of argon.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/general_physics/2_3/2_3_7.html |title=Kaye and Laby. Thermal conductivities of gases |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Argon is almost 1% of the atmosphere and isolated at a moderate cost. Krypton and xenon are only trace components of the atmosphere and very expensive. All of  these "noble" gases are non-toxic, clear, odorless, chemically inert, and commercially available because of their widespread application in industry.  Some manufacturers also offer [[sulfur hexafluoride]] as an insulating gas, especially to insulate sound. It has only 2/3 the conductivity of argon, but it is stable, inexpensive and dense. However, sulfur hexafluoride is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. In Europe, {{chem|SF|6}} falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its usage for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, {{chem|SF|6}} is banned as a [[tracer gas]] and in all applications except [[high-voltage switchgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/sustainability/climate-meps-give-gas-bill-green-boost/article-145749|title=F-gas and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; restrictions|author=|date=|website=euractiv.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the more effective a fill gas is at its optimum thickness, the thinner the optimum thickness is. For example, the optimum thickness for krypton is lower than for argon, and lower for argon than for air.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Handbook, Volume 1, Fundamentals, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it is difficult to determine whether the gas in an IGU has become mixed with air at time of manufacture (or becomes mixed with air once installed), many designers prefer to use thicker gaps than would be optimum for the fill gas if it were pure. Argon is commonly used in insulated glazing as it is the most affordable. Krypton, which is considerably more expensive, is not generally used except to produce very thin double glazing units or extremely high performance triple-glazed units. Xenon has found very little application in IGUs because of cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ktu.lt/ultra/journal/pdf_51_2/51-2004-Vol.2_01-J.Butkus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat insulating properties==
The effectiveness of insulated glass can be expressed as an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]. The higher the R-value, the greater is its resistance to heat transfer.  A standard IGU consisting of clear uncoated panes of glass (or lights) with air in the cavity between the lights typically has an R-value of 0.35 K·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W.

Using US [[customary units]], a rule of thumb in standard IGU construction is that each change in the component of the IGU results in an increase of 1 R-value to the efficiency of the unit. Adding argon gas increases the efficiency to about R-3. Using low emissivity glass on surface #2 will add another R-value. Properly designed triple-glazed IGUs with low emissivity coatings on surfaces #2 and #4 and filled with argon gas in the cavities result in IG units with R-values as high as R-5. Certain vacuum insulated glass units (VIGU) or multi-chambered IG units using coated plastic films result in R-values as high as R-12.5

Additional layers of glazing provide the opportunity for improved insulation. While the standard double glazing is most widely used, triple glazing is not uncommon, and quadruple glazing is produced for very cold environments such as Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96m36VQHlE8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=Quadruple+glazing+Alaska&amp;source=bl&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q=Quadruple+glazing+Alaska&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science|first=Bonnier|last=Corporation|date=1 February 1980|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/quadruple-glazed-house-uses-geothermal-pump-to-maintain-a-constant-temperature/|title=Quadruple-Glazed House Uses Geothermal Pump to Maintain a Constant Temperature|author=|date=|website=inhabitat.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even quintuple glazing (four cavities, five panes) is available - with mid-pane insulation factors equivalent to walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenspec.buildinggreen.com/blogs/top-products-greenbuild-expo-floor-windows|title=Green Products|author=|date=|website=buildinggreen.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/superwindows-rescue|title=‘Superwindows’ To the Rescue?|author=|date=|website=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic insulating properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
In some situations the insulation is in reference to [[noise mitigation]]. In these circumstances a large air space improves the noise insulation quality or [[sound transmission class]]. Asymmetric double glazing, using different thicknesses of glass rather than the conventional symmetrical systems (equal glass thicknesses used for both lights) will improve the acoustic attenuation properties of the IGU. If standard air spaces are used, [[sulfur hexafluoride]] can be used to replace or augment an inert gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUxCGJd0owC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;lpg=PA504&amp;dq=hexafluoride+insulating+glass&amp;source=web&amp;ots=niJxrJZMBa&amp;sig=DQwDhsPWasPns4IgA4tJtyR_YXs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result |title=Sound insulation - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improve acoustical attenuation performance.

Other glazing material variations affect acoustics. The most widely used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the insulating glass can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.

Reviewing the glazing system components, including the air space material used in the insulating glass, can ensure overall sound transmission improvement.

== Longevity ==
The life of an IGU varies depending on the quality of materials used, size of gap between inner and outer pane, temperature differences, workmanship and location of installation both in terms of facing direction and geographic location, as well as the treatment the unit receives.  IG units typically last from 10 to 25 years, with windows facing the equator often lasting less than 12 years. IGUs typically carry a [[warranty]] for 10 to 20 years depending upon the manufacturer.  If IGUs are altered (such as installation of a solar control film) the warranty may be voided by the manufacturer.

The Insulating Glass Manufacturers Alliance (IGMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igmaonline.org |title=IGMA |publisher=Igmaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertook an extensive study to characterize the failures of commercial insulating glass units over a 25-year period.

For a standard construction IG unit, condensation collects between the layers of glass when the perimeter seal has failed and when the desiccant has become saturated, and can generally only be eliminated by replacing the IGU. Seal failure and subsequent replacement results in a significant factor in the overall cost of owning IGUs.

Large temperature differences between the inner and outer panes stress the spacer adhesives, which can eventually fail. Units with a small gap between the panes are more prone to failure because of the increased stress.

Atmospheric pressure changes combined with wet weather can, in rare cases, eventually lead to the gap filling with water.

The flexible sealing surfaces preventing infiltration around the window unit can also degrade or be torn or damaged. Replacement of these seals can be difficult to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip into a slot on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced.

In Canada, since the beginning of 1990, there are some companies offering servicing of failed IG units. They provide open ventilation to the atmosphere by drilling hole(s) in the glass and/or spacer. This solution often reverses the visible condensation, but cannot clean the interior surface of the glass and staining that may have occurred after long-term exposure to moisture. They may offer a warranty from 5 to 20 years. This solution lowers the insulating value of the window, but it can be a "green" solution when the window is still in good condition. If the IG unit had a gas fill (e.g. argon or krypton or a mixture) the gas is naturally dissipated and the R-value suffers.

Since 2004, there are also some companies offering the same restoration process for failed double-glazed units in the UK, and there is one company offering restoration of failed IG units in Ireland since 2010.

=== Thermal stress cracking ===
Thermal stress cracking isn't different for insulated glazing and uninsulated glazing. Temperature differences across the surface of glass panes can lead to cracking of the glass. This typically occurs where the glass is partially shaded and one section is heated in sunlight. Tinted glass increases heating and thermal stress, while annealing reduces internal stress built into the glass during manufacturing leaving more strength available to resist thermal cracking. &lt;ref&gt;Viracon Corporation, Owatonna, MN, "Tech Talk: Thermal stress cracking", 2001, http://www.viracon.com/images/pdf/TTThermalStress.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal expansion creates internal pressure, or stress, where expanding warm material is retrained by cooler material. A crack may form if the stress exceeds the material strength and the crack will propagate until the stress at the tip of the crack is below the material's strength. Typically cracks initiate and propagate from the narrow shaded cut edge where the material is weak and the stress is spread over a small glass volume compared to the open area. Glass thickness has no direct effect on thermal cracking in windows because both thermal stress and material strength are proportional to thickness. While thicker glass will have more strength remaining after supporting wind loads, that's usually only a significant factor for large glazing units on tall buildings and wind improves heat dissipation. Increased resistance to cracking with thicker glazing in common residential and commercial applications is more reliably result of using tempered glass to satisfy building safety codes requiring its use to reduce the severity of injuries when broken. Cut edge stresses have to be reduced by annealing prior to tempering and that removes stress concentrations created during glass cutting and that significantly increases the stress required to initiate a crack from the edge. The cost to process tempered glass is much greater than the cost difference between 1/8" (3 mm) glass and 3/16" (5 mm) or 1/4" (6.5 mm) material, prompting glaziers to suggest replacing cracked glazing with thicker glass. It may also avoid revealing to the customer that tempered glass should have been used initially.

== Estimating heat loss from double-glazed windows ==
Given the thermal properties of the sash, frame, and sill, and the dimensions of the glazing and thermal properties of the glass, the heat transfer rate for a given window and set of conditions can be calculated.
This can be calculated in kW (kilowatts), but more usefully for cost benefit calculations can be stated as kWh pa (kilowatt hours per annum), based on the typical conditions over a year for a given location.

The glass panels in double-glazed windows transmit heat in both directions by radiation, through the glazing by conduction and across the gap between the panes by convection, by conduction through the frame, and by infiltration around the perimeter seals and the frame's seal to the building. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. Unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains at night in the winter and using sun shades during the day in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a "Window Energy Rating" WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=Connie C.|title=energy and acoustic solutions|url=http://thermotekwindows.com.au/products/double-glazed-doors-windows/|website=THERMOTEK|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''' ('''ICESCR''') is a multilateral [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 16 December 1966 through GA. Resolution 2200A (XXI), and came in force from 3 January 1976.&lt;ref name=refworld/&gt; It commits its parties to work toward the granting of [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] (ESCR) to the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories]] and individuals, including [[labour rights]] and the [[right to health]], the [[right to education]], and the [[right to an adequate standard of living]]. As of September 2018, the Covenant has 169 parties.&lt;ref name="reservations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-3&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en|title=UN Treaty Collection: International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|last=|first=|date=3 January 1976|website=|publisher=UN|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further four countries, including the United States, have signed but not ratified the Covenant.

The ICESCR (and its [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|Optional Protocol]]) is part of the [[International Bill of Human Rights]], along with the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), including the latter's [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|first]] and [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|second]] Optional Protocols.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm |title=Fact Sheet No.2 (Rev.1), The International Bill of Human Rights |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=June 1996 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313093428/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm |archivedate = 13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Covenant is monitored by the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Committee on economic, social and cultural rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CESCR/Pages/CESCRIndex.aspx|work=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==
The ICESCR has its roots in the same process that led to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bill of human rights|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/human-rights/essays/international-bill-of-human-rights.php|work=lawteacher.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140819165643/http://www.lawteacher.net/human-rights/essays/international-bill-of-human-rights.php|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Declaration on the Essential Rights of Man" had been proposed at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|1945 San Francisco Conference]] which led to the founding of the United Nations, and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] was given the task of drafting it.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2/&gt; Early on in the process, the document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights, and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments. The former evolved into the UDHR and was adopted on 10 December 1948.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2/&gt;

Drafting continued on the convention, but there remained significant differences between UN members on the relative importance of [[negative right|negative]] civil and political versus [[positive right|positive]] economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The International Law of Human Rights|last=Sieghart |first=Paul |year=1983 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eventually caused the convention to be split into two separate covenants, "one to contain civil and political rights and the other to contain economic, social and cultural rights."&lt;ref name=unga-r543&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 543, 5 February 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible, and be opened for signature simultaneously.&lt;ref name=unga-r543/&gt; Each would also contain an article on the right of all peoples to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 545, 5 February 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The States Parties to the present Covenant, including those having responsibility for the administration of [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories]], shall promote the realization of the right of [[self-determination]], and shall respect that right, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;'''International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''', Part I, Article 1, Paragraph 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first document became the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the second the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The drafts were presented to the [[UN General Assembly]] for discussion in 1954, and adopted in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2200, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Covenant follows the structure of the UDHR and the ICCPR, with a preamble and thirty-one articles, divided into five parts.&lt;ref&gt;The following section summarises the text of the Covenant.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 1''' (Article 1) recognises the right of all peoples to [[self-determination]], including the right to "freely determine their political status",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; pursue their economic, social and cultural goals, and manage and dispose of their own resources. It recognises a [[negative right]] of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence,&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for non-self governing and trust territories (colonies) to encourage and respect their self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 2''' (Articles 2–5) establishes the principle of "progressive realisation" – see below. It also requires the rights be recognised "without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; The rights can only be limited by law, in a manner compatible with the nature of the rights, and only for the purpose of "promoting the general welfare in a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 3''' (Articles 6–15) lists the rights themselves. These include rights to
* work, under "just and favourable conditions",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; with the right to form and join trade unions (Articles 6, 7, and 8);
* [[social security]], including [[social insurance]] (Article 9);
* family life, including paid [[parental leave]] and the protection of children (Article 10);
* [[right to an adequate standard of living|an adequate standard of living]], including adequate [[right to food|food]], clothing and [[right to housing|housing]], and the "continuous improvement of living conditions" (Article 11);
* health, specifically "the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health" (Article 12);
* [[right to education|education]], including free universal primary education, generally available secondary education and equally accessible higher education. This should be directed to "the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity",&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; and enable all persons to participate effectively in society (Articles 13 and 14);
* participation in cultural life (Article 15).

Many of these rights include specific actions which must be undertaken to realise them.

'''Part 4''' (Articles 16–25) governs reporting and monitoring of the Covenant and the steps taken by the parties to implement it. It also allows the monitoring body – originally the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] – now the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – see below – to make general recommendations to the [[UN General Assembly]] on appropriate measures to realise the rights (Article 21)

'''Part 5''' (Articles 26–31) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Covenant.

==Core provisions==

===Principle of progressive realisation===
'''Article 2''' of the Covenant imposes a duty on all parties to

&lt;blockquote&gt;take steps... to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is known as the principle of "progressive realisation". It acknowledges that some of the rights (for example, the right to health) may be difficult in practice to achieve in a short period of time, and that states may be subject to resource constraints, but requires them to act as best they can within their means.

The principle differs from that of the ICCPR, which obliges parties to "respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction" the rights in that Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICCPR |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |pages=Article 2.1 |publisher=UN |accessdate=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not render the Covenant meaningless. The requirement to "take steps" imposes a continuing obligation to work towards the realisation of the rights.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 9, {{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(symbol)/CESCR+General+comment+3.En?OpenDocument |title=CESCR General Comment 3 |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=14 December 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also interprets the principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide, at the least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraph 10.&lt;/ref&gt; If resources are highly constrained, this should include the use of targeted programmes aimed at the vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraph 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards legislation as an indispensable means for realising the rights which is unlikely to be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraphs 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour rights===
{{main|Labour rights}}
'''Article&amp;nbsp;6''' of the Covenant recognises the [[right to work]], defined as the opportunity of everyone to gain their living by freely chosen or accepted work.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties are required to take "appropriate steps" to safeguard this right, including technical and vocational training and economic policies aimed at steady economic development and ultimately [[full employment]]. The right implies parties must guarantee equal access to employment and protect workers from being unfairly deprived of employment. They must prevent [[workplace discrimination|discrimination in the workplace]] and ensure access for the disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/493bee38093458c0c12571140029367c/$FILE/G0640313.pdf |format=PDF|title=CESCR General Comment 18: The Right to Work |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=6 February 2006|pages=paragraph 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that work must be freely chosen or accepted means parties must prohibit [[Unfree labour|forced]] or [[child labor]].&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 18'', paragraph 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work referred to in Article&amp;nbsp;6 must be ''[[decent work]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 18'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This is effectively defined by '''Article&amp;nbsp;7''' of the Covenant, which recognises the right of everyone to "just and favourable" working conditions. These are in turn defined as fair wages with [[equal pay for equal work]], sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their dependants; [[Occupational safety and health|safe working conditions]]; equal opportunity in the workplace; and sufficient rest and leisure, including limited [[working hours]] and regular, [[paid holidays]].

'''Article&amp;nbsp;8''' recognises the right of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the [[right to strike]]. It allows these rights to be restricted for members of the armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted in a manner consistent with their constitutions (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexico]]), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as [[firefighter]]s (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Constitution of Japan|Japan]]).&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

===Right to social security===
{{main|Social security}}
'''Article 9''' of the Covenant recognizes "the right of everyone to [[social security]], including [[social insurance]]".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires parties to provide some form of social insurance scheme to protect people against the risks of sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment or old age; to provide for survivors, orphans, and those who cannot afford health care; and to ensure that families are adequately supported. Benefits from such a scheme must be adequate, accessible to all, and provided without discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CESCR,,,47b17b5b39c,0.html|title=CESCR Draft General Comment 19: The right to social security|accessdate=13 July 2008|publisher=UN Economic and Social Council|date=4 February 2008|at=paragraphs 1 – 4|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520002906/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CESCR,,,47b17b5b39c,0.html|archivedate=20 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Covenant does not restrict the form of the scheme, and both contributory and non-contributory schemes are permissible (as are community-based and mutual schemes).&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted persistent problems with the implementation of this right, with very low levels of access.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several parties, including France and Monaco, have reservations allowing them to set residence requirements in order to qualify for social benefits. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights permits such restrictions, provided they are proportionate and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to family life===
{{main|Children's rights|Fathers' rights|Mothers' rights|Reproductive rights}}
'''Article 10''' of the Covenant recognises the family as "the natural and fundamental group unit of society", and requires parties to accord it "the widest possible protection and assistance".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties must ensure that their citizens are free to establish families and that marriages are freely contracted and not [[forced marriage|forced]].&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs16&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs16.htm#6 |title=Fact Sheet No.16 (Rev.1), The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=July 1991 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501050654/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs16.htm#6 |archivedate = 1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties must also provide [[parental leave|paid leave]] or adequate social security to mothers before and after childbirth, an obligation which overlaps with that of Article 9. Finally, parties must take "special measures" to protect children from economic or social exploitation, including setting a minimum age of employment and barring children from dangerous and harmful occupations.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 10.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to an adequate standard of living===
{{main|Right to food|Right to water|Right to housing|Right to clothing}}
'''Article 11''' recognises the [[right to an adequate standard of living|right of everyone to an adequate standard of living]]. This includes, but is not limited to, the right to adequate food, clothing, housing, and "the continuous improvement of living conditions".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 11.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It also creates an obligation on parties to work together to eliminate [[world hunger]].

The '''right to adequate food''', also referred to as the [[right to food]], is interpreted as requiring "the availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3d02758c707031d58025677f003b73b9?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 12: The right to adequate food |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=12 May 1999|pages=paragraph 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must be accessible to all, implying an obligation to provide special programmes for the vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 12'', paragraph 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This must also ensure an equitable distribution of world [[food supply|food supplies]] in relation to need, taking into account the problems of food-importing and food-exporting countries.&lt;ref&gt;''''ICESCR, Article 11, 2 (b)&lt;/ref&gt; The right to adequate food also implies a [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=4538838d11&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;advsearch=y&amp;amp;process=y&amp;amp;allwords=comment%2015&amp;amp;exactphrase=&amp;amp;atleastone=&amp;amp;without=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;monthfrom=01&amp;amp;yearfrom=2003&amp;amp;monthto=01&amp;amp;yearto=2003&amp;amp;coa=&amp;amp;language=&amp;amp;citation=|title=CESCR General Comment 15: The right to water |accessdate=13 July 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=20 January 2003|pages=paragraph 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate housing''', also referred to as the [[right to housing]], is "the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity".&lt;ref name=ohchr-gc4-p7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/469f4d91a9378221c12563ed0053547e?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 4: The right to adequate housing |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=13 December 1991|at= paragraph 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires "adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, adequate lighting and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost".&lt;ref name=ohchr-gc4-p7/&gt; Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination, and progressively work to eliminate homelessness. Forced evictions, defined as "the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection", are a prima facie violation of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/959f71e476284596802564c3005d8d50?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 7: The right to adequate housing: forced evictions |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=20 May 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate clothing''', also referred to as the [[right to clothing]], has not been authoritatively defined and has received little in the way of academic commentary or international discussion. What is considered "adequate" has only been discussed in specific contexts, such as refugees, the disabled, the elderly, or workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Stephen James, [http://law.anu.edu.au/anzsil/Conferences/2008/Stephen%20James.pdf ''"A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412083133/http://law.anu.edu.au/anzsil/Conferences/2008/Stephen%20James.pdf |date=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 12''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to "the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 12.1&lt;/ref&gt; "Health" is understood not just as a right to be healthy, but as a right to control one's own health and body (including reproduction), and be free from interference such as [[torture]] or medical experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/40d009901358b0e2c1256915005090be?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 14: The right to the highest attainable standard of health |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=11 August 2000|pages=paragraph 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; States must protect this right by ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction has access to the underlying determinants of health, such as clean water, sanitation, food, nutrition and housing, and through a comprehensive system of healthcare, which is available to everyone without discrimination, and economically accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraphs 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 12.2''' requires parties to take specific steps to improve the health of their citizens, including reducing infant mortality and improving child health, improving environmental and workplace health, preventing, controlling and treating epidemic diseases, and creating conditions to ensure equal and timely access to medical services for all. These are considered to be "illustrative, non-exhaustive examples", rather than a complete statement of parties' obligations.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to health is interpreted as requiring parties to respect women's' [[reproductive rights]], by not limiting access to [[contraception]] or "censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting" information about sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 34.&lt;/ref&gt; They must also ensure that women are protected from harmful traditional practices such as [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right to health is inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-project/humanrightscasesandmaterials/humanrightsconceptsideasandfora/humanrightsinrlationtoothertopics/humanrightsandtheenvironment/ Human Rights and the Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306185240/http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-project/humanrightscasesandmaterials/humanrightsconceptsideasandfora/humanrightsinrlationtoothertopics/humanrightsandtheenvironment/ |date=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to free education===
{{main|Right to education}}
'''Article 13''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to [[free education]] (free for the [[primary education|primary]] level and "the progressive introduction of free education" for the [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher levels]]). This is to be directed towards "the full development of the human personality and the sense of its [[dignity]]",&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1/&gt; and enable all persons to participate effectively in society. Education is seen both as a human right and as "an indispensable means of realizing other human rights", and so this is one of the longest and most important articles of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/ae1a0b126d068e868025683c003c8b3b?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 13: The right to education |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=8 December 1999|pages=paragraph 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 13.2''' lists a number of specific steps parties are required to pursue to realise the right of education. These include the provision of [[Right to education|free, universal and compulsory]] primary education, "generally available and accessible" secondary education in various forms (including technical and vocational training), and equally accessible higher education. All of these must be available to all without discrimination. Parties must also develop a school system (though it may be public, private, or mixed), encourage or provide scholarships for disadvantaged groups. Parties are required to make education free at all levels, either immediately or progressively; "[p]rimary education shall be compulsory and available free to all"; secondary education "shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of [[free education]]"; and "[h]igher education shall be made [[universal access to education|equally accessible to all]], on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education".

'''Articles 13.3 and 13.4''' require parties to respect the educational freedom of parents by allowing them to choose and establish private educational institutions for their children, also referred to as [[freedom of education]]. It also recognises the right of parents to "ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.3&lt;/ref&gt; This is interpreted as requiring public schools to respect the freedom of religion and conscience of their students, and as forbidding instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless non-discriminatory exemptions and alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interpret the Covenant as also requiring states to respect the [[academic freedom]] of staff and students, as this is vital for the educational process.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers [[corporal punishment]] in schools to be inconsistent with the Covenant's underlying principle of the dignity of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 14''' of the Covenant requires those parties which have not yet established a system of free [[compulsory education|compulsory]] primary education, to rapidly adopt a detailed plan of action for its introduction "within a reasonable number of years".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to participation in cultural life===
{{main|Right to science and culture}}
{{main|Right to development}}
{{main|Right to public participation}}
'''Article 15''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to participate in cultural life, enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, and to benefit from the protection of the moral and material rights to any scientific discovery or artistic work they have created. The latter clause is sometimes seen as requiring the protection of intellectual property, but the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interprets it as primarily protecting the [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of authors and "proclaim[ing] the intrinsically personal character of every creation of the human mind and the ensuing durable link between creators and their creations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/03902145edbbe797c125711500584ea8/$FILE/G0640060.pdf |format=PDF|title=CESCR General Comment 17: The right of everyone to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=12 January 2006|at= paragraph 12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus requires parties to respect the right of authors to be recognised as the creator of a work. The material rights are interpreted as being part of the right to an adequate standard of living, and "need not extend over the entire lifespan of an author."&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 17'', paragraph 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties must also work to promote the conservation, development and diffusion of science and culture, "respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 15.3&lt;/ref&gt; and encourage international contacts and cooperation in these fields.

==Reservations==
A number of parties have made [[reservation (law)|reservations]] and interpretative declarations to their application of the Covenant.

'''Algeria''' interprets parts of Article 13, protecting the liberty of parents to freely choose or establish suitable educational institutions, so as not to "impair its right freely to organize its educational system."&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Bangladesh''' interprets the self-determination clause in Article 1 as applying in the historical context of [[colonialism]]. It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within the context of its constitution and domestic law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Belgium''' interprets non-discrimination as to national origin as "not necessarily implying an obligation on States automatically to guarantee to foreigners the same rights as to their nationals. The term should be understood to refer to the elimination of any arbitrary behaviour but not of differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations, in conformity with the principles prevailing in democratic societies."&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''China''' restricts labour rights in Article 8 in a manner consistent with its constitution and domestic law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Egypt''' accepts the Covenant only to the extent it does not conflict with Islamic [[Sharia]] law. Sharia is "a primary source of legislation" under Article 2 of both the suspended [[s:Constitution of Egypt|1973 Constitution]] and the [[s:2011 Provisional Constitution of Egypt|2011 Provisional Constitutional Declaration]].&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''France''' views the Covenant as subservient to the [[UN Charter]]. It also reserves the right to govern the access of aliens to employment, social security, and other benefits.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''India''' interprets the right of self-determination as applying "only to the peoples under foreign domination"&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt; and not to apply to peoples within sovereign nation-states. It also interprets the limitation of rights clause and the rights of equal opportunity in the workplace within the context of its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Indonesia''' interprets the self-determination clause (Article 1) within the context of other international law and as not applying to peoples within a sovereign nation-state.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Ireland''' reserves the right to promote the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Japan''' reserved the right not to be bound to progressively introduce free secondary and higher education, the right to strike for [[civil service|public servant]] and the remuneration on public holidays.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Kuwait''' interprets the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within its constitution and laws, and reserves the right to social security to apply only to Kuwaitis. It also reserves the right to forbid strikes.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Mexico''' restricts the labour rights in Article 8 within the context of its constitution and laws.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Monaco''' interprets the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of national origin as "not necessarily implying an automatic obligation on the part of States to guarantee foreigners the same rights as their nationals",&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt; and reserves the right to set residence requirements on the rights to work, health, education, and social security.

'''New Zealand''' reserved the right not to apply Article 8 (the right to form and join trade unions) insofar as existing measures (which at the time included compulsory unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes) were incompatible with it.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Norway''' reserves the right to strike so as to allow for compulsory arbitration of some labour disputes.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Pakistan''' has a general reservation to interpret the Covenant within the framework of its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Thailand''' interprets the right to self-determination within the framework of other international law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Trinidad and Tobago''' reserves the right to restrict the right to strike of those engaged in essential occupations.

'''Turkey''' will implement the Covenant subject to the UN Charter. It also reserves the right to interpret and implement the right of parents to choose and establish educational institutions in a manner compatible with its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''United Kingdom''' views the Covenant as subservient to the UN Charter. It made several reservations regarding its overseas territories.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''United States''' – [[Amnesty International]] writes that "The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter administration but is not fully bound by it until it is ratified. For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore should not be the object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration."&lt;ref&gt;

==Optional Protocol==
The '''[[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]''' is a side-agreement to the Covenant which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing a historic gap in human rights |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D39BD9ED5406650FC125751C0039FE08?opendocument |publisher=United Nations |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Economic, social and cultural rights: legal entitlements rather than charity" say UN Human Rights Experts |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/C5486C42747EC60BC125751B005B08B3?opendocument |publisher=United Nations |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened for signature on 24 September 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=32207&amp;Cr=cultural+rights&amp;Cr1= |title=UN urges States to adhere to new instrument to protect human rights |publisher=United Nations |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of February 2013 has been signed by 40 parties and ratified by 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-3-a&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having passed the threshold of required ratifications it has entered into force on 5 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12968&amp;LangID=E DisplayNews].

==Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights==
{{main|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}

The '''Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''' is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Covenant. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/ECOSOC/resolutions/E-RES-1985-17.doc |title=ECOSOC Resolution 1985/17 |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=28 May 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other human rights monitoring bodies, the Committee was not established by the treaty it oversees. Rather, it was established by the Economic and Social Council following the failure of two previous monitoring bodies.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs16/&gt;

All states parties are required to submit regular reports to the Committee outlining the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures they have taken to implement the rights affirmed in the Covenant. The first report is due within two years of ratifying the Covenant; thereafter reports are due every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/index.htm |title=Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |accessdate=3 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations".

The Committee typically meets every May and November in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/sessions.htm |title=Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – Sessions |accessdate=3 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611184428/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/sessions.htm |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7109">'''Iqta‘''' ({{lang-ar|اقطاع}}) was an Islamic practice of [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farming]] that became common in Muslim Asia during the [[Buyid dynasty]]. The prominent Orientalist [[Claude Cahen]] described the Iqta‘ as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a form of administrative grant, often (wrongly) translated by the European word “[[fief]]”. The nature of the iḳṭāʿ varied according to time and place, and a translation borrowed from other systems of institutions and conceptions has served only too often to mislead Western historians, and following them, even those of the East.&lt;ref name="Cahen1"&gt;Claude Cahen, "Iḳṭā'," EI2, Vol. 
A mechanism had to be devised to collect the surplus from the peasantry and redistribute it among the members of the ruling class. The crucial element in this mechanism was the ''iqta'' that combined the two functions of collection and distribution without immediately endangering the unity of the political structure. The ''iqta'' was the territorial assignment and its holder was designated ''muqti''
3, p. 1088.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike European systems, the Muqtis had no right to interfere with the personal life of a paying person if the person stayed on the Muqti's land. Also, Iqtas were not hereditary by law and had to be confirmed by a higher authority (like the sultan or the king).

==Muslim tax farming before the Iqta‘==
As with other feudal-like tax farming systems, Iqta' evolved from the tribal practices. It originated from the need to secure one's self by paying taxes to the most powerful leader, but later developed into something exchangeable by the landowners like with the fiefdoms of Europe.

==The early Iqta‘==

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==The Buyids reform of Iqta‘==
The [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]] codified the already existent system of tax farming. They united the Amirs of Persia and reorganized their land into Iqtas, whose borders remained largely similar to the predecessor states. Contrary to most other forms of Iqta, it was hereditary, but the land was divided when there were more sons of age.

==Iqta‘ in the Seljuq era==
In the Seljuk Empire, the move toward the iqta' system was facilitated by the Persian bureaucrat [[Nizam al-Mulk]] "who developed and systemized the trend towards feudalism that was already inherent in the tax-farming practices of the immediately preceding period," &lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. "The Middle East".&lt;/ref&gt;
It is made clear that muqtis hold no claim on the peasants/subjects other than that of collecting from them in a proper manner the due land tax that has been assigned to them. When the revenue has been realized from them, those subjects should remain secure from any demands of the muqtis in respect of their persons, wealth, families, lands and goods. The muqtis can't hold any further claims on them. The subjects can go to the King and address their grievances in case they are being subjugated by the muqtis. It is thus clear that the muqtis only hold the land under the king, the land in truth belongs to the Sultan. Nizam al-Mulk emphasizes an important element in the iqta- muqti's right to collect and appropriate taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Iqta's: Distribution of Revenue Resources among the Ruling Class, Irfan Habib&lt;/ref&gt;
Of course, the muqtis also had certain obligations to the Sultan. They had to maintain the troops and furnish them at call. The revenues they got from the iqtas were meant to be resources for him to do the same. The revenue was meant for the muqti's own expenses, payment and maintenance of the troops and the rest had to be sent back to the king. The muqti was thus a tax collector and army paymaster rolled into one.

==Iqta‘ in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Mamluk sultanate of Delhi]]==
[[Iltutmish|Shamsa ud-din Iltutmish]] established the "Iqta‘ system" based on Mohammad Gori's ideas. It was very close to the original form of Iqta' as its main function was only to collect taxes by Muqtis/Iqtedars in India. They had no other right to the subjects apart from the taxes as long as taxes were paid. The money was used to pay for the landowner's army, which could be called by the Sultan at any time, making up for a relatively quick mobilisation and highly professional soldiers. A small part of the money was to be given to the Sultan, but the percentage was usually insignificant compared to the other expenses. Iqtas were given for exceptional military service or loyalty and were, unlike the original, usually hereditary.
The Iqta‘ system was later reorganized by [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Balban]], who divided his empire into small pieces of land and opposed making Iqta hereditary. His absolutist rule concentrated on limiting the power of the estates (mainly the nobility and merchants) and securing his supreme authority as the king. He also dissolved the Council of Forty - Chahalgani, a form of sharing power between the highest nobles and the king. His rule was supported by the strengthened espionage and counter-espionage system and his personal secret police, called ''barids''.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sailendra (2013). A Textbook of Medieval Indian History. Primus Books. pp. 76–79. {{ISBN|978-9-38060-734-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Iqta' system was revived by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]], having also made the assignments hereditary to please the nobles.

==Iqta‘ and feudalism==
Although there are similarities between the Iqta‘ system and the common fief system practiced in the west at similar periods, there are also considerable differences.

The Iqta‘ holders generally did not technically own the lands, but only assume the right to the revenue of the land, a right that the government typically reserved the right to change. Many Iqta‘ holders did not hold their Iqta' for life, and at least in most cases they were not subject to inheritance to the next generation.

Although the subjects attached to the Iqta‘ were still technically free men, in real practice the end result often end up with them functioning like serfs.

There are significant variances in the actual implementation of Iqta' systems throughout the different periods and in different area, so it is difficult to completely generalize them.

== History ==
The group was established in 1963 in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and has its roots in [[Jebsen &amp; Co]], a trading partnership formed in Hong Kong in 1895. Management positions are held today by descendants of the Jebsen &amp; Co founders, Jacob Jebsen (1870–1941, [[:de:Jacob Jebsen|de]]) and Heinrich Jessen (1865–1931).

After incorporation in 1963, Jebsen &amp; Jessen (SEA) operated in Singapore and Malaysia, and subsequently set up offices throughout South East Asia.

'''Jennifer "Jenny" Gillen Toomey''' (born in 1968) is an [[United States|American]] [[indie rock]] musician and arts activist.

== Early life and education ==
Toomey is from [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]], and later, [[Washington, D.C.]]

Toomey is a graduate of [[Georgetown University]] with a degree in [[philosophy]].

== Career ==
Toomey was a member of the bands Geek, [[Tsunami (band)|Tsunami]], Liquorice, [[Grenadine (band)|Grenadine]], So Low and Choke, among others, and has also recorded under her own name.&lt;ref name=PhilaCityPaper-Tsunami-Ladyfest-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rapa|first1=Patrick|title=The Match: Indie rock mothers of invention Tsunami are still fighting the good fight and reuniting for Ladyfest|url=http://citypaper.net:80/articles/2003-03-20/cover9.shtml|work=[[Philadelphia City Paper]]|date=20 March 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030426001930/http://citypaper.net/articles/2003-03-20/cover9.shtml|archivedate=26 April 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Toomey co-founded the [[Simple Machines]] record label with a housemate who left the project soon after. Toomey ran the label with [[Kristin Thomson]] from 1990 to 1998 out of their house in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. Along with [[TeenBeat Records]] and [[Dischord Records]], Simple Machines helped document the D.C. [[punk rock|punk]] and [[indie rock]] scenes. Tsunami was also greatly influential in the [[do it yourself|do it yourself (D.I.Y.)]] movement among the punk, grunge and indie communities. Among the artists released on Simple Machines are Tsunami, Grenadine, [[Franklin Bruno]], [[Ida (band)|Ida]], and [[Scrawl]], among others.&lt;ref name=SimpleMachines-Story&gt;{{cite web|title=Simple Machines Records: Story|url=http://www.simplemachines.net/story.html|website=[[Simple Machines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Toomey founded the [[Future of Music Coalition]], a Washington, D.C. [[think tank]] that translates the complex issues at the intersection of music, policy and law, aiming to help (primarily independent) musicians, including [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]], health insurance, and the effects of corporate consolidation of radio and the music industry. She was the founding executive director.&lt;ref name=NPR-MorningEdition-FCCTestimony-2004&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ulaby|first1=Neda|title=Jenny Toomey, Rocking the FCC|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1644659|work=[[Morning Edition]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=11 February 2004|language=en|format=Includes audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her advocacy work, Toomey participated in many conferences, including the Future of the Music Industry forum held at Georgetown University in January 2003, among others.&lt;ref name=CSPAN-MusicIndustryDigitalTech-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adelstein|first1=Jonathan S.|last2=Lightfoot|first2=David|last3=Toomey|first3=Jenny|title=Music Industry Digital Technology|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?174441-1/music-industry-digital-technology|work=[[Georgetown University]], [[Future of Music Coalition]]|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|date=6 January 2003|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[political philosophy]], the '''landscapes of power''' are the features of the built environment that perform political functions — including establishing the hegemony of a governing entity or an ideological creed in a particular territory and cultivating a sense of pride in place in residents of a territory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Sharon Zukin]] originated the term in her book ''Landscapes of Power: From Detroit to Disney World.''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004.  119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Panopticon]] is a prime example of how the organization of physical space performs some of the functions listed above — in this case, establishing the authority over a particular area. The Panopticon is a type of prison built with a circle of cells arranged around a guard tower. The occupants of these cells are visible to the guard, but the prisoners cannot see into the tower. They must consequently behave, as they would be under surveillance, or risk the possible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, Matthew G. "Space and the Structuring of Disciplinary Power: An Interpretive Review." ''Geografiska Annaler'', 79, no. 3 (1997): 171-180. JSTOR, (Nov. 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] discussed the Panopticon in his book ''[[Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison]]''

There are 4 functions of landscape of power
1. to show who owns what
2. for nation building
3. to create identity and
4. to show who is in power.
More commonplace landscapes of power might include monuments, memorials and, as Zukin argues, even cities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal Services NYC''' ('''LSNYC''') is a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that provides free [[civil law (common law)|civil]] [[legal services|legal assistance]] to low-income people in [[New York City]]. The community-based organization serves more than 100,000 clients annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalservicesnyc.org/about-us |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Legal Services NYC |access-date= 19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the nation's largest organization exclusively devoted to providing free civil services to the poor, with programs located in low-income neighborhoods throughout New York City.

==History==
In 1967, a group of federally funded [[legal services]] offices united to become Community Action for Legal Services (CALS), which later changed to Legal Services for New York City. After adopting a new logo&lt;ref name="probono.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.probono.net/images/areas/333/LS%20NYC%20logo_Photo.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image of logo|website=Probono.net\accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brand, the organization changed its name in 2007, on its 40th anniversary, to Legal Services NYC (LSNYC).&lt;ref name="probono.net"/&gt; The first landmark win for LSNYC came in 1970 with ''[[Goldberg v. Kelly]]'', where the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] laid down the [[due process]] standards for the termination of government benefits.

==Structure==
The organization's structure serves [[New York City]]'s low-income community on the local level. Some of the local units are run from the central office, while others are independent organizations with their own local board of directors. Each borough has its own program:  Manhattan Legal Services, Queens Legal Services, [[Staten Island Legal Services]], Bronx Legal Services, and Brooklyn Legal Services.  There is also a citywide Central Office and a Legal Support Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalservicesnyc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=75|title=Our Program - Legal Services NYC|first=Kate|last=Whalen|website=Legalservicesnyc.org|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The organization represents clients in [[court]]s and [[administrative proceeding]]s. It also provides advice or referral information if unable to provide representation. Assistance is provided through legal education and community workshops, help lines and written materials. The organization also provides training to [[poverty law]] attorneys and advocates through its Legal Support Unit.

==Governance==
LSNYC is governed by a board of directors; the members are appointed by Bar Associations, community groups, and other entities. The board of directors is led by the executive committee, composed of the Chair, Vice Chair, Treasurer and Secretary, and three additional non-officer members of the board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15824">'''Metabolife International, Inc.,''' was a [[multi-level marketing]] company based in [[San Diego, California]] which manufactured [[dietary supplements]]. Metabolife's best-selling product, an [[ephedra|ephedra-based]] supplement called ''Metabolife 356'', once generated hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales.&lt;ref name="sdbj"/&gt; However, Metabolife 356 and other ephedra-containing supplements were linked to thousands of [[serious adverse event]]s, including deaths, which caused the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to ban the sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements in 2004.

Subsequently, Metabolife's founder Michael Ellis was convicted of lying to the FDA and concealing evidence of ephedra's dangers, and the company and its owner were both convicted of [[income tax evasion]]. A congressional investigation found that Metabolife had received thousands of reports of serious adverse events, many occurring in young and otherwise healthy people, and that Metabolife concealed the reports and acted with "indifference to the health of consumers."&lt;ref name="house-investigation"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] | title = Adverse Event Reports from Metabolife | url = http://oversight-archive.waxman.house.gov/documents/20040827102309-56026.pdf | date = October 2002 | accessdate = 2013-03-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141223212556/http://oversight-archive.waxman.house.gov/documents/20040827102309-56026.pdf | archivedate = 2014-12-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Metabolife was founded in the early 1990s by Michael Ellis, a former [[police officer]] on [[probation]] for charges relating to his involvement with a [[methamphetamine]] lab.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news |publisher = [[Salon.com]]|last = Brownlee|first = Shannon|title = Swallowing Ephedra|url = http://www.salon.com/2000/06/07/ephedra/|date = 2000-06-07|accessdate = 2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="little-pill"&gt;{{cite news |publisher = ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]''|title = Little Pill, Big Trouble|last = Crabtree|first = Penni|url = http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/business/20030720-9999_mz1b20metabo.html|date = 2003-07-20|accessdate = 2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis and a boyhood friend, Michael Blevins, were arrested in 1989 for producing and distributing methamphetamine. Both Ellis and Blevins cooperated with federal authorities in return for lighter sentences. Following Blevins' release from prison, the two formed Metabolife to market ephedra, an herbal supplement containing compounds chemically related to methamphetamine.&lt;ref name="little-pill"/&gt; Ellis served as the company's CEO until September 2000, when he was succeeded by David Brown (Brown went on to serve as president and CEO of [[Protandim|LifeVantage]] in 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=23461893&amp;ticker=LFVN:US | title = Executive profile: David Brown | work = [[BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation and lobbying ==
In the late 1990s, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. FDA]] considered regulating ephedra more strictly, in response to reports of adverse reactions and more than 100 deaths linked to the supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfe SM |title=Medicine.

Metabolife took an active role in [[lobbying]] against regulation of ephedra, forming an advocacy group called the Dietary Supplement Safety and Science Coalition and contributing heavily to [[Congressman|Congressmen]] [[Brian Bilbray]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[California|Calif.]]) and [[Dan Burton]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Indiana|Ind.]]), among other politicians.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; Bilbray subsequently criticized the FDA's treatment of Metabolife and its efforts to regulate ephedra. During this period in the late 1990s, Metabolife contributed $1.6 million in [[soft money]] to both political parties, and almost $3 million to [[lobbyists]].&lt;ref name="little-pill"/&gt; At the state level, Metabolife contributed $10,000 to then-Governor of Texas [[George W. Bush]], who intervened to stop regulation which would have banned [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] sales of ephedra. Bush subsequently returned the $10,000 after Ellis' and Blevins' methamphetamine convictions were publicized in the media.&lt;ref name="little-pill"/&gt; Other recipients of Metabolife contributions included then-Governor of California [[Gray Davis|Joseph Graham 'Gray' Davis, Jr.]], who was given $175,000.&lt;ref name="little-pill"/&gt;

== Legal issues ==
Metabolife was investigated by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] for [[income tax evasion]]; ultimately, the company pleaded guilty to filing fraudulent tax returns and was sentenced to pay a criminal fine of $600,000.&lt;ref name="doj-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/usaopress/2005/txdv05cas51005_1.pdf |title=Metabolife and owner William Bradley Plead Guilty to Tax Charges |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |date=2005-10-05 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012223851/http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/usaopress/2005/txdv05cas51005_1.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolife owner William Bradley also pleaded guilty to evading millions of dollars in taxes and was sentenced to 6 months in [[federal prison]] and 2 years of [[probation]].&lt;ref name="doj-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.sdreader.com/php/cityshow.php?id=1476 | title = Breaking Stories: Case Closed | last = Potter | first = Matt | publisher = SanDiegoReader.com | date = 2006-10-05 | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to federal prosecutors in the case against Metabolife and its executives, the company’s certified public accountant, Michael Compton, knew about and helped conceal Metabolife’s illegal activities.&lt;ref name=Crabtree/&gt; Compton had admitted falsifying tax returns for company executives and was complicit in the company’s failure to account for $93.7 million in income on its income tax returns from 1996 through 1999.&lt;ref name=Crabtree&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Penni|title=Kickbacks also paid, affidavit alleges|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/business/20031202-9999_1b2metabolif.html|publisher=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015|date=December 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hettena&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hettena|first1=Seth|title=Metabolife: its rise and fall|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20041017&amp;slug=drugdiet17|publisher=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015|date=October 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bauder&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bauder|first1=Don|title=A Metabolife Death|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2003/nov/26/metabolife-death/|publisher=[[San Diego Reader]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015|date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vardi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vardi|first1=Nathan|title=Poison Pills|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/0419/078.html|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015|date=April 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compton had assisted the company in setting up secret offshore bank accounts and trusts in the Cayman Islands and was aware that Bradley, Ellis, and Blevins each had over $1 million in unreported cash concealed in safes within their homes.&lt;ref name=Bauder/&gt; In July 2002, criminal investigators of the Internal Revenue Service raided Compton's office, seizing documents and computer data,&lt;ref name=Bauder/&gt; and in November 2003, 10 days after a warrant against Metabolife and its principals was unsealed in U.S. District Court, Compton died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.&lt;ref name=Bauder/&gt;

Some of the politicians associated with Metabolife also encountered legal difficulties; Texas state legislators [[Jeff Wentworth]] and Rick Green were accused of illegal lobbying on behalf of the company.&lt;ref name="little-pill"/&gt;

Following the FDA's ban of ephedra, Michael Ellis was indicted on eight counts of [[making false statements]] to the FDA in an effort to obstruct regulation of ephedra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-08-15-ephedra_x.htm | title = Criminal investigation sought for diet supplement seller | publisher = ''[[USA Today]]'' | date = 2002-08-15| accessdate = 2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20050806-9999-1b6metabo.html | title = Metabolife will plead guilty, end tax probe | first = David | last = Washburn | publisher = ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' | date = 2005-08-06| accessdate = 2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis ultimately [[guilty plea|pled guilty]] to a single count of lying to the FDA about the adverse effects of Metabolife 356.

{{wikisource|Combatant Status Review Tribunal (fact sheet of October 17, 2006)}}
'''Military Police: Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees''' is the full title of a [[United States Army]] regulation usually referred to as '''AR 190-8''', that lays out how the United States Army should treat captives.&lt;ref name=DoDAr190-8-19971001&gt;
{{cite web

| publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This document is notable as the [[United States Supreme Court]] advised the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], in its ruling on ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' in 2004, that the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal|Tribunals]] the DoD convened to review the status of the [[Guantanamo captive]]s should be modeled after the Tribunals described in AR-190-8.

==The authority of AR 190-8 Tribunals==

As a signatory to the [[Geneva Conventions]], the United States is obliged to convene a "[[competent tribunal]]" to determine the status of any captive "should any doubt arise" as to their proper status.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsFirstAnalysisOfCSRT&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Geneva Convention]] states that all captives must be accorded the protections of [[POW]] status until a competent tribunal convenes, and determines the captive does not qualify for such status.&lt;ref name=DoDAr190-8-19971001/&gt;
*AR-190-8 Tribunals are authorized to confirm that a captive is a [[lawful enemy combatant|lawful combatant]], after all, who should continue to be detained as a prisoner of war until hostilities cease.
*AR-190-8 Tribunals are authorized to determine that a captive is an innocent [[civilian]], who should be immediately released.
*AR-190-8 Tribunals are authorized to confirm that a captive is a [[combatant]] who acted in a way that he or she should be stripped of POW status. According to the Geneva Conventions, only captives who have been stripped of POW status, by a competent tribunal, can face charges for [[war crimes]] they committed in situation of [[armed conflict]].

| '''AR-190-8 Tribunal''' || '''Combatant Status Review Tribunal'''
|-
| 
*Authorized to confirm that a captive is a lawful combatant.
*Authorized to determine that a captive is an innocent civilian.
*Authorized to determine that a combatant should be stripped of the protections of POW status, and can, subsequently, face war crime charges.
||
*Authorized to confirm or dispute earlier, secret determinations that captives are "[[enemy combatant]]s".
*Explicitly not authorized to determine whether captives qualify for the protections of POW status.

*Three officers, presided by a [[field grade]] officer, make the determination, on the preponderance of the evidence.
||
*Three officers, [[Tribunal President (CSRT)|whose President]] is a [[field grade]] officer, make the determination, on the preponderance of the evidence.  One of the officers must be a military lawyer.

* Another officer, who does not share in the determination, support the officers making the determination.  He or she collates the information the Tribunal bases its decision on.  It is preferred that this be a military lawyer.
||
* Two officers, who do not share in the determination, support the officers making the determination.  
**The [[Recorder (CSRT)|Recorder]] collates the information the Tribunal bases its decision on.  The Recorders were military lawyers.
**The [[Personal Representative (CSRT)|Personal Representative]] meets with the captive:
***explains the Tribunal's procedures; explained that participation was voluntary
***goes over the unclassified allegations against the captive, which they would be learning, for the first time;
***tries to get the captive to share their account of the incidents recorded in the allegations.
***determines whether the captive wanted to attend, submit a written statement, or allow the Tribunal to convene without their participation;
***if the captive doesn't attend, or is disruptive, and is removed, it is the Personal Representative's responsibility to present the captive's version of events.

==June 4, 2007 dismissal of charges against Guantanamo captives==

On June 4, 2007 Colonel [[Peter Brownback]] and Naval Captain [[Keith J. Allred]] dismissed all charges against Guantanamo captives [[Omar Khadr]] and [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]], on jurisdictional grounds.
They ruled that the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] had only authorized the [[Guantanamo military commission]]s to charge captives who were classified as "[[illegal enemy combatant]]s", and since Khadr and Hamdan's Combatant Status Review Tribunals had only made the determination 
that they were "[[enemy combatant]]s", their military commissions lacked the jurisdiction to hear the charges.

The main objective of the Law Commission, as declared in its founding legislation, is to monitor and [[Critical thinking|critically analyse]] the laws of New Zealand with a view to identifying—and proposing solutions to—their possible shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1985/0151/latest/DLM87301.html Functions]". Law Commission Act 1985—Section 5. "The principal functions of the Commission are (...) to take and keep under review in a systematic way the law of New Zealand (...) to make recommendations for the reform and development of the law of New Zealand (...) to advise on the review of any aspect of the law of New Zealand conducted by any government department or organisation (...)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission is part of the [[Commonwealth Association of Law Reform Agencies]].

The Law Commission reviews, reforms and develops New Zealand law. It then makes recommendations to Government to improve the law. It also advises its Responsible Minister and government agencies on how to make the law more accessible and easier to understand.

The Commission has a commitment to consult the public on areas of law that it reviews. It promotes discussion and consultation by publishing Issues Papers. It invites submissions from the public before it makes recommendations to the Responsible Minister. It publishes these recommendations in a report to Parliament. The Minister tables the report and the government then decides whether and how it will amend the law.

{{Over-quotation|section|date=November 2013}}
The supplementary fundamental laws of October 7, 1907 established the charter of [[human rights|rights]] and overall [[Form of government|system of governance]].

The Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 consist of ten sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution |title=Iran's 1906 Constitution |publisher=[[Foundation for Iranian Studies]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. General Dispositions
2. Rights of the Persian Nation
3. Powers of the Realm
4. Rights of Members of the Assembly
5. Rights of Persian Throne
6. Concerning the Ministers
7. Powers of the Tribunal of Justice
8. Provincial and Departmental Councils (anjumans)

The original Fundamental Law, containing 51 Articles, was promulgated on Dhu’l-Qu’da 14, A.H. 1324 (December 30, 1906) by Muzaffaru’d-Din Shah, who died just 4 days later. The following supplementary laws were ratified by his son and successor Shah Muhammad ‘Ali on Sha’ban 29, A.H. 1325 (October 7, 1907)

===General Dispositions===
Article 1 and 2 of the laws, established [[Islam]] as the official religion of Persia/Iran, and specified that all laws of the nation must be approved by a committee of Shi'a clerics. Later, these two articles were mainly ignored by the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavis]], which sometimes resulted in anger and uprising of clerics and religious masses: (See: [[Islamic revolution#Pahlavi dynasty and anti-Islamic policy|Pahlavis and non-Islamic policies]])

Articles 3-7 under the General Dispositions discuss the logistics of borders, flag specifications and Tehran as the capital of the country. They also elaborate on the property rights of foreign nationals in Iran as well as the inability to suspend the principles of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of the Persian Nation===
In the "Rights of the Persian Nation," articles 8-25 discuss an array of rights inherent to all citizens of Iran. These rights include personal and property rights as well as freedom of expression and censorship. They briefly touch on the rights of citizenship and to move freely within the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powers of the Realm===
This section of the Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 begins by stating the following:
{{cquote|The powers of the realm are all derived from the people; and the Fundamental Law regulates the employment of those powers.}}

Article 27 discussed the three categories that the power of the realm is divided into as:
{{cquote|
First, the legislative power which is specially concerned with the making or amelioration of laws. This power is derived from His Imperial Majesty, the National Consultative Assembly, and the Senate, of which three sources each has the right to introduce laws, provided that the continuance thereof be dependent on their not being at variance with the standards of the ecclesiastical law, and on its approval by the Members of the two Assemblies, and the Royal ratification. The enacting and approval of laws connected with the revenue and expenditure of the kingdom are, however, specially assigned to the National Consultative Assembly. The explanation and interpretation of the laws are, moreover, amongst the special functions of the above-mentioned assembly.

Second, the judicial power, by which is meant the determining of rights. This power belongs exclusively to the ecclesiastical tribunals in matters connected with the ecclesiastical law, and to the civil tribunals in matters connected with ordinary law.

Third, the executive power, which appertains to the King, that is to say, the laws and ordinances are carried out by the Ministers and State officials in the august name of His Imperial Majesty in such manner as the Law Defines.}}

The remaining articles entail a permanent distinction between the three powers as well as their relativity in each province, department and district.&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of Members of the Assembly===
This section includes the roles of the National Consultative Assembly and the Senate and the stipulations for membership within the two branches of government.&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of the Persian Throne===
In the Rights of the Persian Throne, the section begins with several articles outlining the duties of the Shah and the logistics of the throne. These include the process of succession to the throne, ascending to the throne and how to deal with instances issues like death.

It further discusses the duties of the Shah like the appointment and dismissal of Ministers and The granting of military rank, decoration and other honorary distinctions. The shah also commands the military and has the final say on whether or not to wage war.

This sections concludes in Article 57 by underlining the precise degree of power that the Shah obtains saying:
{{cquote|.
The Royal prerogatives and powers are only those explicitly mentioned in the present Constitutional Law.}}&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerning the Ministers===
Articles 58-70 comment on the duties and laws regarding the Ministers. This section also helps to establish the specific roles that Ministers play in the government.

Several articles talk specifically about how Ministers are appointed as well as how they are held accountable for their delinquencies.

===Powers of the Tribunal of Justice===
This section begins by stating the purpose for the Ministry of Justice with article 71:
{{cquote|
*ART. 71.
**The Supreme Ministry of Justice and the judicial tribunals are the places officially destine for the redress of public grievances, while judgement in all matters falling within the scope of the Ecclesiastical Law is vested in just mujtahids possessing the necessary qualifications.}}

Articles 72-82 continue on to discuss the instructions for dealing with public disputes and inquiries as well as the legal aspects of carrying out justice in regards to law violations. Several articles explain the rules for all proceedings of tribunals declaring that they must be public and that all decisions must be based on reason and supported by proof in accordance to the law.

In articles 83-89, the issue of appointment is addressed and explained in regards to the Public Prosecutor and the members of the judicial tribunals, corroborating with the laws set forth.&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provincial and Departmental Councils (anjumans)===
The various Provincial and Departmental Councils are discussed in this section, establishing the special regulations for the different branches.

The fundamental laws regulating these assemblies includes the election of the members of the provincial and departmental councils, the supervision over all reforms connected with the public advantage, and duties of the expenditure for the individual councils.&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerning the Finances===
The regulations and management of finances is provided in articles 94-103. These articles include laws regarding taxes, tax exemptions, the set laws regarding the approval of the budget as well as the role of the Financial Commission.

The Financial Commission's role is: {{cquote|to inspect and analyse the accounts of the Department of Finance and to liquidate the accounts of all debtors and creditors of the Treasury.}}

The section concludes with the idea that the institution and organization of the Financial Commission must be in accordance with the Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Army===
The last section of the Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 is the Army. This sections outlines all elements of recruitment of troops, the duties and rights of the military, and the promotion of military personnel. It further discusses the budget of the military which is determined by the National Consultative Assembly each year, and rights regarding military personnel.

The Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 conclude with the following statements:&lt;ref&gt;http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the Name of God, blessed and exalted is He."

"The complementary provisions of the Fundamental Code of Laws have been perused and are correct. Please God, our Royal Person will observe and regard all of them. Our sons and successors also will, please God, confirm these sacred laws and principles.

The Law only says that the laws mustn't be against Islam, but not that the laws have to be Islamic. Laws can indeed be un-Islamic and not be at variance with any specified Islamic law. The Constitutional Revolution had a role in suppressing the power that the clergy and the religion had. The Revolution gave rights to minorities such as [[Zoroastrian]]s, Christians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gozaar.org/template1.php?id=425&amp;language=english |accessdate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024144423/http://www.gozaar.org/template1.php?id=425 |archivedate=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Pinsent Masons has roots dating back to 1769. The modern day firm is the product of a series of mergers between firms including Pinsent &amp; Co, Masons, Simpson Curtis, Biddle &amp; Co, L'Estrange &amp; Brett and McGrigors. Alumni of the legacy firms include former British Chancellor [[Alistair Darling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/nobody-s-darling-1-508687|title=Nobody's Darling|website=www.scotsman.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm's recent history has been dominated by a process of internationalisation. Over the past decade it has developed a presence in key major cities around the world: [[Beijing]] (2007), [[Singapore]] (2009), [[Paris]] (2012), [[Munich]] (2012), [[Brussels]] (2015), [[Sydney]] (2015), [[Melbourne]] (2015), [[Düsseldorf]] (2016), [[Johannesburg]] (2016), [[Madrid]] (2017), [[Dublin]] (2017)and [[Perth]] (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Pinsent Masons to open first African office|url=http://www.africanlawbusiness.com/news/6591-pinsent-masons-to-open-first-african-office|publisher=African Law &amp; Business|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm's board is led by Senior Partner Richard Foley and Managing Partner John Cleland. In 2016 the firm announced the appointment of former Secretary of State for International Development [[Douglas Alexander]] as a strategic adviser,&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Former Labour MP Douglas Alexander joins Pinsent Masons as 'strategic advisor'|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/professionals/former-labour-mp-douglas-alexander-7469132|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed its first external board member in the form of former banker Pauline Egan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Blog: Revolving doors: Pinsent Masons makes board appointments as BLP and Mayer Brown make City hires|url=http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/6071-revolving-doors-pinsent-masons-makes-board-appointments-as-blp-and-mayer-brown-makes-city-hires|first=Madeleine|last=Farman|date=18 April 2016|publisher=legalbusiness.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''(4:2)''' The statute did not invalidly usurp the judicial power of the Commonwealth. &lt;small&gt; (per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey &amp; McHugh JJ; Deane &amp; Gaudron JJ dissenting; Brennan J not deciding)&lt;/small&gt;}}

'''''Polyukovich v The Commonwealth''''' [1991] HCA 32; (1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 501, commonly referred to as the '''''War Crimes Act Case''''', was a significant case decided in the [[High Court of Australia]] regarding the scope of the external affairs power in [[section 51(xxix) of the Constitution of Australia|section 51(xxix) of the Constitution]] and the judicial power of the [[The Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth]].

==Background==
The [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/wca1945121/ ''War Crimes Act 1945'' (Cth)] provided that any person who committed a war crime between 1 September 1939 and 8 May 1945 was guilty of an [[indictable offence]]. [[Ivan Polyukhovich|Ivan Timofeyevich Polyukhovich]] had been charged under the Act with war crimes, alleged to have been committed between September 1942 and May 1943 in the [[Ukraine]] while it was under German occupation in [[World War II]].

Polyukhovich's lawyers argued that the law was beyond the scope of Commonwealth legislative power in section 51(vi) (defence) and section 51(xxix) (external affairs) of the Constitution. He further argued that the attempt to make past criminal conduct an offence was an invalid attempt to usurp the judicial power of the Commonwealth, that power being vested by the Constitution in Chapter III courts, by enacting what was effectively a [[bill of attainder]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Decision==

===External affairs power===
By a majority of 6 to 1 (Brennan J dissenting) the court held that the Act was a valid exercise of the external affairs power. The six majority judges all wrote separate opinions. Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron &amp; McHugh JJ were all of the opinion that as the subject matter of the legislation was external to Australia then the law was a valid one under the external affairs power. Mason CJ also said that if the Parliament considered that Australia had an interest or concern it was not for the court to examine whether there was a relevant interest or concern.

Toohey J, however, considered that it was not sufficient that the Act dealt with matters outside Australia. In his opinion, the subject matter had to 'touch and concern' Australia, In the event, he found that there was a sufficient connection between the subject matter of the Act and Australia to allow the law under section 51(xxix).

In dissent, Brennan J suggested that there must be a nexus between Australia and the 'external affair' involved. He held that, because the subject of war crimes in World War II was not an external affair at the time, i.e., 1939 to 1945, the subsequent acquisition of citizenship or residence in Australia by an individual was not enough to transform the subject matter into an external affair.

===Judicial power===
In relation to Polyukhovich's contention that the Act purported to usurp the judicial power of the Chapter III courts, the court held by a majority of 4 to 2 (Brennan J not deciding) that the statute did not invalidly usurp the judicial power of the Commonwealth. While the majority all accepted that a bill of attainder would offend the Commonwealth [[separation of powers]], the fact that a law operated ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' did not automatically make the law a bill of attainder. In addition, an ''ex post facto'' law of the kind under consideration was not a usurpation of judicial power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5190">The '''Second Company Law Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32012L0030:EN:NOT 2012/30/EU] (sometimes also called the "Capital Directive") is a [[European Union Directive]] concerning the capital requirements of public companies that operating within the [[European Union]]. A number of its provisions have become increasingly controversial since its enactment in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31977L0091:EN:NOT 77/91/EEC]&lt;/ref&gt; as many rules for the [[Capital maintenance|maintenance and alteration of capital]] have been abandoned within EU member states, particularly regarding the use of [[minimum capital]] (currently set at €25,000), and the accounting concept of nominal share value. Nevertheless, a large number of its rules are still seen as essential for the protection of creditors, to attempt to forestall insolvency.

(2) "Member States may decide not to apply the first sentence of point (a) of Article 21(1) and Articles 34, 35, 40, 41, 42 and 43 to companies incorporated under a special law which issue both capital shares and workers' shares, the latter being issued to the company's employees as a body, who are represented at general meetings of shareholders by delegates having the right to vote."
*art 46, principle of equal treatment of shareholders
*arts 47-50, final transitional and temporal provisions

==Court of Justice decisions==
The Directives provisions on freedom of establishment had determined that minimum capital was a disproportionate means to achieve the aim of protecting creditors. These decisions have only been made in relation to national laws regarding private companies, and not yet the EU Directive itself. It is unclear to what extent it would be regarded as compatible with the TFEU.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19278">'''Sperm donation laws''' vary '''by country'''. Most countries have laws on [[sperm donation]] and place limits on  how many children a sperm donor may give rise to. Other laws include a prohibition on use of donor semen after the donor has died, or to the payment to sperm donors. Other laws may restrict use of donor sperm for [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF) treatment, which may itself be banned or restricted in some way, such as to married heterosexual couples, banning such treatment to single women or lesbian couples. 

Restrictions on sperm donations or the ability to obtain IVF treatment in some jurisdictions has given rise to women seeking such donations or treatments traveling to countries which do not impose such restrictions, in a practice called [[fertility tourism]].

==Limitations on number of donations ==
Most jurisdictions have laws that limit the number of children a sperm donor may give rise to. The main reason to limit sperm donations is the risk of accidental [[consanguinity]] or [[inbreeding]] between [[Donor conceived person|donor offspring]]. In some countries such limits are voluntary while in others they are imposed by law. 

Most jurisdictions which set limits on the number of sperm donations do so in terms of number of donor offspring, but some jurisdictions set the limits in terms of "families", to allow for the children of the recipient woman to be true genetic siblings and because consanguinity issues are caught by a country's [[incest law]]s.

Most jurisdictions set only local limits, while a number set worldwide limits. Some jurisdictions permit the export of donor sperms, which may not count in the limit on donor offspring, while the import of donor sperm may be subject to local limits.

==By country==

===Australia===
In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], there is a limit of 10 families per donor.&lt;ref name=mivf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mivf.com.au/downloads/sperm_donor_info.pdf |title=Melbourne IVF sperm donor info |publisher=Mivf.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Western Australia]], the Human Reproductive Technology Act 1991 (HRT Act) limits the number of families for each donor to 5.&lt;ref name=rtc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtc.org.au/faqs/index.html#pregnancies |title=Western Australian Reproductive Technology Council |publisher=Rtc.org.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
There is no limit to the number of children born from each donor, however he/she can only donate to a  maximum of six families. Before the law was changed in July 2007, a medical practitioner could make his or her own decision on the maximum. In the late 1990s Belgian fertility clinics (or sperm banks) imported large amounts of donor sperm from other countries and this led to Belgium becoming a '[[fertility destination]]'. However, the Belgian Parliament became concerned about this and, along with the promulgation of the Tissues Directive by the European Commission, the Government decided radically to alter the laws relating to maximum numbers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Canada===
There is no upper limit to the number of donor offspring in Canada, but sperm banks generally follow the same recommendations as in the US, i.e. a maximum of 25 offspring per population of 800,000.&lt;ref name=canada&gt;[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=52e43aa6-b15c-423f-a845-13a845143e70&amp;k=9062 Women shopping for super sperm] Sue Montgomery, CanWest News Service; Montreal Gazette. Published: Saturday, December 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]] banned compensation for sperm donors and imposed a bureaucratic system described as "cumbersome" on donors, after which time more than 90% of donor sperm used in Canada comes from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/07/the-great-lesbian-sperm-crisis|title=The Great Lesbian Sperm Crisis|first=Samantha|last=Allen|date=7 September 2015|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/the180/refugee-cessation-canadian-sperm-supply-the-case-against-national-polls-1.3242699/why-the-majority-of-sperm-donations-in-canada-are-from-the-u-s-1.3242843|title=Why the majority of sperm donations in Canada are from the U.S. - CBC Radio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], one donor may give rise to 12 children.&lt;ref name=Vejledning&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sst.dk/~/media/Tilsyn%20og%20patientsikkerhed/Private_behandlingssteder/Vejledning_sundhedspersoner_vaevcentres_forpligtelser_kunstig_befrugtning.ashx/ |title=Vejledning om kunstig befrugtning |publisher=sst.dk |date=|accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Denmark also exports semen worldwide, and where it is the limit of the importing country that is followed, or, when there is no such limit, a fixed amount considering that country's total population,&lt;ref name=Privatecustomersquestions&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7688/ |title=Questions and answers |publisher=cryos.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7688/ |archivedate=2013-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to minimise the risk of consanguinity.

Through the export it may result in that some single donors have over 100 biological children worldwide who are genetic half-siblings&lt;ref name=hverdagsetik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etik.dk/artikel/494119:Hverdagsetik--Danske-saeddonorer-kan-vaere-faedre-til-100-boern-hver/|title=Danske sæddonorer kan være fædre til 100 børn hver |publisher=etik.dk |date=|accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, donations from a single donor may give rise to six families, but there is no limit to sibling numbers.

Single women and coupled lesbians are not permitted to have treatment using donor sperm. Women in these categories therefore seek treatment abroad, particularly in Spain, Belgium and Denmark. Before the changes to local laws in Spain and Belgium which restricted the numbers of children permitted to be born from a single donor, these were the preferred fertility destinations and clinics in these countries frequently bought in sperm supplies from abroad to satisfy demand.

===Germany===
Legislation provides that a donor may not produce more than fifteen children through his donations. The legal position surrounding donations to single mothers and lesbians is still awaiting clarification by the courts. At present a donor can run the risk of paternity proceedings if his donations are used in such cases.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Israel===
In Israel, sperm donation is mandated by the [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Ministry of Health]].&lt;ref name=GeneralManagerDirective&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.il/hozer/mk20_2007.pdf|title=General Manager Directive |publisher=health.gov.il|date=2007-08-11|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 12 authorized sperm banks and hospitals across the country, and 2 more in private research facilities. Only unmarried, healthy men under the age of 30 are allowed to donate sperm, and they are financially compensated for it.&lt;ref name=MOHSpermDonations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.il/Subjects/fertility/Pages/sperm-bank.aspx |title=MOH Sperm Donations |publisher=health.gov.il |date=|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who want to donate must get to the hospital, pass an interview and blood-checks. They are also prohibited from donating sperm in more than one sperm bank. Finally, anonymity is kept indefinitely; the donor would never receive information regarding offsprings, and vice versa.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], a voluntary policy law by fertility clinics limit one donor to "fathering" a maximum of 10 children to four families.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Around 1996-97, fertility clinics in New Zealand voluntarily agreed they would only accept donations from non-anonymous donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/|title=Database could help NZ children trace sperm donors|date=28 January 2003|publisher=|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004 legislated that all donations made on or after 22 August 2005 must be non-anonymous.

===Norway===
Clinics in [[Norway]] have a maximum of eight children per donor.&lt;ref name=norway&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/omoss/avdelinger/reproduksjonsmedisinsk/Sider/bli-sedgiver.aspx |title=Rikshospitalet HF - Bli sædgiver |publisher=Oslo-universitetssykehus.no |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109070145/http://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/omoss/avdelinger/reproduksjonsmedisinsk/Sider/bli-sedgiver.aspx |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
The law provides that there must not be more than six births per donor. The same law applies to egg donations. Prior to the change in the law in 2008, clinics set their own maximums on the numbers of children produced from each donor. Spain was becoming a destination for fertility tourists, i.e. women seeking to become pregnant through the use of donor sperm and Spanish clinics were purchasing donor sperm from other countries in order to satisfy demand (see Onselling in main article). Many UK women were travelling to Spain at that time to be impregnated with sperm imported from clinics in the UK for example, where there were already controls on the numbers of children which each donor could produce.

The change in the law in Spain coincided with Europe-wide discussions on the use and export of human cells.

Sperm donation is only permitted by anonymous donation. Surrogacy is not allowed.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], a donor may give a child to a maximum of six couples. However, each pair may have a sibling in addition. Thus, the limit is 12 children per donor.&lt;ref name=gbg&gt;[http://www.sahlgrenska.se/upload/SU/omrade_oss/reproduktionsmedicin/Spermadonatorinformation.pdf Sahlgrenska Hospital's sperm donor information] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sthlm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karolinska.se/templates/Page____69511.aspx?epslanguage=SV |title=Karolinska University Hospital |publisher=Karolinska.se |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) recommends a maximum of 6 children per donor.&lt;ref name=sos&gt;[http://www.sos.se/sosfs/2005_17/2005_17.pdf SOSFS 2005:17, Ändring i föreskrifterna och allmänna råden (SOSFS 2002:13) om assisterad befruktning] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial insemination by donor was done only if the woman was married or in registered cohabitation, and required written consent of the spouse or partner.&lt;ref name=GeneticIntegrityAct&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/20060351.htm |title=''The Genetic Integrity Act (2006:351)'' |publisher=Notisum.se |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law has now changed allowing single women access to state funded fertility treatment although long waiting lists may prove prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/omrostning/votering-betankande-201516sou3-assisterad_H319SoU3p1
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]] sperm donation is only allowed for married heterosexual couples—not for unmarried couples, singles or homosexual couples. A donor may give rise to a maximum of eight children.

===UK===
The [[HFEA]] sets a limit of 10 families within the UK which can be created using the gametes of one donor.&lt;ref name=hfea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/368.html|title=HFEA information for donors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no limit to the number of children which may be born to each such family from the same donor. A donor may set a lower limit and may impose conditions on the use of his sperm.

Exports of sperm from the UK have to be notified to the HFEA. Donors must give their permission for export. Special permission is required from the HFEA for the export of embryos.

Some clinics export sperm and import vials from clinics abroad. They may also exchange vials to enable them to use samples from a wider pool of donors, but they must ensure that the donor does not produce children for more than ten families within the UK. A donor must meet certain criteria to donate as well as being between 18 and 45 years old.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], there are no regulations governing who may engage in sperm donation.&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fertilitycommunity.com/fertility/sperm-donor-basics.html |title=fertilitycommunity.com |publisher=fertilitycommunity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the [[ASRM|American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] and other expert groups (e.g., [[American Association of Tissue Banks]]) provide recommendations and guidelines.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; The ASRM guidelines limit a donor to 25 live births per population area of 850,000,&lt;ref name=asrm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asrm.org/membersonly/practice/2006gameteguide.pdf|title=404 - Document Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not enforced by law, there is no central tracking, and it has been estimated that only about 40% of births are reported. It is likely that some donors have over one hundred genetic children.&lt;ref name=dsr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/dsr_discussion |title=DSR_Discussion Yahoo group |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |date=2003-06-16 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some sperm banks impose lower limits; e.g., the Sperm Bank of California has a limit of ten families per donor,&lt;ref name=ca&gt;[http://www.thespermbankofca.org/bds.html The Sperm Bank of California information on donor sperm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525113305/http://www.thespermbankofca.org/bds.html |date=May 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rainbow Flag Sperm Bank has a limit of donor children by six different women.&lt;ref name=rainbow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gayspermbank.com |title=Rainbow Flag Health Services |publisher=Gayspermbank.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology Tax Relief''' is the generic name for the programme of tax incentives implemented in the [[UK]] to incentivise companies to invest in high-value-add [[R&amp;D]] and [[Intellectual Property|IP]] commercialisation.

==History==
The new approach began in 2000 with the launch of the R&amp;D Tax Credit for [[small and medium enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/financebill/2000/Clause68A.html "Finance Act 2000"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117024827/http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/financebill/2000/Clause68A.html |date=17 November 2012 }} Retrieved 28 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Technology Tax Relief now encompasses the following main tax reliefs:
*[[Research and Development Tax Credit|Research &amp; Development Tax Credit]] 
*[[Patent Box]]
*[[Research and Development Capital Allowances]]
*[[Research and Development Expenditure Credit]] 
*[[Creative Sector Tax Relief]]s including 
**Video Games Tax Relief,
**Animation Tax Relief, 
**High-End TV Production Tax Relief,
**and Film Tax Relief
*The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and [[UK Capital Gains Tax|capital gains tax]] relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

'''The Mitre Law''', or '''''Ley 5315''''' is a law passed in [[Argentina]] in 1907. The law overall did not enact any new principals, but its purpose was to justify and simplify the concession laws and overall regulations in Argentina with regard to the [[Rail transport|railroad industry]].  It was more of a gesture to foreign investors that had initially invested in building the Argentinian railroad system in the 19th century.  The rail industry was very profitable for foreign investors in the 20th century, and the Mitre Law ensured that similar regulations would be continued and thus Argentina hoped for increased investment into their [[Developing country|developing economy]]. it had the effect of an increase in foreign investments in railroads notably from British companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regalsky|first=Andres M.|date=October 1989|title=Foreign Capital, Local Interests and Railway Development in Argentina: French Investments in Railways, 1900–1914*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-latin-american-studies/article/foreign-capital-local-interests-and-railway-development-in-argentina-french-investments-in-railways-19001914/715693B4029CE6C2AB084E97423F171B|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=21|issue=3|pages=425–452|doi=10.1017/S0022216X00018502|issn=1469-767X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Argentina lacked the iron and coal resources that were essential to an expanding economy during the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], the [[Government of Argentina|Argentinian government]] had to offer generous deals with foreign investors because of the lack of such resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Julian S.|date=1937|title=British Railways in Argentina|jstor=2143973|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=52|issue=4|pages=559–582|doi=10.2307/2143973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24BqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=mitre+law+argentina&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-E_Ws07eI8&amp;sig=tCoeyWAG_ljgosg1pBbiP-SWJG8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnwebAqr_WAhVmF2MKHR0tBzEQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=mitre%20law%20argentina&amp;f=false|title=British Railways in Argentina 1857-1914: A Case Study of Foreign Investment|last=Lewis|first=Colin M.|date=2015-11-19|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781474241670|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law permitted all railway companies, and not just foreign owned ones, to import most of their [[raw material]]s tax-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=uMMc1sHOYaMC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=mitre+law+1907&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0xKJ-hX_xK&amp;sig=eZ2wyBDl0p5Wni7_0Iz0W9R5dHQ&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC2v-g0KLXAhUIuhoKHSggAo8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mitre%20law%201907&amp;f=false|title=The Economic History of Latin America Since Independence|last=Bulmer-Thomas|first=Victor|date=2003-08-04|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521532747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of the Mitre Law ==

The Mitre Law follows similar practices of [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberalism in other Latin American countries]], meaning opening their economies to European countries such as Great Britain, and France, also including lower tax rates to promote business growth.  The Mitre Law included a clause that ensured that a 3% tax on net profits from the rail industry would go back to rebuilding and maintaining stations across Argentina.  Investors however did not like this tax, even though low, it would slow profitability over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''United Federal Workers of America''' ('''UFWA''') was an [[United States|American]] [[trade union|labor union]] representing federal government employees which existed from 1937 to 1946. It was the first union with this jurisdiction established by the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (a [[national trade union center|national labor federation]]). In 1946 it merged with other unions to form the influential [[United Public Workers of America]]. The union challenged the [[constitutionality]] of the [[Hatch Act of 1939]], which led to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[United Public Workers v. Mitchell]]'', 330 U.S. 75 (1947).

The union is sometimes confused with the [[United Public Workers of America]], its successor union.

==History==
In 1937, the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) formed a new union for U.S. government employees, the United Federal Workers of America (UFWA), from local unions which had disaffiliated from the [[American Federation of Labor]]-affiliated [[American Federation of Government Employees]] (AFGE).&lt;ref name="Slater126"&gt;Slater, ''Public Workers: Government Employee Unions, the Law, and the State, 1900-1962,'' 2004, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The UFWA's membership, however, remained static (as did the membership of nearly all federal government unions during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, when people were grateful for work.).&lt;ref name="Slater126" /&gt; Much of the UFWA leadership was [[Left-wing politics|leftist]]. The leadership was militant in its advocacy of the rights of its members, and most of the national and local union leadership advocated leftist ideals; associated with left-wing intellectuals, activists, and political people; and supported left-wing organizations.&lt;ref name="Arnesen1445"&gt;Arnesen, "United Federal Workers of America/United Public Workers of America," in ''Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History,'' 2006, p. 1445.&lt;/ref&gt; This led many politicians and others to believe the organization was Communist-controlled.&lt;ref name="Arnesen1445" /&gt;

The political leanings of the UWFA led to passage of two pieces of legislation intended to restrict its political activities.&lt;ref name="Arnesen1445" /&gt; In June 1938, Congress passed a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to appropriations legislation that prevented the federal government from making payments (such as salaries) to any person or organization which advocated the overthrow of the federal government (as many communist organizations at the time proposed).&lt;ref name="Goldstein244"&gt;Goldstein, ''Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1976,'' 2001, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Congress passed the [[Hatch Act of 1939]], which restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. A provision of the Hatch Act made it illegal for the federal government to employ anyone who advocated the overthrow of the federal government.&lt;ref name="Goldstein244"/&gt; The UFWA hired lawyer [[Lee Pressman]] to challenge the constitutionality of the Hatch Act.&lt;ref&gt;Gall, ''Pursuing Justice: Lee Pressman, the New Deal, and the CIO,'' 1999, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 1946, the [[State, County, and Municipal Workers of America]] (SCMWA) merged with the UFWA to form the [[United Public Workers of America]].&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform: Chicago Public Education, 1929-1970,'' 2008, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SperoBlum"&gt;Spero and Blum, ''Government As Employer,'' 1972, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewUnionUrges"&gt;"New Union Urges Wider Labor Law," ''New York Times,'' April 26, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The impetus for the merger was the relative failure of the UFWA to attract new members, and SCMWA essentially absorbed the smaller federal union.&lt;ref&gt;Spero, ''Government As Employer,'' 1948, p. 198; Fink, ''Labor Unions,'' 1977, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The union's long-standing lawsuit against the Hatch Act of 1939 finally reached the Supreme Court in 1947. In ''[[United Public Workers v. Mitchell]]'', 330 U.S. 75 (1947), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the Act. Writing for the majority, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Stanley Forman Reed]] argued that the Hatch Act did not infringe on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment guarantees of free speech and free association]] but rather on rights guaranteed by the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] (guaranteeing non-enumerated rights to the people) and [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] (guaranteeing non-enumerated rights to the states).&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, ''Constitutional Rights and Powers of the People,'' 1996, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights were not absolute, and could be subordinated to the "elemental need for order" without which all rights ceased to function.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; Additionally, the non-enumerated rights of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were subordinate to the enumerated rights granted to the federal government by the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; 

Reed upheld the Hatch Act as a legitimate exercise of the enumerated rights of the federal government.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; The decision in ''United Public Workers v. Mitchell'' relied heavily on the "doctrine of privilege," a legal doctrine that held that public employment was a privilege (not a right) and subsequently significant restrictions could be placed on public employees that could not be constitutionally tolerated in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom and O'Leary, ''Public Administration and Law,'' 1996, p. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; ''United Public Workers v. Mitchell'' proved to be the last gasp of the doctrine of privilege. 

The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the doctrine in ''[[Wieman v. Updegraff]]'', 344 U.S. 183 (1952). A broad number of high court decisions in areas such as [[nonpartisan]] speech, [[due process]], [[search and seizure]], the [[Marriage|right to marry]], the right to bear children, [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]], education, and receipt of public benefits over the next two decades continued to undermine the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Hildreth, and Miller, ''Handbook of Public Administration,''  2006, p. 672-674.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Supreme Court later reaffirmed ''Mitchell'' in 1973 in ''[[United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers|Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers]]'', 413 U.S. 548 (1973), it did so on the grounds that permitting public employees to engage in political activity was dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Menez, Vile, and Bartholomew, ''Summaries of Leading Cases on the Constitution,'' 2003, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">A '''victim study''' ( or '''victimization survey''') (or [[victimization]] study) is a survey, such as the [[British Crime Survey]], that asks a sample of people which crimes have been committed against them over a fixed period of time and whether or not they have been reported to the police. Victim studies may be carried out at a national or local level.

Victim studies are canvasses of the public which request them to report any crimes which they have experienced, whether or not they have reported them. This is one of the main ways in which the [[dark figure of crime]] is exposed particularly in cases of abuse. Such surveys usually show the level of criminal activity is at least double that which appears in the official [[crime statistics]].

[[Victimisation]] surveys are usually of two types:

*'''National survey''' - of a whole country in which people are asked to provide information on crimes which have been perpetrated against them. The British Crime Survey and the United States [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] are examples.
* '''Area or neighbourhood surveys''' - in which a specific, usually inner city, neighbourhood is targeted, and [[criminologists]] or [[sociologists]] engage in a more detailed study of the same issues. These small scale victim studies have been particularly associated with [[Left realism|Left Realist]] [[criminology]]. For example, victim studies have been carried out in Islington in London by Jock Young, revealing a fear of crime amongst local residents that shapes much of their behaviour.

There is a third type of survey: ''The International Crime Victim Survey (ICVS)'' is a programme of standardised sample surveys  to look at householders’ experience with crime, policing, crime prevention and feelings of unsafety in a large number of countries. International comparison is the main aim for this project.

A criticism of victim surveys is that there is no way of verifying information given by respondents.
