'''''A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''' ('''''BABOK&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Guide''''') is the globally recognized standard for the practice of business analysis. ''BABOK Guide'' reflects the collective knowledge of the business analysis community and presents the most widely accepted business analysis practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BABOK Guide - IIBA {{!}} International Institute of  Business Analysis|url = http://www.iiba.org/babok-guide.aspx|website = www.iiba.org|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BABOK Guide'' recognizes and reflects the fact that business analysis is continually evolving and is practised in a wide variety of forms and contexts. It defines the skills and knowledge that people who work with and employ business analysts should expect a skilled practitioner to demonstrate.

''BABOK Guide'' is a framework that describes the business analysis tasks that must be performed to deliver a solution that will provide value to the sponsoring organization. Each business analysis task contributes to this overall goal directly or indirectly. Many elements of a task may vary, including the form those tasks take, the order they are performed in, or the relative importance of the tasks.

''BABOK Guide'' describes the skills, knowledge, and competencies required to perform business analysis effectively. It does not describe the processes that people will follow to do business analysis.

According to Capability Maturity Model Integration, organizations interested in process improvement need to adopt industry standards from ''Business Analysis Body of Knowledge'' (and [[Body of knowledge|other associated references]]) to lift their project delivery from the ''ad hoc'' to the ''managed'' level.

== History ==
''BABOK Guide'' was first published by [[International Institute of Business Analysis|International Institute of Business Analysis&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt;]] (IIBA&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) as a draft document version 1.4, in October 2005, for consultation with the wider business analysis and project management community, to document and standardize generally accepted business analysis practices. The first formal release was at version 1.6 in June 2006. Version 2.0 was released 31 March 2009.  Version 3 was released in April 2015.

''BABOK Guide'' is defined and updated by the professionals who use it every day and is under active review and consultation all the time.  Prior to publication, ''BABOK Guide'' undergoes a full public review where any person can provide feedback and comment on the content.

=== Professional Certification ===
Once the body of knowledge was established, IIBA created the [[Certified Business Analysis Professional]]&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; (CBAP'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''') designation to recognise senior business analysts who could demonstrate in-depth long-term experience in these knowledge areas (5–10 years in a dedicated business analyst role).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CBAP Certification - IIBA {{!}} International Institute of  Business Analysis|url = http://www.iiba.org/Certification-Recognition/CBAP-Designation.aspx|website = www.iiba.org|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIBA also offers the [[Certification_of_Competency_in_Business_Analysis|Certification of Competency on Business Analysis]] &lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; (CCBA'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''') designation that recognises Business Analysts with 3750 hours business analysis experience, including 900 hours experience in two knowledge areas or 500 hours experience in four knowledge areas, and 21 professional development hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CCBA Designation|url = http://www.iiba.org/Certification-Recognition/CCBA-Designation.aspx|accessdate =21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both certifications above the applicant must have a minimum high school education (or equivalent), two references from a career manager, client or Certified Business Analyst Professional and sign the IIBA Code of Conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Certified Business Analysis Professional|url = http://www.iiba.org/Certification-Recognition/CBAP-Designation.aspx|work = Certification|publisher = IIBA|accessdate =21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIBA also offers the Entry Certificate in Business Analysis&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; (ECBA'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''') that does not require a reference.

== Structure and content ==
''BABOK Guide'' includes chapters on:
* Business Analysis Key Concepts: define important terms that are the foundation of the practice of business analysis.
* Knowledge Areas: represents the core content of ''BABOK Guide'' and contain the business analysis tasks that are used to perform business analysis.
* Underlying Competencies: describes the behaviours, characteristics, knowledge, and personal qualities that help business analysts be effective in their job.
* Techniques: describes 50 of the most common techniques used by business analysts.
* Perspectives: describes 5 different views of business analysis (Agile, Business Intelligence, Information Technology, Business Architecture, and Business Process Management). New to ''BABOK Guide'' version 3, Perspectives demonstrate the continued evolution of the practice of business analysis.

=== Knowledge areas ===
''BABOK Guide'' organizes business analysis tasks within 6 knowledge areas. Each task describes the typical knowledge, skills, deliverables, and techniques that the business analyst requires to be able to perform those tasks competently. The knowledge areas logically organize tasks but do not specify a sequence, process, or methodology.

The knowledge areas of ''BABOK Guide'' are:
* '''Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring:''' describes the tasks used to organize and coordinate business analysis efforts.
* '''Elicitation and Collaboration:''' describes the tasks used to prepare for and conduct elicitation activities and confirm the results.
* '''Requirements Life Cycle Management:'''  the tasks used to manage and maintain requirements and design information from inception to retirement.
* '''Strategy Analysis:''' describes the tasks used to identify the business need, address that need, and align the change strategy within the enterprise.
* '''Requirements Analysis and Design Definition:''' describes the tasks used to organize requirements, specify and model requirements and designs, validate and verify information, identify solution options, and estimate the potential value that could be realized.
* '''Solution Evaluation:''' describes the tasks used to assess the performance of and value delivered by a solution and to recommend improvements on increasing values.

The '''Act of Independence of Central America''' ({{lang-es|Acta de Independencia Centroamericana}}), also known as the '''Act of Independence of Guatemala''', is the legal document by which the Provincial Council of the Province of [[Guatemala]] proclaimed the independence of [[Central America]] from the [[Spanish Empire]] and invited the other provinces of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]{{efn|As part of the adoption of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], the [[Cádiz Cortes]] consolidated the seven historic provinces of the Captaincy General of Guatemala into only two: the Province of Guatemala (consisting of the former provinces of Guatemala, Belize, Chiapas, Honduras and El Salvador) and the Province of Nicaragua y Costa Rica. These newly combined provinces officially existed from 1812 to 1814 and from 1820 until their independence. In the Act of Independence of Central America and contemporary correspondence, Central American writers generally continued to refer to the seven historic divisions of the region as "provinces," despite the recent administrative reorganization.}} to send envoys to a congress to decide the form of the region's independence. It was enacted on 15 September 1821.&lt;ref name="documentos"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Documentos de la Union Centroamericana|website = Organization of American States – Foreign Trade Information System|url = http://www.sice.oas.org/sica/Studies/DocUnionCentroamericana.pdf|format = pdf|language=Spanish|accessdate = 12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence movements==
The events of the [[Peninsular War]]—in particular the removal of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] from the Spanish throne—inspired and facilitated [[1811 Independence Movement|a series of revolts]] in El Salvador and Nicaragua aimed at winning for Central America greater political autonomy. Though quickly suppressed, these uprisings formed part of the general political upheaval in the Spanish world that led to the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]]. Between 1810 and 1814, the Captaincy General of Guatemala elected seven representatives to the new [[Cádiz Cortes]], and formed locally elected provincial governing councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Rieu-Millan|first = Marie Laure|title = Los diputados americanos en las Cortes de Cádiz: Igualdad o independencia|location =  Madrid|publisher = Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas|year = 1990|language=Spanish|isbn = 978-84-00-07091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, shortly after his restoration to power in 1814, Ferdinand repudiated the 1812 constitution, dissolved the Cortes, and suppressed liberalism in [[peninsular Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Alfonso Bullon de Mendoza y Gomez de Valugera|title=Revolución y contrarrevolución en España y América (1808–1840)|editor=Javier Parades Alonso |work=España Siglo XIX|publisher=ACTAS|year=1991|ISBN=84-87863-03-5|pages=81–82|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provoked renewed unrest in the Spanish Americas. The brief restoration of the constitution during the [[Liberal Triennium]] beginning in 1820 allowed the Central American provinces to reestablish their elected councils, which then became focal points for constitutionalist and separatist sentiments. In 1821 the provincial council of Guatemala began to openly discuss a declaration of independence from Spain.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Promulgation of the Act==

In September the discussion turned toward an outright declaration of independence from Spain, and a document announcing the act was drawn up and debated. The 15 September council meeting at which independence was finally declared was chaired by [[Gabino Gaínza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gabino De Gaínza y Fernández- Medrano |author=Rodolfo Pérez Pimentel |website=Diccionario Biografico Ecuador |language=Spanish |url=http://www.diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo2/g1.htm |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184701/http://www.diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo2/g1.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the text of the Act itself was written by [[Hondurans|Honduran]] intellectual and politician [[José Cecilio del Valle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosa|first=Ramón|title=Biografía de Don José Cecilio del Valle|language=Spanish|url = https://archive.org/details/biografadedonj00ram|accessdate=15 October 2014|year=1882|location=Tegucigalpa|publisher=Tipografía Nacional}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signed by representatives of the various Central American provinces, including [[José Matías Delgado]], [[José Lorenzo de Romaña]] and [[José Domingo Diéguez]].&lt;ref name="documentos" /&gt; The meeting was held at the National Palace in [[Guatemala City]], the site of which is now Centennial Park.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The Province of [[San Salvador]] ([[El Salvador]]) accepted the decision of the Guatemalan Council on 21 September,&lt;ref name="El Salvador"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Independencia Nacional de El Salvador|website = elsalvador.com|language=Spanish|url = http://www.elsalvador.com/Especiales/2008/Septiembre/historia.asp|accessdate = 12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Act was seconded by the provincial councils of [[Comayagua]] ([[Honduras]]) on 28 September and of [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]] on 11 October. However, the other provinces were reluctant to accept the primacy of [[Guatemala]] in a new Central American state, and the form of the new polity that would succeed the Captaincy General was not at all clear.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Text of the Act==
The Act consists of an introduction, eighteen articles, and a collection of thirteen signatures.&lt;ref name="documentos" /&gt;

===Introduction===
The introduction asserts that, after consultation with the municipal councils of other cities in the Captaincy General, the provincial council of Guatemala has agreed that there is a general public desire for independence from Spain. In response to this desire, the council has gathered together in the halls of the National Palace together with other public figures to seriously weigh the matter. Hearing the calls for independence from the streets outside the Palace, the council and the individuals gathered have determined the following articles:

===Article 1===
The general will of the people of Guatemala is for independence from the Spanish government and the formation of a congress, which is hereby proclaimed to the same Guatemalan people.

===Article 2===
Messages will be dispatched to the provinces so that they may elect deputies or representatives to come to the capital, where they will constitute a congress that will determine the form of the new state's independent government and the fundamental law by which it will be governed.

===Article 3===
To facilitate the appointment of deputies to the congress, they are to be chosen by the same electoral bodies that previously appointed deputies to the [[Spanish Cortes]].

===Article 4===
Deputies to the Congress are to be allocated in proportion to the provinces' populations, with one deputy for every fifteen thousand citizens, including as citizens those residents of [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|African origin]].

===Article 5===
The provincial electoral bodies are to determine the proper number of deputies for their provinces on the basis of the latest [[census]].

===Article 6===
The deputies thus elected should gather in Guatemala City to form a congress on 1 March 1822 (the following year).

===Article 7===
Until the meeting of the congress, the existing authorities should continue to enforce the laws under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]].

===Article 8===
Until the meeting of the congress, the Lord Political Chief [[Gabino Gaínza]] will continue to lead the political and military government, together with a provisional advisory council.

===Article 9===
The advisory council will consult with the Lord Political Chief in all matters of economics and government.

===Article 10===
The [[Catholic Church]] will continue to be the state religion of Guatemala, with the personal safety and property of its ministers guaranteed.

===Article 11===
Messages will be dispatched to the leaders of religious communities to enjoin their cooperation in urging the public to preserve peace and concord during the political transition.

===Article 12===
The municipal council of Guatemala City will take active steps to ensure order and tranquility in the capital region.

===Article 13===
The Lord Political Chief will publish a manifesto announcing the decisions of the ruling council and requesting an oath of loyalty from the people to the new American government that is being established.

===Article 14===
The same oath will recognize the leaders of the new government in their respective roles and authorities.

===Article 15===
The Lord Political Chief, together with the municipal council, will solemnly mark the day upon which the people will proclaim their independence and loyalty to the new state.

===Article 16===
The municipal council has authorized the minting of a [[medal]] to commemorate 15 September 1821, on which they declared their independence.

===Article 17===
Being printed, this Act will be circulated among the various provincial councils, deputies and authorities for the harmonization of their sentiments with those of the people and this council.

===Article 18===
On a day to be chosen by the Lord Political Chief, there will be a solemn [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] of Thanksgiving to be followed by three days of celebrations.

==Aftermath and union with Mexico==
Article 2 of the Act of Independence provided for the formation of a congress to "decide the point of absolute general independence and fix, in case of agreement, the form of government and the fundamental law of governance" for the new state.&lt;ref name="documentos" /&gt; This constituent assembly was meant to meet the following March, but the opportunity never came. Instead, on 29 October 1821 the president of the provisional governing council of newly independent Mexico, [[Agustín de Iturbide]], sent a letter to Gabino Gaínza (now the president of the interim government of Central America) and the council of delegates representing the provinces of [[Chiapas]], El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica with a proposal that Central America join the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]] under the terms of the [[Plan of Iguala|Three Guarantees]] of the [[Treaty of Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="Visión PHM"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Quirarte|first = Martín|title = Visión Panorámica de la Historia de México|edition = 11th|publisher = Librería Porrúa Hnos.|location = Mexico|year = 1978|language=Spanish|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F7RVAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Atlas des chemins vicinaux''''' was produced in order to preserve the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[street network]] from possible usurpations. A law passed on 10 April 1841 led to the creation of an [[atlas]] of streets and roads in each town, to specify officially the Belgium public roads network. 

This atlas is still the only document which defines the public domain in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was founded around 1850 by [[Julius Münter]] and is the largest botanical collection in the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].&lt;ref&gt;Starke, S. &amp; Schnittler, M (2009): Die Sammlungen des Botanischen Institutes der Ernst-Moritz- Arndt-Universität Greifswald.

== History ==

A [[herbarium]] was created in the 17th century when [[Samuel Gustav Wilcke]] founded the [[Greifswald Botanic Garden and Arboretum|Botanical Gardens of Greifswald]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botanik.uni-greifswald.de/index.php?id=2129&amp;L=0 Institut für Botanik und Landschaftsökologie]&lt;/ref&gt; The Botanical museum was founded by  Julius Münter between 1845 and 1855. Münter and his assistants Hermann Zabel and Ludwig Holtz collected botanical objects from the region of [[New Western Pomerania]]. The collections were later extended to specimens from other regions.

== Holdings ==

The collection includes ''naturalia'' such as wood samples, plant compounds, and drugs as well as ''artificialia'' such as scientific models, instruments, and wall charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitaetssammlungen.de/sammlung/526 universitaetssammlungen.de]&lt;/ref&gt;  The core of the collection consists of the herbarium with roughly 300.000 specimens and the teaching collection with many botanical models. 

The “Herbarium Higher Plants” (GFV) documents many endangered or extinct species and serves as the central herbarium of the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. The holdings include 250.000 specimens of ferns and spermatophytes, 30.000 algae, 17.000 moss, and 8.000 lichens.&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Litterski: Sammlungen des Botanischen Institutsin: Kulturbesitz und Sammlungen der Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald. Hrsg. von Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald, Rostock 1995, S. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching collection contains flower models of the model makers [[Robert Brendel]] and [[Paul Osterloh]], as well as the "Arnoldsche Obst-Cabinet" (Arnold’s fruit cabinet) with 214 (originally 455) models of fruits. The porcelain models were produced between 1856 and 1899 in [[Gotha]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2345">A '''breviograph''' or '''brevigraph''' (from {{lang-la|brevis}}, short, and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''grapho'', to write) is a type of [[scribal abbreviation]] in the form of an easily written symbol, character, flourish or stroke, based on a modified letter form to take the place of a common letter combination, especially those occurring at the beginning or end of a word. Breviographs were used frequently by stenographers, law clerks and scriveners, and they were also found in early printed books and tracts.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Samuel A.

'''CRuPAC''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|uː|p|æ|k}} {{respell|KROO|pak}}) is an acronym that generally stands for: '''Conclusion''', '''Rule''', '''Proof''', '''Application''' and '''Conclusion'''. It functions as a system for organizing a closed legal brief. The CRuPAC format is a "closed" format that is frequently used in responsive legal pleadings, where the issue has already been properly framed and identified by the movant (often through use of the related [[IRAC]] methodology). Some authors have suggested dropping the "P" section of CRuPAC, which results in only four sections: '''Conclusion''', '''Rule''', '''Application''' and '''Conclusion'''

==The Sections of a CRuPAC==
===Conclusion===

The CRuPAC starts by stating the conclusion that the author wishes the reader (or judge) to reach.

===Rules===

The rules section of a CRuPAC follows the conclusion. The rule section of a CRuPAC is the statement of the rules that govern the particular question. Rules may include [[statutes]], [[constitutions]], the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Rules of Civil Procedure]], the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure|Rules of Criminal Procedure]], the [[Federal Rules of Evidence|Rules of Evidence]], etc. The pertinent rule may also be included in [[Restatements of the Law]], or the [[common law]] as derived from court case [[precedent]]. Which rules are applicable depends entirely on the question being addressed.

===Proof===

The "P" in CRuPAC stands for "proof", although many attorneys sometimes refer to this as the "[[precedent]]" section. In the proof section, the author uses case law to prove how the rule operates and to give examples of how the rule is used.

===Application===

The application section of a CRuPAC applies the rules developed in the rules section to the specific facts of the issue at hand. It is generally improper to introduce new rules in the Application section. If the rules developed in the rules section include [[common law]] decisions, then the most efficient way of applying those rules to the facts is by the method compare and contrast, in which the facts of the cases cited as [[precedent]] are compared to the facts in the current litigation.

===Conclusion===

The (second) conclusion section of a CRuPAC restates the introductory conclusion. It is important that the (second) conclusion not merely copy the introduction verbatim; but rather, that the second conclusion restate the introduction in a compelling manner. It is never proper to introduce new argument or rules in the conclusion. By using two conclusion sections, the CRUPAC applies the maxim: "Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, then tell 'em what you told 'em."

{{Redirect|CMMI|the US government organization|Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation}}
'''Capability Maturity Model Integration''' ('''CMMI''') is a process level improvement training and appraisal program. Administered by the '''CMMI Institute''', a [[subsidiary]] of [[ISACA]], it was developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU). It is required by many [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) and U.S. Government contracts, especially in [[software development]]. CMU claims CMMI can be used to guide process improvement across a project,  division, or an entire organization. CMMI defines the following maturity levels for processes: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing. Version 2.0 was published in 2018 (Version 1.3 was published in 2010, and is the reference model for the remaining information in this wiki article). CMMI is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by CMU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:4i4pt6.2.7|title=Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)|website=tmsearch.uspto.gov|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:Characteristics of Capability Maturity Model.svg|thumb|500px|Characteristics of the maturity levels.&lt;ref name=Go08&gt;Sally Godfrey (2008) [software.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/What%20is%20CMMI.ppt What is CMMI ?]. NASA presentation. Accessed 8 dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Originally CMMI addresses three areas of interest:

#Product and service development — CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV),
#Service establishment, management, — CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC), and
#Product and service acquisition — CMMI for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ).

In version 2.0 these three areas (that previously had a separate model each) were merged into a single model (see below for details).

CMMI was developed by a group from industry, government, and the [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI) at CMU. CMMI models provide guidance for developing or improving processes that meet the business goals of an organization. A CMMI model may also be used as a framework for appraising the process maturity of the organization.&lt;ref name="Go08" /&gt;  By January 2013, the entire CMMI product suite was transferred from the SEI to the CMMI Institute, a newly created organization at Carnegie Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/&lt;/ref&gt;

CMMI originated in software engineering but has been highly generalized over the years to embrace other areas of interest, such as the development of hardware products, the delivery of all kinds of services, and the acquisition of products and services. The word "software" does not appear in definitions of CMMI. This generalization of improvement concepts makes CMMI extremely abstract. It is not as specific to software engineering as its predecessor, the Software CMM (CMM, see below).

It is important to realize that CMMI is a model and not a standard. In other words, for each area of practice it specifies a general intent and different levels of maturity in abstract terms; it does not provide a prescription how to achieve those levels. It does provide detailed abstract information and examples which serve as guidelines to understanding and implementations, but the particular way of implementing is up to the organization.

==History==
CMMI was developed by the CMMI project, which aimed to improve the usability of maturity models by integrating many different models into one framework. The project consisted of members of industry, government and the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI). The main sponsors included the Office of the Secretary of Defense ([[Office of the Secretary of Defense|OSD]]) and the [[National Defense Industrial Association]].

CMMI is the successor of the [[capability maturity model]] (CMM) or Software CMM. The CMM was developed from 1987 until 1997. In 2002, version 1.1 was released, version 1.2 followed in August 2006, and version 1.3 in November 2010. Some major changes in CMMI V1.3 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/2011/cmmi-v1-3-summing-up/ Major changes in CMMI Version 1.3]&lt;/ref&gt; are the support of [[agile software development]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/2010/cmmi-v1-3-agile/ CMMI V1.3: Agile]&lt;/ref&gt; improvements to high maturity practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/2010/cmmi-v1-3-released-high-maturity-clarified/ CMMI V1.3, High Maturity Practices Clarified]&lt;/ref&gt; and alignment of the representation (staged and continuous).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/2010/cmmi-v1-3-deploying-the-cmmi/ Deploying the CMMI V1.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI, 2008), CMMI helps "integrate traditionally separate organizational functions, set process improvement goals and priorities, provide guidance for quality processes, and provide a point of reference for appraising current processes."&lt;ref name=SEI08&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/ CMMI Overview]. Software Engineering Institute. Accessed 16 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the CMMI Institute was acquired by [[ISACA]].

In March 2018 CMMI 2.0 was introduced, not free for the first time in CMMI history: the cheapest option was 1-week access to the online version at US$150.00.

==CMMI topics==

===Representation===
In version 1.3 CMMI existed in two representations: continuous and staged.&lt;ref name=Go08/&gt; The continuous representation is designed to allow the user to focus on the specific processes that are considered important for the organization's immediate business objectives, or those to which the organization assigns a high degree of risks. The staged representation is designed to provide a standard sequence of improvements, and can serve as a basis for comparing the maturity of different projects and organizations. The staged representation also provides for an easy migration from the SW-CMM to CMMI.&lt;ref name=Go08 /&gt;

In version 2.0 the above representation separation was cancelled and there is now only one cohesive model.

=== Model framework (v2.0) ===
The model is divided into 4 categories, 9 capabilities and 20 process areas (with initialisms in parenthesis, and highest maturity levels attainable in square brackets):

* Doing
** Ensuring Quality (ENQ)
*** Requirement Development &amp; Management (RDM) [3]
*** Process Quality Assurance (PQA) [3]
*** Validation &amp; Verification (VV) [3]
*** Peer Reviews (PR) [3]

===Model framework (v1.3)===
&lt;!-- (NB: this section moved from CMM, where it was irrelevant. It requires checking for relevance here in CMMI.) --&gt;
{{details|Process area (CMMI)}}

Depending on the areas of interest (acquisition, services, development) used, the process areas it contains will vary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/tools/cmmi-v1-3-process-areas/ Overview of the CMMI Version 1.3 Process Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Process area (CMMI)|Process areas]] are the areas that will be covered by the organization's processes. The table below lists the seventeen CMMI core process areas that are present for all CMMI areas of interest in version 1.3.

===Models (v1.3)===
CMMI best practices are published in documents called models, each of which addresses a different area of interest.  Version 1.3 provides models for three areas of interest: development, acquisition, and services.
* CMMI for Development ([http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/10tr033.cfm CMMI-DEV]), v1.3 was released in November 2010. It addresses product and service development processes.
* CMMI for Acquisition ([http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/10tr032.cfm CMMI-ACQ]), v1.3 was released in November 2010. It addresses supply chain management, acquisition, and outsourcing processes in government and industry.
* CMMI for Services ([http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/10tr034.cfm CMMI-SVC]), v1.3 was released in November 2010. It addresses guidance for delivering services within an organization and to external customers.

=== Model (v2.0) ===
In version 2.0 DEV, ACQ and SVC were merged into a single model where each process area potentially has a specific reference to one or more of these three aspects. Trying to keep up with the industry the model also has explicit reference to agile aspects in some process areas.

===Appraisal===
An organization cannot be certified in CMMI; instead, an organization is ''appraised''. Depending on the type of appraisal, the organization can be awarded a maturity level rating (1-5) or a capability level achievement profile.

Many organizations find value in measuring their progress by conducting an appraisal. Appraisals are typically conducted for one or more of the following reasons:
# To determine how well the organization’s processes compare to CMMI best practices, and to identify areas where improvement can be made
# To inform external customers and suppliers of how well the organization’s processes compare to CMMI best practices
# To meet the contractual requirements of one or more customers

Appraisals of organizations using a CMMI model&lt;ref&gt;For the latest published CMMI appraisal results see the [http://sas.sei.cmu.edu/pars/ SEI Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206030049/http://sas.sei.cmu.edu/pars/ |date=6 February 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; must conform to the requirements defined in the Appraisal Requirements for CMMI (ARC) document. There are three classes of appraisals, A, B and C, which focus on identifying improvement opportunities and comparing the organization’s processes to CMMI best practices. Of these, class A appraisal is the most formal and is the only one that can result in a level rating. Appraisal teams use a CMMI model and ARC-conformant appraisal method to guide their evaluation of the organization and their reporting of conclusions. The appraisal results can then be used (e.g., by a process group) to plan improvements for the organization.

The [[Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement]] (SCAMPI) is an appraisal method that meets all of the ARC requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |year=2006
 |work=CMU/SEI-2006-HB-002
 |publisher=Software Engineering Institute
 |title=Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPISM) A, Version 1.2: Method Definition Document
 |url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/06hb002.cfm
 |accessdate=23 September 2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Results of a SCAMPI appraisal may be published (if the appraised organization approves) on the CMMI Web site of the SEI: [https://sas.cmmiinstitute.com/pars/ Published SCAMPI Appraisal Results]. SCAMPI also supports the conduct of [[ISO 15504|ISO/IEC 15504]], also known as [[The SPICE project|SPICE]] (Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination), assessments etc.

This approach promotes that members of the EPG and PATs be trained in the CMMI, that an informal (SCAMPI C) appraisal be performed, and that process areas be prioritized for improvement. More modern approaches, that involve the deployment of commercially available, CMMI-compliant processes, can significantly reduce the time to achieve compliance. SEI has maintained statistics on the "time to move up" for organizations adopting the earlier Software CMM as well as CMMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Process Maturity Profile
 |url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/casestudies/profiles/cmmi.cfm
 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics indicate that, since 1987, the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 23 months, and from Level 2 to Level 3 is an additional 20 months. Since the release of the CMMI, the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 5 months, with median movement to Level 3 another 21 months.  These statistics are updated and published every six months in a maturity profile.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The Software Engineering Institute’s (SEI) team software process methodology and the use of CMMI models can be used to raise the maturity level. A new product called Accelerated Improvement Method&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sei.cmu.edu/process/high-performance.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; (AIM) combines the use of CMMI and the TSP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
To address user security concerns, two unofficial security guides are available.  ''Considering the Case for Security Content in CMMI for Services'' has one process area, Security Management.&lt;ref&gt;Eileer Forrester and Kieran Doyle.  Considering the Case for Security Content in CMMI for Services (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Security by Design with CMMI for Development, Version 1.3'' has the following process areas:

* OPSD - Organizational Preparedness for Secure Development
* SMP - Secure Management in Projects
* SRTS - Security Requirements and Technical Solution
* SVV - Security Verification and Validation

While they do not affect maturity or capability levels, these process areas can be reported in appraisal results.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens AG Corporate Technology.  ''Security by Design with CMMI for Development, Version 1.3'', (May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The SEI published that 60 organizations measured increases of performance in the categories of cost, schedule, productivity, quality and customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=CMMI Performance Results of CMMI
 |url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/research/results/
 |accessdate=2006-09-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The median increase in performance varied between 14% (customer satisfaction) and 62% (productivity). However, the CMMI model mostly deals with ''what'' processes should be implemented, and not so much with ''how'' they can be implemented. These results do not guarantee that applying CMMI will increase performance in every organization. A small company with few resources may be less likely to benefit from CMMI; this view is supported by the [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/2005sepCMMI.pdf process maturity profile] (page 10). Of the small organizations (&lt;25 employees), 70.5% are assessed at level 2: Managed, while 52.8% of the organizations with 1,001–2,000 employees are rated at the highest level (5: Optimizing).

Turner &amp; Jain (2002) argue that although it is obvious there are large differences between CMMI and [[agile software development]], both approaches have much in common. They believe neither way is the 'right' way to develop software, but that there are phases in a project where one of the two is better suited. They suggest one should combine the different fragments of the methods into a new hybrid method. Sutherland et al. (2007) assert that a combination of [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] and CMMI brings more adaptability and predictability than either one alone. David J. Anderson (2005) gives hints on how to interpret CMMI in an agile manner.

CMMI Roadmaps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/08tn010.cfm CMMI Roadmaps]&lt;/ref&gt; which are a goal-driven approach to selecting and deploying relevant process areas from the CMMI-DEV model, can provide guidance and focus for effective CMMI adoption. There are several CMMI roadmaps for the continuous representation, each with a specific set of improvement goals. Examples are the CMMI Project Roadmap,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/2010/cmmi-v1-3-the-cmmi-project-roadmap/ CMMI Project Roadmap]&lt;/ref&gt; CMMI Product and Product Integration Roadmaps &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/2010/cmmi-v1-3-the-cmmi-product-and-product-integration-roadmaps/ CMMI Product and Product Integration Roadmaps]&lt;/ref&gt; and the CMMI Process and Measurements Roadmaps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benlinders.com/2010/cmmi-v1-3-the-cmmi-process-and-measurement-roadmaps/ CMMI Process and Measurements Roadmaps]&lt;/ref&gt; These roadmaps combine the strengths of both the staged and the continuous representations.
 
The combination of the project management technique [[earned value management]] (EVM) with CMMI has been described ([http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02tn016.cfm Solomon, 2002]). To conclude with a similar use of CMMI, Extreme Programming ([[Extreme Programming|XP]]), a software engineering method, has been evaluated with CMM/CMMI (Nawrocki et al., 2002). For example, the XP requirements management approach, which relies on oral communication, was evaluated as not compliant with CMMI.

CMMI can be appraised using two different approaches: staged and continuous. The staged approach yields appraisal results as one of five ''maturity levels.'' The continuous approach yields one of four ''capability levels.'' The differences in these approaches are felt only in the appraisal; the best practices are equivalent and result in equivalent process improvement results.

The '''''Companion to British History''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-9560983-0-6}}) is a single-volume encyclopaedic reference work "bigger than a foundation stone, longer than the Bible" (''[[Daily Telegraph]]'') written by [[Charles Arnold-Baker]] and in 1966 edited by his son Henry [[von Blumenthal]], who, as proprietor of Longcross Press, published the first and third editions. It was described as "arguably one of the most remarkable books ever written".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/3299556/oneman-triumph/&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was by [[Routledge publishing|Routledge]].

A '''comparison of network diagram software''' finds a number of tools exist to generate [[computer network]] diagrams. Broadly, there are three types of tools that help create network maps and diagrams:

* Hybrid tools
* Network Monitoring tools
* Drawing tools

Network mapping and drawing software support IT systems managers to understand the hardware and software services on a network and how they are interconnected. Network maps and diagrams are a component of [[network documentation]]. They are required artifacts to better manage IT systems' uptime, performance, security risks, plan network changes and upgrades.

== Hybrid Tools ==

These tools have capabilities in common with drawing tools and network monitoring tools. They are more specialized than general drawing tools and provide network engineers and IT systems administrators a higher level of automation and the ability to develop more detailed network topologies and diagrams. Typical capabilities include but not limited to :
* Displaying port / interface information on connections between devices on the maps
* Visualizing [[VLAN]]s / subnets
* Visualizing virtual servers and storage
* Visualizing flow of network traffic across devices and networks
* Displaying [[Wide Area Network|WAN]] and [[LAN]] maps by location
* Importing network configuration files to generate topologies automatically

== Network Monitoring Tools ==

Some network monitoring tools generate visual maps by automatically scanning the network using network discovery protocols. The maps are ideally suited for viewing network monitoring status and issues visually. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:
* Automatically scanning the network using [[SNMP]], [[Windows Management Instrumentation|WMI]], etc.
* Scanning [[Windows]] and [[Unix]] servers
* Scanning virtual hosts
* Scanning routing protocols
* Scanning connection speeds
* Performing scheduled scans
* Tracking changes to the network

== Drawing Tools ==

These tools help users to create network topology diagrams by adding icons to a canvas and using lines and connectors to draw linkages between nodes. This category of tools is similar to general drawing and paint tools. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:
* Libraries of icons for devices 
* Ability to add shapes and annotations to maps
* Ability to create free-form diagrams

== Government and legal interactions ==
In January 2005 the [[Council for Responsible Nutrition]] (CRN),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crnusa.org/about-crn|title=About CRN {{!}} Council for Responsible Nutrition|website=www.crnusa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "trade association representing dietary supplement and functional food manufacturers and ingredient suppliers," registered a complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] against ConsumerLab.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/regulatory/crn-files-ftc-complaint-against-consumerlabcom-0|title=CRN Files FTC Complaint Against ConsumerLab.com|date=2005-01-13|work=Natural Products INSIDER|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It alleged the "entire business model" of ConsumerLab.com "represents an egregious form of consumer fraud and deception."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29530">[[File:Luis Jimenez Logo13.png|thumb]]
'''''El Vacilón de la Mañana''''' is a &lt;span lang="es-419" dir="ltr"&gt;Spanish&lt;/span&gt; language weekday morning radio show. The show originates from [[WSKQ-FM]] in [[New York City]], a Spanish radio station branded as "Mega 97.9", and it is syndicated live to a number of different markets in the US such as Providence, Rhode Island; Miami and Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Hartford, Connecticut; and Puerto Rico.&lt;span lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;

The word "vacilón" is [[Untranslatability|not directly translatable into English]]; it derives from the Spanish verb ''vacilar'' (to [[wiktionary:vacillate|vacillate]]), but in colloquial Spanish can also mean to "check someone out" or to "have fun." Thus, the show's name roughly translates in English to "The Morning Tease."

==History==
During the first two weeks of January 2007, new airings of this program were discontinued, and only pre-recorded programs were aired, coinciding with [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez's]] departure from the program. He has signed a contract with the [[Univision Radio]] network, but is prevented by previous non-competitive agreements to air any new program in New York City during El Vacilón's allotted time slot until 2008. Most of the program's crew has chosen to remain contracted to La Mega.

As of mid January 2007, [[Spanish Broadcasting System]] (SBS) owned WSKQ (La Mega 97.9 FM) brought two new hosts to the show, Dominican-born Juan Carlos Alonso (who sounds just like Luis Jiménez), and Puerto Rican Frankie Jay (who also sounds like Moonshadow) which are now replacing [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] and Moonshadow. Juan Carlos Alonso was relocated from another SBS station in Orlando, Florida and Frankie Jay was relocated from another SBS station in Puerto Rico. Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay voice resemblance to the former hosts have sparked a number of accusations of trying to imitate the former Vacilón hosts [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] and Moonshadow (the main reason SBS brought them to NY).

During 2007 [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] and SBS were involved in a legal fight because SBS claims [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] was cashing in on the name of the morning show through the release of his DVD movie ''El Vacilón the Movie'' which was released on January 30, 2007. [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] filed a counter-lawsuit accusing SBS of trying to fool the audience by having Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay imitate the voices and style of [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] and Moonshadow, and also accuses his former team members of betrayal and stealing his intellectual property by using characters such as Dr. Hector Tilla and Madam Melo. In early January 2008 Spanish Broadcasting System officially won the legal fight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--spanishradio0116jan16,0,766009.story&lt;/ref&gt;

Since February 21, 2007, [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] started producing his own show ''[[The Luis Jiménez Show]]'' and it is being broadcast in several cities in the US, such as Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, among others through different Univision Radio stations. It is expected to expand into more cities during this year as Univision Radio introduces the show to new markets, but it is not expected to make it into NYC until 2008. Only two of the members of the old "Vacilón de la Mañana" have followed [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] to his new show. These are "Yun Yun" and "Sonny Flow", the latter one being "DJ Chucky" who just became part of "The Luis Jiménez Show" crew. Alma, who is Luis's producer, is also part of the new show in Univision Radio.

Moonshadow has come back to ''El Vacilón de la Mañana'' and together with Juan Carlos and Franky Jay had been able to stay ahead of the ''Luis Jiménez Show'' (3.9 to 2.0 in the ratings).  Although when ''The Luis Jiménez Show'' made it to NYC early in 2008.
Upon his departure from ''El Vacilón de la Mañana'' Luis Jiménez also took the morning show's website with him. For the entire year of 2007 the domain name "www.elvacilon.com" belonged to his producer Maria Alma and therefore SBS and WSKQ La Mega 97.9 FM were unable to use the website address for the show. A new website for ''El Vacilón'' was created [http://www.elvacilon.org www.elvacilon.org].In early 2008, after the lawsuit the domain name "elvacilon dot com" was returned to SBS and is run on the web servers of Spanish Broadcasting System(SBS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvacilon.com ''El Vacilón De La Mañana'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Miami ''Vacilón''==

An equally named program was broadcast by another SBS affiliate station in [[Miami]]: [[WXDJ|WXDJ-FM (El Zol 95.7)]], a fact that raised confusion among some listeners in both markets until March 2003. The hosts of ''El Vacilón Miami'' were Enrique Santos (a former police officer turned funny man) and "The Professor" Joe Ferrero, both of Cuban-American descent. Early producer of the show [[Alberto Sardinas]] also joined the team at the time.

The two jokesters achieved national and international notoriety when on June 18, 2003 they prank-called Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]], which brought them plenty of press. They later used the same technique to prank-call Cuba's then-President [[Fidel Castro]], the more notorious and more better known of the pranks. The team was fined by the FCC when an anonymous source filed a complaint with said government agency (as a result of the latter prank). The duo took to the streets of Miami and collected in pennies the entire amount of the fee and then some. Luckily, the radio station's legal eagles resolved the issue regarding the fine and all of the money collected was then donated to a local charity. They later used the same technique to crank call. In the history of radio broadcast this was the first time that a morning show had prank-called the leaders of two countries.

Despite of the huge success of El Vacilón Miami, hosted by Enrique and Joe, it all came to a halt on March 5, 2007 when the hosts, fed up with the string of unfulfilled promises by Spanish Broadcasting Systems (SBS) and other issues, decided to walk out on air. They trashed the company for four hours of broadcast until they were eventually pulled off the air by management. The morning show was replaced with pre-recorded bits soon after. One week later, the only one of the show's main producers, Miguel Reyes alias Mikey Machete, was let go by the company. Reyes hosted the Saturday morning "Best Of" show which he also produced and achieved the number one spot in ratings for a Saturday morning show in the Tropical market. While SBS refused to give details on Mr. Reyes’ firing, it appeared to be the result of the fall out following the early departure of the show's two hosts.

Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero were signed to Univision's WRTO, Miami, La Kalle 98.3 FM for the time being. Luis Jiménez's and his morning show were being syndicated in various markets. Univision Radio returned both shows to their respective cities to take on SBS directly on early 2008. Mike Reyes, former producer for Enrique Santos &amp; Joe Ferrero, return to radio also in early 2008 at the end of his non compete

From March 22, 2007 to March 1, 2008, "El Zol 95 FM" was broadcasting New York's ''El Vacilón de la Mañana'' which was also being syndicated in Puerto Rico. Since March 3, 2008, El Zol started El Vacilón de Miami with Neo Encendido and Los Pichy Boys (Alejandro González and Maikel Rodriguez) from 6 to 10 pm. The latter show was replaced in less than a year by Al Fuentes, former P.D. of various radio stations and Pio Ferro, V.P of Programming of SBS. Soon after that, Pio Ferro's employment was terminated and that morning show had become a one-man show.

''The Enrique and Joe Show'' (with sidekick and producer [[Mikey Machete]]) on Miami's La Kalle 98.3 FM, in less than a years time, once again became the #1 rated Tropical (bi-lingual) morning show in South Florida with ratings numbers reaching double digits. In May 2009, the dynamic duo of Miami radio split up and two shows were created. In the morning ''The Enrique Santos Show'', followed by ''Joe Ferrero y La Animalada'' (originally hosted for 5 months by Mikey Machete and Albertico Rodriguez) on La Kalle 98.3FM.
In early spring 2010, changes started to take place in both radio stations and by mid-year, Enrique Santos was the only one from the original morning crew to be retained on 98.3's morning show as Univision restructured the station to fit Arbitron's new ratings methodology. The station, now re-branded as MIX 98.3, assumed a more bilingual style programing.

Joe Ferrero was let go by Univision Radio on June 4, 2010 along with (Mike Reyes) Mikey Machete. In October 2010 Joe Ferrero consequently took over ''El Vacilón de la Mañana'' on Spanish Broadcasting System's (WXDJ) El Zol 95.7 FM with new co-host Albertito Rodriguez as his sidekick and female co-host Betzy Vazquez. [[Mikey (Mike Reyes) Machete]] is currently the Promotions &amp; Marketing director for ESPN Deportes Radio in Miami.

As of August 22, 2012, Joe Ferrero is no longer at SBS Miami. He was let go for no apparent reason and is currently the Operations Manager and morning show host at the all new 105.5 FM stations out of the Florida Keys. Some of the infamous duo's classic crank calls can still be heard on www.Marikonson.com
In 2015, Ferrero became a morning host on WMGE (Mega 94.9) in the Miami/Frt Lauderdale market until 2016, when Joe Ferrero was let go from the station "for no apparent reason" as per the statement he released via his Instagram account.

==Overview==
''El Vacilón de la Mañana'' (roughly translated as the "Morning Party") has various key elements: [[prank call]]s, musical [[parody|parodies]], comedy sketches, humorous commentary about straight and odd news, and open telephone lines.

The program's key player is [[Luis Jiménez (radio host)|Luis Jiménez]] (born on March 26, 1970 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]), who has been its main host for more than twelve years. Jiménez co-hosts the broadcast with [[Moonshadow (media personality)|Raymond Broussard]] (born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on December 20, 1953, of [[Cajun]] and Puerto Rican descent) and who uses the stage name ''Moonshadow''.

Luis Jiménez started his radio career in his hometown of [[Caguas]], [[Puerto Rico]] as a teenager, working as a part-time disc-jockey in various local radio stations. He later moved to [[Orlando, Florida]], achieving some recognition there as a morning radio host after holding various odd jobs. He was referred to La Mega's management as a suitable candidate for hosting a Spanish-language radio show in New York City and moved there in 1993. The program's first airing occurred on August 9.

Jiménez modeled his show after ''El Bufeo Matutino'' (''The Morning Goof''), a successful radio program in Puerto Rico that lasted twenty-two years in its various inceptions, and always had Moonshadow as its main producer and host. Luis Jiménez co-hosted the show with longtime friend Junior Hernandez. Hernandez suffered from asthma, and died of a heart attack. Fans streamed to the station to pay tribute to Hernandez the Thursday night after his death; the popular radio personality was only 34 years old. After Broussard's move to New York City in 1997, and after the death of Hernandez's in 1998, the program had a succession of co-hosts, with Moonshadow joining the show for good in 2000. Moonshadow can claim poetic justice about the fact that WZNT-FM, also known as Z-93, (Puerto Rico's main salsa radio station), which was the same radio station who fired him for being too controversial, now airs ''El Vacilón de la Mañana'' to Puerto Rico in direct Internet audio feed from La Mega every morning after a management change (SBS currently owns both stations). The first audio feed to Puerto Rico occurred on February 9, 2004. The program has since gone into syndication by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Networks]] in a few Latino markets within the United States; the first syndicated airing to Orlando, Florida and other Latino markets occurred on January 9, 2006.
[[Image:Moonshadow1.jpg|right|280px|thumb|[[Moonshadow (media personality)|Moonshadow]] (right) and [[Yun Yun Echevarría]] (center)at "El Gufeo Matutino at Z-93 (1980s)]]

While Moonshadow has gone on record in numerous times about modeling his original show after [[Howard Stern]]'s (with a very strong dose of Puerto Rican cultural elements), Jiménez's numerous original contributions give the show a unique pan-Latino flavor (its largest audience appears to be the [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and Puerto Rican community in New York City). The result "out-Sterned" Stern's show, and El Vacilón's audienceship ratings surpassed Stern's for three years, until Stern's departure to satellite radio in 2005.

Jiménez and Moonshadow do not act alone: besides a sizeable audience participation, the show's announcers and assistant producers (called the ''Mequetrefes'', or Whippersnappers) are key to the success of the show. This ragtag group feature a female traffic announcer ([[Carolina Cadillo]], born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], of [[Peru]]vian and [[Nicaragua]]n descent), a rather peculiar news announcer (Francis Méndez, born in [[Jarabacoa]], [[Dominican Republic]]), the show's main audio producer (DJ Chucky), its call screeners and production assistants (Tony Sánchez, Bocachula, El Papichulo, etc.), and the like. The show's executive producer, María Eugenia Alma, appears sporadically in the show, particularly as female singer and occasional phone call prankster.

Each member of the team is known for a perceived self-avowed defect or particularity: Luis Jiménez claims to have undersized [[genitalia]] and [[hypospadias]], Moonshadow has an [[inguinal hernia]] but reportedly has the fastest tongue in American radio history; Francis Méndez is allegedly a former [[cocaine]] addict who now suffers from [[erectile dysfunction]] as a result, Carolina Cadillo is a proud [[nymphomania]]c who speaks Spanish with a noticeable English accent (Spanish is her second language) and who has virtually no [[buttocks]], and so on.

==Prank calls==
Prank calls are usually presented in a section called ''¡Caíste!'' (You Fell for It!), in which unwitting people are called to their homes or job places and are provoked with touchy subjects for the prank victims (generally, they are taunted with intimate subjects). These prank calls are made by request from friends or family of the victims. The most famous prank call victim on the show's history was a Dominican building superintendent given the moniker [[Manolo Cabeza de Huevo|Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo]] by Jiménez, who played the part of a viciously irate jealous husband. Manolo's enraged, expletive-laden response has become the most copied and broadcast anecdote in the show's history. Manolo's son Israel, who coordinated the phone call, was in turn pranked in another memorable call.

After the deportation of the section's producer, [[Rubén Ithier]], also known as ''Rubén El Moreno'', back to his country of origin, the [[Dominican Republic]] in late 2004, this section went into limbo for close to a year and a half. Prank reruns were (and are still) played on the section's regularly slotted time.

During the hiatus, the current cast tried to pull some pranks of their own with mixed success, including repeated ''Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo'' pranks, perhaps the most successful after Ithier's departure.

The cast resumed production of regularly scheduled ''¡Caíste!'' pranks in early 2006.

In a similar sidenote, the Miami programme is also known for its share of pranks. Its notoriety came with the ''¡Caiste!'' jokes made to Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro (The former being pranked before the latter) while using pre-existing tape conversations (for the former, it was with a conversation between Castro and then-Mexican President [[Vicente Fox]], while for the latter, the snippets of the prank which was done on Chávez was used). Both pranks had Joe Ferrero pretending to be a sergeant in some army. Needless to say, while the reaction of the former victim was absolute silence, Castro replied after Ferrero tripped up his (Castro's) words ("¿Estás conforme con toda la mierda que has hecho en la isla, asesino?" ["Are you conformed with all the shit that you did on the island, murderer?"]) with a slightly peeved response: "¿En qué caí, comemierda? ¿En qué caí, maricón? ¿En qué caí, mari-cón-són?" ("What did I fall in, shiteater? What did I fall in, queer? What did I fall in, you gay-fer?"). However, the [[FCC]] complained and slapped a fine to the two disc jockeys (Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero); both chose not to pay, relying instead on a penny-drive. Its (the programme's) second-funniest joke is one that is called ''¡Píntame!'' (Paint me!), in which the two prank call a painter by asking him "¿Usted es el pintor?" ("Are you the Painter?"), whereupon by using his response (which was always "¡Sí, yo soy el pintor!" ("Yes, I'm the painter!") they played a sample of [[Elvis Crespo]]'s song "Píntame" (the first line of the song, to be exact: "'Píntame', le dije yo al pintor"; "'Paint me', I told the painter"), thus aggravating the man and angering him even further, thus launching a tirade of Dominican insults. Another famous prank made by the 2 DJs was their "Gonzalo Créo" saga; the first joke of which, "La vieja puta" ("The Old Bitch"), revolved around Santos prank calling a Cuban man by making said Cuban believe that he was in a telephoned confession booth, whereupon the Cuban said that he was being stalked by the grandmother of a friend of his. When one of Santos's associates is heard, the Cuban is outraged, and hangs up on him, whereupon, we hear Santos saying that he didn't get a chance to ask for the Cuban's money; the rest of the prank (although it is funny) revolves around then trying to get the Cuban's money. More of the "Gonzalo Créo" jokes occurred, including "El Dolor del Vecino" (The Neighbor's Pain), using the same premise of pretense of a telephoned confession booth, which involves a man struggling with his apparent bisexuality and "Domingo Y Pancho" which involves them prank calling a man who is sexually aroused by a woman who is helping him with physical therapy for an illness of the nerves. A lot of the prank calls made by Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero (During and after ''El Vacilón'' including the Enrique &amp; Joe Show) have now been made available at www.Marikonson.com

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] considers the use of prank calls to be a violation of FCC policy, which prohibits recording unsolicited phone calls for broadcast, and fined WSKQ a penalty of $16,000 for a 2007 prank call, unless all parties agree with the recording being made public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioinfo.com/2012/08/24/friday-august-24-2012/ Friday, August 24, 2012]. ''RadioInfo.com''. Retrieved August 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedic characters==
Luis Jiménez (and occasionally [[Raymond Broussard|Moonshadow]], who used to play all the comedic characters in his previous shows but has a more laid-back role on this one) play various characters in fifteen-minute segments on the show (usually three a day). Among them: ''Cornelio Toro'', a naive store-owner whose wife has made a habit of being unfaithful to him with every man she comes in contact with while Toro fails to recognize it every time, even though he immediately knows when someone else is being cheated on (the name is a play on Spanish words: Cornelio sounds very much like "cuernudo", a cuckold, while Toro, or bull, evokes the bull's ''cuernos'', or horns, the sign of the deceived man in Latin American culture); ''Jonathan Buford Rodriguez'', better known as ''El Chulo'', a [[gigolo]] who preys on geriatric women; ''El Chef Pipí'', a parody on Cuban chef and [[Univision]] television personality José Hernández, better known as [[Chef Pepin]], being Chef Pipí's main trait his questionable masculinity; ''Rebeca Larica'', a hyperventilating, gum-chewing woman who craves for male attention (played by Moonshadow); ''Dr. Héctor Tilla'', a self-proclaimed medical doctor with very rude manners and a long history of malpractice lawsuits; ''Paca Garmentí'' and ''Silvia Penacho Chafrías''; two civic-minded single women (they are set apart, in the movie at least, by their hairstyle: Paca, played by Luis, has short black hair in braids, while Silvia, played by Moonshadow, has red hair styled similarly to the [[Wendy's]] girl), both over 60 years old, who love to bicker with each other (both names are plays on Spanish words: "''Pa' cagarme en tí''" is the informal way of saying "''En tí me' cago''", which means "I shit on you", while Silvia's name, whilst parts of it are normal, The clang comes with the word "''chocha fría''", which means something to the effect of "cold pussy"); ''Madam Melo'' (originally called ''Mamá Melo''), a hyperkinetic [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[santería]] practitioner (both names are plays on sexual references: "Madam Melo" is a play on "mandamelo", which means "Fuck me", whilst "Mamá Melo" is a play on the insult "mamamelo", which means "Suck it (my dick) for me"); ''Goyito'' and ''Memin'', two schoolkids (Memin being a straight arrow, while Goyito is a perennial foul-mouthed prankster) and ''Federico "Pedrito" Rivera Rodriguez'', better known as ''Findingo'', a chronic [[marijuana]] smoker with a strong [[speech impairment]].

Some of the ideas behind these characters are not entirely original: ''Cornelio Toro'' is the updated version of ''Toribio Tauro'', a similar television character played by Puerto Rican comedic actor [[Adrián García (comedian)|Adrián García]] on Puerto Rican television (and provided with an accent closely resembling that of ''Don Pulula'', one of [[José Miguel Agrelot]]'s characters); ''El Chulo'' evolved from a real human being who was a production assistant for one of Puerto Rico's radio morning shows who had a liking for geriatric women (and became famously made fun of by being called ''El Chupaviejas'' by the show's hosts), and ''Dr. Hector Tilla'' was another one of Moonshadow's creations while in the toilet. ''Goyito'' and ''Memin'' were originally created by Moonshadow after ''Pellín'' and ''Pillín'', two animated characters from a Puerto Rican public service announcement, while ''Findingo's'' name was taken from a similarly named (although completely different) comedic character played by the Puerto Rican actor, René Rubiella; the original character shared a low [[intelligence quotient]] with the newer one, besides the name. The parody on Chef Pepin was rumored to be hated by the parodied celebrity because of its homoerotic undertones, but this was dispelled recently when Chef Pepín himself was invited to participate in a racy sketch along its comedic counterpart, the result being a hilarious interaction between the two characters which Chef Pepín clearly enjoyed.

Special mention has to be made about a real "character" who happens to be a regular caller to the show, and as of October 2005 has joined the cast on a part-time basis. ''Metadona'' is a real-life reformed robber, born in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], who had a chronic drug addiction before rehabilitation. There are strong doubts about him being completely drug-free, but he vows to have abandoned his criminal past for good. His slow delivery (evoking a chronically drug-induced state) and daring stories about botched robberies and juvenile pranks entitled him to the alias, which is the Spanish word for [[methadone]]. He has a habit of loudly opening a [[beer]] can for [[breakfast]] every time he calls.

==Musical parodies==
''El Vacilón''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s musical parodies have recently become the show's bread and butter. Popular Latino songs are typically parodied in the show, generally changing the lyrics to sexually suggestive, humorous lyrics. Some original compositions are featured as well, and generally along the same subject matter. A few program guests, mainly [[reggaeton]] artists, have parodied their own regular songs in the show (and therefore have contributed with their own material). A few English-language songs are also parodied, but mostly fragments of them.

Newer songs are introduced in a weekly section called ''El Joyón Musical'' (''joyón'' can be an [[augmentative]] for either the word ''joya'' (jewel), or ''joyo'' (an alternate spelling for hole, and Puerto Rican vulgar slang for [[anus]])). The songs are then placed in heavy rotation as filler between sections (and, in the Puerto Rico broadcast of the show, to cover local New York radio spots that are irrelevant to the Puerto Rican market).

Some listeners have complained these musical parodies take more show time than warranted. The authors of most of these parodies, [[DJ Chucky]] who is now part of ''[[The Luis Jiménez Show]]'' and [[Gerpis Correa]], also known as ''Shino/Aguakate''.

The Miami ''Vacilón'' did their share of musical parodies, until the hosts Enrique and Joe left to Univision Radio. None of the new hosts capitalized on that aspect of the show, mostly for lack of production and talent. Both Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero continued to produce phenomenal parodies which dealt with political satire, current events, making fun of people, and even the City of Hialeah (Second largest city in South Florida, mostly Cuban). The parody sung, written and performed by Enrique Santos, "Sweet Home Hialeah", has been one of their most famous, locally. The video was shot on location in the City of Hialeah and has almost become its emblem. The lyrics were sung to "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]" but with a twist. (See YouTube)

==News, straight and odd==
Straight news are read and humorously discussed in the section called "''Hablando Plepla''" ("Talking Crap"; "Plepla" is a euphemism for [[feces]], with less of a profane connotation than the more commonly used ''caca'', or "shit").

The same is done for odd news in the section called ''Noticias Locas'' (Crazy News). Most are taken from the Odd News segment of [[Yahoo!]] News.

Francis Méndez reads regular news at the top of the hour (not the same as Hablando Plepla), but injecting humorous slang phrases to the headlines. This goes in sharp contrast to the serious, almost dead-panned delivery of the show's sports announcer, [[Cuba]]n-born Renato Murphy, as well as that of [[Carolina Cadillo|Cadillo's]] traffic report. The result is almost as odd as the ''Noticias Locas'' segment itself.

==Open Lines==
Lines are opened in a segment of the show for listeners to call in and tell their anecdotes, which are generally mishaps or sexual situations. Although many subject names are suggested, all calls wind up discussing the aforementioned situations. From Monday to Thursday, subjects are rotated, but the last two hours of Friday's show are devoted to randomly take calls on previous subjects, in the section called ''Lo Que Sobró de la Semana'' (What's Left of This Week).

Listeners' calls tend to have a somewhat stringent quality control:

*[[Tony Sánchez]], the program's call screener, has to judge the story as funny enough to be put on air. Then the call is broadcast on air, so the hosts can talk to the caller. Usually each call is given approximately three minutes of air time. If the story isn't funny enough (e.g., a weak [[Punch line|punchline]]), or runs too long, the call is hung up to the tune of two different songs: A bolero parody which starts with the line ''Ay, Qué Historia Más Pendeja'' (Ugh, What a Stupid Story) for unfunny calls, and a "Charge" tune instrumentalized with the syllable "blah" for long calls.
*If callers start giving too much praise to Juan and Moonshadow, the cast will start singing a Puerto Rican bomba which starts ''Es Un Lambón'' (He's A Kiss-up)
*If the hosts judge a story as over-the-top, or an outright fabrication, the cast will start chanting ''Embustero, Embustero...'' (Liar, Liar...)
*If Tony Sánchez's judgement about a call produces a flat or otherwise uninteresting call, Jiménez chastises him on the air and  physically strikes him (or so it seems). Many callers complain that Sánchez's judgement depends on his mood, on how well the anecdote is explained to him, or on the caller's gender.  Tony Sánchez is considered a traitor by most of the audience since he and the rest of the "mequetrefes" betrayed Luis Jiménez and stole his show.

'''''From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler''''' is a 1995 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] based on [[E.L. Konigsburg]]'s [[From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler|novel of the same name]]. The story is about a girl and her brother who run away from home to live in the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and discover what they think is a lost treasure. The children, Claudia and Jamie, are transfixed with the treasure and won't leave without knowing what its secret is. [[Lauren Bacall]] stars in the title role.

The book was previously adapted into a [[From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler (1973 film)|1973 feature film]] starring [[Ingrid Bergman]], later released on home video as ''The Hideaways''.

==Plot==
Claudia is the middle child of a busy family. She is smart and responsible, often required to help her mother around the house. However, weary of the life in suburban Connecticut, she decides to find something grander. Her younger brother Jamie, along with his extensive savings from playing cards, is enlisted as her partner in crime. They run away from home to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

Once they arrive, they spend their days in the museum, exploring and eavesdropping on different schools' guided tours. They hide in the bathrooms until after closing time and sleep in antique beds. While there they encounter "The Angel," a marble statue recently auctioned off by the elusive Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. The striking piece is surrounded by mystery. Many experts dispute the artist who created the work, though many suppose it to be none other than [[Michelangelo]] himself. Claudia becomes determined to solve the mystery of "The Angel."  Claudia and Jamie spend most of their time in searching and researching new things about the statue.

The following day, the two notice a small mark at the base of the piece. After some research, they find that the mark was one that Michelangelo made on numerous works. Claudia disguises herself as an adult in order to make an appointment with a museum worker to inform them of their discovery. Contrary to her hopes, the official informs her that they knew of the mark but are unsure if it is authentic.

Jamie, homesick after a week away, catches a cold. Refusing to go home before they solve the mystery, Claudia suggests that they visit the statue's previous owner, Mrs. Frankweiler. She refuses to tell them directly, but does permit them to attempt to discover the answer for themselves. After leading them to a room lined from floor to ceiling with filing cabinets, she informs them that they have one hour to search for the truth. After 54 minutes of fruitless effort, Claudia uncovers the correct file. It contains a sketch of the sculpture from one of Michelangelo's notebooks, proving that he is, indeed, the creator. Finally appeased, the siblings permit Mrs. Frankweiler to drive them home.

==Authenticity==
The film lacks the narrative of Mrs. Frankweiler present in the book which causes it to lose much of the book's humor and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.tvguide.com/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler/review/131325]&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority of the film, the script stays true to the action in the book. However, Claudia's posing as an adult and Jamie's cold are not present in the novel. ''[[TV Guide]]'' asserts that these changes may differ from the book but bring added drama to the film.

==Critical acclaim==
TV Guide granted the film three and a half stars out of four. It declared that the film was a "somewhat dry, but still thoroughly entertaining adaptation of an excellent story." They also write that the film "celebrates the magic and beauty of art, the fun of an adventure, and most of all, a child's need to feel important." Their final word on the matter proclaim that "the performances and production are first rate. The children are variously brilliant, bratty and excitable, and Lauren Bacall is appropriately dignified as Mrs. Frankweiler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.tvguide.com/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler/review/131325]&lt;/ref&gt;"

J. Dillard writes that the movie is carried by its casting of Lauren Bacall in the title role and that the film "never rises above the level of the TV Movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler-1995-film]&lt;/ref&gt;" However, he does say that it "should be entertaining " for its preteen target audience.

'''''Guinness World Records''''', known from its inception in 1955 until 2000 as '''''The Guinness Book of Records''''' and in previous United States editions as '''''The Guinness Book of World Records''''', is a [[reference book]] published annually, listing [[world record]]s both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The brainchild of Sir [[Hugh Beaver]], the book was co-founded by brothers [[Norris McWhirter|Norris]] and [[Ross McWhirter]] in [[Fleet Street]], London in August 1954.

The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2019 edition, it is now in its 64th  year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in ''Guinness World Records'' becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faq.aspx |publisher=Guinness World Records |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124172127/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faq.aspx |archivedate=24 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 10 November 1951, [[Hugh Beaver|Sir Hugh Beaver]], then the managing director of the [[Guinness]] Breweries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guinness.book-of-records.info/history.html |title=The History of the Book |work=Guinness Record Book Collecting |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; went on a shooting party in the [[North Slob]], by the [[River Slaney]] in [[County Wexford]], Ireland. After missing a shot at a [[Eurasian Golden Plover|golden plover]], he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest [[Game (food)|game bird]] in Europe, the golden plover or the [[red grouse]] (it is the plover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fionn Davenport|title=Ireland|year= 2010|page=193|isbn=9781742203508|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfL3QnPMi9oC&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt;). That evening at [[Castlebridge]] House, he realized that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/james.robertson/history2.htm |title=Early history of Guinness World Records |page=2 |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701200438/http://freespace.virgin.net/james.robertson/history2.htm |archivedate=1 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Publication of the Guinness Book of Records: 27 August 1955|first=Richard|last=Cavendish|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=55|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2005|year=2004|page=6|isbn=1892051222|publisher=Guinness; 50th Anniversary edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee [[Christopher Chataway]] recommended University friends [[Norris McWhirter|Norris]] and [[Ross McWhirter]], who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became ''The Guinness Book of Records'' in August 1954. A thousand copies were printed and given away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spyhunter007.com/spy_guinness_book_history.htm|title=Guinness Book History 1950 - Present|work=spyhunter007.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founding of ''The Guinness Book of Records'' at 107 [[Fleet Street]], London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British best seller lists by Christmas. The following year, it launched in the US, and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, ''Guinness World Records'' has gone on to become a record breaker in its own right; with sales of more than 100 million copies in 100 different countries and 37 languages, ''Guinness World Records'' is the world's best selling copyrighted book ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.aspx|title=Guinness World Records Corporate - Home|work=guinnessworldrecords.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821044202/http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.aspx|archivedate=21 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the TV series ''[[Record Breakers]]'', based upon the book, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. [[Ross McWhirter#Assassination|Ross McWhirter was assassinated]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3643039.stm |title=Record Breakers' McWhirter dies|date=20 April 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2014 |newspaper=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Ross' assassination, the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called ''Norris on the Spot''.

Guinness Superlatives (later Guinness World Records) Limited was formed in 1954 to publish the first book. [[Sterling Publishing]] owned the rights to the ''Guinness'' book in the US for decades. The group was owned by Guinness PLC and subsequently [[Diageo]] until 2001, when it was purchased by [[Gullane Entertainment]]. Gullane was itself purchased by [[HIT Entertainment]] in 2002. In 2006, [[Apax Partners]] purchased HiT and subsequently sold Guinness World Records in early 2008 to the [[Jim Pattison Group]], the parent company of [[Ripley Entertainment]], which is licensed to operate Guinness World Records' Attractions. With offices in New York City and Tokyo, Guinness World Records' global headquarters remain in London, while its museum attractions are based at Ripley headquarters in [[Orlando, Florida]], US.

Recent editions have focused on record feats by person competitors. Competitions range from obvious ones such as [[Olympic weightlifting]] to the longest [[egg tossing]] distances, or for longest time spent playing ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' or the number of hot dogs that can be consumed in three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/24214-most-hot-dogs-eaten-in-3-minutes&lt;/ref&gt; Besides records about competitions, it contains such facts such as the heaviest tumour,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/67567-largest-tumour-removed-intact&lt;/ref&gt; the most poisonous fungus,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66477-most-poisonous-fungus&lt;/ref&gt; the longest-running soap opera&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-running-tv-soap-opera&lt;/ref&gt; and the most valuable life-insurance policy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/3/mystery-billionaire-takes-out-historic-%24201-million-life-insurance-policy-56096&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Many records also relate to the youngest people to have achieved something, such as the youngest person to visit all nations of the world ([[Maurizio Giuliano]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records|year=2006|page=126|edition=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each edition contains a selection of the records from the Guinness World Records database, as well as select new records, with the criteria for inclusion changing from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ppbdz/i_am_craig_glenday_editorinchief_at_guinness/cmywf2e&lt;/ref&gt;

The retirement of Norris McWhirter from his consulting role in 1995 and the subsequent decision by Diageo Plc to sell The Guinness Book of Records brand have shifted the focus of the books from text-oriented to illustrated reference. A selection of records are curated for the book from the full archive but all existing Guinness World Records titles can be accessed by creating a login on the company's website. Applications made by individuals for existing record categories are free of charge. There is an administration fee of $5 to propose a new record title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/the-application-process/&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of spin-off books&lt;ref&gt;http://www.book-of-records.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and television series have also been produced.

''Guinness World Records'' bestowed the record of "Person with the most records" on [[Ashrita Furman]] of Queens, NY in April 2009. At that time, he held 100 records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Guinness-World-Records-honors-one-mans-historic-milestone-100-Records-Broken/blog/241933/7691.html |title=Guinness World Records honors one man's historic milestone – 100 Records Broken! – Guinness World Records Blog post |publisher=community.guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=29 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612221225/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Guinness-World-Records-honors-one-mans-historic-milestone-100-Records-Broken/blog/241933/7691.html |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Guinness designated 9 November as ''International Guinness World Records Day'' to encourage breaking of world records.&lt;ref name="Guinness2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20061106005761&amp;newsLang=en|title=Records Shatter Across the Globe in Honor of Guinness World Records Day 2006|accessdate=29 April 2007|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718032729/http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20061106005761&amp;newsLang=en|archive-date=18 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, an estimated 100,000 people participated in over 10 countries. Guinness reported 2,244 new records in 12 months, which was a 173% increase over the previous year.&lt;ref name="Guinness2006"/&gt; In February 2008, [[NBC]] aired ''The Top 100 Guinness World Records of All Time'' and Guinness World Records made the complete list available on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2008/01/080128.aspx Guinness World Records Live: Top 100].

For many records, Guinness World Records is the effective authority on the exact requirements for them and with whom records reside, the company providing adjudicators to events to determine the veracity of record attempts. The list of records which the Guinness World Records covers is not fixed; records may be added and also removed for various reasons. The public are invited to submit applications for records, which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; The company also provides corporate services for companies to "harness the power of record-breaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses."&lt;ref name="corporate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/ |title=Guinness World Records Corportate |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=10 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512021154/http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/ |archivedate=12 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical and safety issues===
[[File:Guinness Beer Record 1977.jpg|right|thumb|Steven Petrosino drinking 1 litre of beer in 1.3 seconds in June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerrecord.com|title=Guinness World Beer Record|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbX33Zkl9Nw|title=Video clip|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrosino set record times for 250 ml, 500 ml and 1.5 litres as well, but Guinness accepted only the record for one litre. They later dropped all beer and alcohol records from their compendium in 1991, and reinstated the records in 2008.]]
Guinness World Records states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons, such as those related to the killing or harming of animals.&lt;ref name="isitarecord"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/is-it-a-record/ |title=IS YOUR PROPOSAL A POTENTIAL GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ ACHIEVEMENT? |publisher="Guinness World Records" |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons, including concerns for the well being of potential record breakers. For example, following publication of a "heaviest fish" record, many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy, and therefore such entries were removed.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Guinness Book also dropped records within their "eating and drinking records" section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential [[lawsuit|litigation]].&lt;ref name="discontinue"/&gt; These changes included the removal of all [[distilled beverage|spirit]], wine, and beer drinking records, along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees.&lt;ref name="discontinue"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records|year=1990|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other records, such as [[sword swallowing]] and rally driving (on public roads), were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels.

There have been instances of closed records being reopened. For example, the sword swallowing record was listed as closed in the 1990 Guinness Book of World Records, but the ''[[Guinness World Records Primetime]]'' TV show, which started in 1998, accepted three sword swallowing challenges (and so did the 2007 edition of the ''Guinness World Records'' onwards). Similarly, the speed beer drinking records which were dropped from the book in 1991, reappeared 17 years later in the 2008 edition, but were moved from the "Human Achievements" section of the older book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook.htm |title=Guinness World Record Book Entry |work=Guinness World Beer Record |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the "Modern Society" section of the newer edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Record Book Entry 2008|url=http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook_2008.htm|work=Guinness World Beer Record|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2011}}, it is required in the guidelines of all "large food" type records that the item be fully edible, and distributed to the public for consumption, to prevent food wastage.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

[[Chain letter]]s are also not allowed: "Guinness World Records does not accept any records relating to chain letters, sent by post or e-mail. 

===Difficulty in defining records===
For some potential categories, ''Guinness World Records'' has declined to list some records that are too difficult or impossible to determine. For example, its website states: "We do not accept any claims for beauty as it is not objectively measurable."&lt;ref name=isitarecord/&gt;

On 10 December 2010, ''Guinness World Records'' stopped its new "[[dreadlock]]" category after investigation of its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, determining it was impossible to judge this record accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Longest-Dreadlock-Record-Rested/BLOG/3083932/7691.html |title=Longest Dreadlock Record&amp;nbsp;– Rested&amp;nbsp;– Guinness World Records Blog post&amp;nbsp;– Home of the Longest, Shortest, Fastest, Tallest facts and feats |publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005033245/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Longest-Dreadlock-Record-Rested/BLOG/3083932/7691.html |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verifying existing records==
''Guinness World Records'' website publishes selected records and is not supposed to be used for the record verification purposes, as it explains: "There are more than 40,000 current records in our database and we try our best to feature as many as possible online. We currently include over 15,000 records online which we update every week, so make sure to check the site regularly!" The book printed annually contains only 4,000 records. The only way to verify a record is to contact Guinness, and the average response time is twelve weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://guinnessworldrecords.com/FAQ/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, a ''Guinness Book of World Records'' museum opened in the [[Empire State Building]]. Speed shooter [[Bob Munden]] then went on tour promoting ''The Guinness Book of World Records'' by performing his record fast draws with a standard weight single-action revolver from a western movie type holster. His fastest time for a draw was 0.02 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmunden.com|title=Bob Munden • Six-Gun Magic Custom Gunsmithing - Bob &amp; Becky Munden - Six-Gun Magic Gunwork|work=bobmunden.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among exhibits were life-size statues of the world's tallest man ([[Robert Wadlow]]) and world's largest earth worm, an X-ray photo of a sword swallower, repeated lightning strike victim [[Roy Sullivan]]'s hat complete with lightning holes and a pair of gem-studded golf shoes on sale for $6500.&lt;ref&gt;''In Praise of Facts'', by John Leonard, the introduction to the New York Times Desk Reference&lt;/ref&gt; The museum closed in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951231&amp;slug=2160261|title=Travel &amp; Outdoors - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly: A 1995 Travel Retrospective - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, the Guinness company has permitted the [[franchising]] of small museums with displays based on the book, all currently ({{As of|2010|lc=y}}) located in towns popular with tourists: [[Tokyo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[San Antonio]].

Specials:
* ''Guinness World Records: 50 Years, 50 Records'' - on ITV (UK), 11 September 2004

With the popularity of reality television, Guinness World Records began to market itself as the originator of the television genre, with slogans such as ''we wrote the book on Reality TV''.
[[File:Ironing guinness 0357.JPG|right|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Suresh Joachim|Suresh Joachim Arulanantham]] is a Tamil Canadian film actor and producer and multiple-Guinness World Record holder who has broken over 50 world records set in several countries in attempts to benefit the underprivileged children around the world. Some world record attempts are more unusual than others: he is pictured here minutes away from breaking the [[ironing]] world record at 55 hours and 5 minutes, at [[Shoppers World, Brampton]].]]

==Gamer's edition==
{{Distinguish|Guinness World Records: The Videogame}}
In 2008, Guinness World Records released its gamer's edition, a branch that keeps records for popular video game high scores, code, and feats in association with [[Twin Galaxies]]. The Gamer's Edition contains 258 pages, over 1236 video game related world records and four interviews including one with Twin Galaxies founder [[Walter Day]]. The most recent edition is the ''Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, 2019,'' which was released September 6, 2018.

==British pop music volume==
{{Main|British Hit Singles &amp; Albums}}
The ''[[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]'' was published from 2003 to 2006, based on two earlier, separate HiT publications, ''British Hit Singles'' and ''British Hit Albums'', which began in 1977. It was effectively replaced (in singles part) by the ''Virgin Book of British Hit Singles'' from 2007 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-18|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Virgin-Book-British-Hit-Singles/dp/0753515377|title=Amazon page for VBBHS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==

===Video games===
A [[video game]], ''[[Guinness World Records: The Video Game]]'', was developed by [[TT Fusion]] and released for [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]] and [[iOS]] in November 2008.

===Film===
In 2012, [[Warner Bros.]] announced the development of a live-action film version of ''Guinness World Records'' with [[Daniel Chun]] as scriptwriter. The film version will apparently use the heroic achievements of record holders as the basis for a narrative that should have global appeal.&lt;ref name="GuinessFilm"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/08/guinness-book-world-records-film | title=Guinness Book of World Records could be next big brand name to hit cinemas | publisher=Guardian | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Gunsho Ruijū'''|群書類従}} is a collection of old Japanese books assembled by [[Hanawa Hokiichi]] (塙保己一) with the support of the [[Bakufu]].

The first series in 1819 has 25 subjects with 1273 works. A modern print edition was published in 19 volumes from 1894 to 1912.

A second series of another 2103 texts was created by his son [[Hanawa Tadatomi]] (塙忠宝) from 1821 under the title ''Zoku Gunsho Ruijū'' (続群書類従). Another series, the ''Zoku Zoku Gunsho Ruijū''  (続々群書類従), was assembled in two parts, the first with 16 subjects in 1903-4 in 5 volumes, the second in 1906-9 with 304 sources in 16 volumes. ''Shin Gunsho Ruijū'' ([[:ja:新群書類従]]) was printed in 1906-08 in 10 volumes.

Another text collection begun by Hanawa Tadatomi is the ''[[Dai Nihon Shiryō]]''

'''Hana aloha''' is a [[Hawaii]]an term that refers to the art of love magic.&lt;ref name="Pukui"&gt;Pukui, M and Elbert S. Hawaiian Dictionary. University of Hawaii Press; Honolulu, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of hana aloha was performed by a [[kahuna]] (priest) who conducted a ceremony to gain the desired effect. An infatuated person may request a hana aloha in order to instill a lust into a desired victim, or a shy person may request a ceremony that simply brings the desired person in closer proximity. Conversely a person who felt that they were afflicted by love-inducing magic could request a "pale hana aloha" ceremony in order to ward off the unwanted love. Some kahuna would only conduct a hana aloha ceremony if the love was one that was spiritually pure. One test used to determine this was to stir a bowl of water and place two flowers, particularly those of the ko'oloa'ula (''[[Abutilon menziesii]]'') in the turbulent liquid. If the flowers quickly met and floated together then the love was ordained, but if the flowers avoided each other the ceremony was not to be conducted.  

==Sugarcane==
The ceremony invariably uses [[sugarcane]] as an essential element, and specific varieties of sugarcane were applied to different ends. The names of the canes themselves hinted at their particular use, utilizing the Hawaiian wit that constantly played puns of the multiple meanings of words.  The "papa'a cane", a particularly dark cane, literally means burnt and refers to the slightly burnt flavor of the molasses of this variety. Papa'a can also mean "tight, walled, secure," and therefore was used in the hana aloha that aimed to make a secure, long term relationship.&lt;ref name="Pukui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fornander"&gt;Fornander A. Fornander Collection of Hawaiian Antiquities and Folk-Lore, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; "Manulele", referring to a flying bird, was applied to a distant love.&lt;ref name="Pukui" /&gt; The "Pilimai" variety, literally meaning "come this way," was used to cause intense but short lived affairs. Other cane varieties associated with the hana aloha are the "Lahi" and "Kea" varieties. The counter action to the hana aloha magic utilized the "Laukona" sugarcane variety in a ceremony called pale hana aloha.&lt;ref name="Fornander" /&gt; 

While the hana aloha ceremony focused on prayer it would at times be accompanied by a "magic potion," to be drunk either by the infatuated person or his/hers object of desire.

The '''Hubbell Center''' is the museum, library, and archive of the Hubbell family in North America.

==Description==
The Hubbell Center is a tax-exempt not-for-profit corporation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Its mission is to preserve, protect, and display the history and artifacts of the descendants of [[Richard Hubball]], and make them accessible to the family and others across the world. Richard Hubbell was born in 1626 in [[Bewdley]], England, and since his arrival in the [[New Haven Colony]], his descendants have migrated widely in the US and Canada, as well as many foreign countries. The inspiration for the Hubbell Center came about through discussion among Clifton Howells Hubbell, Donald Clayton Hubbell, James Windsor Hubbell, Jr., Jack Jerome Hubbell, and Harold Berresford Hubbell, Jr., a longtime Hubbell researcher and co-founder (with Donald Sidney Hubbell) of The Hubbell Family Historical Society (THFHS). The Center is sustained through charitable contributions, and the facility in which the Center is located is provided through the generosity of the James W. Hubbell, Jr. family of [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. The Center also serves as the focal point for THFHS, which is associated with the Center and provides financial support, structure and membership.

==Holdings==
[[File:Gutierrez-Hubbell House, Pajarito NM.jpg|thumb|Gutierrez-Hubbell House in Pajarito, NM]]
The holdings of the Hubbell Center include a library of resource books on Connecticut, New York, and New England; genealogy books published by THFHS; books written by and about Hubbells of all spellings; memorabilia of the Hubbell family; and references to family-associated features such as the Hubbell Trading Post in Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100115165517/http://www.nps.gov/archive/hutr/hubbell.htm Hubbell Trading Post], The National Park Service. Archived from [http://www.nps.gov/archive/hutr/hubbell.htm the original] on January 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbell House in Minnesota,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubbellhouserestaurant.com/history.htm "A Brief History of the Hubbell House"], The Hubbell House Restaurant.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hubbell-Gutierrez House]] in New Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubbellhousealliance.org/property.htm "About the Hubbell Property"], Hubbell House Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], and others.

'''Ichpedia''' is an online encyclopedia for the [[intangible cultural heritage]] (ICH) in [[Korea]] and international arenas. It was created by a group of scholars and practitioners with the support of [http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/new/index.action Cultural Heritage Administration of the Republic of Korea]. It is the ongoing project to build up an extensive inventory of ICH in [[Korea]]. The ultimate goal is to enhance the significance of traditional cultures and cultural diversities.

== Outline of Ichpedia ==
The ICHPEDIA project in [[Korea]] started with a movement to create a new paradigm for safeguarding of ICH in the national and international arenas. With the awareness that there are conflicts and difference between [[Korea]]’s current policies and laws regarding ICH protection and [[UNESCO]]’s 2003 Convention, the project started with a new understanding of ICH and a new methodology of collecting data. ICHPEDIA is the online encyclopedia of intangible cultural heritage established on the basis of survey data. Its immediate goal is to create an exclusive record of [[Korea]]’s ICH using internet surveys and taking a wiki-model based on the Web 2.0 platform. This project entails some innovations such as the utilization of a bottom-up approach, the collective intelligence, and community’s active involvement. In order to compile exclusive lists of ICH, first, the online survey is used. Second, a wiki-model for collecting data and a new network system is set up. Third, the online-based networks have certain merits, including the ability to surpass barriers of time and space, as well as various divisions and partitions in the society. ICHPEDIA removes the walls between specialists and ordinary people, central organizations and regional ones, and between government and citizens. The ultimate goal of ICHPEDIA project is to increase cooperation among stakeholders for safeguarding ICH in [[Korea]].

ICH has recently drawn international attention because of its immeasurable contributions to the enhancement of human creativity and cultural diversity. However, ICH of each country has been disappearing rapidly as modernization and industrialization processes within each country were intensified. In particular, ICH is not easy to preserve and protect from destruction due to its immaterial and formless nature. It exists in people’s memory, ideas, and everyday practices. [[UNESCO]] has strenuously made efforts to establish safeguarding measures of ICH throughout the world due to distinctive characteristics of ICH. [[UNESCO]]’s initiatives signify its view of ICH as the common [[cultural heritages]] of humanity. As part of such initiatives, [[UNESCO]] announced the Convention for the safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. The Convention specifies safeguarding measures additionally proclaimed by the directives of ICH and related guidelines. Of the safeguarding methods, inventories are very important ways in which the intangible heritage community members can raise awareness of their [[cultural heritage]].  According to [[UNESCO]], the process of inventorying ICH enhances the self-respect of heritage bearers and their respective communities and enriches human creativity. The Convention encourages the involvement of state parties in creating inventories of ICH existing in their territories and providing regular updates of any existing inventories.  Updating of inventories is an ongoing process that can never be fully completed. The Convention allows some flexibility for the state parties in utilizing their own methods in inventory-making.

Since the 1960s the Korean government has made efforts to protect and preserve the [[:ko:문화유산|Korean cultural heritages]] at the national level.  Both legal and administrative measures have been undertaken affecting national treasures containing both tangible and intangible cultural heritages. The government’s imperative to safeguard the national treasures was/is acknowledged being exemplary and draws international attention. However, since the Convention in 2003 and its operational directives have been ratified by many member states, [[Korea]] has fallen into confusion. There are some conflicts and differences between the [[Korea]]’s existing system and the [[UNESCO]]’s new one regarding the safeguarding measures. It is necessary to carefully consider the differences and distinctions between the two systems. Although [[Korea]] had an existing, mature system of protection and preservation of [[cultural heritages]], it is now facing a change in its existing system. The [[UNESCO]]’s initiatives have caused [[Korea]] to take stock in the safeguarding ICH.

== Policy ==
# Data are collected through bottom-up approach.
# Collective intelligentce are being promoted.

[[Sushruta Samhita]] written between 2nd and 4th century BC, is a medical text that  prescribes seasonal foods and flavours.

[[Manasollasa]], is one of the earliest texts compiled during the rule of  [[Chalukya]] king [[Someshvara III]] in the
1130AD. It includes several recipes including  "iddarika" thought to refer to [[idli]], although there is disagreement about that. It has been suggested that [[Vaddaradhane]], the Kannada text of Jain Acharya Sivakoti written in 920 AD, the mention of iddalige may be the earliest mention of Idali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/490030/kitchen-chronicles.html|title=Kitchen chronicles|last=Palecanda|first=Lakshmi|date=2015-07-18|work=Deccan Herald|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Ni'matnama]]''' is a fifteenth-century collection of the recipes during the rule of  Sultan of [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]), Ghiyath Shahi, and his son and successor, Nasir Shah. It contains recipes for cooking as well as providing remedies and aphrodisiacs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/culinary-adventures-ghiyath-shah-sultan-malwa-nimatnama-2798876-foodie/|title=The culinary adventures of Ghiyath Shah, the sultan of Malwa|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a sections on the preparation of betel leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QlONJ_XYOeIC&amp;dq=india+sultanate+cook+book|title=The Ni'matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan's Book of Delights|last=Titley|first=Norah M.|date=2004-11-30|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134268078|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soopa Shastra''', (1508 A.D.) written by  [[Mangarasa III]], a follower of Jainism, is exclusively  vegetarian.  The ingredients and cooking methods are given detail, and even the types of utensils and ovens needed are mentioned. King Mangarasa III belonged to the Chengalvu dynasty, and  was under the suzerainty of Hoysala kings The first chapter describes  thirty five breads, sweets and snacks, now mostly obsolete. The second chapter describes  drinks, salty, sour and sweet in taste. Third chapter discusses nine types of payasa ([[kheer]]), eight types of cooked rice and 24 mixed rice dishes. The remaining three chapters include recipes for 20 dishes with eggplant, 16 dishes with jackfruit and 25e dishes made with raw bananas (plantains) and banana flowers.  The last chapter contains recipes using bamboo shoots and myrobalan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peppertrail.com/inner.php?menu_id=19&amp;sm1_id=95&amp;index_id=3  SOOPA SHASTRA OF MANGARASA: CULINARY TRADITIONS OF MEDIEVAL KARNATAKA (1508 A.D.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it was composed during the rule of a Jain ruler, some of the vegetarian ingredients mentioned, such as onions, are regarded inappropriate for strict Jains.

In the chapter, Pishtakadhyaya, food items made with flour like rotti, mandige, garige, dose, iddali have been mentioned.  It shopuld be noted that inncient Kannada poetry has used ‘rotika’ even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.gov.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=117662  Did soup flow from Karnataka?, Ratnadeep Banerji, Press Information Bureau, 25-March, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the word Soopa is used in the same sense as the English term "[[soup]]".

The first book of '''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'''  (the third volume of the Akbarnama), written in 1590, gives several recipes, mainly those prevailing among the Mughal elite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiacurry.com/historicalrecipes/  India Historical Recipes British-Raj Akbar-period]&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Period==

The British rule saw publication of several cookbooks, some intended for the British elite, others for locals, often in languages like Gujarati, bangla and Hindi. These include
* Pak-Shastra, 1878, Gujarati

==Internationalization of Indian cooking==
With large scale migration of Indians to North America, and with arrival of international influence in India, a new set of cookbook authors emerged.
* An Invitation to Indian Cooking, [[Madhur Jaffrey]], (1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/madhur-jaffrey-the-doyenne-of-curry-is-back-but-tikkas-not-9774961.html|title=Madhur Jaffrey: The doyenne of curry is back... but tikka's not|last=Dutta|first=Kunal|date=2014-10-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has since then written a series of popular cook books.

* Lord Krishna's Cuisine: The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking Hardcover, Yamuna Devi, 1987

With the advent of TV and the internet, new food authors have emerged in the past few decades. There is significant international influence because International travel has become common. These include

'''''Julia's Kitchen Wisdom''''' (Knopf, 2000, {{ISBN|0-375-41151-8}}) is a [[cookbook|book of cooking principles]], first published in 2000, that was based on the notebook of the famous American television [[cook (profession)|chef]] [[Julia Child]].

==Description==
The book ''Julia's Kitchen Wisdom'' accompanied a TV special of the same name and was compiled by co-author [[David Nussbaum]], who had worked with Child and [[Jacques Pépin]] on their book of the previous year, ''[[Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home]]''. It was Child's last published book before her death in 2004 and was intended as a quick reference for common kitchen techniques rather than a comprehensive cookbook in the manner of 1961's ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'' or 1989's ''[[The Way To Cook]]''.

The book follows the practice used in previous books (particularly ''The Way To Cook'') of focusing on "master recipes", basic recipes representing a specific principle or ingredient, and then presenting other dishes as variants thereof. Due to its brevity, it also shies away from presenting complex recipes such as [[puff pastry]], referring readers to Child's earlier, more in-depth work for such items.

''Julia's Kitchen Wisdom'' was reissued in 2009 in a paperback edition as a tie-in to the movie version of the book ''[[Julie &amp; Julia]]''.

'''Lincoln Record Society''' is a British [[text publication society]] founded in 1910 which edits and publishes historic records relating to [[Lincolnshire]] and the [[Diocese of Lincoln]]. The ancient diocese covered not only Lincolnshire, but also [[Leicestershire]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Rutland]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[Bedfordshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Huntingdonshire]] and parts of [[Hertfordshire]], and the society's publications may touch on the history of all these areas. In practice, they have tended to relate either to the ecclesiastical administration of the diocese (in its several geographical incarnations), or to the broader history of the county.  

==History==
===Prehistory: Lincolnshire Record Society===
A precursor body was the '''Lincolnshire Record Society''', founded in January 1889, and modelled on other county-based record societies including the [[Oxford Historical Society]] (founded 1884) and [[Somerset Record Society]] (founded 1886). The society published an edition of the [[chronicle]] of [[Louth Park Abbey]] in 1891, but this was to prove its only publication, and shortly afterwards it faded from view.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln Record Society===
The Lincoln Record Society was established in October 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, pp. 1, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal initiator was Canon [[C. W. Foster]] (1866–1935), who since 1906 had served as secretary of the diocesan Records Committee. Foster became the first general editor of the new society, as well as its secretary and, from 1918, its treasurer, running it largely single-handedly until his death in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, pp. 69–79.&lt;/ref&gt; He personally edited 12 of its volumes. He was succeeded as general editor and secretary by [[Kathleen Major]] (1906–2000), who held both posts until 1956, when she resigned the secretaryship on her appointment as Principal of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]]: she remained general editor until 1975 (serving her final year jointly with [[Dorothy Owen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, pp. 81–108, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent general editors have been Dorothy Owen, 1975–95; Professor David Smith, 1995–2002; and Nicholas Bennett, 2002–date.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prominent supporters (albeit at a distance) over several decades included the historians [[Frank Stenton]] and his wife [[Doris Mary Stenton|Doris]]. Frank Stenton edited a volume of medieval [[charter]]s of five Lincolnshire [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertine]] monasteries, published as the society's 18th volume in 1922, and later served as its President from 1942 to 1967; while Doris Stenton edited a volume of early 13th-century Lincolnshire [[Assizes|Assize Rolls]], published as the 22nd volume in 1926, and continued to maintain close contact with the society.

In 1912, in order to meet the interests of [[Genealogy|genealogists]], the society established a Parish Register Section, with a separate subscription, for publishing Lincolnshire [[parish register]]s. Nine volumes of registers were published (seven of them edited by Canon Foster); but the series had to be abandoned as printing costs rose in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
===Main series===
The Society's first two publications, agreed in November 1910, were an edition of early 17th-century Lincolnshire church notes compiled by the [[antiquarian|antiquary]] [[Gervase Holles]], edited by R. E. G. Cole; and a [[Calendar (archives)|calendar]] of the acts of Bishop [[Thomas Cooper (bishop)|Thomas Cooper]] (1571–84), edited by Foster.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The two volumes appeared in 1911 and 1912 respectively. 

A particularly important series comprised the ten volumes of ''Registrum Antiquissimum'', an edition of the medieval charters of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], with two additional volumes of [[facsimile]]s. The first four volumes, published between 1931 and 1937, were edited by Canon Foster (the last being completed and seen through the press after his death by Kathleen Major); and the final six, plus the two facsimile volumes, published between 1937 and 1973, by Kathleen Major.

Recent volumes, which illustrate the range of subject-matter addressed, have included:

The society's 100th volume, published to commemorate its centenary in 2010, was a history of the society itself by Nicholas Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

All volumes have been issued in a uniform [[Cream (colour)|cream]] binding. Most have been issued in standard [[octavo]] format, but a small number, containing facsimile material, have appeared in a larger [[Folio (printing)|folio]] format: these have included the two facsimile volumes of ''Registrum Antiquissimum'' (LRS vols 42 and 68); a facsimile edition of extracts from the minute-books of the [[Spalding Gentlemen’s Society]], 1712–1755 (LRS vol. 73); a volume of town plans of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] (LRS vol. 92); another of maps of the [[River Witham|Witham]] Fens (LRS vol. 96); and another based on an album of photographs of the construction of the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway|Bourne to Saxby railway]], 1890–93 (LRS vol. 98).

===Parish Register Section===
The nine volumes of the Parish Register Section, which were not included in the society's main numbered series, were published between 1913 and 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2010, pp. 237–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occasional Publications===
In 2016, the society inaugurated a separate series of "Occasional Publications". The first (and to date only) volume in this series is ''Steep, Strait and High: ancient houses of central Lincoln'' (2016) by Christopher Johnson and Stanley Jones, which forms the final volume in a series of architectural and historical surveys of the historic buildings of Lincoln, originally undertaken by the Survey of Ancient Houses sponsored by the Lincoln Civic Trust, and continued by the Survey of Lincoln.

==Grants==
The society offers research grants, for sums ranging from £500 to £5,000 (with a possibility of renewal), for projects falling within its areas of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grants |publisher=Lincoln Record Society |url=http://www.lincoln-record-society.org.uk/?page_id=25 |accessdate=22 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Microdecisions, Inc. v. Skinner''''', {{law report|889|So.2d|871}} (Fla. 2d Dist. App. 2004), was a case before the [[Florida Second District Court of Appeal]] concerning whether Abe Skinner, the [[Collier County, Florida]] Property Appraiser could require prospective commercial users of the official GIS records created in his office to first enter into a licensing agreement. The court concluded that he may not.&lt;ref name="appeals_opinion_p2"&gt;{{cite court | litigants= Microdecisions, Inc. v.

In the decision, the court held that "Skinner has no authority to assert copyright protection in the GIS maps, which are public records."&lt;ref name="appeals_opinion_p6"&gt;{{cite court | litigants= Microdecisions, Inc. v.

This was a Florida District Court of Appeal decision, but the Florida Supreme Court declined to hear the case and ordered the Skinner (as Collier County Property Appraiser) to pay Microdecisions' attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/clerk/dispositions/2005/4/05-255.pdf here][http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Microdecisions_v._Skinner_SCOTFL_RULING.djvu Commons DjVu-format copy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Supreme Court]] affirmed the lower Court's ruling when it refused to hear the case by denying certiorari review.&lt;ref&gt;see [{{SCOTUS URL|orders/courtorders/112805pzor.pdf}} here], under "Certiorari Denied"&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was cited as providing the main reasoning for the decision in ''[[County of Santa Clara v. California First Amendment Coalition]]'' by the 4th District of the [[California Courts of Appeal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Political rehabilitation''' is the process by which a member of a political organization or government who has fallen into disgrace is restored to public life. The term is usually applied to leaders or other prominent individuals who regain their prominence after a period in which they have no influence or standing. Historically, the concept is usually associated with [[Communist state]]s and [[Communist party|parties]] where, as a result of shifting political lines often as part of a power struggle, leading members of the Communist Party find themselves on the losing side of a political conflict and out of favour, often to the point of being denounced or even imprisoned. 

These individuals may be rehabilitated either as a result of capitulating to the dominant political line and renouncing their former beliefs or allegiances to disgraced leaders, or they may be rehabilitated as a result of a change in the political leadership of the party, either a change in personnel or a change in political line, so that the views or associations which caused the individual, or group of individuals, to fall into disgrace are viewed more sympathetically.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} 

Well known figures who have been rehabilitated include [[Deng Xiaoping]] who fell into disgrace during the [[Cultural Revolution]] for being a "third roader" but was rehabilitated subsequently and became [[paramount leader]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]; and [[Russia]]'s last [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]], [[Nicholas II]], and [[Russian Imperial Family|his family]], who were all shot dead by Bolshevik revolutionaries in July, 1918, but were rehabilitated by the [[Russian Supreme Court]] on 1 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

==China==
Rehabilitation ({{zh|c=平反|p=píngfǎn}}) was carried out at many stages in the [[History of the People's Republic of China]], but most significantly after the [[3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] that marked the [[Chinese economic reform]]s of [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Rehabilitation committees ({{lang|zh|平反委员会}} ''Píngfǎn Wěiyuánhuì'') considered appeals from both the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] as well as from [[Petitioning (China)|petitions]]&amp;mdash;often in the form of [[big-character poster]]s&amp;mdash;by ordinary citizens. Reformer [[Hu Yaobang]] led a series of rehabilitations from 1978 to 1981 of people persecuted by the [[Gang of Four]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966&amp;ndash;1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of Memory and Reconciliation in East Asia|editor1-first=Mikyoung|editor1-last=Kim|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|first=Bin|last=Xu|chapter=Memory and reconciliation|pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
{{main|Rehabilitation (Soviet)}}
In the context of the former [[Soviet Union]], and the [[Post-Soviet states]], rehabilitation ({{lang-ru|реабилитация}}, [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] in [[English language|English]] as ''reabilitatsiya'' or [[Scientific transliteration of Cyrillic|academically]] rendered as ''reabilitacija'') was the restoration of a person who was criminally prosecuted without due basis, to the state of [[acquittal]]. 

Mass [[amnesty]] of the victims of Soviet repressions started after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Initially, in 1953, this did not entail any form of exoneration. This release became coupled with rehabilitations after [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s denunciation of [[Stalinism]] in his 1956 speech ''[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]]''. Several entire nationality groups that had been deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia during [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfer]] were rehabilitated in the late 1950s.  

Both the modern [[Russian Federation]] and [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://zakon.nau.ua/eng/doc/?uid=3019.39.0 ''Law of Ukraine on "Rehabilitiona of victims of political repressions in Ukraine"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728122403/http://zakon.nau.ua/eng/doc/?uid=3019.39.0 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have enacted laws "On the Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repressions", which provide the basis for the continued post-Stalinist rehabilitation of victims.

'''''HM Advocate v Ross''''' was a 1991 [[Scots criminal law]] case decided by the [[High Court of Justiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;1991 SLT 564, 1991 JC 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant had been charged with violently attacking others in a [[public house]], but was allowed to go free on the premise that he was in a state of non-self-induced [[automatic behavior|automatism]]. Others in the bar had slipped [[LSD]] and other drugs into his [[beer]] without him knowing, and there was only a small amount of alcohol he had been drinking so he was not responsible for his intoxication which led to the violent actions.

This case set a key precedent in Scots law for automatism, namely that since this case, if someone has been under the effect of drugs that they themselves did not voluntarily know they were taking or were under the influence of and commit a violent act, it may be a defence for them in court if they can prove or give evidence that their intoxication was not self-induced.

Later cases suggested that the Scottish precedent established in ''Ross'' would be followed in England as well.&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Simester, A. T. H. Smith, ''Harm and Culpability'' (1996), p. 140, n. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4216">An online '''shopping directory''' is a "Yellow Pages-Style" [[web directory]] that specializes in [[ecommerce]] sites (which are websites that sell products or services).  Inspired by the organizational structure used in traditional [[shopping mall]] directories, online shopping directories organize ecommerce sites by their category and subcategory of goods sold.  Without the constraints related to shopping at a physical mall (e.g. distance,  location, hours of operation, access to transportation), an online shopping directory serves to aggregate all ecommerce sites in one centralized location in order to help a user decide where to shop online.

==Variations==
A shopping directory is different from a [[comparison shopping website]] (which is also referred to as a comparison shopping engine or a price comparison shopping site).  While comparison shopping websites present product listings, by category, so a user can compare pricing on same and/or similar products, a shopping directory does not provide product comparison, review or sale.  Examples of comparison shopping websites include: [[Google Shopping]], [[Shopping.com]], [[Shopzilla]], [[TheFind.com]]

A shopping directory is different from an [[online marketplace]].  Marketplaces sell products and/or services that are aggregated from various ecommerce sellers but sold under the branding and infrastructure of the named marketplace itself.  Examples of online marketplaces include: [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Etsy]] and [[Ebay]].

A specialized form of a shopping directory is a [[coupon]], daily deal and/or promotional savings site.  Coupon sites provide a niche web directory centered on deal aggregation by listing only ecommerce sites that offer additional savings to the user.  Coupon sites are very popular with users but often are viewed negatively by merchants.&lt;ref name="cworldAMZN"&gt;David Streitfeld, Oct 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/business/deal-sites-have-fading-allure-for-merchants.html?_r=0], ''NYTimes'', retrieved on 8.April, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of coupon sites include: [[Retailmenot]], [[Coupons.com]], [[Groupon]]

==History==
Free directories such as the [[Open Directory Project]], often updated by volunteers, lost their prominence and relevancy in today's search-driven internet.  Before the increased popularity of the [[Google]] search engine, shopping directories, such as that found at the [[Yahoo! Directory]] or the [[Paypal]] Shopping Directory, played a prominent role in users' online shopping habits and behavior.  As Google gained dominance, users adapted their shopping search behavior to the new system.  Most search engines took over the role traditionally filled by shopping directories.

Recently, criticisms have emerged over the limits of using search engines such as [[Google]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] for use in the ecommerce cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?src=busln|title=NYTimes "The Dirty Little Secrets of Search"| accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominance of the [[SEO]] structure in search makes competition fierce among merchants as they struggle for positioning on the Google search results pages.

New methodologies for shopping directories are emerging as startups look to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizreport.com/2014/03/how-search-technology-can-enhance-the-user-experience.html|title=BizReport "How search technology can enhance the user experience."|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As ecommerce continues to grow, startup companies are reinvisioning the shopping directory to make it more relevant to the growing needs of online shoppers.

==Business model==
* Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site
* Use of [[affiliate marketing|affiliate programs]] of the listed ecommerce sites to earn commissions on referrals
* Advertising in the directory itself, such as [[banner ads]], [[contextual advertising|contextual ads]] like [[Google AdSense]] or some form of sponsored listings (usually [[pay per click]] based)
* Combination of above

'''YP Texas Region Yellow Pages LLC''' is a division of [[YP Holdings]] that publishes telephone directories to [[Southwestern Bell]] customers for [[AT&amp;T]].

The company was originally formed in 1984 as '''Southwestern Bell Media, Inc.''' Its products included the Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages and the Silver Pages, a telephone directory specifically compiled with listings of businesses that were focused on senior citizens.

In 1991, Southwestern Bell Media relocated its corporate domicile to Missouri and became '''Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages, Inc.''' Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages also began marketing its yellow pages directory under the "SWBYP'S" name, shorthand for '''S'''outh'''w'''estern '''B'''ell '''Y'''ellow '''P'''age'''s'''. Telephone numbers to the company also were cleverly named; if customers sought to order more telephone books, they called 1-800-SWB-BOOK; for the advertising side, 1-800-4SWBYPS.

In 1995, Southwestern Bell Corporation changed its name to [[SBC Communications]]. The Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages division was reorganized, with '''Southwestern Bell Advertising, L.P.''' and '''Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages Resources, Inc.''' being formed. Southwestern Bell Advertising compiled directory listings, while Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages was a sales agent for directory advertising.

In 1997, SBC began acquiring other telephone companies, including [[Pacific Telesis]], [[Ameritech]], and [[Southern New England Telecommunications|SNET]]. It began including the "SBC" branding with the names of its operating companies. The SWBYP'S nickname went by the wayside, in favor of simply Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages. The last year SWBYP'S were branded Southwestern Bell came in 2001, when "SBC" was added to the company names SBC owned, and SWBYP'S became known as '''SBC Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages'''. The Southwestern Bell branding was retired altogether in 2002 in favor of SBC's corporate standard '''SBC SMART Yellow Pages''', inherited from [[Pacific Bell Directory]].

Until 2004, telephone directories published by Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages included the following disclaimer:

:"Directory listings contained herein are transcribed by Southwestern Bell Advertising, L.P., from compilations copyright (year) by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, and may not be reproduced in whole or part, or in any form whatsoever without the consent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company."

==Spinoff==
In 2012, the company was sold to [[YP Holdings]], becoming '''YP Texas Region Yellow Pages LLC'''. The company was relocated to the state of [[Delaware]] as opposed to [[Missouri]], the historic domicile of [[Southwestern Bell]].

The "Texas Region" identifier with its corporate name refers to Southwestern Bell's headquarters in Dallas, Texas.

The '''Stair Society''' is a [[learned society]] devoted to the study of [[Scots law]]. It was instituted in 1934 "to encourage the study and to advance the knowledge of the history of Scots Law,"&lt;ref name="stairhome"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stair Society|url=http://www.stairsociety.org/home.htm|publisher=Stair Society|accessdate=20 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328014546/http://www.stairsociety.org/home.htm|archivedate=28 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is named for [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair]], the seventeenth century [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] considered the most important of Scots Law's [[Scots law#The Institutional Writers|Institutional Writers]]. It is comparable to the [[Selden Society]], an organisation devoted to the study of English legal history.

==Society==
The Society has around four hundred and fifty members from Scotland and around the world.&lt;ref name="memb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership Details|url=http://www.stairsociety.org/memb.htm|publisher=Stair Society|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society holds an [[annual general meeting]] in November, which includes a guest lecture. Recent distinguished figures to have addressed the Society included [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], Rogers Professor at the [[University of Georgia School of Law]], and [[John H. Langbein]], [[Sterling Professor|Sterling Professor of Law and Legal History]] at [[Yale Law School]]. The Society is run by a Council, chaired by Professor John Cairns, Professor of Legal History at the [[University of Edinburgh School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor John W. Cairns|url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/johncairns_27.aspx|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh School of Law]]|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the Society is [[Angus Stewart, Lord Stewart|Lord Stewart]].

As part of its aim of furthering study Scots legal history, the Stair Society produces printed and electronic publications, specifically an annual volume along with occasional other publications. The Society's Literary Director is Mark Godfrey, Professor of Legal History at the [[University of Glasgow School of Law]].

The Society also provides a postgraduate scholarship to support someone undertaking doctoral research (i.e. leading to degrees of Ph.D. or D.Phil.) in the area of Scots legal history. The scholarship has had one successful graduate so far but is currently suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postgraduate scholarship|url=http://www.stairsociety.org/scholarship.htm|publisher=Stair Society|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viscount Stair==
[[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair]], generally known as Viscount Stair, was an important political figure in seventeenth century Scotland and served as [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] from 1671 to 1681 and 1689 to 1695. The first edition of his "''Institutions of the Law of Scotland''", an account of the [[private law]] of Scotland according to the judgements of the [[Court of Session]], was published in 1681, and the work is now considered the foundation of modern Scots law.

'''''Supreme Diamonds (Pty) Ltd v Du Bois; Regent Neckwear Manufacturing Co. (Pty) Ltd v Ehrke''''' (1979 (3) SA 444 (W)) is an important case in [[South African law]], heard and decided in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Goldstone AJ in 1979, on March 13 and 14 respectively. The case concerned applications for default judgments. The plaintiffs were represented by HS Danilowitz of Feinsteins.

== Facts ==
In two actions, the plaintiffs claimed default judgment, in terms of Rule of Court 31(2)(a), for (in the first case) the return of certain diamonds wrongfully alienated by the defendant or their value, and (in the second) the return of certain shirts, such claim being for specific performance, or their value.

== Judgment ==
Goldstone AJ found that the plaintiffs were clearly entitled to default judgment for the return of the diamonds and the shirts.

As to the alternative claims for their value, he held, as to the first case, that the alternative claim was a delictual claim for damages and was not a liquidated demand for the purposes of Rule of Court 31(2)(a). Accordingly, he found that the plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment on the alternative claim unless evidence was led to establish the value of the diamonds on the date of the alleged delict: that is, when the diamonds were wrongfully disposed of or alienated.

As to the second case, Goldstone AJ found that the alternative claim appeared to be one for damages as an alternative to specific performance. The value of the goods had to be determined at the date of judgment: Such claim could not be for a liquidated demand. He held, accordingly, that it was also necessary for the plaintiff to lead evidence to establish the value of the shirts at the date of judgment in order to be entitled to default judgment for the amount of the alternative claim.

{{Wiktionary|TTFN}}
'''TTFN''' is an [[initialism]] for a [[colloquial]] [[valediction]], "'''ta ta for now'''", based on "[[wikt:ta ta|ta ta]]", an informal "goodbye". The expression came to prominence, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Used by the [[military]], it was frequently heard by the British public.

"Ta-ta for now" was brought into popular use in the UK in 1940 in the weekly radio comedy ''[[It's That Man Again]]'' by the character Mrs. Mopp, who ended every scene with it.&lt;ref name="cryer"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cryer | first1 = Max. |authorlink= Max Cryer | title = Who said that first? : The Curious Origins of Common Words and Phrases | year = 2010 | publisher = Exisle Pub. | location = Auckland, N.Z. | isbn = 978-0-908988-91-4 | pages = 281–282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fergusson1994&gt;{{citation |year=1994 |author=Ferguson, Rosalind |chapter=Origin of TTFN |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eiCbrmVx6QC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22TTFN%22+ITMA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y3ddTt6OJdDhrAf4-LjGDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22TTFN%22%20ITMA&amp;f=false |page=125 |editor=|title=Shorter Dictionary of Catch Phrases |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eiCbrmVx6QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shorter+dictionary+catch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=63hdTpevNIjwrQeN8dWXDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |place=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-10051-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Street |first=Seán |title= A Concise History of British Radio, 1922-2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7jo0IcUZeoC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;ots=4lNhoilguB&amp;dq=ttfn&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=ttfn&amp;f=false | publisher = Kelly Publications |year= 2002 |isbn= 9781903053140 |pages= 74–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|ta-ta|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the second series, the show's name was shortened to ''ITMA'', to satirize the abundance of abbreviations that were becoming common knowledge due to the ongoing war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daniels|first=Morgan|title=The Effects Of ‘Antiestablishment’ BBC Comedy On Politicians, The Public And Broadcasting Values C.1939-73|date=September 2011|url=https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/bitstream/123456789/2415/1/DANIELSEffectsOf2011.doc|location=University of London|format=doc|quote=The new, abbreviated title, for example, was a nod to the flurry of acronymous (and anonymous) bodies disseminating orders at will.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1966 ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television episode "Better Luck Next Time", [[Catwoman]] (played by the actress [[Julie Newmar]]) states "TTFN" in a microphone to Batman ([[Adam West]]) while he is high upon a wall while being stalked by her tiger, Tinkerbell, and then she has to further explain the meaning of the acronym to the puzzled Batman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519460/quotes Memorable quotes for] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', "Better Luck Next Time" (1966) on [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the phrase does not appear in the original books by [[A. A. Milne]].

[[Tim Horton]], the deceased professional hockey player and founder of the Tim Horton's Doughnut chain, has "TTFN" on his grave stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=10450&amp;PIpi=769366 Tim Horton on Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ta ta for now" caught on with the British public so much that it was often uttered by dying people as their last words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7676195.stm "How radio comedy changed a nation"] ''[[BBC News]] Magazine'', 17 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the catchphrase of radio personalities such as [[Jimmy Young (disc jockey)|Jimmy Young]], who modified it to BFN: "Bye for now".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = In Depth – Newsmakers – Jimmy Young: Too old? | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1634802.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 2 November 2001 | accessdate = 16 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TTFN is still used in online chat such as [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and [[MUD]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slang.uoregon.edu/pub_search.lasso?RecordIDNumber=11396&amp;Process=detail01 "ttfn" in The Interactive Linguistics Databases Project for Lower-division Instruction and Student Research], University of Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg2911.txt talk mode] in the [[Jargon File]] v.2.9.11, 1 January 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text Annotation''' is the practice and the result of adding a note or [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and [[Collaborative editing|editing]], commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text.&lt;ref name= "Shabjee and Reynolds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabajee|first=P. and D. Reynolds|title=What is Annotation? A Short Review of Annotation and Annotation Systems|url=http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/publications/researchreport/rr1053/report_html?ilrtyear=2003|work=ILRT Research Report No. 1053|publisher=Institute for Learning &amp; Research Technology|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Text annotations are sometimes referred to as [[marginalia]], though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.

This article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also [[Web annotation]].

== History ==

Text annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in [[Talmud#Commentaries|Talmudic commentaries]] and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe,|first=Joanna|author2=Christine M. Neuwirth |title=From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|year=2001|volume=15|issue=33|pages=333–370|doi=10.1177/105065190101500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[printing press]] and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or [[Footnotes|textual footnotes or endnotes]] rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Computer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, [[learning]], social [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[editing]], and other practices.  Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and [[Computer data storage|storage]] that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds"/&gt;

== Functions and Applications ==

Text annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article "From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation," scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks," which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers," which involves sharing of annotations; (3)"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators," which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages," for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function.&lt;ref name = "Wolfe and Neuwirth"/&gt; Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, [[motivation]], and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support [[memory]] and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Catherine|title=Reading and Writing the Electronic Book|journal=Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=UNC Chapel Hill|pages=38–51|url=http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009|doi=10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational applications ===

Educational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and [[communication]]. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Other areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for [[collaborative learning]], both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products.&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Effects"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Effects of Annotations on Student Readers and Writers|journal=Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries|year=2000|pages=19–26|doi=10.1145/336597.336620|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336620|isbn=158113231X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of [[critical reading]] and stance-taking necessary for effective [[Argumentation|argumentative writing]].&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib" /&gt;

While shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, "since the 1920s, [[literacy]] theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy."&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders /&gt;  Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Nancy|author2=Yoram Chisik |title=In the Company of Readers: The Digital Library Book as "Practiced Place"|journal=Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries|year=2005|pages=235–243|doi=10.1145/1065385.1065439|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1065439|isbn=1581138768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.&lt;ref name=GunaTanKauferEncouragingReadingandCollaboration&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=Ananda|author2=Aaron Tan |author3=David Kaufer |title=Encouraging Reading and Collaboration Using Classroom Salon|journal=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education|year=2010|pages=254–258|doi=10.1145/1822090.1822162|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822162&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=90744943&amp;CFTOKEN=38262707|isbn=9781605587295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, [[critical thinking]], and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall et all Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool"&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple Perspectives on Problem Solving and Learning in the Digital Age.|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=313–323|author=Mendenhall, A. |author2=C. Kim |author3=T.E. Johson|editor=D. Ifenthaler |editor2=P. Isaias |editor3=J.M. Spector |editor4=K. D.G. Sampson|chapter=Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool in a College English Course.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them [[English studies|English]], [[sport psychology]], and [[hypermedia]]. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, [[metacognition]], and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.&lt;ref name="Novak et al Educaitonal Uses of Social Annotation Tools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novak|first=Elena |author2=Rim Razzouk |author3=Tristan E. Johnson|title=The Educational Uses of Social Annotation Tools in Higher Education: A Literature Review|journal=Internet and Higher Education|year=2012|volume=15|pages=39–49|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ947876&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ947876|doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing and text-centered collaboration ===

Text annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called "queries").&lt;ref name=Einsohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Einsohn|first=Emily|title=The Copyeditor's Handbook|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_copyeditor_s_handbook.html?id=qv1p2RYbpY0C|isbn=9780520218352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks.&lt;ref name="Weng and Gennari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weng|first=Chuhnua|author2=John H. Gennari |title=Asynchronous Collaborative Writing Through Annotations|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work '04|year=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=578–581|doi=10.1145/1031607.1031705|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031607.1031705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Much research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of [[computer-supported cooperative work]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez and Eklundh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Henry|author2=Kerstin Severinson Eklundh |title=Visualizing Patterns of Annotation in Document-Centered Collaboration on the Web|journal=Studies in Writing: Vol. 17 Writing and Digital Media|year=2005|pages=131–143|editor1-first=L. |editor1-last=Van Waes |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Leijten |editor3-first=C. |editor3-last=Neuwirth |others=G. Rijlaardsdam (Series Ed.)|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and Design ==

Research in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.

===Annotation structure===
The structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a ''body'', an ''anchor'', and a ''marker''. The body of an annotation includes reader-generated [[symbols]] and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook /&gt;

===Annotation display types===
IT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:
* Footnote interfaces that display annotations below the corresponding text
* Aligned annotations that display comments and notes vertically in the text margins, sometimes in multiple columns or as a "sidebar" layer
* Interlinear annotations that attach annotations directly into a text
* Sticky note interfaces, where annotations appear in popup dialogs over the source text
* Voice annotations, in which reviewers record annotations and embed them within a document
* Pen or digital-ink based interfaces that allow writing directly on a document or screen
Annotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe Annotation Technologies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotation Technologies: A software and Research Review|journal=Computers and Composition|year=2002|volume=19|issue=4|pages=471–497|doi=10.1016/s8755-4615(02)00144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as ''anchored discussion''.&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotations and the Collaborative Digital Library: Effects of an Aligned Annotion Interface on Student Argumentation and Reading Strategies|journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|date=Jun 2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=141–164|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ851577&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ851577|doi=10.1007/s11412-008-9040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IT-based text annotation systems ==

IT-based annotation systems include [[Computer software|standalone]] and [[Client-server model|client-server systems]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of [[Library|libraries]], [[patent office]]s, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of annotation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine C.: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263806 Annotation: from paper books to the digital library], Proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries '97 Conference, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto]] and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;Virbel, Jacques, Reading and managing texts on the Bibliothèque de France station, The digital word: text-based computing in the humanities book contents, MIT Press 1993, Cambridge, USA, pp 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).

Annotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as [[OpenOffice.org]]/[[LibreOffice]] Writer and [[Microsoft Word]]. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as [[Adobe Acrobat]], which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds" /&gt;

=== Web-based text annotation systems ===
{{main|Web annotation}}
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] had already implemented the concept&lt;ref name="boulton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archaeology.org/the-nexus-browser/|title=The Nexus Browser|last=Boulton|first=Jim|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of directly editing web documents in 1990 in [[WorldWideWeb]], the first web browser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=21 September 2014|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|year=1993–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability.&lt;ref name="boulton"/&gt; An early version of [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]] in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability,&lt;ref name="mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkdroid.org/tmp/www-talk/1192.html|title=Group Annotation Server Guinea Pigs?|last=Andreessen|first=Marc|date=31 May 1993|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was quickly removed.  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, [[WebDAV]], was then reintroduced as an extension.

A different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document.  This approach was pioneered by [[Stet (software)|Stet]], the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]]. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The [[co-ment]] system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using [[Django (web framework)|Django]]/[[Python (programming language)|Python]] on the server side and various [[AJAX]] libraries such as [[JQuery]] on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU [[Affero General Public License]].

Since 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbin|first=Kenneth|title=IRS Determination Letter|url=https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/11/03162019/Hypothes.is-501.c3-IRS-Determination-Letter-2013-06-29.pdf|publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has offered the free, open web annotation service [[Hypothes.is]]. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a [[Learning management system|LMS]] or [[Content management system|CMS]]. Both [[Web annotation|webpages]] and [[Portable Document Format#Annotation|PDFs]] can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, [http://www.hylighter.com/hybar/site/index.html HyLighter] supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] tasks as [[Named-entity recognition]], relationship extraction or [[Canonicalization|normalization]]. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via [[supervised learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cejuela|first=Juan Miguel|title=tagtog, interactive and text-mining-assisted annotation of gene mentions in PLOS full-text articles|pmc=3978375|publisher=[[Database (journal)|Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation]]|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal [[PLoS ONE]], published by the [[Public Library of Science]], has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.

'''The Cabildo''' was the seat of Spanish colonial city hall of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and is now the Louisiana State Museum Cabildo. It is located along [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]], adjacent to [[St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans)|St. Louis Cathedral]].

== History ==
The original Cabildo was destroyed in the [[Great New Orleans Fire (1788)]]. The Cabildo was rebuilt between 1795–99 as the home of the [[Spain|Spanish]] municipal government in New Orleans, in 1821 Spanish coat of arms removed from the façade pediment and replaced with the extant American eagle with cannonballs by the Italian sculptor Pietro Cardelli and the third floor with [[mansard roof]] was later added in 1994 after a fire, in French style. The building took its name from the governing body who met there—the "Illustrious [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]]," or city council. The Cabildo was the site of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] transfer ceremonies late in 1803, and continued to be used by the New Orleans city council until the mid-1850s.

The building's main hall, the '''Sala Capitular''' ("Meeting Room"), was originally utilized as a [[courtroom]]. [[Louisiana (New Spain)|The Spanish]] used the courtroom from 1799 to 1803, and from 1803 to 1812 it was used by the [[Territory of Orleans|Louisiana territorial]] superior court. During the years between 1868 and 1910, the Cabildo was the seat of the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasc.org/Bicentennial/lasc_history.aspx History of the Louisiana Supreme Court], retrieved on 16 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sala Capitular was the site of several landmark court cases, including ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.

In 1895 the building was in a state of decay and proposed for demolition; artist [[William Woodward (artist)|William Woodward]] led a successful campaign to have the historic building preserved and restored. In 1911 (the state's highest court having vacated), the Cabildo became the home of the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. The museum displays exhibits about the history of Louisiana from its settlement up through the [[Reconstruction Era]], and about the heritage of the ethnic groups who have lived in the state.

[[File:FQDecaturCathedralFlagGray.jpg|thumb|left|The '''Cabildo''' is left of [[St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans)|St. Louis Cathedral]] at [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]].]]
It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="nhlsum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;Patricia Heintzelman (June 30, 1975) {{NHLS url|id=66000373 |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: The Cabildo}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000373|title=Accompanying 2 photos, exterior, from 1968.|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabildo was extensively damaged by a fire on May 11, 1988, which destroyed the cupola and the entire third floor,&lt;ref name=JScab&gt;"Louisiana State Museum" (history), Joseph F. Meany Jr., Karen W. Engelke, ''The Journal of American History'', Vol. 83, No. 3 (Dec. 1996), pages 946–952, webpage: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2945646 JSTOR-Cabildo].&lt;/ref&gt; but it was restored and reopened to the public in 1994.&lt;ref name=JScab /&gt;

In 2005, the Cabildo survived [[Hurricane Katrina]], the eye of which passed 30 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) east of downtown, with relatively minor damage. Days after the storm struck, the [[Louisiana State Police]] used the business offices of the Cabildo to set up what was called Troop N. From the Cabildo, state troopers patrolled the city's streets along with police agencies from [[New Mexico]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].

'''''The English and Australian Cookery Book''''' is considered to be the first Australian [[cookbook]]. Published in London in 1864, the full title of the first edition reads: ''The English and Australian Cookery Book: Cookery for the Many, as well as the [[upper ten thousand|Upper Ten Thousand]] - by an Australian [[Aristology|Aristologist]]''. The unnamed author was in fact a Tasmanian named Edward Abbott,

Abbott was the son of a Canadian-born military officer, posted from NSW to Hobart in 1815 to become deputy judge advocate. Abbott junior rose from the position of clerk in his father’s office to become a key player in the colony as wealthy grazier, coroner and parliamentarian. He lost much of his wealth, and years of his prime, to an epic legal battle with colonial authorities over a rescinded land grant. Eccentric, he is said to have been the first person to try to raise thylacine cubs, his writing suggests he was something of an early Australian nationalist. While proselytising the science, art and etiquette of fine dining — or “aristology” as he called it — he had a quick temper and at one time assaulted the premier of the day with his umbrella, apparently in a rage related to his ongoing legal wrangle with the government. Shortly before his death in 1869, Abbott sent his will to son Frederick, one of his four children, along with an apology of sorts. “I leave but little, I tried to speculate in wheat, flour and oats — but failed owing to the rascality of commission agents,” he explained.  However Abbott did manage to leave the legacy of his cookbook - it is much more than a collection of recipes. Within its green and gold cover, illustrated with a stylised globe depicting the opposite nature of the seasons between hemispheres, are near 300 pages crammed with wit and wisdom, as well as wickedly good recipes.

In 1970, a selection of material from Abbott's original version was republished under the title '''''The Colonial Cook Book: the Recipes of a By-gone Australia''''', edited by Alison Burt. Although now out of print, this abridged edition may be found in specialist second-hand booksellers or in larger institutional libraries in Australia.

In his gastronomic history of Australia, Michael Symons often refers to Abbott's cookery book, devoting a chapter to its contents.  He viewed it as a positive first step in the emerging [[Australian cuisine|Australian culinary tradition]] and  lamented that the book did not have more than one edition.

An exact facsimile was published in Tasmania in 2014 to mark the sesquicentenary (150 years) of Abbott's original publication.  This slipcased edition includes a Companion Volume in contrasting gilt foil cover with authoritative essays by Professor Barbara Santich, Food Studies, Adelaide University (''Bold Palates''); seminal Australian culinary history author Michael Symons (''One Continuous Picnic'') and the world authority on Edward Abbott, Tony Marshall - as well as interpretive recipes by Sally Wise (''A Year in a Bottle'') and cocktails by historian Sebastian Reaburn.

While many reference Abbott's cookery book as the first Australian cookbook, few until now have analysed its contents in detail.

The '''Treaty of Fifth Avenue''' refers to the agreement reached between US Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] and New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in July 1960.

Although Rockefeller had little influence over the Republican Party's conservative wing, he was the de facto leader of the liberal Republicans. Nixon felt he needed the support of Rockefeller to secure the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination. Nixon feared that Rockefeller, who had recently written an indictment of the Republican Party, would refuse to support him unless the party platform was changed. Nixon and Rockefeller met at Rockefeller's Fifth Avenue apartment in New York City where, over the course of four hours (and with other participants joining by phone) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2014/12/16-nixon-sightings-part-2-hess&lt;/ref&gt; they agreed to this fourteen-point compact of security and economic issues. The compact called for increased defense spending on U.S. nuclear capability as well as the establishment of a flexible response force to deal with armed conflicts. In addition, the document supports planks to the party platform that stimulate economic growth, "remove the last vestiges of segregation or discrimination," and provide government funding for education. While the compromise might not have profoundly changed the party's platform, it strained Nixon's relations with the party's conservative members who disagreed with Rockefeller's more liberal views (See [[Rockefeller Republicans]]).

==First-hand Account==
From Steven Hess, who worked with Richard Nixon:

"The platform committee met at the Blackstone Hotel, Chicago, a week before the convention convened. On July 22, 10:30 pm, we are gathered in the suite of Charles Percy, the committee chairman, waiting for the final draft to be typed so that the committee can give its approval in the morning. The phone rings and from Percy's response this is no ordinary call. Nixon has flown secretly to New York to meet with arch foe Nelson Rockefeller in his Fifth Avenue apartment. They are now telling Percy what they wish to have in the platform. There are three phone connections in the suite: Percy is on one; Rod Perkins, Rockefeller's representative is on the second; I am one of the people rotating on the third. The call lasts nearly four hours, except for when the hotel switchboard operator pulls the plugs at midnight and goes home, causing a 15 minute interruption. This is "The Compact of Fifth Avenue," so named by headline writers.  The committee's reaction is explosive: We will not be dictated to, and especially not by Rockefeller. Their revolt lasts 36 hours. Eisenhower is furious over new wording in the defense plank, which we quietly delete.  Nixon rushes to Chicago to calm the delegates, also raising questions about his political smarts." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2014/12/16-nixon-sightings-part-2-hess "Nixon Sightings, Pt.

==Statement by Governor Rockefeller==

The Vice President and I met today at my home in New York City.

The meeting took place at the Vice President's request.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the platform of the Republican party. During the course of the meeting we discussed our views with Chairman Percy and other members of the platform committee by telephone.

The Vice President and I reached agreement on the following specific and basic positions on foreign policy and national defense:

1. The growing vigor and aggressiveness of communism demands new and profound effort and action in all areas of American Life.

2. The vital need of our foreign policy is new political creativity—leading and inspiring the formation, in all great regions of the free world, of confederations, large enough and strong enough to meet modern problems and challenges. We should promptly lead toward the formation of such confederations in the North Atlantic community and in the Western Hemisphere.

3. In the field of disarmament we shall
:a. Intensify the quest for better detection methods;
:b. Discontinue nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere;
:c. Discontinue other tests as detection methods make possible, and,
:d. Resume immediately underground nuclear testing for purposes of improving methods of detection.
4. In national defense, the swiftness of the technological revolution—and the warning signs of Soviet aggressiveness—makes clear that new efforts are necessary, for the facts of our survival in the Nineteen Fifties give no assurance of such survival, in the same military posture, in the Nineteen Sixties.

5. The two imperatives of national security in the Nineteen Sixties are:
:a. A powerful second—strike capacity—a nuclear retaliatory power capable of surviving surprise attack to inflict devastating punishment on any aggressor, and,
:b. A modern, flexible and balanced military establishment with forces capable of deterring or meeting any local aggression.
:c. These imperatives require: More and improved bombers, airborne alert, speeded production of missiles and Polaris submarines, accelerated dispersal and hardening of bases, full modernization of the equipment of our ground forces, and an intensified program for civil defense.

6. The United States can afford and must provide the increased expenditures to implement fully this necessary program for strengthening our defense posture. There must be no price ceiling on America's security.

The Vice President and I also reached agreement on the following specific positions on domestic affairs:

1. Our government must be reorganized—especially in supporting the President in the crucial decision-making process—to cope effectively with modern problems and challenges. Specifically, this calls for:
:a. Creation of a post to assist the President in the whole area of national security and international affairs;
:b. Creation of a post to assist in planning and management of domestic affairs, and,
:c. Reorganization of defense planning and command to achieve under the President, unified doctrine and unified direction of forces.

2. The rate of our economic growth must, as promptly as possible, be accelerated by policies and programs stimulating our free enterprise system—to allow us to meet the demands of national defense and the growing social needs and a higher standard of living for our growing population. As the Vice President pointed out in a speech in 1958, the achievement of a 5 per cent rate of growth would produce an additional $10,000,000,000 of tax reserve in 1962.

3. Our farm programs must be realistically reoriented by:
:a. Finding and encouraging ways for our low income farmers to become more productive members of our growing economy;
:b. At least doubling of the Conservation Reserve;
:c. Use of price supports at level best-fitted to specific commodity in order to widen markets, ease production controls, and help achieve equitable farm income;
:d. Faster disposal of surpluses through an expanded "Food for Peace" program and allocation of some surplus to a stock pile for civil defense.

4. Our program for civil rights must assure aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life—voting and housing, schools and jobs. It will express support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators and will commend the action of those business men who have abandoned the practice of refusing to serve food at their lunch counters to their Negro customers and will urge all others to follow their example.

5. Our program for health insurance for the aged shall provide insurance on a sound fiscal basis through a contributory system under which beneficiaries have the option of purchasing private health insurance.

6. Our program for labor, while reaffirming our efforts to support and strengthen the processes of free collective bargaining, shall provide for improved procedures for the resolution of disputes endangering the national welfare.

7. Our program for educational needs [sic] by calling for prompt and substantial grant aid for school construction primarily on the basis of financial needs, under an equalization formula, and with matching funds by the states—including these further measures for higher education: grants-in-aid for such buildings as classrooms and laboratories, an expanded loan program for dormitories, expanded student loan and graduate fellowship programs and inauguration of a program of federal scholarships for the most able undergraduates.

These constitute the basic positions for which I have been fighting.

If they are embodied in the Republican Party platform, as adopted by the convention, they will constitute a platform that I can support with pride and vigor.

==Statement by Vice President Nixon==

"Governor Rockefeller and I have been in consultation with the Platform Committee since its sessions began. By yesterday, it was apparent that there was a general agreement among members of the committee and between the Governor and myself regarding the basic philosophy to be followed as we go into the 1960 campaign.

Whatever differences that existed between Governor Rockefeller and myself were matters more of specifics than of principle. I felt it in the best interests of both our country and the Republican party at this critical time in history that it be made clear that we stood firmly together on these important issues.

Therefore, I called Governor Rockefeller and arranged a private meeting last night. The text of the statement released by the Governor defines our area of agreement and provides a guide to our thinking for the consideration of the Platform Committee."

The '''''Volkstum''''' (lit. ''folkdom'' or ''folklore'', though the meaning is wider than the common usage of [[folklore]]) is the entire utterances of a ''[[Volk]]'' or [[ethnic minority]] over its lifetime, expressing a "''Volkscharakter''" this unit had in common. It was the defining idea of the [[Völkisch movement]].

The term was coined by German nationalists in the context of Germany's "[[War of the Sixth Coalition|Freedom Wars]]", in marked and conscious opposition to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] such as universal human rights. This sense of the word is now criticised in academia, though it is still in use in the protection of [[ethnic minorities]] and is a legal standard in Austria.

==History==

===Origins===
In the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the adjective ''volkstümlich'' usually meant the cultural achievements of uneducated Germans as well as [[popular culture]]. The "''Volksdichtung''" (People's Poetry) was 'high' literature, the culture of distinction, and partly devalued the [[elite]] education and partly idealised it.  The concept was not yet tied to a certain nation, and attributed some of its characteristics to non-German culture.

[[Justus Möser]] (1720–1794), [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744–1803), [[Johann Georg Hamann]] (1730–1788) and other German [[romanticism|Romantics]] gradually increased the concept by their actions into an unspoiled, organic, person liable closed and eternal "People's character" (''Volkscharakter'') and charged against the monarchies then dominating Germany. Möser already bordered on being the "''Vater der Volkskunde''" (Father of [[European Ethnology|Ethnology]]) the ''Deutschtum'' against the [[cosmopolitanism]] of the Enlightenment and against the [[French Revolution]].

[[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] (''Deutsches Volksthum'' 1810) is considered the inventor of the noun ''Volkstum''. He translated the foreign word [[Nation]] and thus moved it into an "unerring something" in every ''Volk''. For him and for [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] (1769–1860) and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814), German ''Volkstum'' was a revolutionary source not only against the foreign domination of Napoleonic France, but also against dynasties and the church, with the word Enlightenment becoming less and less used.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Emmerich, ''Zur Kritik der Volkstumsideologie'', S. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  For all three thinkers, the idea of a uniform anti-Enlightenment position with an opposed Volkstum was already linked with [[Antisemitism]]. Arndt wrote in ''Der Rhein, Deutschlands Strom, aber nicht Deutschlands Grenze'' 1813: {{cquote|Cursed just by humanity and cosmopolitanism, making her prahlet! Right across the world those Jews sense that they must praise us as the highest summits of human formation!}}

He strictly rejected [[Jewish emancipation]], whilst seeing it as every man's natural right and goal, and in particular of the German people to the whole human race was living. He then summarised the concept as exclusive to those on the inside, not as being outside and expansive.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Wolfgang Emmerich, ''Zur Kritik der Volkstumsideologie'', S. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Empire===
The founding of the [[German Reich]] in 1871, as a "''[[Kleindeutsche Lösung]]''" under Prussian domination, only fulfilled part of the German nationalists' objectives, wishing and struggling as they did for the unification of all German speakers in a single [[nation state]].

The more ''Volkstum'' concept was now part of a nationalist ideology and political propaganda. It  often served as a patriotic or visionary binding-agent to cover over or overcome the real contradictions inside and outside the German empire: for example, by providing a "''Volkstumskampf''", it summoned a corporate-agrarian ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' or ideal community as the key features of ''Volkstum'', though these did not actually exist. It was the term of choice for every figure wishing to turn to an irrational feeling and definition of unity, against both enemies inside and outside the ''Reich''.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Emmerich, ''Zur Kritik der Volkstumsideologie'', S. 98 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Brothers Grimm]] had not yet distinguished between ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) and ''Gesellschaft'' (society), Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936) noted in his 1887 work ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'' that the two were mutually exclusive - he defined "community" as a form of mutual affirmation of the people in themselves as in their resources, their respective communities (such as their family) but as an understood purpose - as opposed to its mutual form as "society" in which the individual himself was a purpose, with a 'community' (e.g. a corporation) watching over his means. 'Community' would in his terms be felt by children as "the permanent and genuine" against the "temporary and apparent cohabitation" of 'society'. This was directed against the Marxism of social democracy, whose "scientific" reasoned ideal of the classless society was felt by Tönnies to be unworkable. He was very sceptical about a concept such as "''Volksgemeinschaft''"  - in the political sphere, he held that the ancient ''[[polis]]'', or the medieval Hanseatic city as its most pronounced form, little more than which could be expected by modern people.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Tönnies, ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', 8. Aufl., Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft [1887] 2006, such as Geist der Neuzeit, Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, [1935] 1998, in: TG, Bd. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underscored by the context of [[Wilhelm II of Prussia|Wilhelmine]] [[militarism]] and [[imperialism]] on the eve of the [[First World War]], however, [[Heinrich Claß]] (chairman of the [[Alldeutscher Verband]]) in contrast defined Volkstum as national assertiveness and "Menschlichkeit" (humanity): {{Cquote|This so-called 'humanity' may apply again if we are politically, morally, medically and culturally reformed, and then they will always find their [only] limits will be the bill for which each victim will be bought for the health of the Volk.}}

He also took the "German disease" to be the German Jewish minority, who for him embodied all the moral values and ethnic roots of "corrosive" [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Emmerich, ''Zur Kritik der Volkstumsideologie'', S. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war the "''Deutsche Volkstum''" and "''Deutschtum''", particularly in universities, again became popular, in the sense of [[chauvinism]]. In "''Deutschen Reden in schwerer Zeit''" (German Speeches in a black time), 35 Berlin professors spoke out against much [[degeneration]] and foreigners, calling the World War a "''Reinigungsbad''" and the "fountain cellar of a new culture". Gustav Röthen, for example, saw it as the mass killings of the "sacred flame, faithful to the world-historical mission of the German people against barbarism and sub-culture".

===Weimar Republic===
&lt;!---
Nach der Kriegsniederlage und der mit blutigem [[Bürgerkrieg]] beendeten [[Novemberrevolution]] gewann der Volkstumsbegriff den Charakter einer [[Utopie]], die die Sehnsucht nach einer vermeintlichen ursprünglichen, nun zerstörten Einheit ausdrückte. [[Paul de Lagarde]], der deutsches Volkstum bereits seit 1890 mit einer angeblichen [[Arier|arischen]] [[Rassentheorie|Rasse]] verknüpft hatte, klagte nach 1918: Das deutsche Volk, „welches wir lieben und zu sehen begehren, hat nie existiert und wird vielleicht nie existieren.“

So trauerte auch der Österreicher [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] in seinen ''Aufzeichnungen'' darüber, dass das deutsche Volkstum „seine Ganzheit und die Geisteselite ihre Nähe zum Volk ebenso endgültig verloren habe wie das [[Garten Eden|Paradies]].“

In der [[Jugendbewegung]] der 1920er Jahre fand das Volkstumsideal einen apolitischen Ausdruck unter Rückgriff auf romantische Traditionen. Das Gemeinschaftserlebnis sollte die Zerrissenheit und Differenzierung der industriellen Massengesellschaft und ihrer anonymen Staatsinstitutionen, auf die man kaum Einfluss zu haben glaubte, kompensieren.

Im entstehenden deutschen [[Faschismus]] wurde das einheitliche, die individuelle Freiheit und Selbstverwirklichung aufhebende Volkstum dann erneut zur politischen Aktionsforderung mit dem Ziel einer [[Nationale Revolution|Nationalen Revolution]]. [[Hans Freyer]] schrieb 1925 in ''Revolution von Rechts'':&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Emmerich, ''Zur Kritik der Volkstumsideologie'', S. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;„Hier wird Volk mehr als das große unmittelbare Dasein, aus dem die Bildungen der Geschichte aufsteigen, mehr als der geheimnisvolle Grund, in dem wir alle wurzeln. Hier wird Volk zu einer Auslese und zu einem kategorischen Imperativ. Es wird zur Front aller wahrhaft revolutionären Kräfte, zur Front gegen das Prinzip der industriellen Gesellschaft.“&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Er verband dies mit dem Ruf nach dem [[Führerprinzip]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;„Der Führer schafft das eine klassenlose, aber vielschichtige, herrschaftsfreie, aber streng gefügte Gebilde des Volkes. Volk sein heißt Volk werden, unter des Führers Hand.“&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Wilhelm Stapel]] erklärte die Ansicht [[Hegel]]s, wonach die Menschen ihr Volkstum allmählich zugunsten der Einigung in der gemeinsamen Menschheit überwinden müssten, in ''Antisemitismus und Antigermanismus'' 1928 für „wunderliches Fehldenken, vor welchem nur der gesichert ist, der Sinn für Wirklichkeit hat“.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Emmerich, ''Zur Kritik der Volkstumsideologie'', S. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Der [[Friedensvertrag von Versailles]] schloss deutsche Ansprüche auf durch den Krieg verlorene Gebiete zunächst aus. Doch in der ''Leipziger Stiftung für [[Volks- und Kulturbodenforschung]]'' fanden „völkische“ Nachwuchshistoriker wie [[Walter Frank]], [[Hermann Aubin]], [[Hans Rothfels]], [[Werner Conze]], [[Theodor Schieder]], der Agrar- und Bevölkerungswissenschaftler [[Theodor Oberländer]] u.a. ein Betätigungsfeld. Sie konstruierten abseits der Universitäten, wo solche Versuche kaum Interesse fanden, eine „Volksgeschichte“, die sich Fragen der ethnischen Zugehörigkeit von "Volksdeutschen" widmete und damit aktiv an der [[Vertragsrevisionismus|Revisionspolitik]] bereits der Weimarer Zeit teilnahm. Hier wurden Konzepte von „Volkstum“ mit „Volksboden“ und „[[Lebensraum]]“ verbunden, „Umsiedlungs“- und „Eindeutschungs“-Pläne entwickelt.

Seit 1929 traten dieser Forscherkreis auch offen für die „[[Nationale Revolution|Nationale Revolution]]“ und für einen Politikwechsel zur ethnischen Neuordnung Europas ein. Dabei bestimmten sie – auch auf zwei Historikertagen – weite Teile Osteuropas als Zone germanisch-deutscher Kulturausstrahlung.
---&gt;

===Third Reich===
Under [[National Socialism]] Volkstum was aggressively interpreted.  [[Adolf Hitler]], in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', put Volkstum alongside [[race (biology)|race]], "because the Volkstum, better than Race, lies not just in the speech, but in the blood."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler: ''Mein Kampf''. 1925/27: (428): ''Falsche Vorstellungen von „Germanisation“''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the "[[Machtergreifung]]", various university and non-university groups oriented towards völkisch and volkstum-politics were linked to cross-disciplinary "research communities", into which "Volk history" and "Ostforschung" were integrated, closely connected to the Nazi [[Nazi Germany|state]] and [[Nazi Party|party]].  Their specialist disciplines became programmes with more state backing and funding than ever before.  The concept of an "ethnic Volkstum" was divided into "Volksgenossen" (Volk comrades) and "Volksfeinde" (Volk enemies), so that the Volkstum concept was revised and became more strongly oriented towards racist and warlike solutions.

Above all, the Prussian archivist [[Albert Brackmann]] advocated and led the [[Gleichschaltung]] of the Nordostdeutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (Northeast German Research Foundation), which centrally directed research on East German history and controlled numerous projects on the issues of border demarcation and population policy. The young historians of [[Königsberg]] supported the "Ostpolitik" (Eastern Policy) of the NSDAP, for no academic elite had emerged within the party itself.  After 1937 the Norddeutsche and Ostdeutsche Forschungsgemeinschafts combined as a single large state-funded research organization. The impact of Volkstum historians was decisive in the use of their expertise in the Nazi ethnic policies in the conquered areas of eastern Europe from 1939 onwards.  They drafted numerous maps and statistics, serving Nazi planning as the basis of its settlement and population policy in Poland, the Baltic states, Ukraine and Belarus.

The Nazis during the war made repeated efforts to propagate Volkstum ("racial consciousness"), pamphlets were issued that enjoined all German women to avoid sexual relations with all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their blood.&lt;ref&gt;Leila J. Rupp, ''Mobilising Women for War'', p 124–5, {{ISBN|0-691-04649-2}}, {{OCLC|3379930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of "Eindeutschung" propagated and legitimated by the Volkstum historians, which made so-called German installations as ethnically and culturally, also favoured the Holocaust, even if they did not conceive it and were not directly involved in it.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times: ''Research for the "Volkstumskampf"'': Reviews of the [[Ingo Haar]] book ''Historiker im Nationalsozialismus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
After 1945 the concept was first used in its political sense in Germany as an expression of nationalist ideology and avoided by neutral words like "Bevölkerung" ([[population]]). [[Bertolt Brecht]] formulated it as: ''The Volk is not tümlich.'' In the [[Deutsche Demokratische Republik|DDR]] the term "Volk" – without "-tum" – expressed the supposed conformity of the population with the [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands|SED]] and the state in such word combinations as [[Volksdemokratie]], [[Volkspolizei]] and [[Volksarmee]]. By contrast a later opposition slogan was "[[Wir sind das Volk]]".

In Austria the concept was equally needed, but in a multi-ethnic monarchy.  Thus in the 1976 National Minorities Act the term "Volksgruppe" served approximately as a synonym for national minority, according to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of the Council of Europe.  Section 6 in the German [[Federal Expellee Law]] also used the expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bvfg/__6.html § 6 Bundesvertriebenengesetz]&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature of Switzerland explained Volkstum, at the time of ratification of the Framework Convention, as "inspired by the desire [...] to together preserve what relates to their common identity, including their culture, their traditions, their religion or their language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/0_441_1/index.html SR 0.441.1], admin.ch&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this legislation Volkstum is primarily used to mean an expression of the self-perception of a population group.  In its popular sense (close to the usual English sense of [[folklore]]), the term appears occasionally in Germany as describing regional traditions (the Volkstum of the Danube Swabians, Sorbs, Frisians, etc.).
