'''Actinobiology''' is the study of the effects of [[radiation]] upon living organisms. Actinobiology has become particularly relevant in space travel due to the abundance of cosmic radiation, which may negatively impact unprotected living organisms in space. 

Radiations are the most important physical mutagens. H.J. Muller who used X-rays for the first time to increase the rate of mutation in ''Drosophila'', opened an entirely new field in inducing mutations. So Muller is considered as the 'Father of Actinobiology'.

In 2002, Russian scientists found melanin-rich fungi growing near [[ground zero]] at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]. It was soon discovered that these fungi were using radiation as an energy source in much the same way that plants use the sun for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Chernobyl Fungus Feeds on Radiation| last=Melville| first=Kate| publisher=Science a Gogo| date=2007-05-23| accessdate=2012-05-28| url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20070422222547data_trunc_sys.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiotrophic bacterium have also been discovered deep underground, feeding on [[uranium]] emissions.

'''''All About Radiation''''' is one of the [[L. Ron Hubbard bibliography|books]] by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] that form the canonical texts of [[Scientology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothstein|first=Mikael|authorlink=Mikael Rothstein|title=The invention of sacred tradition|editor=James R. Lewis|editor2=Olav Hammer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|pages=21|chapter=Scientology, scripture and sacred tradition|isbn=978-0-521-86479-4|oclc=154706390}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is no longer promoted by the Church of Scientology nor included in their "Basics" book canon. Its first printing was from HASI ([[Hubbard Association of Scientologists International]]) by way of the Speedwell Printing Company, [[Kent, England]], 1957. Later editions were published by the [[Church of Scientology]]'s in-house publisher [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]]. It is controversial for its claims, amongst other things, that radiation poisoning and even cancer can be cured by courses of vitamins. There is no known cure for radiation poisoning and current medical practice is to provide [[palliative care]] until the symptoms subside or the patient dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Berger ME, Christensen DM, Lowry PC, Jones OW, Wiley AL |title=Medical management of radiation injuries: current approaches |journal=Occup Med (Lond) |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=162–72 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16641501 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kql011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Early printings of the book were credited on the cover as simply "By a nuclear physicist and a medical doctor", while subsequent ones credited [[L. Ron Hubbard]] as being the nuclear physicist and "Medicus" as being the doctor.

By the 1979 edition, the "medical doctor" was credited as being Richard Farley.

In the book's most recent edition, the book's authorship is attributed to Hubbard and Gene Denk and Farley R. Spink.

==Variant text==
The book has gone through a number of printings since its initial run, and has undergone a few modifications over the years, mostly to remove controversial assertions made in the original lectures. As it is a fundamental Scientology tenet that Hubbard's works are considered immutable [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Standard Tech]], not to be altered in any way, except by Hubbard himself, these changes are considered evidence to [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Freezone]] practitioners that the current Church alters the text. It is to be noted that the first part of the book is not by Hubbard and that the second part was not written by Hubbard but edited from four of his lectures given in April 1957 in London. These lectures are available since March 2005 with a transcription which makes it possible to see how the book text was edited from the lectures. The book was not reissued in June 2007 as part of the [[Golden Age of Knowledge]] program. Among the text removed from the book in later editions:

*"Alleviation of the remote effects and increased tolerance to radiation have been claimed as a result." (pg.49)
*"How is it that gamma rays go through walls but don't go through bodies?....I can fortunately tell you what is happening when a body gets hurt by atomic radiation. It RESISTS the rays! The wall doesn't resist the rays and [[Gamma ray#Health effects|the body does]]." (pg.79)
*"Scientology is the principle {{sic}} agency that is preventing and treating people for radiation at this time." (pg.110)
*"[[Dianazene]] runs out radiation – or what appears to be radiation.  It also proofs a person against radiation to some degree.  It also turns on and runs out incipient cancer.  I have seen it run out skin cancer.  A man who didn't have much liability to skin cancer (only had a few moles) took Dianazene.  His whole jaw turned into a raw mass of cancer.  He kept on taking Dianazene and it disappeared after a while.  I was looking at a case of cancer that might have happened." (pg. 123–124)

==Hubbard's qualifications==

Despite calling himself a nuclear physicist (some editions of the book even call him "one of America's first nuclear physicists" on the dustjacket), Hubbard was not a qualified physicist. His degree was from the unaccredited [[Sequoia University]], a [[diploma mill]]. The one course in nuclear physics Hubbard took was in 1931 at [[The George Washington University|George Washington University]], whose records indicate that he scored an F in the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Official Transcript of the Record of Lafayette Ronald Hubbard | publisher = George Washington University | date = April 24, 1941 | url = http://www.lermanet.com/L_Ron_Hubbard/mr142.htm | accessdate = 2006-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard dropped out of school shortly thereafter, with a 2.28 grade point average.&lt;ref name=shannon&gt;Shannon, Michael Lynn; ''[http://www.lermanet.com/shannon/ A Biography of L. Ron Hubbard]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard referred to himself as a nuclear physicist on many occasions in the 1950s, such as in the tape-recorded 1956 lecture ''A Postulate Out of a Golden Age'', where he not only claimed to be a nuclear physicist, but that he was offered (and turned down) a U.S. Government post as one. This comment has been edited out of the CD version of the lecture currently offered by the L. Ron Hubbard Classic Lectures series.

In February 1966, Hubbard defended his mail-order degree: "I was a Ph.D., Sequoia's [sic] University and therefore a perfectly valid doctor under the laws of the State of California".  But only a month later, he announced: "having reviewed the damage being done in our society with nuclear physics and psychiatry by persons calling themselves "Doctor" [I] do hereby resign in protest my university degree as a Doctor of philosophy (Ph. D.)" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/radiation.html Hysterical Radiation and Bogus Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Anderson Report==
The final results of the [[Anderson Report]] in 1965 declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Board heard evidence from a highly qualified radiologist who has made a special study of radiation and its effects. He said that Hubbard's knowledge of radiation, as displayed by his writings in ''All About Radiation'', was the 'sort of knowledge that perhaps a boy who has read Intermediate Physics might, with a lot of misapprehensions and lack of understanding, demonstrate'.... From this witness's evidence it is apparent that Hubbard is completely incompetent to deal with the subject of radiation and that his knowledge of nuclear physics is distorted, inaccurate, mistaken and negligible. No evidence was called which disputed in any way these conclusions."  &lt;ref name=anderson&gt;''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/ar07.html  Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology]'', by Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C., Published 1965 by the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amaral''' is a [[Impact crater|crater]] on the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. With its smooth floor, surrounding [[ejecta]], and small [[secondary crater]]s, it appears noticeably younger than the heavily cratered surface around it. Along with a smooth crater floor, Amaral also has a central peak. Bright material on this peak is of particular interest as it appears to have an unusual color. In color-enhanced images, the central peak of Amaral appears as a bright [[blue]] color in striking contrast to the otherwise [[Orange (colour)|orange]] tones of surface material nearby. The different color of the central peak likely indicates rocks with different [[chemical composition]] from those on the neighboring surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=286 |title=messenger.jhuapl.edu. |access-date=2009-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221725/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=286 |archive-date=2015-09-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[population genetics]], an '''ancestry-informative marker''' ('''AIM''') is a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] that exhibits substantially different frequencies between different populations. A set of many AIMs can be used to estimate the proportion of ancestry of an individual derived from each population.  

A single-nucleotide polymorphism is a modification of a single nucleotide base within a DNA sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Polymorphism (genetics)|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.535500}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 15 million SNP ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]]) sites  (out of roughly 3 billion base pairs, or about 0.4%)   from among which AIMs may potentially be selected.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Pennisi, Human Genetic Variation, ''Science'' 21 December 2007:
Vol. 318. no. 5858, pp. 1842 - 1843 {{doi|10.1126/science.318.5858.1842}} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5858/1842]&lt;/ref&gt; The SNPs that relate to ancestry are often traced to the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA because both of these areas are inherited from one parent, eradicating complexities that come with parental gene recombination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/192856584|title=Forensic biology|last=Houck|first=Max M|last2=Houck|first2=editor.), Max M|last3=(Firm)|first3=ProQuest|date=2015|publisher=Oxford, England ; San Diego, California : Academic Press|isbn=9780128007112|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNP mutations are rare, so sequences with SNPs tend to be passed down through generations rather than altered each generation. However, because any given SNP is relatively common in a population, analysts must examine groups of SNPs (otherwise known as AIMS) to determine someone’s ancestry. Using statistical methods such as apparent error rate and Improved Bayesian Estimate, the set of SNPs with the highest accuracy for predicting a specific ancestry can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampson|first=Joshua N.|last2=Kidd|first2=Kenneth K.|last3=Kidd|first3=Judith R.|last4=Zhao|first4=Hongyu|date=2011-06-14|title=Selecting SNPs to Identify Ancestry|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|language=en|volume=75|issue=4|pages=539–553|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2011.00656.x|issn=0003-4800|pmc=3141729|pmid=21668909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Examining a suite of these markers more or less evenly spaced across the genome is also a cost-effective way to discover novel genes underlying complex diseases in a technique called [[admixture mapping]] or mapping by admixture [[linkage disequilibrium]].

As one example, the [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]] Null [[allele]] (FY*0) has a frequency of almost 100% of Sub-Saharan Africans, but occurs very infrequently in populations outside of this region.  A person having this allele is thus more likely to have Sub-Saharan African ancestors. North and South [[Han Chinese]] ancestry can be distinguished unambiguously using a set of 140 AIMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.g3journal.org/content/2/3/339 | doi=10.1534/g3.112.001941| pmid=22413087| pmc=3291503| title=Ancestry Informative Marker Set for Han Chinese Population| journal=G3&amp;#58; Genes&amp;#124;Genomes&amp;#124;Genetics| volume=2| issue=3| pages=339–341| year=2012| last1=Qu| first1=Hui-Qi| last2=Li| first2=Quan| last3=Xu| first3=Shuhua| last4=McCormick| first4=Joseph B.| last5=Fisher-Hoch| first5=Susan P.| last6=Xiong| first6=Momiao| last7=Qian| first7=Ji| last8=Jin| first8=Li}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collections of AIMs have been developed that can estimate the geographical origins of ancestors from within Europe.&lt;ref name="Bauchet"&gt;Bauchet M, McEvoy B, Pearson L, Quillen E, Sarkisian T, Hovhannesyan K, Deka R, Bradley D, Shriver M. 2007. ''Measuring European population stratification with microarray genotype data. American Journal of Human Genetics'' '''80(5):''' 948-956. {{doi|10.1086/513477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery and Development ==
The discovery of ancestry-informative markers was made possible by the development of [[DNA sequencing|next generation sequencing]], or NGS. NGS enables the study of genetic markers by isolating specific [[DNA sequencing|gene sequences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davey|first=John W.|last2=Hohenlohe|first2=Paul A.|last3=Etter|first3=Paul D.|last4=Boone|first4=Jason Q.|last5=Catchen|first5=Julian M.|last6=Blaxter|first6=Mark L.|date=2011-07|title=Genome-wide genetic marker discovery and genotyping using next-generation sequencing|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3012|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=En|volume=12|issue=7|pages=499–510|doi=10.1038/nrg3012|pmid=21681211|issn=1471-0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such method for sequence extraction is the use [[Restriction enzyme|restriction enzymes]], specifically [[endonuclease]], which modifies the DNA sequence. This enzyme can be used with DNA ligase (connecting two different DNA), modifying  DNA by inserting DNA from other organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loenen|first=Wil A. M.|last2=Dryden|first2=David T. F.|last3=Raleigh|first3=Elisabeth A.|last4=Wilson|first4=Geoffrey G.|last5=Murray|first5=Noreen E.|date=2013-10-18|title=Highlights of the DNA cutters: a short history of the restriction enzymes|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/1/3/2438402|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1093/nar/gkt990|pmid=24141096|pmc=3874209|issn=1362-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method, cDNA sequencing, or [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]], can also help to acquire information of the [[Transcriptome|transcriptomes]] in a broad range of organisms and find SNPs ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]]), within a DNA sequence. 

== Applications ==
Ancestry informative markers have a number of applications in genetic research, forensics, and private industry. AIMs that indicate a predisposition for diseases such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] mellitus and [[Chronic kidney disease#Severity-based%20stages|renal disease]] have been shown to reduce the effects of [[genetic admixture]] in ancestral mapping when using admixture mapping software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keene|first=Keith L.|last2=Mychaleckyj|first2=Josyf C.|last3=Leak|first3=Tennille S.|last4=Smith|first4=Shelly G.|last5=Perlegas|first5=Peter S.|last6=Divers|first6=Jasmin|last7=Langefeld|first7=Carl D.|last8=Freedman|first8=Barry I.|last9=Bowden|first9=Donald W.|date=2008-07-25|title=Exploration of the utility of ancestry informative markers for genetic association studies of African Americans with type 2 diabetes and end stage renal disease|journal=Human Genetics|language=en|volume=124|issue=2|pages=147–154|doi=10.1007/s00439-008-0532-6|issn=0340-6717|pmc=2786006|pmid=18654799}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differential ability of ancestry-informative markers allows scientists and researchers to narrow geographical populations of concern; for example, illegal [[Organ trade|organ trafficking]] can be traced to certain areas by comparing the samples taken from organ recipients and deciphering the foreign marker in their body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=Use of ancestry-informative markers as a scientific tool to combat the illegal traffic in human kidneys|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875176815302493|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series|language=en|volume=5|pages=e302–e304|doi=10.1016/j.fsigss.2015.09.120|issn=1875-1768|last1=Severini|first1=S.|last2=Carnevali|first2=E.|last3=Margiotta|first3=G.|last4=Garcia-González|first4=M.A.|last5=Carracedo|first5=Á.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An array of private companies, such as [[23andMe]] and [[Ancestry.com|AncestryDNA]], provide cost-effective [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|direct-to-consumers (DTC)]] genetic testing by analyzing ancestry informative markers to determine geographic origins. These private companies collect massive quantities of data such as biological samples and self-reported information from consumers, a practice known as [[biobank]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ing, enabling their researchers to discover more insights on AIMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoeklé|first=Henri-Corto|last2=Mamzer-Bruneel|first2=Marie-France|last3=Vogt|first3=Guillaume|last4=Hervé|first4=Christian|date=2016-03-31|title=23andMe: a new two-sided data-banking market model|journal=BMC Medical Ethics|language=En|volume=17|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1186/s12910-016-0101-9|issn=1472-6939|pmc=4826522|pmid=27059184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though AIM panels can be useful for disease screening, the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA) prevents the use of genetic information for insurance and workplace discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/SAPonHR493.pdf|title=Statement of Administration Policy: Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (2007)|last=Slaughter|date=April 25, 2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Medical Research ==
Different ancestral traits and their affiliation to diseases can help scientists determine appropriate approaches of treatment for a specific population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Nan|last2=Li|first2=Hongzhe|last3=Criswell|first3=Lindsey A.|last4=Gregersen|first4=Peter K.|last5=Alarcon-Riquelme|first5=Marta E.|last6=Kittles|first6=Rick|last7=Shigeta|first7=Russell|last8=Silva|first8=Gabriel|last9=Patel|first9=Pragna I.|date=2005-09-29|title=Examination of ancestry and ethnic affiliation using highly informative diallelic DNA markers: application to diverse and admixed populations and implications for clinical epidemiology and forensic medicine|journal=Human Genetics|language=en|volume=118|issue=3–4|pages=382–392|doi=10.1007/s00439-005-0012-1|pmid=16193326|issn=0340-6717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical researchers have revealed the link between ancestry traits and some common diseases; for example, individuals of African descent have been found to be at higher risk of [[asthma]] than those of European ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vergara|first=Candelaria|last2=Caraballo|first2=Luis|last3=Mercado|first3=Dilia|last4=Jimenez|first4=Silvia|last5=Rojas|first5=Winston|last6=Rafaels|first6=Nicholas|last7=Hand|first7=Tracey|last8=Campbell|first8=Monica|last9=Tsai|first9=Yuhjung J.|date=2009-03-17|title=African ancestry is associated with risk of asthma and high total serum IgE in a population from the Caribbean Coast of Colombia|journal=Human Genetics|language=en|volume=125|issue=5–6|pages=565–579|doi=10.1007/s00439-009-0649-2|pmid=19290544|issn=0340-6717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIM panels can be used for detecting disease [[Risk factor|risk factors]]. One such panel was created for [[African Americans|African American]] ancestry based on subsets of commercially available SNP arrays. These types of arrays can help reduce the cost of identifying risk factors, since they allow researchers to screen for ancestry markers instead of the entire genome. This is due to the fact that these SNP arrays narrow the scope of the necessary screening from hundreds of thousands of SNP markers to a panel of a few thousands of AIMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tandon|first=Arti|last2=Patterson|first2=Nick|last3=Reich|first3=David|date=2010-12-22|title=Ancestry informative marker panels for African Americans based on subsets of commercially available SNP arrays|journal=Genetic Epidemiology|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=80–83|doi=10.1002/gepi.20550|issn=0741-0395|pmc=4386999|pmid=21181899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some believe that structured populations should be used in studies to better ascertain genetic associations to [[Disease|diseases]], the social implications of the potential racial stigma that may result from such studies is a major concern. However, the study done by Yang et al. (2005) suggests that the technology to conduct deeper research into and identify ancestry-associated variations in human disease does already exist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
BOINC was originally developed to manage the [[SETI@home]] project.

The original SETI client was a non-BOINC software exclusively for SETI@home. As one of the first volunteer grid computing projects, it was not designed with a high level of security. As a result, some participants in the project attempted to cheat the project to gain "credits," while some others submitted entirely falsified work. BOINC was designed, in part, to combat these security breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Anderson | first=David P. | title=Public Computing: Reconnecting People to Science | url=https://boinc.berkeley.edu/madrid.html | accessdate=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BOINC project started in February 2002, and the first version was released on April 10, 2002. The first BOINC-based project was [[Predictor@home]] launched on June 9, 2004. In 2009, [[AQUA@home]] deployed multi-threaded CPU applications for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kamran Karimi |author2=Neil Dickson |author3=Firas Hamze |last-author-amp=yes | title = High-Performance Physics Simulations Using Multi-Core CPUs and GPGPUs in a Volunteer Computing Context | journal = International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications |volume=25 |pages=61 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1177/1094342010372928 | url = https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1004/1004.0023.pdf|arxiv=1004.0023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the first [[OpenCL]] application in 2010.

{{As of|2018|1|2}}, 37 BOINC projects are active.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php|title=Choosing BOINC projects|last=|first=|date=|website=BOINC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|BOINC client–server technology}}
[[File:BOINCManager.png|thumb|right|BOINC Manager [[Icon (computing)|icon]] ]]
In essence, BOINC is [[software]] that can use the unused [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] cycles on a [[computer]] to do scientific computing—what one individual does not use of his/her computer, BOINC uses. In late 2008, BOINC's official website announced that [[Nvidia]] had developed a system called [[CUDA]] that uses GPUs for scientific computing. With NVIDIA's assistance, some BOINC-based projects (e.g., [[SETI@home]], [[MilkyWay@home]]) now have applications that run on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. Beginning in October 2009, BOINC added support for the [[ATI Technologies|ATI]]/[[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] family of GPUs also. These applications run from 2 to 10 times faster than the former CPU-only versions. In 7.x preview versions, GPU support (via [[OpenCL]]) was added for computers using [[macOS|Mac OS X]] with AMD Radeon graphic cards.

BOINC consists of a [[Server (computing)|server]] system and client software that communicate with each other to distribute and process work units and return the results.

===User interfaces===
BOINC can be controlled remotely by [[remote procedure call]]s (RPC), from the [[Command-line interface|command line]], and from the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing#Account managers|BOINC Account Manager]].

BOINC Manager currently has two "views": the ''Advanced View'' and the ''Simplified [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]''. The ''Grid View'' was removed in the 6.6.x clients as it was redundant.

The appearance ([[Skin (computing)|skin]]) of the Simplified GUI is user-customizable, in that users can create their own designs.

===Mobile Application===
A BOINC app also exists for Android, allowing every person owning an Android device – smartphone, tablet and Kindle – to share their unused computing power. The user is allowed to select the research projects they want to support, if it is in the app's available project list.

By default, the application will allow computing only when the device is connected to a WiFi network, is being charged, and the battery has a charge of at least 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Android_FAQ|title= Android FAQ |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 12 April 2018 |website= BOINC |publisher= UC Berkeley |access-date= 29 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only some of the BOINC projects are available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php|website=BOINC}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Asteroids@home]], [[Collatz Conjecture]], [[Einstein@home]], [[Enigma@home]], [[LHC@home]], [[Moo! Wrapper]], [[Quake Catcher Network]], [[Rosetta@home]], [[SETI@home]], [[theSkyNet POGS]], [[Universe@Home]], [[World Community Grid]] and [[Yoyo@home]].

===Account managers===
A BOINC Account Manager is an application that manages multiple BOINC project accounts across multiple computers (CPUs) and operating systems. Account managers were designed for people who are new to BOINC or have several computers participating in several projects. The account manager concept was conceived and developed jointly by [[GridRepublic]] and BOINC. Current account managers include:
* BAM! (BOINC Account Manager) (The first publicly available Account Manager, released for public use on May 30, 2006)
* [[GridRepublic]] (Follows the idea of keeping it simple and keep it neat when it comes to account management)
* [[Charity Engine]] (Non-profit account manager for hire, uses prize draws and continuous charity fundraising to motivate people to join the grid)
* Dazzler (Open-source Account Manager, to ease institutional management resources)

===Credit system===
{{Main|BOINC Credit System}}

The BOINC Credit System is designed to avoid cheating by validating results before granting credit.
* A credit management system helps to ensure that users are returning results which are both scientifically and statistically accurate.
* Online distributed computing is almost entirely a volunteer endeavor. For this reason, projects are dependent on a complicated and variable mix of new users, long-term users, and retiring users.

==Projects==
There are about 35 projects currently listed,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of which about half yield published reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Since 2013, the [[cryptocurrency]] Gridcoin has been associated with BOINC as a remunerative coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy|date=2015|publisher=O'Reilly Media|edition=1st|last1=Swan|first1=Melanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gridcoin]] uses a modified [[proof-of-stake]] timestamping system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://allcoinsnews.com/2015/10/01/gridcoin-crowdfunds-for-pnp-network-rewarding-scientific-research/|title=Gridcoin Crowdfunds for PiGrid PnP Network Rewarding Scientific Research|website=allcoinsnews.com|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; called proof-of-research to reward participants for computational work completed on BOINC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/putting-the-blockchain-to-work-for-science-gridcoin-1400747268|title=Putting the Blockchain to Work For Science!|website=Bitcoin Magazine|last1=Wagner|first1=Andrew|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/1331-new-coin-launch-announcement-grc-gridcoin/page-195#entry101161|title=GRIDCOIN – GRC (The environmentally conscious coin)|last=Halford|first=Rob|date=2013-10-06|website=cryptocointalk.com|accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proof-of-research system was implemented on October 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.gridcoin.us/Proof-of-Research|title=Proof-of-Research - Gridcoin|website=wiki.gridcoin.us|language=en|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system takes into account a parameter supplied with the limited number of white-listed projects called RAC (Recent Average Credit), and distributes the coin according to the proportion of RAC acquired in the project to the people who are computing in it. Each whitelisted project gets the same amount of GRC to distribute among its contributors.

'''Carpathite''' (also ''pendletonite'' and ''karpatite'') is a very rare hydrocarbon mineral. It is the mineral form of the [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] [[coronene]] with formula: C&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. 

==Discovery==
It was first described in 1955 for an occurrence in [[Transcarpathian Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]. It was named for the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. It has also been reported from the [[Presov Region]] of the [[Slovak Republic]], the [[Kamchatka Oblast]] in Russia and from [[San Benito County, California]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

==Occurrence==
It occurs at the contact zone of a [[diorite]] intrusive into [[argillite]] within cavities in the Ukraine. In the California occurrence it appears as  a low temperature [[hydrothermal]] phase. It is associated with [[idrialite]], [[amorphous]] organic material, [[calcite]], [[barite]], [[quartz]], [[cinnabar]], and [[metacinnabar]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

'''''Categories for the Working Mathematician''''' ('''''CWM''''') is a textbook in [[category theory]] written by American [[mathematician]] [[Saunders Mac Lane]], who cofounded the subject together with [[Samuel Eilenberg]]. It was first published in 1971, and is based on his lectures on the subject given at the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Australian National University]], [[Bowdoin College]], and [[Tulane University]]. It is widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leinster |first1=Tom |title=Category Theory for the Sciences |year=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=174}} "The towering presence among category theory books is the classic one by one of its founders: [[Saunders Mac Lane]]'s Categories for the Working Mathematician"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Awodey |first1=Steve |title=Category Theory |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=iv}} "Why write a new textbook on Category Theory, when we already have Mac Lane’s Categories for the Working Mathematician? Simply put, because Mac Lane’s book is for the working (and aspiring) mathematician. What is needed now, after 30 years of spreading into various other disciplines and places in the curriculum, is a book for everyone else." Awodey also dedicated the book to Saunders Mac Lane.&lt;/ref&gt; as the premier introduction to the subject.

== Contents ==

The book has twelve chapters, which are:

:Chapter I. [[Category (mathematics)|Categories]], [[Functor]]s, and [[natural transformation|Natural Transformation]]s.
:Chapter II. Constructions on Categories.
:Chapter III. Universals and [[Limit (category theory)|Limit]]s.
:Chapter IV. [[Adjoint functors|Adjoints]].
:Chapter V. [[Limit (category theory)|Limits]].
:Chapter VI. [[Monad (category theory)|Monad]]s and Algebras.
:Chapter VII. [[Monoidal category|Monoid]]s.
:Chapter VIII. [[Abelian category|Abelian Categories]].
:Chapter IX. Special Limits.
:Chapter X. [[Kan extension|Kan Extension]]s.
:Chapter XI. Symmetry and [[Braided monoidal category|Braiding in Monoidal Categories]]
:Chapter XII. Structures in Categories.

Chapters XI and XII were added in the 1998 second edition, the first in view of its importance in [[string theory]] and [[quantum field theory]], and the second to address higher-dimensional categories that have come into prominence.&lt;ref&gt;From the preface to the second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is the classic reference for [[category theory]], some of the terminology is not standard. In particular, Mac Lane attempted to settle an ambiguity in usage for the terms [[epimorphism]] and [[monomorphism]] by introducing the terms ''epic'' and ''monic,'' but the distinction is not in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bergman |first1=George |title=An Invitation to General Algebra and Universal Constructions |year=1998 |publisher=Henry Helson |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Unley]], [[Adelaide]], the youngest child of John Thomas Edward Tilley, a civil engineer from London, and his wife [[South Australia]]-born wife Catherine Jane (née Nicholas).  He was educated at [[Adelaide High School]], then studied under [[William Rowan Browne]] at the [[University of Adelaide]], and the [[University of Sydney]].  He went to England to work in the munitions industry during [[World War I]] but returned after the Armistice.

He won an [[Exhibition of 1851]] scholarship to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1919 where he studied under [[Alfred Harker (petrologist)|Alfred Harker]].  Most of the remainder of his career was spent in England, though spent 1938-9 in Australia and visited regularly after the War.

In 1929, while investigating a [[volcanic plug]] at [[Scawt Hill]], near [[Larne]], [[Northern Ireland]] for the [[Mineralogical Magazine]] he identified and named the new minerals [[larnite]] and [[scawtite]].&lt;ref name="habitas site des"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/escr/site.asp?Item=1130|title=Scawt Hill|website=www.habitas.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''data science competition platform''' is used by businesses to host [[data science]] challenges that are hard to solve for one group. Historically, [[crowdsourcing]] challenges have been known to solve very complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2016.69|title=Crowdsourcing biomedical research: leveraging communities as innovation engines|first1=Julio|last1=Saez-Rodriguez|first2=James C.|last2=Costello|first3=Stephen H.|last3=Friend|first4=Michael R.|last4=Kellen|first5=Lara|last5=Mangravite|first6=Pablo|last6=Meyer|first7=Thea|last7=Norman|first8=Gustavo|last8=Stolovitzky|publisher=|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=17|issue=8|pages=470–486|doi=10.1038/nrg.2016.69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Netflix Prize]] is one such competition. Since then there have been several platforms developed on the idea of data science competitions. Research has been completed on how competition can improve research performance. 

Examples of data science competition platforms include [[Kaggle]], [[InnoCentive]], and Alibaba Tianchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tianchi.aliyun.com/index.htm|title=Tianchi: Platform of Crowd Intelligence|website=tianchi.aliyun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alibaba]]'s competition platform which was used in [[SIGKDD|KDD]] 2017.

[[File:CB Unix Manuals.jpg|thumb|The multi-volume programmer's manual to a 1975 operating system called [[CB UNIX]]]]
'''Documentation''' is a set of [[Document|documents]] provided on paper, or [[online]], or on [[digital media|digital]] or [[analog media]], such as [[audio tape]] or [[CD]]s. Examples are user guides, white papers, on-line help, quick-reference guides.  It is becoming less common to see paper (hard-copy) documentation.  Documentation is distributed via websites, software products, and other on-line applications.

Professionals educated in this field are termed documentalists. This field changed its name to [[information science]] in 1968, but some uses of the term documentation still exists and there have been efforts to reintroduce the term documentation as a field of study.

== Principles for producing documentation ==

While associated [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards are not easily available publicly, a guide from other sources for this topic may serve the purpose.&lt;ref name=agd&gt;{{cite web|last=N/A |first= |authorlink= |title=Guide to Documentation |work= |publisher= |year=2003 |url=http://www.somers.k12.ct.us/common/guide_to_doc.pdf |format= |doi= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729135707/http://www.somers.k12.ct.us/common/guide_to_doc.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=agds&gt;{{cite web

=== Procedures and techniques ===

The procedures of documentation vary from one sector, or one type, to another. In general, these may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated [[Standing operating procedure|SOP]]s in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be easy to read and understand. If it's too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, Short, Familiar words should be used to a maximum of 15 words to a sentence. Only gender hyper neutral word should be used and cultural biases should be avoided. Procedures should be numbered when they are to be performed.&lt;ref name=grdp&gt;{{cite web

== Producing documentation ==

Technical writers and corporate communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, technical writers have a background in both the subject matter and also in writing and managing content (information architecture). Technical writers more commonly collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs), such as engineers, technical experts,  medical professionals, or other types of clients to define and then create content (documentation) that meets the user's needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation that is required for most companies.

=== Specializing documentation ===

* [[Marketing Communications]] (MarCom): MarCom writers endeavor to convey the company's value proposition through a variety of print, electronic, and social media.  This area of corporate writing is often engaged in responding to proposals.
* [[Technical Communication]] (TechCom): Technical writers document a company's product or service.  Technical publication include user guides, installation an configuration manuals, and troubleshooting/repair/replace procedures.
* [[Legal Writing]]: This type of documentation is often prepared by attorneys or paralegals who could be in private practice or retained as corporate council.
* Compliance documentation: This type of documentation codifies [[Standard Operating Procedures]] (SOPs), for any regulatory compliance needs, as for safety approval, taxation, financing, technical approval, etc.

=== Indexing ===

* [[Database index|Index (database)]]
* [[Index (search engine)]]

== Documentation in computer science ==
{{main|Software documentation}}
The following are typical software documentation types
* Request for Proposal ([[RFP]])
* Requirements/ [[Statement of work]]/ Scope of Work (SOW)
* Software Design and Functional Specification
* System Design and Functional Specifications
* Change Management, Error and Enhancement Tracking
* [[User Acceptance Testing]]
* [[Man page|Manpages]]
* [[Perl Programming Documentation|Perldocs]]

The following are typical hardware and service documentation types
* [[Computer network diagram|network diagrams]]
* network maps
* [[datasheet]] for IT systems (Server, Switch, e.g.)
* Service Catalog and Service Portfolio ([[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]])

Documentation include such as feasibility report, technical documentation, operational documentation, log book, etc.

=== Tools for documenting software ===
There are many types of software and applications used to create documentation.

SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER (SDF)

A common type of software document written by software engineers in the simulation industry is the SDF. When developing software for a simulator, which can range from embedded avionics devices to 3D terrain databases by way of full motion control systems, the engineer keeps a notebook detailing the development "the build" of the project or module. The document can be a wiki page, MS word document or other environment.  They should contain a ''requirements'' section, an ''interface'' section to detail the communication interface of the software.  Often a ''notes'' section is used to detail the proof of concept, and then track errors and enhancements. Finally, a ''testing'' section to document how the software was tested.  This documents conformance to the client's requirements. The result is a detailed description of how the software is designed, how to build and install the software on the target device, and any known defects and work-arounds. This build document enables future developers and maintainers to come up to speed on the software in a timely manner, and also provides a roadmap to modifying code or searching for bugs.

SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK INVENTORY AND CONFIGURATION ([[CMDB]])

These software tools can automatically collect data of your network equipment. The data could be for inventory and for configuration information. The [[ITIL|ITIL Library]] requests to create such a database as a basis for all information for the IT responsible. It's also the basis for IT documentation. Examples include XIA Configuration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrel-solutions.com/xiaconfiguration/|title=XIA Configuration Network Documentation Tool|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Documentation in criminal justice ==

"Documentation" is the preferred term for the process of populating criminal databases.  Examples include the [[National Counter-terrorism Center]]'s [[Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment]] ("TIDE"), [[sex offender registries]], and gang databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rader Brown|first=Rebecca|title=The Gang's All Here: Evaluating the Need for a National Gang Database|journal=Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems|year=2009|volume=42|pages=293–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentation in Early Childhood Education ==
Documentation, as it pertains to the Early Childhood Education field, is "when we notice and value children's ideas, thinking, questions, and theories about the world and then collect traces of their work (drawings, photographs of the children in action, and transcripts of their words) to share with a wider community" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/909907917|title=Pedagogical documentation in early childhood : sharing children's learning and teachers' thinking|last=Susan,|first=Stacey,|isbn=9781605543925|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|oclc=909907917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thusly, documentation is a process, used to link the educator's knowledge and learning of the child/children with the families, other collaborators, and even to the children themselves.  

Documentation is an integral part of the cycle of inquiry - observing, reflecting, documenting, sharing and responding. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pedagogical documentation, in terms of the teacher documentation, is the "teacher's story of the movement in children's understanding".  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;According to Stephanie Cox Suarez in 'Documentation - Transforming our Perspectives', "teachers are considered researchers, and documentation is a research tool to support knowledge building among children and adults" &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pz.harvard.edu/resources/documentation-transforming-our-perspectives|title=Documentation: Transforming our Perspectives {{!}} Project Zero|website=www.pz.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation can take many different styles in the classroom.  The following exemplifies ways in which documentation can make the 'research', or learning, visible:

# Documentation Panels (bulletin-board-like presentation with multiple pictures and descriptions about the project or event).
# Daily Log (a log kept every day that records the play and learning in the classroom)
# Documentation developed by or with the children (when observing children during documentation, the child's lens of the observation is used in the actual documentation)
# Individual Portfolios (documentation used to track and highlight the development of each child)
# Electronic Documentation (using apps and devices to share documentation with families and collaborators)
# Transcripts or Recordings of Conversations (using recording in documentation can bring about deeper reflections for both the educator and the child)
# Learning Stories (a narrative used to "describe learning and help children see themselves as powerful learners" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)
# The Classroom as Documentation (reflections and documentation of the physical environment of a classroom). &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Documentation is certainly a process in and of itself, and it is also a process within the educator.  The following is the development of documentation as it progresses for and in the educator themselves:

* Develop[s] habits of documentation
* Become[s] comfortable with going public with recounting of activities

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10645">[[File:XASFig.jpg|thumb|Three regions of XAS data|440x440px]] '''X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy''' ([[X-ray absorption spectroscopy|XAS]]) includes both '''Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure''' (EXAFS) and '''X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure''' ([[XANES]]). XAS is the measurement of the [[x-ray]] [[absorption coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt; \mu (E) &lt;/math&gt; in the equations below) of a material as a function of energy. X-rays of a narrow energy resolution are shone on the sample and the incident and transmitted x-ray intensity is recorded as the incident x-ray energy is incremented. The number of x-ray photons that are transmitted through a sample (I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the number of x-ray photons shone on the sample (I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by a decreasing exponential that depends on the type of atoms in the sample, the absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and the thickness of the sample &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt; I_t = I_0 e^{-\mu x} &lt;/math&gt;

The absorption coefficient is obtained by taking the log ratio of the incident x-ray intensity to the transmitted x-ray intensity. 

&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac{-\mathrm{ln}({I}_{t}/{I}_{0})}{x} &lt;/math&gt;

When the incident x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an [[electron]] of an atom within the sample, the number of x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing a drop in the transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an absorption edge. Each element on the periodic table has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at [[synchrotron]]s. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids.  And because of the brilliance of synchrotron X-ray sources the concentration of the absorbing element can be as low as a few ppm. 

EXAFS [[Absorption spectrum|spectra]] are displayed as graphs of the [[absorption coefficient]] of a given material versus [[energy]], typically in a 500 – 1000 [[Electron volt|eV]] range beginning before an [[absorption edge]] of an element in the sample. The x-ray absorption coefficient is usually normalized to unit step height. This is done by regressing a line to the region before and after the absorption edge, subtracting the pre-edge line from the entire data set and dividing by the absorption step height, which is determined by the difference between the pre-edge and post-edge lines at the value of E0 (on the absorption edge).

The normalized absorption spectra are often called [[XANES]] spectra. These spectra can be used to determine the average oxidation state of the element in the sample. The XANES spectra are also sensitive to the coordination environment of the absorbing atom in the sample.  Finger printing methods have been used to match the XANES spectra of an unknown sample to those of known "standards". Linear combination fitting of several different standard spectra can give an estimate to the amount of each of the known standard spectra within an unknown sample.

X-ray absorption spectra are produced over the range of 200 – 35,000 eV. The dominant physical process is one where the absorbed photon ejects a core [[photoelectron]] from the absorbing atom, leaving behind a core hole. The atom with the core hole is now excited.  The ejected photoelectron’s energy will be equal to that of the absorbed photon minus the [[binding energy]] of the initial core state. The ejected photoelectron interacts with electrons in the surrounding non-excited atoms.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:EXAFS.png|thumb|300px|right|Schematics of the EXAFS process illustrating the origin of EXAFS oscillations due to the interference of outgoing and backscattered photoelectron wave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p-ng.si/~arcon/xas/exafs/exafs.htm Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure, Dr. Alojz Kodre ''et al.'']&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;If the ejected photoelectron is taken to have a [[wave]]-like nature and the surrounding atoms are described as point scatterers, it is possible to imagine the [[backscatter]]ed electron waves interfering with the forward-propagating waves. The resulting interference pattern shows up as a [[modulation]] of the measured absorption coefficient, thereby causing the oscillation in the EXAFS spectra. A simplified plane-wave single-scattering theory has been used for interpretation of EXAFS spectra for many years, although modern methods (like FEFF, GNXAS) have shown that curved-wave corrections and multiple-scattering effects can not be neglected. The photelectron scattering amplitude in the low energy range (5-200 eV) of the photoelectron kinetic energy  become much larger so that multiple scattering events become dominant in the [[XANES]]  (or NEXAFS) spectra.

The [[wavelength]] of the photoelectron is dependent on the energy and phase of the backscattered wave which exists at the central atom. The wavelength changes as a function of the energy of the incoming photon. The [[phase (waves)|phase]] and [[amplitude]] of the backscattered wave are dependent on the type of atom doing the backscattering and the distance of the backscattering atom from the central atom. The dependence of the scattering on atomic species makes it possible to obtain information pertaining to the chemical coordination environment of the original absorbing (centrally excited) atom by analyzing these EXAFS data.

==Experimental considerations==

Since EXAFS requires a tunable x-ray source, data are always collected at [[synchrotron]]s, often at [[beamline]]s which are especially optimized for the purpose. The utility of a particular synchrotron to study a particular solid depends on the [[Luminosity#In_scattering_theory_and_accelerator_physics|brightness]] of the x-ray flux at the absorption edges of the relevant elements.

== Applications ==

XAS is an interdisciplinary technique and its unique properties, as compared to x-ray diffraction, have been exploited for
understanding the details of local structure in:

* [[glass]], [[amorphous]] and [[liquid]] systems
* [[Solid solution|solid solutions]]
* [[Doping (semiconductor)|Doping]] and [[Ion implantation|ionic implantation]] of materials for [[electronics]]
* local distortions of crystal lattices
* [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic compounds]]
* [[metalloproteins]]
* [[Cluster chemistry|metal clusters]]
* vibrational dynamics{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* [[ions]] in [[solutions]]
* [[speciation]] of elements

==Example of Significance==

EXAFS is, like [[XANES]], a highly sensitive technique with elemental specificity.  As such, EXAFS is an extremely useful way to determine the chemical state of practically important species which occur in very low abundance or concentration. Frequent use of EXAFS occurs in [[environmental chemistry]], where scientists try to understand the propagation of [[pollutant]]s through an [[ecosystem]]. EXAFS can be used along with [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] in [[forensic]] examinations, particularly in [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[non-proliferation]] applications.

For an example of an EXAFS study of [[uranium]] chemistry in [[glass]] see [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/459339-8dNh9T/webviewable/459339.pdf], and for a general study of trivalent [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in [[chloride]] containing aqueous media can be read at [http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/activity_rep/ar98/2525-edelstein.pdf]

==History==

A very detailed, balanced and informative account about the history of EXAFS (originally called Kossel's structures) is given in the paper "A History of the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure" by R. Stumm von Bordwehr, Ann. Phys. Fr. vol. 14, 377-466 (1989).
A more modern and accurate account of the history of XAFS (EXAFS and XANES) is given by the leader of the group that developed the modern version of XAFS in the award lecture "Musings about the development of the XAFS" by Edward A. Stern, J. Synchrotron Rad. (2001). 8, 49-54.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1935">'''François Pierre Nicholas Gillet de Laumont''' (28 May 1747 – 1 June 1834) was a [[France|French]] [[mineralogist]].

He was born in [[Paris]], educated at a military school and served in the army from 1772 to 1784, when he was appointed inspector of mines. His attention in his leisure time was wholly given to [[mineralogy]], and he assisted in organizing the new [[Mines ParisTech|École des Mines]] in Paris. 

He was author of numerous mineralogical papers in the "''Journal et Annales des Mines''". The mineral [[laumontite]], which Laumont discovered in the mines of [[Huelgoat]], was named after him by [[René Just Haüy]].&lt;ref name=HH&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ElcEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Gillet+de+Laumont%22+1747&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QeUgTp-zKV&amp;sig=AeljHpP9aDLurO3UsWLzpyRJFxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXns-VjfDJAhUGdh4KHbpjBMYQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gillet%20de%20Laumont%22%201747&amp;f=false Records of General Science, Volume 2] edited by [[Robert Dundas Thomson]], Thomas Thomson&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Jean-Baptiste L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17042">The '''Groves Classification''' is a numbering system to enable the shape of any [[academic dress|academic gown or hood]] to be easily described and identified. It was devised by Nicholas Groves to establish a common terminology for hoods and gown to remedy the situation of individual universities using differing terms to describe the same item. As such it is used in same manner as an heraldic blazon whereby a textual description enables a coat of arms to be drawn. The system was first described in the Burgon Society's annual in 2001 and adopted as standard by robe makers and scholars of academic dress.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'&gt;{{Citation | surname=Groves| given=Nicholas | author-link= | title=Towards a Standard Terminology for Describing Academic Dress | journal=The Burgon Society Annual |volume=1 |issue= | year=2001 | pages=9–12 | url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/library/trans/annual2001.pdf }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Groves Classification included a standardization for shapes and patterns of hoods and gowns worn by graduates and undergraduates. Further information was given regarding the use of different fabrics and standardization of colors, but the focus was placed on gowns and hoods which are explained further below.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'/&gt;

The Classification undergoes periodic revision as new hood and gown patterns emerge.

===Hoods===
Hoods in the Classification are divided into three different types as summarised in the table below. Unlike the gowns and robes, these are based on the shape of the hood rather than the degrees for which they are worn.

*'''[f]''' full shape hoods are those that have a [[cape]], a [[cowl]] and a [[liripipe]].
*'''[s]''' simple shape hoods have only a cowl and a liripipe.
*'''[a]''' Aberdeen shape hoods have only a cape and a vestigial cowl.

===Gowns===
Gowns in the Groves system are divided into three classes. These generally follow the shapes associated with each different [[academic degree]] in the British educational system. 
*[b] [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] gowns typically have large open sleeves
*[m] [[master's degree|master's]] gowns typically have long closed sleeves with armhole at elbow level
*[d] [[doctoral degree|doctor's]] robes vary in shape widely between institutions and are all classed as [d].

==Changes==
The Groves classification system was first published in 2001. Since that time, it has been adapted and changed to include newly devised academic dress and revisions of existing schemes.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'/&gt; The Burgon Society maintains a comprehensive listing of system shapes on its website. In addition to those included above, the current list classifies undergraduate gowns in use throughout the United Kingdom and academic headwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/design/groves.php|title=The Design of Academical Dress|publisher=The Burgon Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11760">'''International Botanical Congress''' ('''IBC''') is an international meeting of [[botanist]]s in all scientific fields, authorized by the '''International Association of Botanical and Mycological Societies''' ('''IABMS''') and held every six years, with the location rotating between different continents. The current numbering system for the congresses starts from the year 1900; the XVIII IBC was held in Melbourne, Australia, 24–30 July 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibc2011.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the XIX IBC was held in [[Shenzhen]], China, 23–29 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibc2017.cn/&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBC has the power to alter the ICN ([[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]), which was renamed from the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] (ICBN) at the XVIII IBC. Formally the power resides with the Plenary Session; in practice this approves the decisions of the Nomenclature Section. The Nomenclature Section meets before the actual Congress and deals with all proposals to modify the Code: this includes ratifying recommendations from sub-committees on [[conservation (botany)|conservation]]. To reduce the risk of a hasty decision the Nomenclature Section adopts a 60% majority requirement for any change not already recommended by a committee.

== History ==
[[File:1975 CPA 4471 uneven lighting.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp for the 1975 congress]]
Prior to the first International Botanical Congress, local congresses concerned with natural sciences generally had grown to be very large, and a more specialized but also international meeting was considered desirable.&lt;ref name=Stafleu&gt;{{cite book|author=Stafleu, F.A. |year=1970 |title= XI International Botanical Congress, University of Washington, Seattle, U.S.A., August 24-September 2, 1969. Proceedings |chapter= A century of botanical congresses |publisher=XI International Botanical Congress, Inc. |location=Washington, D.C. |editor= R.C. Starr |pages= 9–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first annual IBC was held in 1864 in [[Brussels]], in conjunction with an international horticultural exhibit.&lt;ref name=Stafleu/&gt; At the second annual congress (held in [[Amsterdam]]), [[Karl Koch (botanist)|Karl Koch]] made a proposal to standardize botanical nomenclature, and the third congress (held in [[London]]) resolved that this matter would be dealt with by the next congress.

The fourth congress, which had as one of its principal purposes to establish laws of botanical nomenclature, was organized by la [[Société botanique de France]], and took place in [[Paris]] in August 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/actesducongrsi1867inte#page/n9/mode/2up |title=Actes du Congrés international de botanique tenu a Paris en août 1867, sous les auspices de la Société botanique de France (1867)|author=Alphonse de Candolle |year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws adopted were based on those prepared by [[Alphonse de Candolle]]. Regular international botanical and/or horticultural congresses were held but made no further changes to nomenclature until the 1892 meeting in [[Genoa]],&lt;ref name=Stafleu/&gt; which made some small changes to the laws of nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/attidelcongress00penzgoog|title=Atti del Congresso botanico internazionale di Genova 1892 (1893)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent meetings are as follows in the table below. The "Code" column shows whether a code of nomenclature was adopted.

Year !! City !! Country !! Code !! Major actions concerning nomenclature
|-
| I || 1900 || [[Paris]] || {{FRA}} || || Decisions on nomenclature deferred.
|-
| II || 1905 || [[Vienna]] || {{AUT}} || Yes || First binding ''Rules of Nomenclature''; French became the official language of the meeting; requirement for Latin plant descriptions from 1908 onwards (not enforced); end of the [[Kew Rule]].
|-
| III || 1910 || [[Brussels]] || {{BEL}} || Yes || Separate starting dates for nomenclature of fungi established.
|-
| IV || 1926 || [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] || {{USA}} || || Decisions on nomenclature deferred.
|-
| V || 1930 || [[Cambridge]] || {{UK}} || Yes || The [[Type (biology)|type]] method incorporated; Latin requirement deferred until 1932; "absolute homonym rule" accepted, or "once a later homonym always illegitimate (unless conserved)", which altered the status of many names, including many that had previously been [[conserved name|conserved]].&lt;ref name=Rickett&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rickett, H.W. |author2=Stafleu, F.A. |year=1959|title=Nomina generica conservanda et rejicienda spermatophytorum|journal=Taxon|volume=8|issue=7|pages=213–243 |doi=10.2307/1217883}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cambridge Code'' was not published until 1935.&lt;ref name=Nico91/&gt; This code was accepted by previous proponents of the American Code, ending a period of schism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weatherby, C.A. |year=1949|title=Botanical Nomenclature Since 1867|journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=36 |issue=1|pages=5–7|jstor=2438113|doi=10.2307/2438113 |pmid=18124191}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
| VI || 1935 || [[Amsterdam]] || {{NED}} || || English became the official language of the Congress, replacing French. No formal Code was published.&lt;ref name=Nico91/&gt;
|-
| VII || 1950 || [[Stockholm]] || {{SWE}} || Yes || Adoption of the first [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]];&lt;ref name=Stafleu/&gt; arbitrary dates defined for some foundational works; decision to hold future congresses every five years (except four years for the next one). For fossil plants, organ genera and form genera were introduced.
|-
| VIII || 1954 || [[Paris]] || {{FRA}} || Yes || Two additional principles added, II and III, dealing with types and with priority. Proposals to conserve or reject specific names were rejected, but a committee was established to find ways to improve the stability of names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stafleu, F.A. |year=1954 |title=Nomenclature at the Paris Congress |journal=Taxon |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=217–225 |doi=10.2307/1216598 |jstor=1216598}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| IX || 1959 || [[Montreal]] || {{CAN}} || Yes || Presentation of a completely reworked list of conserved and rejected names necessitated by changes made at the 1930 congress,&lt;ref name=Rickett/&gt; but the list for species was not accepted.{{refn|group=nb|"The proposals concerning the question of possible ''nomina specifica conservanda c.q. rejicienda'' did not result in any legislative action but were followed by an attempt to assess first the real scope of the problem before changing the rules. This may seem a minor step forward. In fact I believe it is the first real progress that has been made towards solving this difficult problem.&lt;ref name=1959Code&gt;{{citation |author1=Lanjouw, J. |author2=Baehni, C. |author3=Robyns, W. |author4=Ross, R. |author5=Rousseau, J. |author6=Schopf, J.M. |author7=Schulze, G.M. |author8=Smith, A.C. |author9=Vilmorin, R.d. |author10=Stafleu, F.A. |year=1961 |title=Code International de la Nomenclature Botanique/International Code of Botanical Nomenclature/Internationaler Code der botanischen Nomenklatur |publisher=International Bureau for Plant Taxonomy and Nomenclature of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy |location=Utrecht |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preface by J.

The three texts are all official, but, should there be any inconsistency between the versions, it is agree to regard the English one arbitrarily as correct."&lt;ref name=1959Code/&gt; Preface by J. Lanjouw}}
|-
| X || 1964 || [[Edinburgh]] || {{UK}} || Yes || No major changes to the code.&lt;ref name=Edinburgh&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stafleu, F.A. |year=1964 |title=Nomenclature at Edinburgh |journal=Taxon |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=273–282 |doi=10.2307/1216194 |jstor=1216194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| XI || 1969 || [[Seattle]] || {{USA}} || Yes || Established the [[International Association of Bryologists]].
|-
| XII || 1975 || [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] || {{USSR}} || Yes || Official versions of the code in English, French, and German (the English version to take precedence in case of discrepancy); rejection of species names allowed in a few special cases; organ-genera for fossil plants are eliminated, replaced by [[form classification|form-genera]].
|-
| XIII || 1981 || [[Sydney]] || {{AUS}} || Yes || Official versions of the code in English, French, and German (the English version to take precedence in case of discrepancy); conservation procedure (and rejection) extended to species names "of major economic importance"; fungi starting date restored to 1753 with [[sanctioned name]] status established; the types of genera and higher categories become the types of species (i.e., the taxa themselves are no longer types,&lt;ref&gt;This is a contrast to the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; only specimens or illustrations).
|-
| XIV || 1987 || [[Berlin]] || {{GER}} || Yes || Official version of the code only in (British) English; later translations in French, German, and Japanese; conservation extended to species names that represent the type of a conserved generic name.
|-
| XV || 1993 || [[Tokyo]] || {{JPN}} || Yes || Moves towards registration of plant names; extensive re-arrangement of the nomenclature code; official version of the code only in (British) English; later translations in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Slovak; conservation extended to all species names; rejection permitted for any name that would cause a disadvantageous nomenclatural change; epitype concept introduced.
|-
| XVI || 1999 || [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] || {{USA}} || Yes || Refinement of [[Type (biology)|type]] requirements; illustrations as types mostly forbidden from 1958; morphotaxa for fossils. Proposals defeated included the BioCode and registration of plant names.
|-
| XVII || 2005 || [[Vienna]] || {{AUT}} || Yes || Morphotaxa and regular taxa for fossils; illustrations as types mostly forbidden from 2007; glossary added to the code of nomenclature.
|-
| XVIII || 2011 || [[Melbourne]] || {{AUS}} || Yes || Electronic publication permitted; registration of fungal names; English or Latin descriptions (or diagnoses) from 2012; the concepts of anamorph and teleomorph (for fungi) and morphotaxa (for fossils) eliminated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7806">Here is a list of currently existing astronomical [[interferometer|optical interferometers]] (i.e. operating from visible to mid-infrared wavelengths), and some parameters describing their performance.

== Current performance of ground-based interferometers ==

Columns 2-5 determine the range of targets that can be observed and the range of science which can be done. Higher limiting [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] means that the array can observe fainter sources. The limiting magnitude is determined by the [[astronomical seeing|atmospheric seeing]], the diameters of the telescopes and the light lost in the system. A larger range of baselines means that a wider variety of science can be done and on a wider range of sources.

Columns 6-10 indicate the approximate quality and total amount of science data the array is expected to obtain. This is per year, to account for the average number of cloud-free nights on which each array is operated.

This article lists [[computer monitor]] [[display resolution|screen resolutions]] that are defined by standards or in common use. Most of them use certain [[Preferred number#Computer engineering|preferred numbers]].

==Computer graphics==
{{for|a list of resolution standards in computer monitors|graphics display resolution}}
; [[Pixel aspect ratio]] (PAR): The horizontal to vertical ratio of each, rectangular, physical pixel
; [[Storage aspect ratio]] (SAR): The horizontal to vertical ratio of solely the number of pixels in each direction.&lt;ref group=note&gt;LCD panels' resolutions are often quoted in terms of raw subpixels, misnamed "pixels" in manufacturer's specifications.  Each real pixel includes one subpixel for each of three colors, so calling subpixels "pixels" inflates the claimed resolution by a factor of three.  This bit of marketing obfuscation is calculated as horizontal resolution × vertical resolution × 3.  For example: 640&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;480 VGA is {{formatnum:921600}} subpixels, or {{formatnum:307200}} pixels, 800&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;600 SVGA is {{formatnum:1440000}} subpixels, or {{formatnum:480000}} pixels, and 1024&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;768 XGA is {{formatnum:2359296}} subpixels, but only {{formatnum:786432}} full-color pixels.&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Display aspect ratio]] (DAR): The combination (which occurs by multiplication) of both the pixel aspect ratio and storage aspect ratio giving the aspect ratio as experienced by  the viewer.

== Television ==

For television, the display aspect ratio (DAR) is shown, not the storage aspect ratio (SAR); analog television does not have well-defined pixels, while several digital television standards have non-square pixels.

* [[Log-structured File System (BSD)|BSD-LFS]], an implementation by [[Margo Seltzer]] was added to 4.4BSD, and was later ported to [[386BSD]]. It lacked support for snapshots. It was removed from FreeBSD and OpenBSD, but still lives on in [[NetBSD]].
* [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]]'s [[Fossil (file system)|Fossil]] file system is also log-structured and supports snapshots.
* [[NILFS]] is a log-structured file system implementation for [[Linux]] by [[NTT/Verio]] which supports snapshots.
* LinLogFS (formerly dtfs) and LFS are log-structured file system implementations for Linux.  The latter was part of [[Google Summer of Code|Google Summer of Code 2005]].  Both projects have been abandoned.
* LFS is another log-structured file system for Linux developed by Charles University, Prague.  It was to include support for snapshots and indexed directories, but development has since ceased.
* ULFS is a User-Level Log-structured File System using FUSE.
* [[Write Anywhere File Layout]] (WAFL) by [[NetApp]] is a file layout that supports large, high-performance RAID arrays, quick restarts without lengthy consistency checks in the event of a crash or power failure, and growing the filesystems size quickly. Built using log-structured file system concept,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} snapshots and off-line [[data deduplication]].
* [[LSFS]] is a log-structured file system with writable snapshots and inline [[data deduplication]] created by [[StarWind Software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = The struggle between virtual machine performance and storage
|publisher = ''Jon William Toigo @ TechTarget''
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Cache Accelerated Sequential Layout (CASL) is a proprietary log-structured filesystem developed by [[Nimble Storage]] that uses Solid State Devices to cache traditional hard drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[ObjectiveFS]] is a log-structured FUSE filesystem that uses cloud object stores (e.g. Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage and private cloud object store).
* [[NOVA (filesystem)|NOVA]] for byte-addressable [[persistent memory]] (for example [[non-volatile dual in-line memory module]] (NVDIMM) and [[3D XPoint]]) for Linux developed at the University of California, San Diego, US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/729812/|title=The NOVA filesystem [LWN.net]|website=[[LWN.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some kinds of storage media, such as [[flash memory]] and [[CD-RW]], slowly degrade as they are written to and have a limited number of erase/write cycles at any one location.  Log-structured file systems are sometimes used on these media because they make fewer in-place writes and thus prolong the life of the device by [[wear leveling]]. The more common such file systems include:

* [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] is a file system commonly used on [[optical disc]]s.
* [[JFFS]] and its successor [[JFFS2]] are simple [[Linux]] file systems intended for raw flash-based devices.
* [[UBIFS]] is a filesystem for raw [[NAND flash|NAND flash media]] and also intended to replace [[JFFS2]].
* [[LogFS]] is a scalable flash filesystem for [[Linux]] that works on both raw flash media and block devices, intended to replace [[JFFS2]].
* [[YAFFS]] is a raw NAND flash-specific file system for many operating systems (including Linux).
* [[F2FS]] is a new file system designed for the NAND flash memory-based storage devices on Linux.

The following is a '''list of [[Solar variation|solar cycle]]s''' (sometimes called [[sunspot]] cycles), tracked since 1755 following the original numbering proposed by Rudolf Wolf in the mid-19th century&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;Kane, R.P. (2002). "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/qtq52nl8vtq7w2t6/ Some Implications Using the Group Sunspot Number Reconstruction]". ''Solar Physics'' '''205(2)''', 383-401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spacetoday.org/SolSys/Sun/Sunspots.html Did You Say the Sun Has Spots?]". ''Space Today Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; The source data are the revised International Sunspot Numbers (ISN v2.0), as available at SILSO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunspot numbers|url=http://www.sidc.be/silso/datafiles|website=WDC-SILSO|publisher=Royal Observatory of Belgium|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sunspot number counts exist since 1610&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hathaway,|first1=D.|title=The solar cycle|journal=Living Reviews in Solar Physics|date=2015|volume=12|page=4|doi=10.1007/lrsp-2015-4|arxiv=1502.07020|bibcode=2015LRSP...12....4H}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the cycle numbering is not well defined during the [[Maunder minimum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maunder minimum|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} It was proposed that one cycle might have been lost in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Usoskin|first1=et al.|title=A solar cycle lost in 1793-1800: Early sunspot observations resolve the old mystery|journal=Astrophys. J. Lett.|volume=700|page=L154|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/700/2/L154|arxiv=0907.0063|bibcode=2009ApJ...700L.154U}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this still remains not fully confirmed.

The smoothing was done using the traditional SIDC smoothing formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIDC smoothing formula|url=http://www.sidc.be/silso/node/52|website=WDC-SILSO|publisher=Royal Observatory of Belgium|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other smoothing formulas exist, and they usually give slightly different values for the amplitude and timings of the solar cycles. An example is the Meeus smoothing formula,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meeus|first1=J.|title=Une formule d'adoucissement pour l'activité solaire|journal=Ciel et Terre|date=1958|volume=74|page=445|bibcode=1958C&amp;T....74..445M}}&lt;/ref&gt; with related solar cycles characteristics available in this STCE news item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The solar cycle's new clothes|url=http://www.stce.be/news/312/welcome.html|website=STCE|publisher=Royal Observatory of Belgium|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the table below, the number of spotless days is the number between the maximum of the previous solar cycle and the maximum of the new solar cycle. As an example, there were 817 spotless days during the transit from solar cycle 23 to solar cycle 24.

The '''Malthusian trap''' or '''population trap''' is a condition whereby excess population would stop growing due to shortage of food supply leading to starvation. It is named for [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], who suggested that while technological advances could increase a society's supply of resources, such as food, and thereby improve the standard of living, the resource abundance would enable [[population growth]], which would eventually bring the per capita supply of resources back to its original level.  Some economists contend that since the [[industrial revolution]], mankind has broken out of the trap.&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galor |first=Oded |year=2005 |chapter=From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 |pages=171–293 |publisher=Elsevier |chapterurl=https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/grochp/1-04.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Gregory |year=2007 |title=A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12135-2 |title-link=A Farewell to Alms }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the continuation of [[extreme poverty]] indicates that the Malthusian trap continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Zinkina &amp; [[Andrey Korotayev]].

''World Futures'' 70/2 (2014): 120–39].&lt;/ref&gt; Others further argue that due to lack of food availability coupled with excessive pollution, developing countries show more evidence of the trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/197551/2/WP59.pdf|title=The Malthusian Trap and Development in Pre-Industrial Societies: A View Differing from the Standard One|last=Tisdell|first=Clem|date=1 January 2015|website=University of Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malthus' theoretical argument==
Malthus argued that society has a natural propensity to increase its population, a propensity that causes population growth to be the best measure of the happiness of a people: "The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population, Ch. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:
{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', Chapter II.}}

Malthus faced opposition from economists both during his life and since. A vocal critic several decades later was [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |last=Engels |first=Fredrick |authorlink= |year=1892 |publisher= Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co |location= London |isbn= |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1844engels.html }} Engels wrote that poverty and poor living conditions in 1844 had largely disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0521808781 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence to support the theory===
Research indicates that technological superiority and higher land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living during the time period 1–1500 AD.&lt;ref name="Ashraf and Galor, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashraf |first=Quamrul |first2=Oded |last2=Galor |year=2011 |title=Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=2003–41 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.2003 |pmid=25506082 |pmc=4262154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars have reported on the lack of a significant trend of wages in various places over the world for very long stretches of time.&lt;ref name="Clark2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=R. C. |title=The Great Divergence in European Wages and Prices from the Middle Ages to the First World War |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=411–47 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/exeh.2001.0775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Babylonia during the period 1800 to 1600 BC, for example, the daily wage for a common laborer was enough to buy about 15 pounds of wheat.  In Classical Athens in about 328 BC, the corresponding wage could buy about 24 pounds of wheat.  In England in 1800 AD the wage was about 13 pounds of wheat.&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;{{rp|50}} In spite of the technological developments across these societies, the daily wage hardly varied. In Britain between 1200 and 1800, only relatively minor fluctuations from the mean (less than a factor of two) in real wages occurred.  Following depopulation by the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics, real income in Britain peaked around 1450–1500 and began declining until the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] posits that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death throughout Europe had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making employers and landowners less well off while improving the economic prospects and living standards of workers. He says that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–93, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fogel]] published a study of lifespans and nutrition from about a century before Malthus to the 19th century that examined European birth and death records, military and other records of height and weight that found significant stunted height and low body weight indicative of chronic hunger and malnutrition.  He also found short lifespans that he attributed to chronic malnourishment which left people susceptible to disease.  Lifespans, height and weight began to steadily increase in the UK and France after 1750.  Fogel's findings are consistent with estimates of available food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0-521-80878-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Malthusian view==
{{See also|Malthusianism}}
The rapid increase in the global population since 1900 exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns, whereby expansion of food supply has encouraged population growth. "Neo-Malthusianism" may be used as a label for those who are concerned that [[human overpopulation]] may increase [[resource depletion]] or [[environmental degradation]] to a degree that is not [[sustainability|sustainable]]. Many in [[environmentalism|environmental movements]] express concern over the potential dangers of population growth.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb |author1=Pierre Desrochers |author2=Christine Hoffbauer |journal=[[International Policy Network|The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=3 |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- maybe highlight in text that opinions are from fake journal from pressure group, no CiteSeerX cite --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] published an influential essay in ''Science'' that drew heavily from Malthusian theory. His essay, [[Tragedy of the commons|"The Tragedy of the Commons,"]] argued that "a finite world can support only a finite population" and that "freedom to breed will bring ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|year=1968|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|journal=Science|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Club of Rome]] published a famous book entitled ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOcUZ9uquhEC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Taking Nature Into Account: A Report to the Club of Rome |editor=Wouter van Dieren |year=1995 |publisher=Springer Books |isbn=978-0-387-94533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] is a prominent neo-Malthusian who first raised concerns in 1968 with the publication of ''[[The Population Bomb]]''.

On the other hand, in 2011 [[Andrey Korotayev]] and his colleagues suggested that the emergence of major sociopolitical upheavals at the escape from the Malthusian trap is not an abnormal, but a regular phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Korotayev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79t737gt |title=A Trap At The Escape From The Trap? Demographic-Structural Factors of Political Instability in Modern Africa and West Asia |journal=Cliodynamics |volume=2/2 |year=2011 |pages=1–28 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev, A., Malkov, S., &amp; [[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] (2014).

Some demographic structural factors of political instability in modernizing social systems. ''History &amp; Mathematics'', 4, 201-267].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory that society has overcome the trap==
{{See also|Industrial Revolution#Causes|British Agricultural Revolution}}
The view that a "breakout" from the Malthusian trap has led to an era of sustained economic growth is explored by "[[unified growth theory]]".&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)" /&gt; One branch of unified growth theory is devoted to the interaction between human evolution and economic development. Some argue that natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and brought about the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Omer |last2=Moav |year=2002 |title=Natural Selection and The Origin of Economic Growth |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1133–91 |doi=10.1162/003355302320935007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.199.2634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers contend that a British breakout occurred due to technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, Alexander and Karol J. Borowiecki. Accounting for Breakout in Britain: The Industrial Revolution through a Malthusian Lens (2013). Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 639. Available at: https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has argued, in his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', that a British breakout may have been caused by differences in reproduction rates among the rich and the poor (the rich were more likely to marry, tended to have more children, and, in a society where disease was rampant and childhood mortality at times approached 50%, upper-class children were more likely to survive to adulthood than poor children.) This in turn led to sustained "downward mobility": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.

The '''National Medal of Technology and Innovation''' (formerly the '''National Medal of Technology''') is an honor granted by the [[President of the United States]] to American [[inventors]] and innovators who have made significant contributions to the development of new and important [[technology]]. The award may be granted to a specific person, to a group of people or to an entire [[organization]] or [[corporation]]. It is the highest honor the [[United States of America|United States]] can confer to a US citizen for achievements related to technological progress.

== History ==
The National Medal of Technology was created in 1980 by the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. It was a bipartisan effort to foster technological innovation and the technological competitiveness of the [[United States]] in the international arena. The first National Medals of Technology were issued in 1985 by [[Ronald Reagan|then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan]] to 12 individuals and one company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/about/nmti/recipients/1985.jsp The National Medal of Technology and Innovation Recipients: 1985 Laureates]. ''United States Patent and Trademark Office.''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first recipients were [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Stephen Wozniak]], founders of [[Apple Computer]]. The medal has since been awarded annually.

On August 9, 2007, President George Bush signed the America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act of 2007. The Act amended Section 16 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, changing the name of the Medal to the "National Medal of Technology and Innovation".&lt;ref name="official page" /&gt;

== Award process ==
[[Image:Ralphbaer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ralph Baer]] receives the National Medal of Technology]]
Each year the [[Technology Administration]] under the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] calls for the nomination of new candidates for the National Medal of Technology. Candidates are nominated by their peers who have direct, first-hand knowledge of the candidates achievements. Candidates may be individuals, teams of individuals (up to 4), organizations or corporations. Individuals and all members of teams nominated must be [[United States citizenship|U.S. citizens]] and organizations and corporations must be U.S.-owned (i.e. 50% of their assets or shares must be currently held by U.S. citizens).

All nominations are referred to the National Medal of Technology Evaluation Committee which issues recommendations to the [[United States Secretary of Commerce|U.S. Secretary of Commerce]]. All nominees selected as finalists through the merit review process will be subject to an [[FBI]] security check. Information collected through the security check may be considered in the final selection of winners. The Secretary of Commerce is then able to advise the President of the United States as to which candidates ought to receive the National Medal of Technology. The new National Medal of Technology laureates are then announced by the U.S. President once the final selections have been made.

== Laureates ==
{{As of|2005}}, there have been more than 135 individuals and 12 companies recognized. Summarized here is a list of notable laureates and a summary of their accomplishments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">'''Negative refraction''' is the name for an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] phenomenon where [[light]] [[ray (optics)|rays]] are [[refraction|refracted]] at an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] in the reverse sense to that normally expected.  Such an effect can be obtained using a [[metamaterial]] which has been designed to achieve a [[negative number|negative]] value for both (electric) [[permittivity]] ε and (magnetic) [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] μ, as in such cases the material can be assigned a negative [[refractive index]]. Such materials are sometimes called "double negative" materials.

Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive [[phase velocity]] (i.e. a positive [[refractive index]]), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (a negative [[refractive index]]).

==Negative phase velocity==

Negative phase velocity (NPV) is a property of light propagation in a [[optical medium|medium]].  There are different definitions of NPV, the most common being Veselago's original proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veselago|first=Viktor G|date=1968-04-30|title=THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTANCES WITH SIMULTANEOUSLY NEGATIVE VALUES OF $\epsilon$ AND μ|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1070%2FPU1968v010n04ABEH003699|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514|doi=10.1070/pu1968v010n04abeh003699|issn=0038-5670}}&lt;/ref&gt; of opposition of [[wavevector]] and (Abraham)  [[Poynting vector]], i.e. E×H; other common choices are opposition of [[wavevector]] to [[group velocity]], or to [[energy velocity]]. The use of "phase velocity" in the naming convention, as opposed to the perhaps more appropriate "wave vector", follows since phase velocity has the same sign as the wavevector.

A typical criterion used to determine Veselago NPV is that the dot product of the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector is negative (i.e. that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{P}\cdot\vec{k}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;); however this definition is not [[General covariance|covariant]].  Whilst this restriction is rarely of practical significance, the criterion has nevertheless been generalized into a covariant form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. W. McCall|doi=10.1016/j.metmat.2008.05.001|title=A Covariant Theory of Negative Phase Velocity Propagation|journal=Metamaterials|volume=2|issue=2–3|page=92|year=2008|bibcode = 2008MetaM...2...92M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For plane waves propagating in a Veselago NPV medium, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, rather than the usual right-hand rule.  This gives rise to the name "left-handed (meta)materials". However, the terms left-handed and right-handed can also arise in the study of chiral media, so this terminology is best avoided.

== Negative refractive index ==
[[Image:metarefraction.svg|thumb|A comparison of refraction in a left-handed metamaterial to that in a normal material]]
[[File:Negative refraction.ogv|thumb|Video representing negative refraction of light at uniform planar interface.]]

We can choose to avoid directly considering the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector or a propagating light field, and consider instead the response of the materials directly: that is, we consider what values of permittivity ε and permeability µ result in [[#Negative phase velocity|negative phase velocity]] (NPV).  Since both ε and µ are in general complex, their imaginary parts do not have to be negative for a passive (i.e. [[Attenuation|lossy]]) material to display negative refraction.  The most general [[Victor Veselago|Veselago]] criterion applying to ε and µ is that of Depine and [[Akhlesh Lakhtakia|Lakhtakia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = R. A. Depine and A. Lakhtakia |doi = 10.1002/mop.20127 |title = A new condition to identify isotropic dielectric-magnetic materials displaying negative phase velocity |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 41 |issue = 4 |pages = 315–316 |year = 2004 |arxiv = physics/0311029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other less general forms exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = P. Kinsler and M. W. McCall |doi = 10.1002/mop.23489 |title = Criteria for negative refraction in active and passive media |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 50 |issue = 7 |page = 1804 |year = 2008 |arxiv = 0806.1676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Depine-Lakhtakia criterion for negative phase velocity is

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_r|\mu|+ \mu_r |\epsilon| &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r, \mu_r&lt;/math&gt; are the real valued parts of ε and µ, respectively. However, negative refraction (negative refractive index) and negative phase velocity can be distinct from each other, even in passive materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Tom G.|last2=Lakhtakia|first2=Akhlesh|date=2009-06-12|title=Negative refraction, negative phase velocity, and counterposition in bianisotropic materials and metamaterials|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121|journal=Physical Review B|volume=79|issue=23|pages=235121|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in active materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = J. Skaar |doi = 10.1364/OL.31.003372 |title = On resolving the refractive index and the wave vector |journal = [[Optics Letters]] |volume = 31 |issue = 22 |pages = 3372–3374 |year = 2006 |arxiv = physics/0607104 |bibcode = 2006OptL...31.3372S |citeseerx = 10.1.1.261.8030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the [[refractive index]] ''n'' is determined using &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n =\pm\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, where by convention the positive square root is chosen for ''n''.  However, in NPV materials, we reverse that convention and pick the negative sign to mimic the fact that the wavevector (and hence phase velocity) are likewise reversed.  Strictly speaking, the refractive index is a derived quantity telling us how the wavevector is related to the optical frequency and propagation direction of the light, thus the sign of ''n'' must be chosen to match the physical situation.

==Refraction==
The principal symptom of negative refraction is just that – light rays are 
refracted on the ''same'' side of the normal on entering the material, as indicated in the diagram, and by a suitably general form of [[Snell's law]].

The '''nucleus incertus''' is a region of the rodent pontine [[brainstem]] just ventral to the 4th [[ventricle (brain)|ventricle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goto|first1=M|last2=Swanson|first2=LW|last3=Canteras|first3=NS|title=Connections of the nucleus incertus.|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=Sep 10, 2001|volume=438|issue=1|pages=86–122|pmid=11503154|doi=10.1002/cne.1303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nucleus incertus has a bilateral structure which sits near the brainstem, and is often also called 'nucleus O'.

{{Psychoanalysis |Schools}}

'''Object relations theory''' in [[psychoanalytic psychology]] is the process of developing a [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] in relation to others in the environment during childhood. Based on [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic theory]], the object relations theory suggests that the way people relate to others and situations in their adult lives is shaped by family experiences during infancy. For example, an adult who experienced neglect or abuse in infancy would expect similar behavior from others who remind them of the neglectful or abusive parent from their past. These images of people and events turn into ''objects'' in the unconscious that the "self" carries into adulthood, and they are used by the unconscious to predict people's behavior in their social relationships and interactions.

The first "object" in someone is usually an internalized image of one's mother. Internal objects are formed by the patterns in one's experience of being taken care of as a baby, which may or may not be accurate representations of the actual, external caretakers. Objects are usually internalized images of one's [[mother]], [[father]], or primary caregiver, although they could also consist of parts of a person such as an infant relating to the [[breast]] or things in one's inner world (one's internalized image of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Later experiences can reshape these early patterns, but objects often continue to exert a strong influence throughout life.&lt;ref name = Greenberg1983&gt;Greenberg, J. &amp; Mitchell, S. (1983). ''Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects are initially comprehended in the [[infant]] mind by their functions and are termed ''part objects''.&lt;ref name = Greenberg1983/&gt; The breast that feeds the hungry infant is the "good breast", while a hungry infant that finds no breast is in relation to the "bad breast".&lt;ref name = Greenberg1983/&gt; With a "good enough" facilitating environment, part object functions eventually transform into a comprehension of whole objects. This corresponds with the ability to tolerate ambiguity, to see that both the "good" and the "bad" breast are a part of the same mother figure.&lt;ref name = Greenberg1983/&gt;

==History==
The initial line of thought emerged in 1917 with [[Sándor Ferenczi|Ferenczi]] and, early in the 1930s, [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Sullivan]], coiner of the term "interpersonal,".&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, T. (2005). ''This Art of Psychoanalysis: Dreaming undreamt dreams and interrupted cries''. NY: Routledge. (p. 27).&lt;/ref&gt; British psychologists [[Melanie Klein]], [[Donald Winnicott]], [[Harry Guntrip]], Scott Stuart, and others extended object relations theory during the 1940s and 1950s. [[Ronald Fairbairn]] in 1952 independently formulated his theory of object relations.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn, W.R.D. (1952). ''Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Fairbairn popularized the term "object relations", Melanie Klein's work tends to be most commonly identified with the terms "object relations theory" and "British object relations", at least in contemporary North America, though the influence of 'what is known as the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|''British independent perspective'']], which argued that the primary motivation of the child is object seeking rather than drive gratification',&lt;ref&gt;Glen O. Gabbard, ''Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy'' (Washington, DC 2010) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; is becoming increasingly recognized. Klein felt that the psychodynamic battleground that Freud proposed occurs very early in life, during infancy. Furthermore, its origins are different from those that Freud proposed. The interactions between infant and mother are so deep and intense that they form the focus of the infant's structure of drives. Some of these interactions provoke anger and frustration; others provoke strong emotions of dependence as the child begins to recognize the mother is more than a breast from which to feed. These reactions threaten to overwhelm the individuality of the infant. The way in which the infant resolves the conflict, Klein believed, is reflected in the adult's personality.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, 1997 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] originally identified people in a subject's environment with the term "object" to identify people as the object of drives. Fairbairn took a radical departure from Freud by positing that humans were not seeking satisfaction of the drive, but actually seek the satisfaction that comes in being in relation to real others. Klein and Fairbairn were working along similar lines, but unlike Fairbairn, Klein always held that she was not departing from Freudian theory, but simply elaborating early developmental phenomena consistent with Freudian theory.

Within the London psychoanalytic community, a conflict of loyalties took place between Klein and object relations theory (sometimes referred to as "id psychology"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Fairbairn revised much of Freud's model of the mind. He identified how people who were abused as children internalize that experience. Fairbairn's "moral defense" is the tendency seen in survivors of abuse to take all the bad upon themselves, each believing he is morally bad so his caretaker object can be regarded as good. This is a use of [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] as a defense to maintain an attachment relationship in an unsafe world.  Fairbairn introduced a four-year-old girl with a broken arm to a doctor friend of his. He told the little girl that they were going to find her a new mommy. "Oh no!" the girl cried. "I want my real mommy."  "You mean the mommy that broke your arm?" Fairbairn asked. "I was bad," the girl replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Celani|first1=David|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231149077|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fairbairns-Object-Relations-Clinical-Setting/dp/0231149077/ref=la_B001ITYKYO_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462417226&amp;sr=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She needed to believe that her love object (mother) was all good, so that she could believe she would one day receive the love and nurturing she needed. If she accepted her mother was bad, then she would be bereft and alone in the world, an intolerable state. She used the Moral Defense to make herself bad, but preserve her mother's goodness.

==Kleinian object relations theory==

===Unconscious phantasy {{Anchor|Unconscious Phantasy|Kleinian Phantasy}}===
Klein termed the psychological aspect of instinct unconscious ''phantasy'' (deliberately spelled with 'ph' to distinguish it from the word 'fantasy'). Phantasy is a given of psychic life which moves outward towards the world. These image-potentials are given a priority with the drives and eventually allow the development of more complex states of mental life. Unconscious phantasy in the infant’s emerging mental life is modified by the environment as the infant has contact with reality.&lt;ref name="Segal 1981"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the moment the infant starts interacting with the outer world, he is engaged in testing his phantasies in a reality setting. I want to suggest that the origin of thought lies in this process of testing phantasy against reality; that is, that thought is not only contrasted with phantasy, but based on it and derived from it.&lt;ref name="Segal 1981" /&gt;{{rp|45}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The role of unconscious phantasy is essential in the development of a capacity for thinking. In [[Wilfred Bion|Bion's]] terms, the phantasy image is a preconception that will not be a thought until experience combines with a realization in the world of experience. The preconception and realization combine to take form as a concept that can be thought.&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W. (1962) "A theory of thinking". In ''Second thoughts: Selected papers on psycho-analysis'' (pp. 111–119). London: Karnac. 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W. (1977). Two papers: The grid and caesura. Karnac: London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, T. (1990). ''The matrix of the mind: Object relations and the psychoanalytic dialogue''. Lanham, MD: Aronson.&lt;/ref&gt; The classic example of this is the infant’s observed rooting for the nipple in the first hours of life. The instinctual rooting is the preconception. The provision of the nipple provides the realization in the world of experience, and through time, with repeated experience, the preconception and realization combined to create the concept. Mental capacity builds upon previous experience as the environment and infant interact.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first bodily experiences begin to build up the first memories, and external realities are progressively woven into the texture of phantasy. Before long, the child's phantasies are able to draw upon plastic images as well as sensations—visual, auditory, kinæsthetic, touch, taste, smell images, etc. And these plastic images and dramatic representations of phantasy are progressively elaborated along with articulated perceptions of the external world.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, S. (1948). "The Nature and Function of Phantasy". ''International Journal of Psycho-Analysis'', v. 29, pp. 73–98 . Retrieved December 17, 2007 from PEP Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
With adequate care, the infant is able to tolerate increasing awareness of experience which is underlain by unconscious phantasy and leads to attainment of consecutive developmental achievements, "the positions" in Kleinian theory.

[Projection] helps the ego to overcome anxiety by ridding it of danger and badness. Introjection of the good object is also used by the ego as a defense against anxiety. . . .The processes of splitting off parts of the self and projecting them into objects are thus of vital importance for normal development as well as for abnormal object-relation. The effect of introjection on object relations is equally important. The introjection of the good object, first of all the mother’s breast, is a precondition for normal development . . . It comes to form a focal point in the ego and makes for cohesiveness of the ego. . . . I suggest for these processes the term ‘projective identification’.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|6–9}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Klein imagined this function as a defense which contributes to the normal development of the infant, including ego structure and the development of object relations. The [[introjection]] of the good breast provides a location where one can hide from persecution, an early step in developing a capacity to self-soothe.

Projective identification serves as a mode of communication. It is a form of object relations, and “a pathway for psychological change.”&lt;ref name="Ogden 77" /&gt;{{rp|21}} As a form of object relationship, projective identification is a way of relating with others who are not seen as entirely separate from the individual. Instead, this relating takes place “between the stage of the subjective object and that of true object relatedness”.&lt;ref name="Ogden 77" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

===The paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions===
{{main article|paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions}}

The positions of Kleinian theory, underlain by unconscious phantasy, are stages in the normal development of ego and object relationships, each with its own characteristic defenses and organizational structure.  The paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions occur in the pre-oedipal, oral phase of development.

In contrast to Fairbairn and later Guntrip,&lt;ref&gt;Guntrip, H. (1975). ''Schizoid phenomena, object relations and the self''. Madison, CT: International Universities Press. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Klein believed that both good and bad objects are introjected by the infant, the internalization of good object being essential to the development of healthy ego function.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Klein conceptualized the depressive position as “the most mature form of psychological organization”, which continues to develop throughout the life span.&lt;ref name="Ogden 1989"&gt;{{cite book

The depressive position occurs during the second quarter of the first year.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|14}} Prior to that the infant is in the paranoid-schizoid position, which is characterized by persecutory anxieties and the mechanisms of splitting, projection, introjection, and omnipotence—which includes idealizing and denial—to defend against these anxieties.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Depressive and paranoid-schizoid modes of experience continue to intermingle throughout the first few years of childhood.

====Paranoid-schizoid position====
The paranoid-schizoid position is characterized by part object relationships. Part objects are a function of splitting, which takes place in phantasy. At this developmental stage, experience can only be perceived as all good or all bad. As part objects, it is the function that is identified by the experiencing self, rather than whole and autonomous others. The hungry infant desires the good breast who feeds it. Should that breast appear, it is the good breast. If the breast does not appear, the hungry and now frustrated infant in its distress, has destructive phantasies dominated by oral aggression towards the bad, hallucinated breast.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

Klein notes that in splitting the object, the ego is also split.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|6}} The infant who phantasies destruction of the bad breast is not the same infant that takes in the good breast, at least not until obtaining the depressive position, at which point good and bad can be tolerated simultaneously in the same person and the capacity for remorse and reparation ensue.

The anxieties of the paranoid schizoid position are of a persecutory nature, fear of the ego’s annihilation.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Splitting allows good to stay separate from bad. Projection is an attempt to eject the bad in order to control through omnipotent mastery. Splitting is never fully effective, according to Klein, as the ego tends towards integration.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|34}}

====Depressive position====
Klein saw the depressive position as an important developmental milestone that continues to mature throughout the life span. The splitting and part object relations that characterize the earlier phase are succeeded by the capacity to perceive that the other who frustrates is also the one who gratifies. Schizoid defenses are still in evidence, but feelings of guilt, grief, and the desire for reparation gain dominance in the developing mind.

In the depressive position, the infant is able to experience others as whole, which radically alters object relationships from the earlier phase.&lt;ref name="Klein 1946" /&gt;{{rp|3}} “Before the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object. It is only in the depressive position that polar qualities can be seen as different aspects of the same object.”&lt;ref name="Grotstein 1981"&gt;{{cite book

In a development which Grotstein terms the "primal split",&lt;ref name="Grotstein 1981" /&gt;{{rp|39}} the infant becomes aware of separateness from the mother.  This awareness allows guilt to arise in response to the infant’s previous aggressive phantasies when bad was split from good. The mother’s temporary absences allow for continuous restoration of her “as an image of representation” in the infant mind.&lt;ref name="Grotstein 1981" /&gt;{{rp|39}} Symbolic thought may now arise, and can only emerge once access to the depressive position has been obtained. With the awareness of the primal split, a space is created in which the symbol, the symbolized, and the experiencing subject coexist. History, subjectivity, interiority, and empathy all become possible.&lt;ref name="Ogden 1989" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

The anxieties characteristic of the depressive position shift from a fear of being destroyed to a fear of destroying others. In fact or phantasy, one now realizes the capacity to harm or drive away a person who one ambivalently loves. The defenses characteristic of the depressive position include the manic defenses, repression and reparation. The manic defenses are the same defenses evidenced in the paranoid-schizoid position, but now mobilized to protect the mind from depressive anxiety. As the depressive position brings about an increasing integration in the ego, earlier defenses change in character, becoming less intense and allow increasing awareness of psychic reality.&lt;ref name="Klein 1952"&gt;{{Cite book

In working through depressive anxiety, projections are withdrawn, allowing the other more autonomy, reality, and a separate existence.&lt;ref name="Segal 1981" /&gt;{{rp|16}} The infant, whose destructive phantasies were directed towards the bad mother who frustrated, now begins to realize that bad and good, frustrating and satiating, it is always the same mother. Unconscious guilt for destructive phantasies arises in response to the continuing love and attention provided by caretakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[As] fears of losing the loved one become active, a very important step is made in the development. These feelings of guilt and distress now enter as a new element into the emotion of love. They become an inherent part of love, and influence it profoundly both in quality and quantity.&lt;ref name="Klein 1964"&gt;{{Cite book

From this developmental milestone come a capacity for sympathy, responsibility to and concern for others, and an ability to identify with the subjective experience of people one cares about.&lt;ref name="Klein 1964" /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} With the withdrawal of the destructive projections, repression of the aggressive impulses takes place.&lt;ref name="Klein 1952" /&gt;{{rp|72–73}} The child allows caretakers a more separate existence, which facilitates increasing differentiation of inner and outer reality. Omnipotence is lessened, which corresponds to a decrease in guilt and the fear of loss.&lt;ref name="Segal 1981" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

When all goes well, the developing child is able to comprehend that external others are autonomous people with their own needs and subjectivity.

Previously, extended absences of the object (the good breast, the mother) was experienced as persecutory, and, according to the theory of [[Object relations theory#Unconscious Phantasy|unconscious phantasy]], the persecuted infant phantisizes destruction of the bad object. The good object who then arrives is not the object which did not arrive. Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object.

In phantasy, the good internal mother can be psychically destroyed by the aggressive impulses. It is crucial that the real parental figures are around to demonstrate the continuity of their love. In this way, the child perceives that what happens to good objects in phantasy does not happen to them in reality. Psychic reality is allowed to evolve as a place separate from the literalness of the physical world.

Through repeated experience with good enough parenting, the internal image that the child has of external others, that is the child's internal object, is modified by experience and the image transforms, merging experiences of good and bad which becomes more similar to the real object (e.g. the mother, who can be both good and bad). In Freudian terms, the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] is modified by the [[reality principle]].

Melanie Klein saw this surfacing from the depressive position as a prerequisite for social life. Moreover, she viewed the establishment of an inside and an outside world as the start of interpersonal relationships.

Klein argued that people who never succeed in working through the depressive position in their childhood will, as a result, continue to struggle with this problem in adult life. For example: the cause that a person may maintain suffering from intense guilt feelings over the death of a loved one, may be found in the unworked- through depressive position. The guilt is there because of a lack of differentiation between phantasy and reality. It also functions as a [[defense mechanism]] to defend the self against unbearable feelings of sadness and sorrow, and the internal object of the loved one against the unbearable rage of the self, which, it is feared, could destroy the internal object forever.

====Further thinking regarding the positions====
[[Wilfred Bion]] articulates the dynamic nature of the positions, a point emphasised by [[Thomas Ogden]], and expanded by [[John Steiner]] in terms of '"The equilibrium between the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions"'.&lt;ref&gt;John Steiner, in Robin Anderson ed., ''Clinical Lectures on Klein and Bion'' (London 1992) p. 46-58&lt;/ref&gt; Ogden and [[James Grotstein]] have continued to explore early infantile states of mind, and incorporating the work of [[Donald Meltzer]], [[Ester Bick]] and others, postulate a position preceding the paranoid-schizoid.  Grotstein, following Bion, also hypothesizes a transcendent position which emerges following attainment of the depressive position. This aspect of both Ogden and Grotstein's work remains controversial for many within classical object relations theory.

===Death drive===
[[Sigmund Freud]] developed the concept [[object relation]] to describe or emphasize that bodily [[drive theory|drive]]s satisfy their need through a medium, an object, on a specific focus. The central thesis in [[Melanie Klein]]'s object relations theory was that objects play a decisive role in the development of a subject and can be either part-objects or whole-objects, i.e. a single organ (a mother's breast) or a whole person (a mother). Consequently, both a mother or just the mother's breast can be the focus of satisfaction for a drive. Furthermore, according to traditional psychoanalysis, there are at least two types of drives, the [[libido]] (mythical counterpart: [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]]), and the [[death]] drive, [[mortido]] (mythical counterpart: [[Thanatos]]). Thus, the objects can be receivers of both [[love]] and [[hate]], the affective effects of the [[libido]] and the death drive.

==Ronald Fairbairn's Six Ego Positions==

Fairbairn posited six ego positions or inner voices, or 3 pairs:&lt;ref name="Columbia University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Celani|first1=David|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231149077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Whole Ego relating to the Good Object''', is the healthy inner child relating to the patient and nurturing inner parent. This is the part of the inner world that object relations therapists try to expand and grow. 
* '''The Antilibidinal Ego relating to the Bad Object''', is the depressed, angry or hopeless inner child relating to the rejecting or neglectful inner parent. Whenever someone speaks in a tantrum-like way they are speaking from the Antilibidinal Ego, and they are speaking to the Bad Object. Whenever someone is overly critical and harshly judgmental they are speaking from the Bad Object part of their personality, and are speaking to the Antilibidinal Ego (hopeless inner child). 
* '''The Libidinal Ego relating to the Exciting Object''', is the gullible and overly hopeful inner child relating to the exciting over-promising inner parent. Whenever a person goes back to their cheating or abusive spouse they are operating from their Libidinal Ego and relating to the Exciting Object in their inner worlds. Whenever they are in an addiction they are treating whatever they are addicted to as if it were an Exciting Object.

The Fairbairnian Object Relations therapist imagines that all interactions between the client and the therapist are occurring in the client's inner object relations world, in one of the three dyads. If the client thinks the therapist is wise and compassionate the therapist sees this as an interaction between the client's Libidinal Ego and Exciting Object. If the client is angry at the therapist for not meeting the client's needs, the therapist might see it as an interaction between the client's Antilibidinal Ego and the Bad Object. The therapist might ask the client if this particular interaction reminds the client of something from childhood.

The Fairbairnian Object Relations therapist also uses his/her own emotional reactions as therapeutic cues. If the therapist is feeling irritated at the client, or bored, he/she might interpret that as a re-enactment of the Antilibidinal Ego and the Bad Object, with the therapist cast in the role of Bad Object. If the therapist can patiently be an empathic therapist through the client's re-enactment, then the client has a new experience to incorporate into their inner object world, hopefully expanding their inner picture of their Good Object. Cure is seen as the client being able to receive from their inner Good Object often enough to have a more stable peaceful life.&lt;ref name="Columbia University Press"/&gt;

The Fairbairnian Object Relations Therapist also uses their mistakes in the therapy. If the therapist has absent mindedly made a mistake that hurts the client, the therapist admits the mistake, and empathizes with the client's pain, but instead of apologizing, the therapist asks: How did this mistake in therapy re-enact a childhood scene?

The Personality Studies Institute, guided by [[Otto F. Kernberg]], in New York City receives referrals from surrounding therapists who have become frustrated with the most severe personality disordered clients. Therapists at the Institute wean their clients off all anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, and then work with the clients using Transference Focused Psychotherapy, a form of Object Relations Theory. A typical successful therapy lasts 150 sessions.

Numerous research studies have found that most all models of psychotherapy are equally helpful, the difference mainly being the quality of the individual therapist, not the theory the therapist subscribes to. Object Relations Theory attempts to explain this phenomenon via the theory of the Good Object. If a therapist can be patient and empathic, most clients improve their functioning in their world. The client carries with them a picture of the empathic therapist that helps them cope with the stressors of daily life, regardless of what theory of psychology they subscribe to.

==Continuing developments in the theory==
[[Attachment theory]], researched by [[John Bowlby]] and others, has continued to deepen our understanding of early object relationships. While a different strain of psychoanalytic theory and research, the findings in attachment studies have continued to support the validity of the developmental progressions described in object relations. Recent decades in developmental psychological research, for example on the onset of a "[[Theory of mind#Theory of Mind — Understanding that others have minds with separate beliefs desires and intentions|theory of mind]]" in children, has suggested that the formation of the mental world is enabled by the infant-parent interpersonal interaction which was the main thesis of British object-relations tradition (e.g. Fairbairn, 1952).

While object relations theory grew out of psychoanalysis, it has been applied to the general fields of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychotherapy]] by such authors as [[N. Gregory Hamilton]]&lt;ref name=ORT&gt;http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=166427 ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' article\&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pharmacotherapy&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Richard Hudson Bryan''' (born July 16, 1937) is an American [[Attorney at law|attorney]] and [[politician]] who served as the [[List of Governors of Nevada|25th Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]] from 1983–89, and as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Nevada from 1989 to 2001. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

==Early life==
Bryan was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] and graduated from the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] at [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] in 1959 where he was a member of [[Alpha Tau Omega]] and the president of ASUN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous ATOs|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/atohistory/famousatos.aspx|work=Alpha Tau Omega|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned his law degree from the [[University of California]], [[Hastings College of Law]]. In 1963 he was admitted to the [[State Bar of Nevada|Nevada Bar]].

==Political career==
===1972–1989===
Bryan served as a member of the [[Nevada Senate]] from 1972 to 1978. In 1979, Bryan became the [[Nevada Attorney General]], and served in the position until 1983. Bryan was the [[Governor of Nevada]] from 1983 to 1989.

===U.S. Senate (1989–2001)===
After that, he represented Nevada in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] from 1989 until 2001. Bryan served on the following Senate Committees: [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]], [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Banking]], Vice Chairman-[[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] and [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation|Commerce]]. He chose not to run for re-election in 2000.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces2000/stories/bryan021999.htm Bryan Not to Seek Re-election] Washington Post, 19/02/99, Retrieved 12/04/18&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan was an opponent of [[SETI]] and introduced an amendment to the 1994 budget that secured the cancellation of the [[High Resolution Microwave Survey]] and terminated NASA's SETI efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Amir|last=Alexander|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_12.html|accessdate=February 4, 2010|title=A History of SETI - Explore the Cosmos|work=[[The Planetary Society]]|publisher=[[The Planetary Society]]|quote=But less than one year after their launch, both searches were suddenly and irrevocably terminated, victims of a new wave of Congressional budget cuts. This time it was Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada who led the charge against governmental expenditures on SETI. "The Great Martian Chase," he said, "may finally come to an end. As of today millions have been spent and we have yet to bag a single little green fellow. Not a single Martian has said take me to your leader, and not a single flying saucer has applied for FAA approval."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909212305/http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_12.html|archivedate=September 9, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=H. Paul Shuch|title=Searching for extraterrestrial intelligence: SETI past, present, and future|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-13195-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA criticized Bryan for his opposition to its SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, especially because Bryan ignored the meeting requests from NASA staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Stephen|title=Searching for Good Science: The Cancellation of NASA's SETI Program|url=https://history.nasa.gov/garber.pdf|website=Nasa History Office|publisher=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus was on preventing [[Yucca Mountain]], Nevada, being used as a [[nuclear waste]] long-term storage site. Though [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|the repository]] would be built during Bryan's time in the senate, his opposition, along with [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository#Opposition|numerous others']], delayed any actual storage occurring. This opposition would continue long after Bryan had retired before plans for storage were discontinued by [[President Obama]].&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

The '''Saturn-Shuttle''' was a preliminary concept of launching the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] using the [[Saturn V]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satuttle.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was studied and considered in 1971-1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld036.htm ''Phase B' Shuttle contractor studies 1971'']&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[interstage]] would be fitted on top of the [[S-IC]] stage to support the external tank in the space occupied by the [[S-II]] stage in the Saturn V. It was an alternative to the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRB]]s.

The addition of wings (and some form of landing gear) on the S-IC stage would allow the booster to [[VTVL|fly back]] to the [[Kennedy Space Center]], where technicians would then refurbish the booster (by replacing only the five [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The Shuttle would handle space station logistics, while Saturn V would launch components. 
This would have allowed the [[International Space Station]], using a [[Skylab]] or [[Mir]] configuration with both U.S. and Russian docking ports, to have been lifted with just a handful of launches. The Saturn-Shuttle concept also would have eliminated the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters]] that ultimately precipitated the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' accident]] in 1986.

==Performance==
Because the shuttle orbiter would be riding piggyback on the external tank, and the need to prevent damage to the delicate thermal protection tiles, the five-engine variant of the Saturn-Shuttle would require the center engine to be shut down 45 to 50 seconds after launch, while two of the outboard engines would have to be shut down prior to staging. Once the S-IC was jettisoned, the three onboard high-energy [[Space Shuttle main engines]] would then propel the orbiter into LEO, shutting down 6.5 minutes after ignition. The external tank would then be jettisoned, as on the actually flown shuttle configuration, and the orbiter would then perform its mission.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

But because of the need to keep costs down and to allow President [[Richard Nixon]] to approve the shuttle program in 1972, NASA decided to utilize segmented solid rocket boosters similar to those used on the [[Titan III]] rocket instead of the S-IC, thus ending the Saturn program after the initial Saturn V order was completed.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''''Scientriffic''''' was a bi-monthly kids [[List of science magazines|science magazine]] published by [[CSIRO Publishing]]. It was established in 1999 as a sister publication to [[The Helix (magazine)|''The Helix'']], CSIRO Publishing's [[magazine]] for teens. ''Scientriffic'' targeted kids aged 7 and older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientriffic Magazine Antarctic Issue|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/education-resources/scientriffic-magazine-antarctic-issue|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=Department of the Environment and Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was usually 40 pages long and trimmed to [[quarto]] paper size. It typically contained feature articles about [[science]] and [[mathematics]] of interest to kids.

The magazine was relaunched in July 2015 as ''Double Helix'', combining both ''Scientriffic'' and ''The Helix'' into one magazine, starting from Issue 1, with 8 issues per year.

==Editors==
The final [[editor-in-chief]] was Sarah Kellett. Previous editors included Bianca Nogrady, Heather Catchpole, Cristy Burne, Tanya Patrick and Jasmine Fellows.

'''Social development theory''' attempts to explain qualitative changes in the structure and framework of [[society]], that help the society to better realize  aims and objectives. Development can be  defined in a manner applicable to all societies at all historical periods as an upward ascending movement featuring greater levels of energy, efficiency, quality, productivity, complexity, comprehension, creativity, mastery, enjoyment and accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Garry and Asokan N., "Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Social Development". In: ''Human Choice'', [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]], USA, 1999, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Development is a process of [[social change]], not merely a set of policies and programs instituted for some specific results. During the last five centuries this process has picked up in speed and intensity, and during the last five decades has witnessed a marked surge in acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Peace and Food, ''Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development'', Zed Books, UK, 1994, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic mechanism driving social change is increasing awareness leading to better organization. When society senses new and better opportunities for progress it develops new forms of organization to exploit these new openings successfully. The new forms of organization are better able to harness the available social energies and skills and resources to use the opportunities to get the intended results.

Development is governed by many factors that influence the results of developmental efforts. There must be a motive that drives the social change and essential preconditions for that change to occur. The motive must be powerful enough to overcome obstructions that impede that change from occurring. Development also requires resources such as capital, technology, and supporting infrastructure.

Development is the result of society's capacity to organize resources to meet challenges and opportunities. Society passes through well-defined stages in the course of its development. They are [[nomadic]] [[Hunting and gathering society|hunting and gathering]], [[agrarian society|rural agrarian]], [[Urban area|urban]], commercial, industrial, and [[post-industrial]] societies. Pioneers introduce new ideas, practices, and habits that conservative elements initially resist. At a later stage, innovations are accepted, imitated, organized, and used by other members of the community. Organizational improvements introduced to support the innovations can take place simultaneously at four different levels&amp;mdash;physical, social, mental, and psychological. Moreover four different types of resources are involved in promoting development. Of these four, physical resources are most visible, but least capable of expansion. Productivity of resources increases enormously as the quality of organization and level of knowledge inputs rise.

Development pace and scope varies according to the stage society is in. The three main stages are physical, vital (''vital'' refers to the dynamic and nervous social energies of humanity that propel individuals to accomplish), and mental.

==Terminology==

'''Though the term ''development'' usually refers to economic progress, it can apply to political, social, and technological progress as well. These various sectors of society are so intertwined that it is difficult to neatly separate them. Development in all these sectors is governed by the same principles and laws, and therefore the term applies uniformly.

[[Economic development]] and [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] need not mean the same thing. Strategies and policies aimed at greater growth may produce greater income in a country without improving the average living standard. This happened in oil-producing [[Middle East]]ern countries—a surge in oil prices boosted their national income without much benefit to poorer citizens. Conversely, people-oriented programs and policies can improve health, education, living standards, and other quality-of-life measures with no special emphasis on monetary growth. This occurred in the 30 years of socialist and communist rule in Kerala in India.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Fic (1970), "Kerala: Yenan of India The Rise of Communist Power 1937 -1969" (Nachiketa Publishing Bombay)&lt;/ref&gt;

Four related but distinct terms and phenomena form successive steps in a graded series: survival, growth, development, and evolution. Survival refers to a [[subsistence]] lifestyle with no marked qualitative changes in living standards. Growth refers to horizontal expansion in the existing plane characterized by quantitative expansion—such as a farmer increasing the area under cultivation, or a retailer opening more stores. Development refers to a vertical shift in the level of operations that causes qualitative changes, such as a retailer turning into a manufacturer or an elementary school turning into a high school.

==Human development==

Development is a human process, in the sense that human beings, not material factors, drive development. The energy and aspiration of people who seek development form the motive force that drives development. People's awareness may decide the direction of development. Their efficiency, productivity, creativity, and organizational capacities determine the level of people’s accomplishment and enjoyment. Development is the outer realization of latent inner potentials. The level of people's education, intensity of their aspiration and energies, quality of their attitudes and values, skills and information all affect the extent and pace of development. These factors come into play whether it is the development of the individual, family, community, nation, or the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Garry and Asokan, N., "Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Social Development". In: ''Human Choice'', [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]], USA, 1999, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process of emergence of new activities in society==

===Unconscious vs. conscious development===

Human development normally proceeds from experience to comprehension. As society develops over centuries, it accumulates the experience of countless pioneers. The essence of that experience becomes the formula for accomplishment and success. The fact that experience precedes knowledge can be taken to mean that development is an unconscious process that gets carried out first, while knowledge becomes conscious later on only. ''Unconscious'' refers to activities that people carry out without knowing what the end results will be, or where their actions will lead. They carry out the acts without knowing the conditions required for success.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Garry and Asokan, N., "Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Social Development". In: ''Human Choice'', [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]], USA, 1999, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of pioneering individuals===

The gathering conscious knowledge of society matures and breaks out on the surface in the form of new ideas—espoused by pioneers who also take new initiatives to give expression to those ideas. Those initiatives may call for new strategies and new organizations, which conservative elements may resist. If the pioneer's initiatives succeed, it encourages imitation and slow propagation in the rest of the community. Later, growing success leads to society assimilating the new practice, and it becomes regularized and institutionalized. This can be viewed in three distinct phases of social preparedness, initiative of pioneers, and assimilation by the society.

The pioneer as such plays an important role in the development process—since through that person, unconscious knowledge becomes conscious. The awakening comes to the lone receptive individual first, and that person spreads the awakening to the rest of the society. Though pioneers appear as lone individuals, they act as conscious representatives of society as a whole, and their role should be viewed in that light.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, Harlan and Jacobs, Garry, ''The Genetic Code for Social Development". In: ''Human Choice'', [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]], USA, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imitation of the pioneer===

Though a pioneer comes up with innovative ideas very often the initial response to a pioneer is one of indifference, ridicule or even one of outright hostility. If the pioneer persists and succeeds in an initiative, that person's efforts may eventually get the endorsement of the public. That endorsement tempts others to imitate the pioneer. If they also succeed, news spreads and brings wider acceptance. Conscious efforts to lend organizational support to the new initiative helps institutionalize the new innovation.

===Organization of new activities===

Organization is the human capacity to harness all available information, knowledge, resources, technology, infrastructure, and human skills to exploit new opportunities—and the face challenges and hurdles that block progress. Development comes through improvements in the human capacity for organization. In other words, development comes through emergence of better organizations that enhance society's capacity to make use of opportunities and face challenges.

The development of organizations may come through formulation of new laws and regulations, or through new systems. Each new step of progress brings a corresponding new organization. Increasing European international trade in the 16th and 17th centuries demanded corresponding development in the banking industry, as well as new commercial laws and civil arbitration facilities. New types of business ventures formed to attract the capital needed to finance expanding trade. As a result, a new business entity appeared—the [[joint-stock company]], which limited the investors' liability to the extent of their personal investment without endangering other properties.

Each new developmental advance is accompanied by new or more suitable organizations that facilitate that advance. Often, existing inadequate organizations must change to accommodate new advances.

Many countries have introduced scores of new reforms and procedures—such as the release of business directories, franchising, lease purchase,service, credit rating, collection agencies, industrial estates, free trade zones, and credit cards. Additionally, a diverse range of Internet services have formed. Each new facility improves effective use of available social energies for productive purposes. The importance of these facilities for speeding development is apparent when they are absent. When Eastern European countries wanted to transition to [[Market economy|market-type economies]], they were seriously hampered in their efforts due to the absence of supportive systems and facilities.organisation is not only development that we are also have oppourtunities for doing new activities in the society by knowing new sourses we can achieve some what what we have seen in that new innovations &amp; developments

===Organization matures into institution===

At a particular stage, organizations mature into institutions that become part of society. Beyond this point, an organization does not need laws or agencies to foster growth or ensure a continued presence. The transformation of an organization into an institution signifies society's total acceptance of that new organization.

The income tax office is an example of an organization that is actively maintained by the enactment of laws and the formation of an office for procuring taxes. Without active governmental support, this organization would disappear, as it does not enjoy universal public support. On the other hand, the institution of marriage is universally accepted, and would persist even if governments withdrew regulations that demand registration of marriage and impose age restrictions. The institution of marriage is sustained by the weight of tradition, not by government agencies and legal enactments.

===Cultural transmission by the family===

Families play a major role in the propagation of new activities once they win the support of the society. A family is a miniature version of the larger society—acceptance by the larger entity is reflected in the smaller entity. The family educates the younger generation and transmits social values like self-restraint, responsibility, skills, and occupational training. Though children do not follow their parents' footsteps as much as they once did, parents still mold their children's attitudes and thoughts regarding careers and future occupations. When families propagate a new activity, it signals that the new activity has become an integral part of the society.

==Education==

One of the most powerful means of propagating and sustaining new developments is the [[education]]al system in a society. Education transmits society's collective knowledge from one generation to the next. It equips each new generation to face future opportunities and challenges with knowledge gathered from the past. It shows the young generation the opportunities ahead for them, and thereby raises their aspiration to achieve more. Information imparted by education raises the level of expectations of youth, as well as aspirations for higher income. It also equips youth with the mental capacity to devise ways and means to improve productivity and enhance living standards.

Society can be conceived as a complex fabric that consists of interrelated activities, systems, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Peace and Food, ''Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development'', Zed Books , UK, 1994, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Development occurs when this complex fabric improves its own organization. That organizational improvement can take place simultaneously in several dimensions.
* Quantitative expansion in the volume of social activities
* Qualitative expansion in the content of all those elements that make up the social fabric
* Geographic extension of the social fabric to bring more of the population under the cover of that fabric
* Integration of existing and new organizations so the social fabric functions more efficiently

Such organizational innovations occur all the time, as a continuous process. New organizations emerge whenever a new developmental stage is reached, and old organizations are modified to suit new developmental requirements. The impact of these new organizations may be powerful enough to make people believe they are powerful in their own right—but it is society that creates the new organizations required to achieve its objectives.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The direction that the developmental process takes is influenced by the population's awareness of opportunities. Increasing awareness leads to greater aspiration, which releases greater energy that helps bring about greater accomplishment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Resources==

Since the time of the English economist [[Thomas Malthus]], some have thought that capacity for development is limited by availability of natural resources. Resources can be divided into four major categories: physical, social, mental, and human. Land, water, mineral and oil, etc. constitute physical resources. Social resources consist of society's capacity to manage and direct complex systems and activities. Knowledge, information and technology are mental resources. The energy, skill and capacities of people constitute human resources.

The science of [[economics]] is much concerned with scarcity of resources. Though physical resources are limited, social, mental, and human resources are not subject to inherent limits. Even if these appear limited, there is no fixity about the limitation, and these resources continue to expand over time. That expansion can be accelerated by the use of appropriate strategies. In recent decades the rate of growth of these three resources has accelerated dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Peace and Food, ''Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development'', Zed Books, UK, 1994, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of physical resources tends to diminish as society moves to higher developmental levels. Correspondingly, the role of non-material resources increases as development advances. One of the most important non-material resources is information, which has become a key input. Information is a non-material resource that is not exhausted by distribution or sharing. Greater access to information helps increase the pace of its development. Ready access to information about economic factors helps investors transfer capital to sectors and areas where it fetches a higher return. Greater input of non-material resources helps explain the rising productivity of societies in spite of a limited physical resource base.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Application of higher non-material inputs also raises the productivity of physical inputs. Modern technology has helped increase the proven sources of oil by 50% in recent years—and at the same time, reduced the cost of search operations by 75%. Moreover, technology shows it is possible to reduce the amount of physical inputs in a wide range of activities. [[Agricultural science|Scientific agricultural methods]] demonstrated that soil productivity could be raised through synthetic fertilizers. Dutch farm scientists have demonstrated that a minimal water consumption of 1.4 liters is enough to raise a kilogram of vegetables, compared to the thousand liters that traditional irrigation methods normally require.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[Henry Ford]]'s assembly line techniques reduced the man-hours of labor required to deliver a car from 783 minutes to 93 minutes. These examples show that the greater input of higher non-material resources can raise the productivity of physical resources and thereby extend their limits.&lt;ref&gt;Macfarlane, Robert and Van Harten, Robert. "Engines of Development". In: ''Human Choice'', [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]], USA, 1999, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of technological development==

When the mind engages in pure creative thinking, it comes up with new thoughts and ideas. When it applies itself to society it can come up with new organizations. When it turns to the study of nature, it discovers nature's laws and mechanisms. When it applies itself to technology, it makes new discoveries and practical inventions that boost productivity. Technical creativity has had an erratic course through history, with some intense periods of creative output followed by some dull and inactive periods. However, the period since 1700 has been marked by an intense burst of technological creativity that is multiplying human capacities exponentially.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Though many reasons can be cited for the accelerating pace of technological inventions,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} a major cause is the role played by mental creativity in an increasing atmosphere of freedom. Political freedom and liberation from religious dogma had a powerful impact on creative thinking during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Dogmas and superstitions greatly restricted mental creativity. For example, when the astronomer [[Copernicus]] proposed a [[heliocentric]] view of the world, the church rejected it{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} because it did not conform to established religious doctrine. When [[Galileo]] used a [[telescope]] to view the planets, the church condemned the device as an instrument of the devil, as it seemed so unusual. The Enlightenment shattered such obscurantist fetters on freedom of thought. From then on, the spirit of experimentation thrived.

Though technological inventions have increased the pace of development, the tendency to view developmental accomplishments as mainly powered by technology misses the bigger picture. Technological innovation was spurred by general advances in the social organization of knowledge. In the [[Middle Ages]], efforts at scientific progress were few, mainly because there was no effective system to preserve and disseminate knowledge. Since there was no organized protection for patent rights, scientists and inventors were secretive about observations and discoveries. Establishment of scientific associations and scientific journals spurred the exchange of knowledge and created a written record for posterity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Technological development depends on social organizations. Nobel laureate economist [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]] observed that the mechanization of factory production in England—the [[Industrial Revolution]]—was a direct result of the reorganization of English agriculture. Enclosure of [[common land]]s in England generated surplus income for farmers. That extra income generated additional raw materials for industrial processing, and produced greater demand for industrial products that traditional manufacturing processes could not meet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The opening of sea trade further boosted demand for industrial production for export. Factory production increased many times when production was reorganized to use steam energy, combined with moving assembly lines, specialization, and division of labor. Thus, technological development was both a result of and a contributing factor to the overall development of society.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Individual scientific inventions do not spring out of the blue. They build on past accomplishments in an incremental manner, and give a conscious form to the unconscious knowledge that society gathers over time. As pioneers are more conscious than the surrounding community, their inventions normally meet with initial resistance, which recedes over time as their inventions gain wider acceptance. If opposition is stronger than the pioneer, then the introduction of an invention gets delayed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In medieval times, when [[guild]]s tightly controlled their members, medical progress was slow mainly because physicians were secretive about their remedies. When [[Denis Papin]] demonstrated his [[steam engine]], German naval authorities refused to accept it, fearing it would lead to increased unemployment. [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]], who developed a [[flying shuttle]] textile loom, was physically threatened by English weavers who feared the loss of their jobs. He fled to France where his invention was more favorably received.

The widespread use of computers and application of biotechnology raises similar resistance among the public today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Whether the public receives an invention readily or resists depends on their awareness and willingness to entertain rapid change. Regardless of the response, technological inventions occurs as part of overall social development, not as an isolated field of activity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Limits to development==

The concept of inherent limits to development arose mainly because past development was determined largely by availability of physical resources. Humanity relied more on muscle-power than thought-power to accomplish work. That is no longer the case. Today, mental resources are the primary determinant of development. Where people drove a simple bullock cart, they now design ships and aircraft that carry huge loads across immense distances. Humanity has tamed rivers, cleared jungles and even turned arid desert lands into cultivable lands through irrigation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

By using intelligence, society has turned sand into powerful silicon chips that carry huge amounts of information and form the basis of computers. Since there is no inherent limit to the expansion of society's mental resources, the notion of limits to growth cannot be ultimately binding.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Peace and Food, ''Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development'', Zed Books, UK, 1994, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three stages of development==

Society's developmental journey is marked by three stages: physical, vital, and mental.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} These are not clear-cut stages, but overlap. All three are present in any society at time. One of them is predominant while the other two play subordinate roles. The term 'vital' denotes the emotional and nervous energies that empower society's drive towards accomplishment and express most directly in the interactions between human beings. Before the full development of mind, it is these vital energies that predominate in human personality and gradually yield the ground as the mental element becomes stronger. The speed and circumstances of social transition from one stage to another varies.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, Harlan and Jacobs, Garry. "Human Choice: The Genetic Code for Social Development". In: ''Futures Research Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 9–10, November–December 1999, Pergamon, UK, p. 964.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical stage===

The physical stage is characterized by the domination of the physical element of the human personality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} During this phase, society is preoccupied with bare survival and subsistence. People follow tradition strictly and there is little innovation and change. Land is the main asset and productive resource during the physical stage and wealth is measured by the size of land holdings. This is the [[agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[feudal society|feudal]] phase of society. Inherited wealth and position rule the roost and there is very little upward mobility. Feudal lords and military chiefs function as the leaders of the society. Commerce and money play a relatively minor role. As innovative thinking and experimental approaches are discouraged, people follow tradition unwaveringly and show little inclination to think outside of established guidelines. Occupational skills are passed down from parent to child by a long process of apprenticeship.

Guilds restrict the dissemination of trade secrets and technical knowledge. The Church controls the spread of new knowledge and tries to smother new ideas that does not agree with established dogmas. The physical stage comes to an end when the reorganization of agriculture gives scope for commerce and industry to expand. This happened in Europe during the 18th century when political revolutions abolished feudalism and the Industrial Revolution gave a boost to factory production. The shift to the vital and mental stages helps to break the bonds of tradition and inject new dynamism in social life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Vital stage===

The vital stage of society is infused with dynamism and change. The vital activities of society expand markedly. Society becomes curious, innovative and adventurous. During the vital stage emphasis shifts from interactions with the physical environment to social interactions between people. Trade supplants agriculture as the principal source of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The dawning of this phase in Europe led to exploratory voyages across the seas leading to the discovery of new lands and an expansion of sea trade. Equally important, society at this time began to more effectively harness the power of money. Commerce took over from agriculture, and money replaced land as the most productive resource.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The center of life shifted from the countryside to the towns where opportunities for trade and business were in greater abundance.

The center of power shifted from the aristocracy to the business class, which employed the growing power of money to gain political influence. During the vital stage, the rule of law becomes more formal and binding, providing a secure and safe environment for business to flourish. Banks, shipping companies and joint-stock companies increase in numbers to make use of the opportunities. Fresh innovative thinking leads to new ways of life that people accept as they prove beneficial. Science and experimental approaches begin to make a headway as the hold of tradition and dogma weaken. Demand for education rises.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

As the vital stage matures through the expansion of the commercial and industrial complex, surplus income arises, which prompts people to spend more on items so far considered out of reach. People begin to aspire for luxury and leisure that was not possible when life was at a subsistence level.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Mental stage===

This stage has three essential characteristics: practical, social, and political application of mind. The practical application of mind generates many inventions. The social application of mind leads to new and more effective types of social organization. The political application leads to changes in the political systems that empower the populace to exercise political and human rights in a free and democratic manner. These changes began in the [[Renaissance]] and Enlightenment, and gained momentum in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which proclaimed the right of individuals to relate directly to God without the mediation of priests. The political application of mind led to the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s, which produced writing that first recognized the rights of the common man and gradually led to the actual enjoyment of these rights.

Organization is a mental invention. Therefore it is not surprising that the mental stage of development is responsible for the formulation of a great number of organizational innovations. Huge business corporations have emerged that make more money than even the total earnings of some small countries. Global networks for transportation and communication now connect the nations of the world within a common unified social fabric for sea and air travel, telecommunications, weather reporting and information exchange.

In addition to spurring technological and organizational innovation, the mental phase is also marked by the increasing  power of ideas to change social life. Ethical ideals have been with humanity since the dawn of civilization. But their practical application in daily social life had to wait for the mental stage of development to emerge.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The proclamation of human rights and the recognition of the value of the individual have become effective only after the development of mind and spread of education. The 20th century truly emerged as the century of the common man. Political, social, economic and many other rights were extended to more and more sections of humanity with each succeeding decade.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The relative duration of these three stages and the speed of transition from one to another  varies from one society to another. However broadly speaking, the essential features of the physical, vital and mental stages of development are strikingly similar and therefore quite recognizable even in societies separated by great distance and having little direct contact with one another.

Moreover, societies also learn from those who have gone through these transitions before and, therefore, may be able to make the transitions faster and better. When the Netherlands introduced [[primary education]] in 1618, it was a pioneering initiative. When Japan did the same thing late in the 19th century, it had the advantage of the experience of the USA and other countries. When many Asian countries initiated primary education in the 1950s after winning independence, they could draw on the vast experience of more developed nations. This is a major reason for the quickening pace of progress.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Natural vs. planned development==

Natural development is distinct from development by government initiatives and planning. Natural development is the spontaneous and unconscious process of development that normally occurs. Planned development is the result of deliberate conscious initiatives by the government to speed development through special programs and policies. Natural development is an unconscious process, since it results from the behavior of countless individuals acting on their own—rather than conscious intention of the community. It is also unconscious in the sense that society achieves the results without being fully conscious of how it did so.

The natural development of democracy in Europe over the past few centuries can be contrasted with the conscious effort to introduce democratic forms of government in former colonial nations after [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Planned development is also largely unconscious: the goals may be conscious, but the most effective means for achieving them may remain poorly understood. Planned development can become fully conscious only when the process of development itself is fully understood. While in planned development the government is the initiator in the natural version it is private individuals or groups that are responsible for the initiative. Whoever initiates, the principles and policies are the same and success is assured only when the conditions and right principles are followed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==India's Green Revolution==

The [[Green Revolution]] in India is a good example of a planned development initiative that brings out all the essential features of the development process. Until 1960 [[agriculture in India]] did not differ markedly from what it had been during the [[British Raj|colonial period]] beginning 200 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The Green Revolution is usually described as the introduction of [[Genetically modified food|hybrid varieties]] of wheat and rice, but the adoption of hybrids alone is not sufficient to explain the phenomenal achievements of the Green Revolution. Success was made possible by a comprehensive and well-coordinated program involving multiple changes in the way society managed the production of food.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Prior to the Green Revolution, Indian agriculture was largely based on subsistence-level farming, which did not generate sufficient production to meet the country's food requirements. In the past, this led to periodic food shortages and famines, which were managed by huge imports from abroad. The Green Revolution was an attempt to break out of this condition and increase food production to make the country self-sufficient.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The [[Government of India|Indian government]] realized that it needed to do many things to win the cooperation of Indian farmers to make the green revolution successful. First, the government had to convince farmers to accept the hybrid varieties that would lead to increased yields. Then, they had to assure farmers that increased production would not drive down prices as bumper harvests had done in the past. The government had to ensure a supply of quality seeds, fertilizers, and provide adequate storage space. It also had to train a network of extension agents to train farmers to cultivate their fields with new methods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The government accomplished all this by setting up many new organizations. It set up the [[Food Corporation]] to buy food grains from surplus production areas and distribute it in areas with shortages. It constituted an Agricultural Pricing Commission to ensure a minimum floor price to farmers so that there was no disincentive for increased production. Seed and fertilizer corporations were formed to ensure supply of good quality seeds and timely supply of fertilizers, etc. Agricultural scientists were motivated to do their work better by the offer of better pay scales and greater infrastructural facilities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On top of all this the government established 100,000 demonstration plots across the country to prove to the farmers that the hybrid varieties were indeed more productive.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Peace and Food, ''Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development'', Zed Books, UK, 1994, pp 27, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Revolution succeeded not only because it was a planned initiative, but also because it was a conscious and well-conceived program. It adopted the right approaches and was alive to the needs and aspirations of the farmers. Therefore it was well received.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The planning and awareness exhibited in the project helped create a higher level organization that could harness the enthusiasm and energies of the farmers more effectively.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Planned development differs from natural development, in the sense that it is a program sponsored by the government to accelerate the development process. The success of a planned initiative depends on its ability to ensure the terms and conditions that help the natural process succeed. Many planned government initiatives fail because they begin without proper understanding of the conditions necessary for their fulfillment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} During the 1960s only the Government of India had the resources necessary to launch a massive program of such dimensions. But today, India's private sector is perhaps even better equipped than government to bring about rapid development as illustrated by the dramatic expansion of the country's IT industry.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The Green Revolution was so successful that it helped India achieve food self-sufficiency within five years and double food production within ten years. This was totally unexpected, and took even many experts by surprise. More than the increased food production, the elevation of agricultural operation in India to a higher level of organization was a more noteworthy achievement. It was a perfect demonstration of the success that a planned initiative could achieve when implemented with the required knowledge and awareness.{Citation needed}

'''''The Science of Desire: The Search for the Gay Gene and the Biology of Behavior''''' is a 1994 book by the geneticist [[Dean Hamer]] and the journalist Peter Copeland, in which the authors discuss Hamer's research into the genetics of [[homosexuality]]. The book received both positive and mixed reviews. It was praised as a well-written discussion of science that properly acknowledged the limitations of genetic research on homosexuality, usefully explored its ethical implications, and drew on a wide range of sources and publications. However, reviewers were unconvinced by Hamer's suggestions about the possible evolutionary basis of homosexuality, and argued that some of his claims were incorrect, that more work needed to be done to confirm or refute his genetic findings, and that his use of the term "gay gene" was misleading. Hamer's treatment of psychology and psychiatry was also criticized as biased.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=January 2018}}
Hamer argues that [[human sexuality]] can and should be studied scientifically and discusses his findings about [[Xq28]], a region of the [[X chromosome]]. According to Hamer, he shifted his area of research from [[metallothionein]] to the genetics of homosexuality after reading the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871) and the evolutionary geneticist [[Richard Lewontin]], the neurobiologist [[Steven Rose]] and the psychologist [[Leon Kamin]]'s ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' (1984). Hamer writes that Darwin's book surprised him because of the amount of space it devotes to discussing [[sexual selection]]. He describes Lewontin ''et al.''′s work as "a political rather than a scientific book" and expresses his disagreement with its politics. However, he comments that it taught him that the genetics of behavior is an emotionally and politically charged topic, especially where it concerns sexuality. He criticizes [[Alfred Kinsey]], as well as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality|his views on homosexuality]].{{sfn|Hamer|Copeland|1994|pages=14, 21, 25–26, 58, 173–175}}

==Publication history==
''The Science of Desire'' was first published in 1994 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].{{sfn|Hamer|Copeland|1994|page=4}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''The Science of Desire'' received positive reviews from Genevieve Stuttaford in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',{{sfn|Stuttaford|1994|page=81}} Constance Rinaldo in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Rinaldo|1994|page=88}} the science journalist [[Natalie Angier]] in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'',{{sfn|Angier|1994|pages=9–10}} Martin Johnson in ''[[New Scientist]]'',{{sfn|Johnson|1994|pages=45–46}} the science writer [[Jonathan Weiner]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'',{{sfn|Weiner|1995|pages=35–38}} and the biologist [[Paul R. Gross]] in ''[[National Review]]'',{{sfn|Gross|1995|page=69}} and mixed reviews from W. Lener in ''Choice'' and [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.{{sfn|Horton|1995|pages=36–40}}{{sfn|Lener|1995|page=1215}} The book was also reviewed by Deborah Franklin in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the historian of science [[Daniel Kevles]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.{{sfn|Franklin|1995|page=5}}{{sfn|Kevles|1995|page=85}}

Stuttaford described the book as "admirably lucid and surprisingly lively". She credited Hamer with carefully pointing out the limitations of genetic research on sexual orientation, simplifying complex ideas for general readers, and exploring the ethical implications of a "gay gene" with "laudable compassion and common sense."{{sfn|Stuttaford|1994|page=81}} Rinaldo described the book as an engaging and personalized account of scientific investigation, and recommended it for both lay readers and specialists.{{sfn|Rinaldo|1994|page=88}} Angier described the book as  "a surprising delight to read", writing that Hamer did not overstate his case for the innateness of sexual orientation and "has the welcome habit of sticking to the facts." However, she wrote that the last sections, in which Hamer discussed "still-floundering searches for the genes behind alcoholism, manic depression, shyness, aggression and the like" were less satisfactory.{{sfn|Angier|1994|pages=9–10}}

Johnson believed that Hamer's work made clear the difficulties involved in studying sexuality. He considered its title misleading, as no "gay gene" has been "proven or identified", and criticized Hamer for confusing "sexuality and sex" and for implying that "AIDS (rather than HIV) is sexually transmitted". He also questioned why Hamer needed a co-author, and why a scientist as busy as Hamer claimed to be would find writing a book "describing the background to a single, as yet unconfirmed, unextended and far from concluded, study" a high priority. However, the book convinced him that "the more cynical answers to this question" were mistaken. He found the book well-written, writing that it "conveys something of the serendipity of scientific advance", gave insightful descriptions of scientists, and outlined "the problems of determining whether there are genetic bases for complex behaviours" and suggested a way of overcoming them that made clear that this methodology relies on "redefining a complex characteristic in very limited terms". He concluded that it was "probably the best attempt at a genetic analysis of human sexuality that we have so far, which indicates just how far we have to go" and predicted that it would "fuel the moral debate about what any genetic component to sexuality might mean for ethics and the law." He wrote that Hamer should be "congratulated and encouraged" for contributing to the debate.{{sfn|Johnson|1994|pages=45–46}}

Weiner described the book as a calm and modestly written account of Hamer's research. He credited Hamer with avoiding over-stating the importance of his work or sensationalizing his results, writing that he had produced a "clear and capable book about a difficult subject."{{sfn|Weiner|1995|pages=35–38}} Gross wrote that the book deserved to be widely read.{{sfn|Gross|1995|page=69}} Lener wrote that parts of the book were "diary-like", and gave Hamer's "descriptions of methods used" and "life histories of gay men who participated in the study" as examples. He also wrote that some of Hamer's statements, such as that nobody has studied the number of gay men in the United States since Kinsey's research, were incorrect, but nevertheless considered the book generally "very accurate" and credited Hamer with drawing on "recent, important publications." He concluded that, "General readers as well as professionals and practitioners in sex education/therapy will find much of interest and value."{{sfn|Lener|1995|page=1215}}

Horton described the book as a "popular account" of Hamer's research and credited Hamer, along with other researchers, with helping to make a "forceful but by no means definitive case for the view that biological and genetic influences have an important--perhaps even decisive--part in determining sexual preference among males." Though noting that Hamer acknowledged the limitations of his research, he criticized Hamer for having an unsubtle view of the meaning of "biologial influence" on sexual orientation that ignores the question of how genes produce an "unpredictable interplay of behavioral impulses", and engaging in "overstretched speculations" about "why a gene for homosexuality still exists when it apparently has little apparent survival value in evolutionary terms." He concluded that while Hamer's work "presents technical and conceptual difficulties" and his "preliminary findings obviously need replication or refutation" it "represents a genuine epistemological break away from the past's rigid and withered conceptions of sexual preference."{{sfn|Horton|1995|pages=36–40}}

===Gay media===
''The Science of Desire'' was reviewed by the journalist Steven Petrow in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.{{sfn|Petrow|1994|pages=76–77}} The book also received reviews from ''[[New York Native]]'' and ''Lambda Book Report''.{{sfn|''New York Native''|1994|page=34}}{{sfn|''Lambda Book Report''|1995|page=44}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''The Science of Desire'' received a positive review from the psychiatrist [[Susan Bradley]] in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and a mixed review from the psychologist John C. Gonsiorek in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]''.{{sfn|Bradley|1995|pages=1311–1312}}{{sfn|Gonsiorek|1995|pages=262–263}} The book was also reviewed by Nancy Ordover in ''Socialist Review'' and discussed in ''[[The Lancet]]''.{{sfn|Ordover|1996|page=125}}{{sfn|''The Lancet''|1995|page=1309}}

Bradley described the book as a well-written account of the process of science. She commented that more work needed to be done to replicate Hamer's research and identify the relevant gene, but credited Hamer with being "cautious in extrapolating his findings to larger issues" and acknowledging the limitations of the research. However, she wrote that despite his caution, Hamer used the term "gay gene" in a misleading fashion, since "the term implies more than Hamer's work establishes." She also commented that, "the least well thought out and presented part of this book is the section on psychological theories", which she considered understandable given that Hamer is "not trained in psychology or psychiatry". In her view, "even its subtitle, “Sissies, Freud, and Sex Acts,” suggests a hasty dismissal of the importance of psychological theories." She concluded that the book, "makes enjoyable reading, particularly for anyone interested in the making of science as it relates to human behavior or sexuality."{{sfn|Bradley|1995|pages=1311–1312}}

Gonsiorek considered the book a competent and engaging discussion of Hamer's scientific work, but one that showed the "tension and unease" inherent in popularizing science. He questioned Hamer's description of how he shifted "from an obscure to a high-profile area of genetics", writing that it strained credibility. He called Hamer's discussion of the development of his research protocol "gossipy" and wrote that it contained "many tidbits, some less than kind, and many less than relevant" about the people involved. He praised Hamer's "ability to synthesize information from diverse sources and apply it creatively", his discussions of possible biological mechanisms for the heritability of male homosexuality and the public policy implications of his scientific research, and his criticism of social constructionism. However, he found Hamer's attempt to synthesize his ideas with "psychological concepts" unsuccessful and his evolutionary ideas intriguing but insufficiently developed. He wrote that Hamer tried to connect his ideas to "issues from handedness to Alzheimer's, usually coming off sounding like he has not sufficiently mastered the specific areas", and failed in his discussion of the "behavioral and social science literature", for example by mistakenly identifying social constructionism as a form of [[behaviorism]]. He also considered the book as a whole "marred" by Hamer's persistent hostility towards psychiatry.{{sfn|Gonsiorek|1995|pages=262–263}}

''The Lancet'' endorsed Hamer's proposal for "the creation of a US centre--a National Institute for Sexual Health--to coordinate federal funding for research into sexuality", agreeing with Hamer that "the place of sexuality in human life" is "sufficiently important to merit specific and rigorous scientific study."{{sfn|''The Lancet''|1995|page=1309}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher Timothy F. Murphy noted in ''[[Gay Science]]'' (1997) that while Hamer's research, if valid, establishes "evidence that sexual orientation in some people is subject to genetic influences", the nature of that influence remains to be specified and there is "still conflict about the meaning of Hamer's results." He noted that Hamer's research, like similar studies, has been criticized on the grounds of its small sample size, as well as on other grounds specific to it, and that other researchers have reported difficulty in replicating Hamer's findings. He concluded that much more work had to be done before it could be accepted that genes at Xq28 determine the sexual orientation of some males, despite Hamer's conducting a follow-up study. Murphy argued that while Hamer believed that the study of animal sexual behavior will help make society more tolerant of homosexuality, it was uncertain that it would and if it did, this "should not be because descriptions of the behavior of animals have normative force in regard to the behavior of human beings."{{sfn|Murphy|1997|pages=34–35, 168, 251}}

The gay activist [[Dennis Altman]] described Hamer's suggestion that homosexuality has a genetic basis as dubious in ''The End of the Homosexual?'' (2013). He noted that it conflicted with "the theories and discoveries of both Freud and Kinsey".{{sfn|Altman|2013|pages=34, 222}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34719">'''Therapeutic gene modulation''' refers to the practice of altering the [[Gene expression|expression of a gene]] at one of various stages, with a view to alleviate some form of ailment. It differs from [[gene therapy]] in that gene modulation seeks to alter the expression of an endogenous gene (perhaps through the introduction of a gene encoding a novel modulatory protein) whereas gene therapy concerns the introduction of a gene whose product aids the recipient directly.

Modulation of gene expression can be mediated at the level of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]  by DNA-binding agents (which may be [[artificial transcription factors]]), [[small molecule]]s, or [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthetic oligonucleotides]]. It may also be mediated post-transcriptionally through [[RNA interference]].

== Transcriptional gene modulation ==
An approach to therapeutic modulation utilizes agents that modulate endogenous transcription by specifically targeting those genes at the [[Genome|gDNA]] level. The advantage to this approach over modulation at the mRNA or protein level is that every cell contains only a single gDNA copy. Thus the target copy number is significantly lower allowing the drugs to theoretically be administered at much lower doses.

This approach also offers several advantages over traditional [[gene therapy]]. Directly targeting [[endogeny|endogenous]] transcription should yield correct relative expression of [[RNA splicing|splice]] variants. In contrast, traditional gene therapy typically introduces a gene which can express only one transcript, rather than a set of stoichiometrically-expressed spliced transcript variants. Additionally, virally-introduced genes can be targeted for gene silencing by methylation which can counteract the effect of traditional gene therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young WB, Link CJ | year=2000 | title=Chimeric retroviral helper virus and picornavirus IRES sequence to eliminate DNA methylation for improved retroviral packaging cells | journal=Journal of Virology | volume=74 | issue=11 | pages=5242–5249 | pmid=10799600 | doi=10.1128/JVI.74.11.5242-5249.2000 | pmc=110878}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not anticipated to be a problem for transcriptional modulation as it acts on endogenous DNA.

There are three major categories of agents that act as transcriptional gene modulators: triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), synthetic polyamides (SPAs), and [[DNA-binding protein|DNA binding proteins]].&lt;ref name="Uil-2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Uil TG, Haisma HJ, Rots MG | year=2003 | title=Therapeutic modulation of endogenous gene function by agents with designed DNA-sequence specificities | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | volume=31 | issue=21 | pages=6064–6078 | pmid=14576293 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkg815 | pmc=275457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Triplex-forming oligonucleotides ===
====What are they====

Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO) are one potential method to achieve therapeutic gene modulation. TFOs are approximately 10-40 base pairs long and can bind in the [[DNA|major groove]] in duplex DNA which creates a third strand or a triple helix.&lt;ref name="Uil-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sargent-2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Sargent | first1 = RG. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S. | last3 = Gruenert | first3 = DC. | title = Oligo/polynucleotide-based gene modification: strategies and therapeutic potential | journal = Oligonucleotides | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 55–75 | month =  | year =2011  | doi = 10.1089/oli.2010.0273 | pmid = 21417933 | pmc=3078494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding occurs at polypurine or polypyrimidine regions via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds to the purine (A / G) bases on the double stranded DNA that is already in the form of the [[Nucleic acid double helix|Watson-Crick helix]].&lt;ref name="Simon-2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Simon | first1 = P. | last2 = Cannata | first2 = F. | last3 = Concordet | first3 = JP. | last4 = Giovannangeli | first4 = C. | title = Targeting DNA with triplex-forming oligonucleotides to modify gene sequence | journal = Biochimie | volume = 90 | issue = 8 | pages = 1109–16 |date=August 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.04.004 | pmid = 18460344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====How they work====
TFOs can be either polypurine or polypyrimidine molecules and bind to one of the two strands in the double helix in either parallel or [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] orientation to target polypurine or polypyrimidine regions. Since the DNA-recognition codes are different for the parallel and the anti-parallel fashion of TFO binding, TFOs composed of [[pyrimidine]]s (C / T) bind to the purine-rich strand of the target double helix via [[Hoogsteen base pair|Hoogsteen]] hydrogen bonds in a parallel fashion.&lt;ref name="Sargent-2011"/&gt; TFOs composed of [[purine]]s (A / G), or mixed purine and pyrimidine bind to the same purine-rich strand via reverse Hoogsteen bonds in an anti-parallel fashion. TFO's can recognize purine-rich target strands for duplex DNA.&lt;ref name="Uil-2003"/&gt;
[[Image:TsDNA.png|thumb|100px|Triple Stranded DNA:TFOs bind in a similar fashion to the double stranded DNA as a [[Triple-stranded DNA|triplex helix configuration]].]]

====Complications and limitations====
In order for TFO motifs to bind in a parallel fashion and create [[hydrogen bond]]s, the nitrogen atom at position 3 on the cytosine residue needs to be [[Protonation|protonated]], but at [[pH|physiological pH]] levels it is not, which could prevent parallel binding.&lt;ref name="Uil-2003"/&gt;

Another limitation is that TFOs can only bind to purine-rich target strands and this would limit the choice of [[Endogeny|endogenous]] gene target sites to polypurine-polypyrimidine stretches in duplex DNA. If a method to also allow TFOs to bind to pyrimidine bases was generated, this would enable TFOs to target any part of the [[genome]]. Also the human genome is rich in polypurine and polypyrimidine sequences which could affect the [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of TFO to bind to a target DNA region. An approach to overcome this limitation is to develop TFOs with modified nucleotides that act as [[locked nucleic acid]]s to increase the [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] of the TFO for specific target sequences.&lt;ref name="Zhou-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zhou | first1 = Y. | last2 = Kierzek | first2 = E. | last3 = Loo | first3 = ZP. | last4 = Antonio | first4 = M. | last5 = Yau | first5 = YH. | last6 = Chuah | first6 = YW. | last7 = Geifman-Shochat | first7 = S. | last8 = Kierzek | first8 = R. | last9 = Chen | first9 = G. | title = Recognition of RNA duplexes by chemically modified triplex-forming oligonucleotides | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 41 | issue = 13 | pages = 6664–73 |date=July 2013 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt352 | pmid = 23658228  | pmc = 3711454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other limitations include concerns regarding [[Ligand (biochemistry)|binding affinity]] and specificity, in vivo stability, and uptake into cells. Researchers are attempting to overcome these limitations by improving TFO characteristics through [[DNA methylation|chemical modifications]], such as modifying the TFO backbone to reduce [[Electrostatics|electrostatic repulsions]] between the TFO and the DNA duplex. Also due to their high molecular weight, uptake into cells is limited and some strategies to overcome this include [[DNA condensation|DNA condensing agents]], coupling of the TFO to hydrophobic residues like [[cholesterol]], or cell permeabilization agents.&lt;ref name="Uil-2003"/&gt;

====What can they do====
Scientists are still refining the technology to turn TFOs into a [[Therapeutic effect|therapeutic product]] and much of this revolves around their potential applications in antigene therapy. In particular they have been used as inducers of [[Site-directed mutagenesis|site-specific mutations]], reagents that selectively and specifically [[Restriction enzyme|cleave]] target DNA, and as modulators of [[Regulation of gene expression|gene expression]].&lt;ref name="Guntaka-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Guntaka | first1 = RV. | last2 = Varma | first2 = BR. | last3 = Weber | first3 = KT. | title = Triplex-forming oligonucleotides as modulators of gene expression | journal = Int J Biochem Cell Biol | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–31 |date=Jan 2003 | doi =  10.1016/s1357-2725(02)00165-6| pmid = 12467644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such gene sequence modification method is through the targeting DNA with TFOs to active a [[Gene targeting|target gene]]. If a target sequence is located between two inactive copies of a gene, DNA ligands, such as TFOs, can bind to the target site and would be recognized as DNA lesions. To fix these lesions, [[DNA repair]] complexes are assembled on the targeted sequence, the DNA is repaired. Damage of the intramolecular recombination substrate can then be repaired and detected if resection goes far enough to produce compatible ends on both sides of the cleavage site and then 3' overhangs are ligated leading to the formation of a single active copy of the gene and the loss of all the sequences between the two copies of the gene.&lt;ref name="Simon-2008"/&gt;

In model systems TFOs can inhibit gene expression at the DNA level as well as induce targeted mutagenesis in the model.&lt;ref name="Guntaka-2003"/&gt; TFO-induced inhibition of transcription elongation on endogenous targets have been tested on cell cultures with success.&lt;ref name="Faria-2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Faria | first1 = M. | last2 = Wood | first2 = CD. | last3 = Perrouault | first3 = L. | last4 = Nelson | first4 = JS. | last5 = Winter | first5 = A. | last6 = White | first6 = MR. | last7 = Helene | first7 = C. | last8 = Giovannangeli | first8 = C. | title = Targeted inhibition of transcription elongation in cells mediated by triplex-forming oligonucleotides | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 97 | issue = 8 | pages = 3862–7 |date=April 2000 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.97.8.3862| pmid = 10760257 | pmc=18107}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite much [[in vitro]] success, there has been limited achievement in cellular applications potentially due to target accessibility.

TFOs have the potential to silence [[Gene silencing|silence gene]] by targeting transcription initiation or elongation, arresting at the triplex binding sites, or introducing permanent changes in a target sequence via stimulating a cell's inherent repair pathways. These applications can be relevant in creating [[Experimental cancer treatment|cancer therapies]] that inhibit gene expression at the DNA level. Since aberrant gene expression is a hallmark of cancer, modulating these endogenous genes' expression levels could potentially act as a therapy for multiple [[cancer]] types.

=== Synthetic polyamides ===
Synthetic polyamides are a set of small molecules that form specific hydrogen bonds to the [[DNA#Grooves|minor groove]] of DNA. They can exert an effect either directly, by binding a regulatory region or transcribed region of a gene to modify transcription, or indirectly, by designed conjugation with another agent that makes alterations around the DNA target site.

[[File:Synthetic polyamide cartoon.png|thumb|200px|Cartoon representation of a synthetic polyamide to DNA sequence recognition. The DNA sequence 5'-GTAC-3' is recognized by the amino acid pairs Py/Im, Py/Hp, Hp/Py, and Im/Py. See&lt;ref name="Reddy-2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dervan-2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dervan PB | year=2001 | title=Molecular Recognition of DNA by Small Molecules | journal=Bioorg. Med. Chem. | volume=9 | pages=2215–2235 | pmid=11553460 | issue=9 | doi=10.1016/s0968-0896(01)00262-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; for chemical structure]]

====Structure====
Specific bases in the minor groove of DNA can be recognized and bound by small synthetic polyamides (SPAs). DNA-binding SPAs have been engineered to contain three polyamide amino acid components: hydroxypyrrole (Hp), [[imidazole]] (Im), and [[pyrrole]] (Py).&lt;ref name="White-1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=White S, Szewcxyk JW, Turner JM, Baird EE, Dervan PB | year=1998 | title=Recognition of the four Watson-Crick base pairs in the DNA minor groove by synthetic ligands | journal=Nature | volume=391 | pages=468–471 | pmid=9461213 | doi=10.1038/35106 | issue=6666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chains of these amino acids loop back on themselves in a hairpin structure. The amino acids on either side of the hairpin form a pair which can specifically recognize both sides of a [[Base pair|Watson-Crick base pair]]. This occurs through hydrogen bonding within the minor groove of DNA. The amide pairs Py/Im, Py/Hp, Hp/Py, and Im/Py recognize the Watson-Crick base pairs C-G, A-T, T-A, and G-C, respectively (Table 1). See figure for a graphical representation of 5'-GTAC-3' recognition by a SPA. SPAs have low toxicity, but have not yet been used in human gene modulation.

====Limitations and workarounds====
The major structural drawback to unmodified SPAs as gene modulators is that their recognition sequence cannot be extended beyond 5 Watson-Crick base pairings. The natural curvature of the DNA minor groove is too tight a turn for the hairpin structure to match. There are several groups with proposed workarounds to this problem.&lt;ref name="Reddy-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reddy BS, Sharma SK, Lown JW | year=2001 | title=Recent developments in sequence selective minor groove DNA effectors | journal=Curr.

[[File:Synthetic polyamide mechanism b.png|thumb|200px|Synthetic polyamide blocking of transcription factors.]]

====Direct modulation====
SPAs may inhibit transcription through binding within a transcribed region of a target gene. This inhibition occurs through blocking of elongation by an RNA polymerase.
 
SPAs may also modulate transcription by targeting a transcription regulator binding site. If the regulator is an activator of transcription, this will decrease transcriptional levels. As an example, SPA targeting to the binding site for the activating transcription factor TFIIIA has been demonstrated to inhibit transcription of the downstream 5S RNA.&lt;ref name="Gottesfeld-1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gottesfeld JM, Neely L, Trauger JW, Baird EE, Dervan PB | year=1997 | title=Regulation of gene expression by small molecules | journal=Nature | volume=387 | pages=202–205 | pmid=9144294 | doi=10.1038/387202a0 | issue=6629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, if the regulator is a repressor, this will increase transcriptional levels. As an example, SPA targeting to the host factor LSF, which represses expression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR), blocks binding of LSF and consequently de-represses expression of LTR&lt;ref name="Coull-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coull JJ, He G, Melander C, Rucker VC, Dervan PB, Margolis DM | year=2002 | title=Targeted derepression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat by pyrrole-imidazole polyamides | journal=J.

.

[[File:Synthetic polyamide mechanism c.png|thumb|200px|Synthetic polyamide conjugated to modifying agent.]]

====Conjugate modulation====
SPAs have not been shown to directly modify DNA or have activity other than direct blocking of other factors or processes. However, modifying agents can be bound to the tail ends of the hairpin structure. The specific binding of the SPA to DNA allows for site-specific targeting of the conjugated modifying agent.
 
SPAs have been paired with the  DNA-alkylating moieties cyclopropylpyrroloindole&lt;ref name="Wang-2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang YD, Dziegielewski J, Wurtz NR, Dziegielewska B, Dervan PB, Beerman TA | year=2003 | title=DNA crosslinking and biological activity of a hairpin polyamide-chlorambucil conjugate | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | volume=31 | issue=21 | pages=1208–1215 | pmid=12582240 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkg215 | pmc=150233}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chlorambucil&lt;ref name="Wang-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang YD, Dziegielewski J, Chang AY, Dervan PB, Beerman TA | year=2002 | title=Cell-free and cellular activities of a DNA sequence selective hairpin polyamide-CBI conjugate | journal= J.

This effect inhibited cell cycling and growth. Chlorambucil, a chemotherapeutic agent, was more effective when conjugated to an SPA than without.

In 2012, SPAs were conjugated to SAHA, a potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.&lt;ref name="Pandian-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pandian NG, Nakano Y, Sato S, Morinaga H, Bando T, Nagase H, Sugiyama H | year=2012 | title=A synthetic small molecule for rapid induction of multiple pluripotency genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=2 | issue=544 | pmid=22848790 | doi=10.1038/srep00544 | pages=544 | pmc=3408130}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPAs with conjugated SAHA were targeted to Oct-3/4 and Nanog which induced epigenetic remodeling and consequently increased expression of multiple pluripotency related genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

=== Designer zinc-finger proteins ===
====What they are/structure====

Designer zinc-finger proteins are engineered [[proteins]] used to target specific areas of [[DNA]]. These proteins capitalize on the [[DNA-binding protein|DNA-binding]] capacity of natural [[zinc-finger]] domains to modulate specific target areas of the [[genome]].&lt;ref name="Papworth-2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Papworth | first1 = M. | last2 = Kolasinska | first2 = P. | last3 = Minczuk | first3 = M. | title = Designer zinc-finger proteins and their applications | journal = Gene | volume = 366 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–38 |date=Jan 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2005.09.011 | pmid = 16298089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both designer and natural zinc-finger motifs, the protein consists of two [[Beta sheet|β-sheets]] and one [[Alpha helix|α-helix]]. Two [[histidine]] residues on the α-helix and two [[cysteine]] residues on the β-sheets are bonded to a [[zinc]] atom, which serves to stabilize the protein domain as a whole. This stabilization particularly benefits the α-helix in its function as the DNA-recognition and -binding domain. [[TFIIIA|Transcription factor TFIIIA]] is an example of a naturally-occurring protein with zinc-finger motifs.&lt;ref name="Watson-2008"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Watson | first1 = James D. | title = Molecular biology of the gene | year = 2008 | publisher = Pearson/Benjamin Cummings  | location = San Francisco | isbn = 978-0-8053-9592-1 | pages = 595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Zinc finger.png|thumb|200px|Example of zinc-finger motifs]]

====How they work====
Zinc-finger motifs bind into the [[DNA#Grooves|major groove]] of helical DNA,&lt;ref name="Watson-2008"/&gt; where the [[amino acid]] residue [[Protein sequence|sequence]] on the α-helix gives the motif its target sequence specificity. The domain binds to a seven-[[nucleotide]] sequence of DNA (positions 1 through 6 on the [[DNA replication#Leading strand|primary strand]] of DNA, plus positions 0 and 3 on the [[DNA replication#Lagging strand|complementary strand]]), thereby ensuring that the protein motif is highly selective of its target.&lt;ref name="Papworth-2006"/&gt; In engineering a designer zinc-finger protein, researchers can utilize techniques such as [[site-directed mutagenesis]] followed by [[randomized trial]]s for binding capacity,&lt;ref name="Papworth-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Desjarlais-1993"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Desjarlais | first1 = JR. | last2 = Berg | first2 = JM. | title = Use of a zinc-finger consensus sequence framework and specificity rules to design specific DNA binding proteins | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 90 | issue = 6 | pages = 2256–60 |date=March 1993 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.90.6.2256| pmid = 8460130 | pmc=46065}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[in vitro]] recombination of motifs with known target specificity to produce a library of sequence-specific final proteins.&lt;ref name="Isalan-2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Isalan | first1 = M. | last2 = Klug | first2 = A. | last3 = Choo | first3 = Y. | title = A rapid, generally applicable method to engineer zinc fingers illustrated by targeting the HIV-1 promoter | journal = Nat Biotechnol | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 656–60 |date=July 2001 | doi = 10.1038/90264 | pmid = 11433278 | pmc=2677679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|200px|Epigenetic mechanisms]]

====Effects and impacts on gene modulation====
Designer zinc-finger proteins can modulate [[Gene expression|genome expression]] in a number of ways. Ultimately, two factors are primarily responsible for the end result on expression: whether the targeted sequence is a [[regulatory region]] or a [[coding region]] of DNA, and whether and what types of [[Effector protein|effector domains]] are bound to the zinc-finger domain. If the target sequence for an engineered [[designer protein]] is a regulatory domain - e.g., a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] or a [[repressor]] of [[Dna replication|replication]] - the binding site for naturally-occurring transcription factors will be obscured, leading to a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] for the associated [[gene]].&lt;ref name="Choo-1994"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Choo | first1 = Y. | last2 = Sánchez-García | first2 = I. | last3 = Klug | first3 = A. | title = In vivo repression by a site-specific DNA-binding protein designed against an oncogenic sequence | journal = Nature | volume = 372 | issue = 6507 | pages = 642–5 |date=December 1994 | doi = 10.1038/372642a0 | pmid = 7990954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if the target sequence is an [[exon]], the designer zinc-finger will obscure the sequence from [[Rna Polymerase|RNA polymerase]] transcription complexes, resulting in a truncated or otherwise nonfunctional gene product.&lt;ref name="Papworth-2006"/&gt;

Effector domains bound to the zinc-finger can also have comparable effects. It is the function of these effector domains which are arguably the most important with respect to the use of designer zinc-finger proteins for therapeutic gene modulation. If a [[methylase]] domain is bound to the designer zinc-finger protein, when the zinc-finger protein binds to the target DNA sequence an increase in [[DNA methylation|methylation state of DNA]] in that region will subsequently result.

In the first case to successfully demonstrate the use of designer zinc-finger proteins to modulate gene expression [[in vivo]], Choo ''et al''&lt;ref name="Choo-1994"/&gt; designed a protein consisting of three zinc-finger domains that targeted a specific sequence on a  [[BCR-ABL]] [[Fusion protein|fusion]] [[oncogene]]. This specific oncogene is implicated in [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]. The oncogene typically enables [[leukemia]] cells to proliferate in the absence of specific growth factors, a hallmark of [[cancer]]. By including a [[nuclear localization signal]] with the tri-domain zinc-finger protein in order to facilitate binding of the protein to genomic DNA in the nucleus, Choo ''et al'' were able to demonstrate that their engineered protein could block transcription of the oncogene in vivo. Leukemia cells became dependent on regular growth factors, bringing the cell cycle back under the control of [[Cell cycle regulation#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|normal regulation]].&lt;ref name="Choo-1994"/&gt;

== Post-transcriptional gene modulation ==
The major approach to post-transcriptional gene modulation is via [[RNA interference]] (RNAi). The primary problem with using RNAi in gene modulation is drug delivery to target cells.&lt;ref name="Behlke-2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Behlke | first1 = MA. | title = Progress towards in vivo use of siRNAs | journal = Mol Ther | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 644–70 |date=April 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.01.001 | pmid = 16481219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dykxhoorn-2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Dykxhoorn | first1 = DM. | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = J. | title = Running interference: prospects and obstacles to using small interfering RNAs as small molecule drugs | journal = Annu Rev Biomed Eng | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 377–402 | month =  | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.8.061505.095848 | pmid = 16834561 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNAi gene modulation has been successfully applied to mice toward the treatment of a mouse model for inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;ref name="Peer-2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Peer | first1 = D. | last2 = Park | first2 = EJ. | last3 = Morishita | first3 = Y. | last4 = Carman | first4 = CV. | last5 = Shimaoka | first5 = M. | title = Systemic leukocyte-directed siRNA delivery revealing cyclin D1 as an anti-inflammatory target | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5863 | pages = 627–30 |date=February 2008 | doi = 10.1126/science.1149859 | pmid = 18239128 | pmc=2490797}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment utilized liposome-based beta-7 integrin-targeted, stabilized nanoparticles entrapping short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).

==Clinical significance==
Designer zinc-finger proteins, on the other hand, have undergone some trials in the [[Clinical trial|clinical arena]]. The efficacy and safety of EW-A-401, an engineered zinc-finger transcription factor, as a [[pharmacologic agent]] for treating [[claudication]], a [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] ailment, has been investigated in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00080392 | title=Identifier NCT00080392.Modulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Using an Engineered Zinc-Finger Transcription Factor to Treat Lower Limb Intermittent Claudication | date=30 December 2011 | website=ClinicalTrials.gov | accessdate=25 July 2013 | publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein consists of an engineered [[Plasmid|plasmid DNA]] that prompts the patient to produce an engineered transcription factor, the target of which is the [[VEGF-A|vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)]] gene, which positively influences [[blood vessel]] development. Although not yet approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), two [[Phases of clinical research#Phase I|Phase I clinical studies]] have been completed which identify this zinc-finger protein as a promising and safe potential therapeutic agent for treatment of [[peripheral arterial disease]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Giacca-2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Giacca | first1 = M. | last2 = Zacchigna | first2 = S. | title = VEGF gene therapy: therapeutic angiogenesis in the clinic and beyond | journal = Gene Ther | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 622–9 |date=June 2012 | doi = 10.1038/gt.2012.17 | pmid = 22378343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article lists various '''tornado records'''. The most "extreme" [[tornado]] in recorded history was the [[Tri-State Tornado]], which spread through parts of [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]] on March 18, 1925. It is considered an F5, even though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale at the time. It holds records for longest path length at {{convert|219|mi|km|}}, longest duration at about 3½ hours, and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado at {{convert|73|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history with 695 fatalities.&lt;ref name="Significant Tornadoes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grazulis |first=Thomas P. |authorlink=Thomas P.

When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today.&lt;ref name="tornado damage cost"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/damage/tdam1.html | title = Normalized Damage from Major Tornadoes in the United States: 1890–1999| accessdate = 2007-02-28| last = Brooks| first = Harold E. |author2=Doswell, Charles A III |date=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadliest tornado in world history was the [[Daulatpur–Saturia tornado]] in [[Bangladesh]] on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh tornado"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/qr/qr169/qr169.pdf| title = The April 2004 Tornado in North-Central Bangladesh: A Case for Introducing Tornado Forecasting and Warning Systems| accessdate = 2006-08-17| author = Paul, Bhuiyan| year = 2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its history, Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes kill more than 100 people, almost half of the [[List of tornadoes causing 100 or more deaths|total for the rest of the world]].

For 37 years, the most extensive [[tornado outbreak]] on record, in almost every category, was the [[1974 Super Outbreak]], which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern [[Ontario]] in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; 7 were of F5 intensity and 23 were F4. During the peak of this outbreak there were 16 tornadoes on the ground at the same time. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. However, this record was later broken during the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], which resulted in 360 tornadoes and 324 tornadic fatalities.&lt;ref name="super outbreak"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/extremes/1999/april/TornOut.pdf| title = Tornado Outbreak of April 3–4, 1974; Synoptic Analysis| accessdate = 2007-03-02| author = Hoxit, Lee R|author2=Chappell, Charles F |date=October 1975| format = PDF| publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tornado outbreaks ==

=== Most tornadoes in single 24-hour period ===
The [[2011 Super Outbreak]] was the most prolific tornado outbreak in USA history. It produced 360 tornadoes, with 216 of those in a single 24-hour period on April 27,&lt;ref name="tornado-largest-tornado-outbreak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wmo.asu.edu/tornado-largest-tornado-outbreak |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926235427/http://wmo.asu.edu/tornado-largest-tornado-outbreak |archivedate=2013-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including 11 EF4 and 4 EF5 tornadoes. 348 deaths occurred in that outbreak, of which 324 were tornado related. The outbreak helped smash the record for most tornadoes in the month of April with 770 tornadoes, almost triple the prior record (267 in April 1974). The overall record for a single month was 542 in May 2003, which was also broken.&lt;ref name="April 2011 tornado information"&gt;{{cite web|title=April 2011 tornado information|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/april_2011_tornado_information.html |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infamous [[1974 Super Outbreak]] of April 3–4, 1974, which spawned 148 confirmed tornadoes across eastern North America, held the record for the most prolific tornado outbreak for many years. Not only did it produce an exceptional number of tornadoes, but it was also an inordinately intense outbreak producing dozens of large, long-track tornadoes, including 7 F5 and 23 F4 tornadoes. More significant tornadoes occurred within 24&amp;nbsp;hours than any other week in the tornado record.&lt;ref name="tornado outbreak sequences"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Russell |last=Schneider |author2=H.E. Brooks |author3=J.T. Schaefer |title=Tornado Outbreak Day Sequences: historic events and climatology (1875-2003) |booktitle=22nd Conf Severe Local Storms |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=October 2004 |location=Hyannis, MA |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/11aram22sls/techprogram/paper_81933.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a secular trend in tornado reporting, the 2011 and 1974 tornado counts are not directly comparable.

=== Longest continuous outbreak and largest autumnal outbreak ===
Most tornado outbreaks in North America occur in the spring, but there is a secondary peak of tornado activity in the fall which is less consistent but can include exceptionally large and/or intense outbreaks. In 1992, an estimated [[November 1992 tornado outbreak|95 tornadoes]] broke out in a record 41&amp;nbsp;hours of continuous [[November 1992 tornado outbreak|tornado activity]] from November 21 to 23. This is also among the largest-known outbreaks in areal expanse. Many other very large outbreaks have occurred in autumn, especially in October and November.&lt;ref name="Significant Tornadoes"/&gt;

=== Greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane ===
The greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane is 118 from [[Hurricane Ivan tornado outbreak|Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Roger|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|title=Tropical Cyclone Tornadoes: A Review of Knowledge in Research and Prediction|journal=E-Journal of Severe Storms Meteorology|year=2012|volume=7|issue=6|page=3|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/edwards/ejssmtct.pdf|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caution is advised comparing the raw number of counted tornadoes from recent decades to decades prior to the 1990s since more tornadoes that occur are now recorded than in the past.

===  Deadliest single tornado in world history ===
On April 26, 1989 in [[Bangladesh]] a [[Daulatpur–Saturia tornado|large tornado]] took at least 1,300 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grazulis |first=Tom |authorlink=Thomas P.

=== Deadliest single tornado in US history ===
The [[Tri-State Tornado]] of March 18, 1925 killed 695&amp;nbsp;people in [[Missouri]] (11), [[Illinois]] (613), and [[Indiana]] (71). The outbreak it occurred with was also the deadliest known [[tornado outbreak]], with a combined death toll of 747 across the Mississippi River Valley.&lt;ref name="Significant Tornadoes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadofacts.net/tornado-facts-for-kids.php Tornado Facts for Kids] - Tornado Information for Students and Kids&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadofacts.net/tri-state-tornado-facts.php Tri-State Tornado] information, facts and history.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Most damaging tornado ===
Similar to fatalities, damage (and observations) of a tornado are a coincidence of what character of tornado interacts with certain characteristics of built up areas. That is, destructive tornadoes are in a sense "accidents" of a large tornado striking a large population. In addition to population and changes thereof, comparing damage historically is subject to changes in wealth and inflation. The [[1896 St. Louis–East St. Louis tornado]] on May 27, incurred the most damages adjusted for wealth and inflation, at an estimated $2.9&amp;nbsp;billion (1997&amp;nbsp;USD). In raw numbers, the [[2011 Joplin tornado|Joplin tornado]] of May 22, 2011 is considered the costliest tornado in recent history, with damage totals near $2.8 billion (2011 USD). Until 2011, the "[[1999 Bridge Creek-Moore tornado|Bridge Creek-Moore tornado]]" of May 3, 1999 was the most damaging.&lt;ref name="tornado damage normalization"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Harold E. |authorlink=Harold E. Brooks |author2=Charles A. Doswell III  |title=Normalized Damage from Major Tornadoes in the United States: 1890–1999 |journal=[[Weather and Forecasting]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=168–176 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=February 2001 | url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434(2001)016%3C0168%3ANDFMTI%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |doi=10.1175/1520-0434(2001)016&lt;0168:NDFMTI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 2001WtFor..16..168B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Largest and most powerful tornadoes ==

=== Highest winds observed in a tornado ===
During the F5 [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado]] on May 3, 1999 in the southern [[Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area|Oklahoma City metro]] area, a [[Doppler on Wheels]] situated near the tornado measured winds of {{convert|302|+/-|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} momentarily in a small area inside the funnel approximately {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wurman |first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Wurman |title=Doppler On Wheels |publisher=Center for Severe Weather Research |year=2007 |url=http://www.cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sZWvfQp8?url=http://www.cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm |archivedate=2010-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are also the highest wind speeds observed on Earth.

On May 31, 2013, a tornado hit rural areas near [[El Reno, Oklahoma]]. The tornado was originally rated as an EF3 based on damage; however, after mobile radar data analysis was conducted, it was concluded to have been an EF5 due to a measured wind speed of greater than {{convert|296|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, second only to the Bridge Creek - Moore tornado. Revised RaXPol analysis found winds of {{convert|302|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} well above ground level and ≥{{convert|291|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} below {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} with some subvortices moving at {{convert|175|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="RaXPol"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Snyder, Jeff|author2 = Bluestein, H. B. |title = Some Considerations for the Use of High-Resolution Mobile Radar Data in Tornado Intensity Determination |journal = Weather Forecast. |date = 2014 |url = |doi = 10.1175/WAF-D-14-00026.1 |bibcode = 2014WtFor..29..799S }}&lt;/ref&gt; These winds may possibly be as high or higher than the winds recorded on May&amp;nbsp;3, 1999. Despite the recorded windspeed, the El Reno tornado was later downgraded back to EF3 due to the fact that no EF5 damage was found, likely due to the lack of sufficient damage indicators in the largely rural area west of [[Oklahoma City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/06/04/deadly-el-reno-okla-tornado-was-widest-ever-measured-on-earth-had-nearly-300-mph-winds/ | work=The Washington Post | first=Forecast | last=By | title=Capital Weather Gang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-discovery-channel-to-host-special-for-storm-chasers20130604,0,3911911.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Celine | last=Wright | title=Discovery Channel to air special for fallen 'Storm Chasers' | date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winds were measured at {{convert|268|-|280|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} using portable Doppler radar in the [[Red Rock, Oklahoma]] tornado during the [[April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak]] in north-central Oklahoma. Though these winds are possibly indicative of an F5 strength tornado, this particular tornado's path never encountered any significant structures and caused minimal damage. Thus it was rated an F4.&lt;ref name="doppler spectra"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bluestein |first=Howard B. |authorlink=Howard B. Bluestein |author2=J.G. Ladue |author3=H. Stein |author4=D. Speheger |author5=W.P. Unruh |title=Doppler Radar Wind Spectra of Supercell Tornadoes |journal=[[Monthly Weather Review]] |volume=121 |issue=8 |pages=2200–22 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=August 1993 | url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0493(1993)121%3C2200%3ADRWSOS%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1993)121&lt;2200:DRWSOS&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1993MWRv..121.2200B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Longest damage path and duration ===
The longest-known track for a single tornado is the [[Tri-State Tornado]] with a path length of {{convert|151|to|235|mi|km|abbr=on}}. For years there was debate whether the originally recognized path length of {{convert|219|mi|abbr=on}} over 3.5 hours was from one tornado or a series. Some very long track (VLT) tornadoes were later determined to be successive tornadoes spawned by the same supercell thunderstorm, which are known as a [[tornado family]]. The Tri-State Tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in the damage. A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family. It also found that the tornado began {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} to the west and ended {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} farther east than previously known, bringing the total path to {{convert|235|mi|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|174|mi|abbr=on}} segment from central [[Madison County, Missouri]] to [[Pike County, Indiana]] is likely one continuous tornado and the {{convert|151|mi|abbr=on}} segment from central [[Bollinger County, Missouri]] to western Pike County, Indiana is very likely a single continuous tornado. Another [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornado was found about {{convert|65|mi|abbr=on}} east-northeast of the end of aforementioned segment(s) of the Tri-State Tornado Family and is likely another member of the family. Its path length of {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} over about 20 minutes makes the known tornado family path length total to {{convert|320|mi|abbr=on}} over about 5½ hours.&lt;ref name="Johns"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Johns |first = Robert H. |authorlink = Robert H.

=== Longest path and duration tornado family ===
What at one time was thought to be the record holder for the longest tornado path is now thought to be the longest tornado family, with a track of at least {{convert|293|mi|km}} on May 26, 1917 from the Missouri border across Illinois into Indiana. It caused severe damage and mass casualties in [[Charleston, Illinois|Charleston]] and [[Mattoon, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Significant Tornadoes"/&gt;

What was probably the longest track [[supercell]] thunderstorm tracked {{convert|790|mi|km}} across 6 states in 17.5&amp;nbsp;hours on March 12, 2006 as part of the [[March 2006 tornado outbreak sequence]]. It began in [[Noble County, Oklahoma]] and ended in [[Jackson County, Michigan]], producing many tornadoes in Missouri and Illinois.&lt;ref name="six state supercell"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Jason T. |last=Martinelli |title=A detailed analysis of an extremely long-tracked supercell |booktitle=Preprints of the 33rd Conference on Radar Meteorology |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] and Australian Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre |date=August 2007 |location=Cairns, Australia |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/33Radar/techprogram/paper_123052.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Largest path width ===
Officially, the widest tornado on record is the [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] [[2013 El Reno tornado|tornado]] of May 31, 2013 with a width of {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} at its peak. This is the width found by the National Weather Service based on preliminary data from University of Oklahoma RaxPol mobile radar that also sampled winds of {{convert|296|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} which was used to upgrade the tornado to EF5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Oklahoma Tornadoes and Flash Flooding - May 31, 2013|publisher=National Weather Service Norman Oklahoma|year=2013|url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=events-20130531|accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was revealed that these winds did not impact any structures, and as a result the tornado was downgraded to EF3 based on damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Details|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=453682|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another possible contender for the widest tornado as measured by radar was the F4 [[Mulhall, Oklahoma|Mulhall]] tornado in north-central Oklahoma which occurred during the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]]. The [[radius of maximum wind|diameter of the maximum winds]] (over {{convert|110|mph|m/s|abbr=on}}) was over {{convert|5200|ft|m}} as measured by a DOW radar. Although the tornado passed largely over rural terrain, the width of the wind swath capable of producing damage was as wide as {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Mulhall"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wurman |first=Joshua |authorlink= |author2=C.

The F4 [[Hallam, Nebraska]] [[2004 Hallam, Nebraska tornado|tornado]] during the [[May 2004 tornado outbreak sequence|outbreak]] of May 22, 2004 was the previous official record holder for the widest tornado, surveyed at {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} wide. A similar size tornado struck [[Edmonson, Texas]] on May 31, 1968, when a damage path width between {{convert|2|to|3|mi|km}} was recorded from an F3 tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May 1968 Storm Data |publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]] |url=http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/sd/sd.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503214406/http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/sd/sd.html |archivedate=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Highest forward speed ===
The highest forward speed of a tornado on record was 73 miles per hour (117&amp;nbsp;km/h) from the 1925 Tri-State Tornado (other weak tornadoes have approached or exceeded this speed, but this is the fastest forward movement observed in a major tornado).&lt;ref name="Significant Tornadoes"/&gt;

=== Greatest pressure drop ===
A [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] deficit of {{convert|100|mb|inHg|sigfig=3}} was observed when a violent [[2003 South Dakota tornado outbreak|tornado]] near [[Manchester, South Dakota]] on June 24, 2003 passed directly over an [[in-situ]] probe that storm chasing researcher [[Tim Samaras]] deployed.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Julian J. |last=Lee |author2=T.

== Exceptional tornado droughts ==

=== Longest span without a tornado rated F5 or EF5 in the US ===
Before the [[May 2007 tornado outbreak|Greensburg EF5 tornado]] on May 4, 2007, it had been 8 years and one day since the US had a '''confirmed''' F5 or EF5 tornado. The last confirmed F5 or EF5 had hit southern [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area|Oklahoma City metro]] area and surrounding communities during the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|May 3, 1999 event]]. This is the longest interval without an F5 or EF5 tornado since official records began in 1950.

== Exceptional survivors ==

==Exceptional coincidences==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}

===Codell, Kansas===
The small town of [[Codell, Kansas]], was hit by a tornado on the same date (May 20) three consecutive years: 1916, 1917, and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=National Severe Storms Laboratory |title=Tornado Climatology |work=A Severe Weather Primer: Questions and Answers about Tornadoes |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_climatology.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadofacts.net/tornado-fun-facts.php Fun Tornado Facts] - Interesting and Fun Tornado Facts&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has about 100,000 thunderstorms per year; less than 1% produce a tornado. The odds of this coincidence occurring again are extremely small.

===Tanner/Harvest, Alabama===
[[Tanner, Alabama|Tanner]], a small town in northern Alabama, was hit by an F5 tornado on [[1974 Super Outbreak|April 3, 1974]] and was struck again 45 minutes later by a second F5 (however, the rating is disputed and it may have been high-end F4), demolishing what remained of the town. Thirty-seven years later, on [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27, 2011]] (the largest and deadliest outbreak since 1974), Tanner was hit yet again by the EF5 [[2011 Hackleburg–Phil Campbell, Alabama tornado]], which produced high-end EF4 damage in the southern portion of town. The suburban community of [[Harvest, Alabama]], just to the northeast, also sustained major impacts from all three Tanner tornadoes, and was also hit by destructive tornadoes in [[1995 Anderson Hills tornado|1995]] and [[March 2–3, 2012 tornado outbreak|2012]].

===Moore, Oklahoma===
The south [[Oklahoma City]] suburb of [[Moore, Oklahoma]] was hit by strong to violent tornadoes in 1973, 1998, [[1999 Bridge Creek – Moore tornado|1999]], [[May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence#Moore Tornado (F4)|2003]], [[Early-May 2010 tornado outbreak#Moore – Choctaw tornado|2010]], [[2013 Moore tornado|2013]], and 2015, five of which were of F4/EF4 strength or greater. The 1999 and 2013 events were rated F5 and EF5, respectively. In total, about 23 tornadoes have struck within the immediate vicinity of Moore since 1890, the most recent of which was an EF2 on March 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Moore, Oklahoma Tornadoes (1890-Present) |publisher = National Weather Service Norman Oklahoma |year = 2013 |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=tornadodata-city-ok-moore |accessdate = 2013-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson, Tennessee===
The city of [[Jackson, Tennessee]] has been hit by an F4/EF4 tornado three separate times, in [[January 17–18, 1999 tornado outbreak|1999]], [[May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence|2003]], and [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak|2008]]. All three of these tornadoes occurred after dark and were preceded or followed by a separate F3/EF3 tornado that caused additional destruction in the Jackson area.

'''W70''' is the designation for a tactical [[nuclear warhead]] developed by the [[United States]] in the early 1970s. The [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] designed W70 was used on the [[MGM-52 Lance]]. About 1250 were built in total. The warhead had a [[variable yield]] of between 1 and 100 kilotons, selectable by the user. The design dates from 1973.

The W70-3 was a modified version of the W70 and one of the first warheads to be battlefield-ready with an "enhanced radiation" (i.e. [[neutron bomb]]) feature. It had an explosive yield of about 1 kt., was manufactured during 1981-83, and was retired by 1992; 380 were built. Note that using the explosive yield of a neutron weapon to measure its destructive power can be deceptive, especially given the W70s variable yield - so-called "neutron bombs" only display their unique qualities at lower yields; at higher yields, the radius of intense heat and blast effects far outstrips the range that the prompt radiation can reach through an atmosphere. This effect is exaggerated against tank crews, who are extremely well protected against heat and blast, but whose vehicle's armour is readily penetrated by energetic neutron radiation.

The inventor of the neutron bomb, [[Samuel T. Cohen|Samuel Cohen]], has criticized the description of the W70 as a "neutron bomb":
&lt;blockquote&gt;the W-70 ... is not even remotely a "neutron bomb." Instead of being the type of weapon that, in the popular mind, "kills people and spares buildings" it is one that both kills and physically destroys on a massive scale. The W-70 is not a discriminate weapon, like the neutron bomb—which, incidentally, should be considered a weapon that "kills enemy personnel while sparing the physical fabric of the attacked populace, and even the populace too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''WISEPA J031325.96+780744.2''' (designation abbreviated to '''WISE 0313+7807''', or '''WISE J0313+7807''') is a [[brown dwarf]] of [[spectral class]] T8.5,{{r|Kirkpatrick2011|Kirkpatrick2012}} located in constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] at approximately 21 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].{{r|Beichman2014}}

==Discovery==
'''WISE 0313+7807''' was discovered in 2011 by [[J. Davy Kirkpatrick]] et al. from data, collected by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)]] [[Earth-orbit]]ing [[satellite]] — [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[infrared|infrared-wavelength]] 40 [[centimeter|cm]] (16 [[inch|in]]) [[space observatory|space telescope]], which mission lasted from December 2009 to February 2011. In 2011 Kirkpatrick et al. published a paper in [[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement]], where they presented discovery of 98 new found by WISE [[brown dwarf]] systems with components of [[spectral type]]s M, L, T and Y, among which also was WISE 0313+7807.{{r|Kirkpatrick2011}}&lt;ref name="note 1" group="note"&gt;This 98 brown dwarf systems are only among first, not all brown dwarf systems, discovered from data, collected by WISE: six discoveries was published earlier (however, also listed in Kirkpatrick et al. (2011)) in Mainzer et al. (2011) and Burgasser et al. (2011), and the other discoveries was published later.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distance==
[[Trigonometric parallax]] of WISE 0313+7807 is 153 ± 15 mas, corresponding to distance of 6.5{{±|0.7|0.6}} pc or 21.3{{±|2.3|1.9}} ly.{{r|Beichman2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">The '''Weiss magneton''' was an experimentally derived unit of [[magnetic moment]] equal to {{val|1.853|e=-24}} [[joule]]s per [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], which is about 20% of the [[Bohr magneton]]. It was suggested in 1911 by [[Pierre Weiss]].&lt;ref name="Keith"/&gt;

==Origin==
The idea of elementary magnets originated from the Swiss physicist [[Walther Ritz]], who tried to explain [[atomic spectra]]. In 1907 he suggested that atoms might contain chains of magnetized and neutral rods, which were the cause of magnetic properties of materials. Just like elementary charges, this was supposed to give rise to discrete values of the total magnetic moment per atom.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, Weiss performed measurements of the [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation magnetization]] at the temperature of [[liquid hydrogen]] in the laboratory of [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in Leiden. In 1911, Weiss announced that the molar moments of nickel and iron had the ratio of 3:11, from which he derived the value of a magneton.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with early quantum theory==
Weiss gave an address about the magneton at a conference in [[Karlsruhe]] in September 1911. Several theorists commented that the magneton should involve [[Planck's constant]] ''h''. By postulating that the ratio of electron [[kinetic energy]] to orbital [[frequency]] should be equal to ''h'', [[Richard Gans]] computed a value that was almost an order of magnitude larger than the value obtained by Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Solvay Conference#First Conference|First Solvay Conference]] in November that year, [[Paul Langevin]] obtained a submultiple which gave better agreement.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But once the [[old quantum theory]] was a bit better understood, no theoretical argument could be found to justify Weiss's value. In 1920, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] wrote an article where he called the magneton of the experimentalists the Weiss magneton, and the theoretical value the [[Bohr magneton]].&lt;ref name="Keith"/&gt;

==Further experiments==
Despite theoretical problems, Weiss and other experimentalists like [[Blas Cabrera Felipe|Blas Cabrera]] continued to analyze data in terms of the Weiss magneton until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Keith"/&gt;

The simple formula of Yhprum's law is: "Everything that can work, will work."   

Another formulation of the law due to [[Richard Zeckhauser]], a professor for [[political economy]] at [[Harvard University]] states: "Sometimes systems that should not work, work nevertheless."  

Resnick ''et al''. (2006) used this law to describe how intensive and seemingly [[altruistic]] participation by giving ranking is observed in the [[eBay]] system.&lt;ref name=Resnick06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Resnick|first=Paul|author2=Zeckhauser, Richard |author3=Swanson, John |author4= Lockwood, Kate |title=The value of reputation on eBay: A controlled experiment|journal=Experimental Economics|date=June 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=79–101|doi=10.1007/s10683-006-4309-2|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rzeckhau/postcards.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
