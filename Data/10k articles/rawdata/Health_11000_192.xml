      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9726">The '''Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality home page|publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|url=http://www.ahrq.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''AHRQ'''; pronounced "ark" by initiates and often "A-H-R-Q" by the public) is 1 of 12 agencies within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).&lt;ref name=99a/&gt; The agency is headquartered in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville, MD]], a suburb of [[Washington, D.C.]] It was established as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) as a constituent unit of the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] (PHS) under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (103 Stat. 2159), December 19, 1989, to enhance the [[health care quality|quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health care services]] and access to care by conducting and supporting research, demonstration projects, and evaluations; developing guidelines; and disseminating information on health care services and delivery systems.

However, AHCPR became controversial when it produced several guidelines that some thought would reduce medical drugs and procedures. This included concern from [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] on a cataract guideline and concern by the pharmaceutical industry over a reduction in the use of new drugs. When the agency produced a guideline that concluded that back pain surgery was unnecessary and potentially harmful, a lobbying campaign aided by Congressmen whose backs had been operated on changed the name of the agency and scaled back the guidelines program, which now exists as the [[National Guideline Clearinghouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Avorn J. ''Powerful Medicines: The Benefits, Risks, and Costs of Prescription Drugs'', pp. 277–288. Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; AHCPR was reauthorized December 6, 1999,  for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)  under the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999,&lt;ref name=99a&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999|website=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/policymakers/hrqa99a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which amended Title IX of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq).

==History==
During its early years, the Agency for Healthcare Policy and RESEARCH implemented large multidisciplinary, multi-institutional projects that focused on patient results in certain medical conditions in an effort to improve clinical practice.  This has included basic health [[Information technology|IT]] research, patient safety research on wrong site surgery, medical teamwork, and hospital acquired conditions such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|VRE]].

==Funding==
The Trump administration proposes to merge the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality with the National Institutes of Health. The President's FY 2018 Request to Congress for the Agency was for $378.5 million.

The 2015 budget for AHRQ is US$440 million,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/budget/fy2015/fy-2015-budget-in-brief.pdf 2015 Department of Health and Human Services Budget-in-Brief] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723144330/http://www.hhs.gov/budget/fy2015/fy-2015-budget-in-brief.pdf |date=2014-07-23 }}, pg 10, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Accessed 2015-07-14&lt;/ref&gt; $24 million less than FY 2014. Within this total, the budget includes $334 million in Public Health Service (PHS) Evaluation Funds, a decrease of $30 million from FY 2014, and $106 million from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund, an increase of $13 million above FY 2014.

The FY 2015 budget is intended to ensure the Agency continues its progress on health services research to improve outcomes, affordability, and quality. The budget also supports the collection of information on health care spending and use through the [http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project] (HCUP) and [http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/ Medical Expenditure Panel Survey] (MEPS).

The FY 2015 budget provides $73 million, an increase of $1 million from FY 2014, for AHRQ's patient safety research and dissemination projects that prevent, mitigate, and decrease the number of medical errors, patient safety risks and hazards, and quality gaps. 
The budget includes $23 million, a $6 million decrease from FY 2014, for health information technology (health IT) research, and the development and dissemination of evidence and evidence-based tools to inform policy and practice on how health IT can improve the quality of American health care. In FY 2015, AHRQ will provide $20 million to support 40 grants for foundational health IT research to inform and support the meaningful use of health IT.

In July 2018, the [[National Guideline Clearinghouse]] (NGC) and the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/talkingquality/resources/initiatives/nqmc.html|title=National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)|website=Ahrq.gov|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; two longtime online resources from the AHRQ, were shut down because federal funding ceased to be available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aafp.org/news/government-medicine/20180627guidelineclearinghouse.html|title=AHRQ: National Guideline Clearinghouse to Shut Down July 16|website=Aafp.org|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hhs-eliminates-20-years-evidence-based-medical-guidelines|title=HHS eliminates 20 years of evidence-based medical guidelines|date=12 July 2018|website=Healthcareitnews.com|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/federal-clinical-guidance-database-to-shut-down-because-of-funding-cuts|title=Federal clinical guidance database to shut down because of funding cuts|website=Healthdatamanagement.com|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/hit-programs-at-risk-as-ahrq-faces-elimination|title=HIT programs at risk as AHRQ faces elimination|website=Healthdatamanagement.com|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stakeholders were exploring options for hosting the NGC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/generalprofessionalissues/74153|title=AHRQ Shutters Guideline Site, But ECRI to Carry the Torch|date=20 July 2018|website=Medpagetoday.com|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]; should that happen, it will return to the web.

==Leadership==
[[Gopal Khanna]], MBA was appointed as Agency director on May 9, 2017. Prior to that, Dr. Andrew Bindman was the director of AHRQ from April 2016 until January 2017. Prior to joining AHRQ, Dr. Bindman served as faculty of UCSF School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/people/andrew-bindman-md] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Arnold Ph.D. was acting director from February - April 2016, replacing Richard Kronick in February 2016. [[Richard Kronick]], Ph.D. was director from 2013 to March 2016. Carolyn Clancy M.D. was the director from 2002- 2014.

==Divisions==
The Agency has multiple offices and centers including the Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement (CEPI), the Center for Financing, Access and Trends, the Center for Delivery, Organization and Markets, the Center for Quality and Patient Safety, the Office of Management Services, the Office of Extramural Research and Priority Populations, and the Office of Communications. The Office of Communications was previously known as the Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/04/15/2016-08679/statement-of-organization-functions-and-delegations-of-authority|title=Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority|author=|date=15 April 2016|website=federalregister.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within CEPI, the Evidence-Based Practice Centers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/who-is-involved-in-the-effective-health-care-program1/about-evidence-based-practice-centers-epcs/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (EPCs) develop evidence reports and technology assessments on topics relevant to clinical and other health care organization and delivery issues—specifically those that are common, expensive, and/or significant for the Medicare and Medicaid populations. With this program, AHRQ serves as a "science partner" with private and public organizations in their efforts to improve the quality, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care by synthesizing the evidence and facilitating the translation of evidence-based research findings. Topics are nominated by Federal and non-Federal partners such as professional societies, health plans, insurers, employers, and patient groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/overview/index.html|title=Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPC) Program Overview|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=29 April 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of the rehabilitation of either edentulous or dentate [[maxilla]] and/or [[mandible]] with fixed [[prosthesis]] by placing four [[Dental implant|implants]] in the anterior maxilla, where bone density is higher. The four implants support a fixed prosthesis with 10 to 14 teeth and it is placed immediately, typically within 24 hours of surgery.

Implant manufacturer [[Nobel Biocare]] was among the first to identify the evolution of the All-on-4 technique as a potential valid and cost-effective alternative to conventional implant techniques, and funded studies by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] dentist [[Paulo Maló]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1708-8208.2003.tb00010.x |title='All-on-Four' Immediate-Function Concept with Brånemark System Implants for Completely Edentulous Mandibles: A Retrospective Clinical Study |year=2003 |last1=Maló |first1=Paulo |last2=Rangert |first2=Bo |last3=Nobre |first3=Miguel |journal=Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research |volume=5 |pages=2–9 |pmid=12691645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16137093"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1708-8208.2005.tb00080.x |title=All-on-4 Immediate-Function Concept with Brånemark System Implants for Completely Edentulous Maxillae: A 1-Year Retrospective Clinical Study |year=2005 |last1=Malo |first1=Paulo |last2=Rangert |first2=Bo |last3=Nobre |first3=Miguel |journal=Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research |volume=7 |pages=S88–94 |pmid=16137093}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to determine the efficacy of this approach. During this time this technique was also used by various other clinicians around the world.

All-on-4 is not an invention, but rather a treatment technique that has evolved over time and has the following features:
* four dental implants to support a full fixed bridge (documented since 1977&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Osseointegrated Implants in the Treatment of the Edentulous Jaw|last=Branemark|first=Per-Ingvar|publisher=Almquivist &amp; Weksell International|year=1977|isbn=91-22-00128-X|location=Sweden|pages=79, 81, 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* the use of angulated implants in the back to overcome bony deficiencies or anatomical structures (documented since 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallus|first=T|date=Spring 1990|title=Clinical evaluation of angulated abutments for the Brånemark system: a pilot study.|journal=Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants|doi=|pmid=2202668|volume=5|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* immediate loading (documented since 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lefkove|first=MD|date=1990|title=Immediate loading of cylinder implants with overdentures in the mandibular symphysis: the titanium plasma-sprayed screw technique.|journal=J Oral Implantol|doi=|pmid=2098572|volume=16|pages=265–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The concept itself of the total rehabilitation of a full set of teeth supported by as few as four fixtures was not a new one. Professor P-I Branemark,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; who discovered [[osseointegration]], published numerous articles in the 1970s with successful rehabilitation of a full arch supported by this number of fixtures. However, it was the angulation of the back implants that led to today's All-on-4, and has been trialed by numerous clinicians simultaneously in the United States, Sweden, Portugal, and South America in the 1990s. The technique evolved when in an attempt to avoid certain anatomical limitations typically seen in the back of the upper and lower jaws have, clinicians successfully avoided bone-deficient areas with the use of angulated implants. Anatomical limitations are more prevalent in patients with full dentures, and once the back implants are placed at an angle there is often only enough room left for two more implants in the front. This has led to the use of only four fixtures to support a full set of teeth.

The benefits of All-on-4 implants include:
* Full-arch restoration
* Shorter installation times than other implants
* Prevents further bone loss
* Decreases the need for a bone graft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamworthdentists.co.uk/dental-implants/all-on-4-dental-implants/|title=All on 4 Dental Implants in Tamworth &amp; Lichfield {{!}} Tamworth Dental &amp; Implant Clinic|website=www.tamworthdentists.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the procedure==
The All-on-4 treatment concept is a [[prosthodontic]] procedure (i.e. replacement of missing teeth) that provides a permanent, screw-retained, same-day replacement for the entire upper and / or lower set of teeth with a bridge or denture. The procedure is best for patients with significant tooth loss or decay and for people whose bone loss in the jaw area prevents them from getting conventionally oriented (vertical) dental implants. Often, tooth loss is accompanied by loss of the jaw bone which poses the problem of reconstruction of the jaw bone requiring bone grafting. The All-on-Four technique takes advantage of the dense bone that remains in the front part of the jaws and by placing the two posterior implants on an angle to avoid the sinus cavities in the upper jaw and the nerve canal in the lower jaw.&lt;ref&gt;https://allonfour.com/about-dental-implants/&lt;/ref&gt; For the implementation to be successful a careful analysis of the bone structure needs to be made. The most ideal way to evaluate the bone is by a CBCT scan. The All-on-4 protocol is for at least four implants to be placed in a jaw. The back implants are typically angled approximately 30 to 45 degrees from the biting plane. The implant is placed in front of the maxillary sinus in the upper jaw (maxilla) and in front of the mental nerve in the lower jaw (mandible). The head of the implant emerges in approximately the second premolar position. This will allow a molar tooth to be cantilevered posterior resulting in a denture or bridge with approximately 12 teeth. 

The All-on-4 treatment concept owes its name to the very nature of the method, which consists of applying a dental prosthesis with at least twelve teeth (bridge) fixed in the jaw, based only on four titanium implants.&lt;ref name=pmid16137093/&gt;

==Patent claims for the dental implant fixation==

There is no patent for the All-on-4 technique.

==Price of the treatment==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The price may vary for each country or region, and normally it is divided in two phases. The usual price in the United States is described below:

* The surgical component of removing any compromised remaining teeth, and placing the four dental implants may cost US$12,000–15,000 per jaw.
* The restorative component involving the connection of the teeth may cost US$15,000–$25,000 per jaw, dependent on the materials used such as ceramic, zirconia, or acrylic denture base.
* The total cost of surgery and restorative component can therefore be in the range of $30,000–40,000 per jaw (upper or lower)
* Providers may utilize computer-guided technology that can improve the surgical and restorative outcome with additional cost, but the cost is to improve the treatment outcome

In Europe the price of all-on-4 treatment varies by country. In the UK the cost is comparable to US, and the price is about US$15,000 per jaw. In Germany the price may reach US$12,000. The cheapest option for having all on 4 are eastern European countries. For example, in Poland or Hungary the treatment costs around US$6000–7000 per jaw, dependent on materials and type of restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dentaltravelpoland.co.uk/treatment/all-on-4-dental-implants/|title=All-on-4 dental implants Poland, abroad- prices, reviews, before and after {{!}} Dental Travel Poland|website=www.dentaltravelpoland.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total price (if both upper jaw and lower jaw are considered) could possibly reach US$70,000–80,000. It is important to note that when this treatment is completed by a single doctor, the treatment fees are much lower when compared to a team approach with two doctors, where both would charge separate fees, potentially increasing the cost of the treatment. Clinics with suitable facilities, which are able to offer the entire treatment in one place, and who do these procedures regularly, are typically the most cost-effective.

'''The Aman Foundation''' is a [[not for profit]] trust, based in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. In 2015, under the ''Shajar-e-Aman'' plantation drive the Aman Foundation planted 2,000 local trees, and 200 flowers at the [[Hill Park, Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Citizens for a greener Karachi|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/936908/environmentally-conscious-citizens-for-a-greener-karachi/|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=[[Express Tribune]]|date=August 13, 2015|ref=One of the largest public parks in the of the city, Hill Park, will be greener than ever, as the Aman Foundation planted 2,000 local trees, and 200 flowers at the park.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Aman Foundation, in collaboration with the [[Edhi Foundation]] initiated the annual Edhi Award for [[Prehospital Emergency Care|Pre-hospital Care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aman Foundation, Edhi Foundation initiate Edhi Award|url=http://pakobserver.net/aman-foundation-edhi-foundation-initiate-edhi-award/|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=[[Pakistan Observer]]|date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aman Health==
The Aman Foundation has developed a complete healthcare eco-system, targeting important healthcare matters. Aman Health established heat relief camps in Karachi during the [[2015 Pakistan heat wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beating the heat: Aman Foundation sets up six relief camps|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/915463/beating-the-heat-aman-foundation-sets-up-six-relief-camps/|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=[[Express Tribune]]|date=July 6, 2015|ref=In response to the recent heatwave that claimed hundreds of lives in the city, the Aman Foundation set up six relief camps to alleviate the suffering of the people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aman Ambulance===
Aman Health’s flagship initiative, Aman Ambulance, has changed the landscape of emergency care in Pakistan and is the first state-of-the-art ambulatory vehicle network providing round-the-clock emergency care in the province of Sindh. However seemed unable to provide assistance in the case of a 10 year old girl shot in the head by a bullet, leading to her unfortunate death.

With a fleet of 60 ambulances, the service includes 227 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), 16 doctors and life-saving drugs and equipment, providing 24/7 emergency medical interventions with an average response of 12 minutes.

The Aman Ambulance also holds the recognition of being awarded the ‘Best In Asia’ EMS Service Award, in 2014, by The Asian Emergency Council.

Aman Ambulance is run on international protocols, equipped with the latest medical equipment and life-saving drugs and is staffed with trained medical professionals. The service provides a tiered emergency response system with Basic Life Support Ambulances and Advanced Life Support Ambulances equipped with AED machines and cardiac monitors. In addition, Advanced Cardiac Life Support Ambulances are equipped with ECG machines, which is a unique service available in Karachi.

===Aman Community Health Program (ACHP)===
The Aman Community Health Program (ACHP) disseminates basic preventive healthcare information through community members to reduce the incidence of disease and death in Karachi’s most affected population. The ACHP consists of a mobile field force of hundreds of women trained to initiate inquiries and follow-ups on health issues that are common in their local communities. These include maternal and neo-natal care, malaria, acute infections and addictions. This program empowers underprivileged citizens, especially women, to participate in community welfare activities and increase their access to medical attention for key healthcare issues.

===MASHAL===
MASHAL, the  which means torch in the Urdu Language, also stands for ‘Mental and Social Health Advocacy and Literacy’. It is the Mental Health Initiative launched under The Aman Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/692206/health-concerns-aman-foundation-hopes-to-alleviate-depression-mental-disorders/|title=Health concerns: Aman Foundation hopes to alleviate depression, mental disorders|website=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SUKH===
SUKH concentrates on maternal and child health. The program was initiated to increase the Modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (MCPR) while at the same time ensuring sustainability. It mainly focuses on increasing the demand for Family Planning services and enhancing the quality of services that the facility provides.

The Sukh Initiative emerged from commitments made between Aman Foundation, [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]] and [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], after the 2012 London Summit on family planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/632131/saving-mothers-and-children-us-pak-ngos-launch-maternal-child-healthcare-initiative/|title=Saving mothers and children: US, Pak NGOs launch maternal, child healthcare initiative|website=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aman Telehealth===
Considering the unaffordability of healthcare service for a large majority of the Pakistani population, AMAN TELEHEALTH service was initiated to offer consultations, advice and triage for the most common illnesses over the phone. Besides dealing with common physical ailments, AMAN TELEHEALTH also offers mental health advice via a Mental Health Counsellor. This service especially targets women by offering them a platform via which they can seek medical advice and counseling without leaving their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ilyas|first1=Faiza|title=Dial ‘d’ for doctor|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1103493|website=Dawn|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8939">The '''Angel Makers of Nagyrév''' were a group of women living in the village of [[Nagyrév, Hungary]] who between 1914 and 1929 poisoned to death an estimated 300 people. They were supplied arsenic and encouraged to use it for the purpose by a midwife or "wise woman" named '''Susanna Fazekas''', wife of Julius Fazekas, née '''Susi Oláh''' (Fazekas Gyuláné Oláh Zsuzsanna).

==Crimes==
Mrs. Fazekas was a middle-aged midwife who arrived in Nagyrév in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Heather Sutfin|title=The Angel Makers of Nagyrév|url=http://swordandscale.com/the-angel-makers-of-nagyrev/|website=Sword and Scale|accessdate=10 December 2016|ref=Sword|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her husband already missing without explanation. Between 1911 and 1921 she was imprisoned 10 times for performing illegal [[abortion]]s, but was consistently [[acquittal|acquitted]] by judges supporting abortion.

In Hungarian society at that time, the future husband of a teenage bride was selected by her family and she was forced to accept her parents' choice. [[Divorce]] was not allowed socially, even if the husband was an [[alcoholic]] or [[domestic violence|abusive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popham|first1=Peter|title=Hungary: Murder on the Danube|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-murder-on-the-danube-517007.html|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=The Independent|date=26 November 2005|ref=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], when able-bodied men were sent to fight for [[Austria-Hungary]], rural Nagyrév was an ideal location for holding [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. With the limited freedom of POWs about the village, the women living there often had one or more foreign lovers while their husbands were away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katherine Ramsland |authorlink1=Katherine Ramsland |title=Angels of Death – Nurses, nurses who kill their patients (Chapter 5, Murder by Proxy) |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com:80/notorious_murders/angels/female_nurses/5.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303182947/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/female_nurses/5.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 March 2007 |website=The Crime library |accessdate=10 December 2016 |date=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the men returned, many of them rejected their wives' affairs and wished to return to their previous way of life, creating a volatile situation. At this time Fazekas began secretly persuading women who wished to escape this situation to poison their husbands using [[arsenic]] made by boiling [[flypaper]] and skimming off the lethal residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fish|first1=Jim|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Europe {{!}} Unearthing Hungary husband murders|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3567679.stm|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=news.bbc.co.uk|date=29 March 2004|ref=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barry Yeoman|title=Bad Girls|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199911/bad-girls|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC|date=1 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial killing of their husbands, some of the women went on to poison parents who had become a burden to them, or to get hold of their inheritance. Others poisoned their lovers, some even their sons; as the midwife allegedly told the poisoners, "Why put up with them?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katie Heaney|title=11 Terrifying Female Serial Killers You've Never Heard Of|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/11-terrifying-female-serial-killers-youve-never-heard-of|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=15 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rubicon.hu/magyar/oldalak/arzenes_asszonyok_rendhagyo_sorozatgyilkossag_a_horthy_korban/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first poisoning in Nagyrév took place in 1911; it was not the work of Mrs. Fazekas. The deaths of other husbands, children, and family members soon followed. The poisoning became a fad, and by the mid-1920s, Nagyrév earned the nickname "the murder district." There were an estimated 45–50 murders over the 18 years that Mrs. Fazekas lived in the district. She was the closest thing to a doctor the village had and her cousin was the clerk who filed all the death certificates, allowing the murders to go undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tonya Blust|title=Creepy crimes from the 1920s|url=http://www.historictruecrime.com/creepy-crimes-from-the-1920s/|website=www.historictruecrime.com|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three conflicting accounts have been cited to explain how the Angel Makers were eventually detected. In one, Mrs. Szabó, one of the Angel Makers, was caught in the act by two visitors who survived her poisoning attempts. She fingered a Mrs. Bukenoveski, who named Mrs. Fazekas. In another account, a medical student in a neighboring town found high arsenic levels in a body that washed up on the riverbank, leading to an investigation. However, according to Béla Bodó, a Hungarian-American historian and author of the first scholarly book on the subject, the murders were finally made public in 1929 when an anonymous letter to the editor of a small local newspaper accused women from the [[Tiszazug]] region of the country of poisoning family members. 

The authorities exhumed dozens of corpses from the local cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American front in the Hungarian village killer|url=http://eletmod.transindex.ro/?hir=3976|website=www.transindex.ro|publisher=Index Media Association|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 34 women and one man were indicted.  Afterwards, 26 of the Angel Makers were tried, among them Susi Oláh. Eight were sentenced to death but only two were [[capital punishment|executed]].  Another 12 received prison sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/036319900202700103 | author = Bodó, Béla | title = The poisoning women of Tiszazug | journal = Journal of Family History | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 | pages = 40–59 | pmid = 11789522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">'''Cannabis in Malta''' is illegal but partially decriminalized. In 2018, Malta legalized medical cannabis.

==Enforcement==
In 2015, Malta introduced new policies to decriminalize cannabis. Simple possession will still remain an "arrestable offense" is for the police to be able to fight drug trafficking, and says that the possession of a minimal amount of drugs (3.5g) for personal consumption will effectively be decriminalized. First-time offenders will be handed fines of between €50 and €100 in the case of cannabis possession. Repeat offenders will appear before a Drug Offenders Rehabilitation Board, headed by retired Chief of Justice, which will set conditions for rehabilitation. Breaching the conditions would be tantamount to a criminal offense. The Magistrates Court - in cases not involving the use of weapons or violence - would be able to act as a Drugs Court and refer the accused for treatment to the rehabilitation board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/51881/new_drugs_reform_law_into_force_today_what_has_changed#.WDYlVpLvhDq|title=New drugs reform law into force today– what has changed?|publisher=Malta Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-03-17/local-news/Simple-possession-to-remain-an-arrestable-offence-but-only-to-fight-drug-trade-Bonnici-6736132323|title=Simple possession to remain an ‘arrestable offence’ - but only to fight drug trade – Bonnici - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical cannabis==
[[Sativex]] was approved for prescription use in 2015.  As of July 2017, however, no patients have been treated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Tim|title=Thousands in Malta suffering over extreme restrictions on medical cannabis, says family doctor|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/lifestyle/health/78986/thousands_suffering_over_extreme_restrictions_on_medical_cannabis_says_family_doctor#.WiIkKUqnHGg|accessdate=2017-12-01|work=Malta Today|date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, the Maltese president signed into law legislation approving medical cannabis with a prescription, though the legislation did not detail which specific conditions would merit the use of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mjbizdaily.com/malta-legalizes-marijuana-prescriptions-production-law-nears-approval/|title=Malta legalizes marijuana prescriptions; production law nears approval|date=5 April 2018|publisher=MJ Biz Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/85616/malta_has_officially_legalised_medical_cannabis|title=Malta has officially legalised medical cannabis|publisher=Malta Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18993">'''Capital punishment''' is prohibited in '''Germany''' by constitution. It was abolished in [[West Germany]] in 1949 and [[East Germany]] in 1987. The last person executed in Germany was the East German [[Werner Teske]], killed in an East German prison in [[Leipzig]] in 1981.

==Current legal position==
The current [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution of Germany]] ("Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland"), which came into effect on 23 May 1949, forbids [[capital punishment]]. This ban is stated in [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P102 article 102 GG]: "Die Todesstrafe ist abgeschafft" - ''Capital punishment is abolished.''&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bundesrecht/gg/gesamt.pdf Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland 29.7.2009]
[https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf  Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (Official english translation Stand 22.09.09)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is debated among constitutional jurists whether article 102 GG in combination [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P2 article 2 section 2 GG] – "Jeder hat das Recht auf Leben und körperliche Unversehrtheit" (''Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity'') prohibits any [[targeted killing]] on the part of the state (e.g. in the context of a hostage situation).&lt;ref&gt;on this point, German Wikipedia ([[:de:Todesstrafe#cite ref-169]]) cites Roman Herzog: Todesstrafe I. Rechtlich B. Verfassungsrechtlich. In: Evangelisches Staatslexikon. Band 2, Stuttgart 1987, Sp. 3614.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been debate on the question whether this article could legally be abolished by a two-thirds majority in Bundestag and Bundesrat. This is ostensibly the case, as section 3 of article 79 GG explicitly prohibits amendments of articles 1 and 20, exclusively, from which it follows that article 102 can in principle legally be amended or abolished under article 79. To dispute this, legal scholars have attempted to argue that the prohibition of capital punishment follows necessarily from article 2 GG, which would make article 102 GG entirely redundant. Article 102, according to its systematical place, does not guarantee a basic right but enacts a judiciary restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Herzog: Todesstrafe I. Rechtlich B. Verfassungsrechtlich. In: Evangelisches Staatslexikon. Band 2, Stuttgart 1987, Sp. 3615.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While this was the intention of the authors of the Constitution of 1949, the German [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] in 1995 has argued that "concerns" (''Bedenken'') related to the general nature of the death penalty "suggest" (''legen den Befund nahe'') that capital punishment should indeed be considered inadmissible already as a consequence of the guarantee of [[human dignity]] in article 1 GG.&lt;ref&gt;
"Die staatliche Organisation einer Vollstreckung der Todesstrafe ist schließlich, gemessen am Ideal der Menschenwürde, ein schlechterdings unzumutbares und unerträgliches Unterfangen.  Diese Bedenken legen den Befund nahe, daß nach deutschem Verfassungsrecht jegliche Wiedereinführung der Todesstrafe – auch abgesehen von Art. 102 GG – vor Art. 1 Abs. 1 GG und der Wesensgehaltsgarantie des Grundrechts auf Leben (Art. 2 Abs. 2 Satz 1 i. V. m. Art. 19 Abs. 2 GG) keinen Bestand haben könnte" [http://lexetius.com/1995,464 BGH, Urteil vom 16. 11. 1995 – 5 StR 747/94; Ziffer 28 ff.;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Penal Code was formally&lt;ref&gt;This did not lead to a change of the law-as-in-force itself, which had immediately taken place with the enactment of the Basic Law.&lt;/ref&gt; amended in 1951 to conform to the abolition. Previous death sentences were replaced by [[life imprisonment in Germany|life imprisonment]]. As the constitution requires that prisoners have a chance of regaining freedom with other means than [[pardon|extralegal pardon]] only,&lt;ref&gt;as ruled by the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in BVerfGE [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv045187.html 45,147] in 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; prisoners are checked for [[parole|release on parole]] after 15 years for regular intervals. Since the introduction of this provision, courts may in extreme cases declare ''special gravity of guilt'' which is meant and popularized as [[life without parole]].&lt;ref&gt;Though some realistic hope for regaining freedom must still be guaranteed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although article 21.1 of the constitution of the German [[states of Germany|state]] of [[Hesse]] provides capital punishment for high crimes, this provision is inoperative due to the federal ban on the death penalty ("Bundesrecht bricht Landesrecht." (article 31 GG) – Federal law overrides state law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P31 article 31 GG] It would, of course, also be inactive due to lack of an implementing penal law today.&lt;/ref&gt;). The Bavarian Constitution, while not providing the death penalty by itself, for a long time contained a rule of implementation of it&lt;ref&gt;''The execution of capital punishment requires previous confirmation by the government'', article 47 IV 2 (old form) of the Bavarian Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt; which was abrogated in a summary constitutional amendment in 1998.

==History==

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{main|High justice}}
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[high justice]] originally was reserved to the king. From the 13th century, it was transferred to the king's [[feudalism|vassals]] along with their fiefs.
The first codification of capital punishment was the ''Halsgerichtsordnung'' passed by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1499, followed in 1507 by the ''Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis''.
Both codes formed the basis of the ''Constitutio Criminalis Carolina'' (CCC), passed in  1532 under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].
In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], all regional codes were superseded by the ''Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana'' in 1768.

===Confederation and Reich 1849-1933 ===
If the [[Constitution of the German Empire (1849)|German constitution]] enacted by the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] in 1849 had come into force, capital punishment would have been abolished in most cases, since Art. III § 139 of the constitution stated: "''Die Todesstrafe, ausgenommen wo das Kriegsrecht sie vorschreibt, oder das Seerecht im Fall von Meutereien sie zuläßt, [...], [ist] abgeschafft''" ("Capital punishment, except when it is prescribed by martial law or permitted by the law of the seas in cases of mutiny, [...] [is] abolished"). These lines were deleted in the constitution for the [[Erfurt Union]] of 1849/1850.

Historian [[Christopher Clark]] noted that the death penalty was not very prevalent for example in [[Prussia]]. He compared Prussia to England and Wales, together even populous, in the first half of the 19th century. Every year, in England and Wales for about 16 times as many people were executed. While in Prussia the death penalty was usually applied only in murder cases, the English executed people also for stealing, sometimes even in minor cases.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Clark: Preußen. Aufstieg und Niedergang. 1600–1947. BpB, Bonn 2007, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Empire (1871–1918) quite liberally inflicted the death penalty for some forms of (1) [[treason|high treason]] and for (2) [[murder]]. Murder was then defined as killing with premeditation; only murder and attempted murder of one's sovereign was capital treason.&lt;ref&gt;§ 80, 211 StGB 1871. ''Souvereign'' was not only the Emperor, but also the Prince of both one's own [[States of Germany|State]] and the State of momentary sojourn.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under military law, in case of a war only, some other particularly listed forms of (3) ''treason'', some cases of (4) [[Surrender (military)|wrongful surrender]], (5) [[desertion]] in the field in case of relapse, if the previous desertion also had taken place in the field, (6) [[cowardice]] if it led to a flight with enticing one's comrades to flight, (7) explicit [[insubordination|disobeying an order]] by word or deed in the face of the enemy, (8) [[sedition]] in the face of the enemy, or in the field (only) if done as a ringleader or instigator, or with violence as a leading man.&lt;ref&gt;Militär-Strafgesetzbuch für das Deutsche Reich (MStGB)&lt;/ref&gt; During the German empire, the legal methods were, the hand-held [[axe]], in some states also the [[guillotine]] for civilian crimes and [[firing squad]] for military crimes.

According to [[Manfred Messerschmidt]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Messerschmidt]], ''Die Wehrmachtjustiz 1933-1945'', [http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/politischeliteratur/450137/].&lt;/ref&gt; "from 1907 to 1932," i. e. including [[World War I]], "Germany had issued 1547 death warrants, of which 393 were executed. The [[Weimar Republic]] retained death penalty for murder, and several murderers were guillotined.

===Nazi Germany===
As to the National Socialists, the leading Nazi jurist [[Hans Frank]] boasted at the 1934 [[Reichsparteitag]] of “reckless implementation of the death penalty” as a special acquisition of the Nazi regime. Under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] nearly 40,000 death sentences were handed down, mainly by the [[Volksgerichtshof]] and also by the Reich [[Military Tribunal]]. 

Executions were carried out most often by [[beheading]] using the [[guillotine]], which in 1936 was ordained the official means of civil execution of capital punishment. From 1942 on [[hanging]] by using the short-drop method was also used, notoriously in the reprisals in the aftermath of the [[20 July plot]]. A [[firing squad]] was reserved for military offenders.

Additional forms declared [[treason]] could (in some cases, especially for soldiers, mandatorily) be prosecuted with death, as could grave [[arson]],&lt;ref&gt;as enacted by the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]]. A further law, the [[Lex van der Lubbe]], provided restrospective application so that [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] could be "executed" or, rather, murdered.&lt;/ref&gt; aiding and abetting treason, betraying a secret (mandatorily), procuring a secret for the sake of betraying it, insidious publishing or rhetoric, failure to denounce a capital crime, destroying means for military use, [[sabotage]] (mandatorily for soldiers), [[kidnapping]] (mandatorily),&lt;ref&gt;cf. the respective forms of the StGB&lt;/ref&gt; compassing or imagining the death of a NS or state official for political reasons or the reason of their service,&lt;ref&gt;Law for the upholding of the legal peace, § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[carjacking|setting a car trap for the means of robbery]] (mandatorily), [[espionage]] (mandatorily), [[partisan (military)|partisan]]ry (mandatorily), all cases of desertion, [[Wehrkraftzersetzung|subversion of military strength]] (mandatorily except for minor cases),&lt;ref&gt;Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung&lt;/ref&gt; [[looting]] (mandatorily even in cases of smallest amounts), arson which damages the power of defense of the people, crime during danger resulting from enemy aviation (in grave cases), taking advantage of the state of war whilst committing a crime ("if the sound feeling of the people so requires"), publishing foreign radio broadcasts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19400206&amp;id=G3ZDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MpIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6400,3346414|title=Grim penal code|last=|first=|date=February 6, 1940|work=The Glasgow Herald|access-date=June 18, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of murder was changed and, in practice, extended to the rather vague definition [[murder (German law)|still in force]], but now only with life imprisonment. This list is by no means exhaustive, even where laws and decrees are concerned.

As an addition to crimes declared capital by law or decree, a "dangerous habitual criminal" or one convicted of [[rape]] could be executed "if the protection of the people or the need for just atonement so demands",&lt;ref&gt;Law of 1941 for the amendment of the Penal Code, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; courts (or whatever was in place of a court) sometimes were officially granted the right to inflict the death penalty even where not provided by law, and sometimes did so by their own discretion. Many of the crimes covered a wide and unpredictable range of actions, such as treason, "sabotage" (Kriegsverrat, which was any action pandering the enemy) and subversion of the military strength, which could be interpreted as to cover any critical remark, and even though even it did clearly not cover it was applied to execute any [[conscientious objector]].

To quote [[Hitler]], "after ten years of [[Zuchthaus|hard prison]], a man is lost to the people's community anyway. Thus what to do with such a guy is either put him into a concentration camp, or kill him. In latest times the latter is more important, for the sake of deterrence."&lt;ref&gt;as in: Richard J. Evans: ''Rituale der Vergeltung''. Berlin 2001, S. 828&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1933-1945, [[Wehrmacht]] courts  issued, conservatively estimated, 25000 death warrants, of which 18000 to 20000 were executed." According to official statistics,&lt;ref&gt;As reported on the [[:de:Todesstrafe#Zeit des Nationalsozialismus|German wikipedia]]{{clarify|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; other courts had altogether issued 16560 death warrants (whereof 664 before the war), of which about 12000 were executed. 
In fighting partisans, 345000 are reported to have been killed, of which less than 10% may have been partisans.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Curilla: Die deutsche Ordnungspolizei und der Holocaust im Baltikum und Weißrussland 1941-1944, Paderborn 2006, S. 742.&lt;/ref&gt;

This,{{clarify|date=January 2016}} however, should not obscure the fact that not only the National Socialist legal system was tyrannical (especially also with the [[protective custody]], to be inflicted at the [[Gestapo]]'s arbitration and to be fulfilled in a [[concentration camp]]), but this law{{clarify|date=January 2016}} also was broken to the detriment{{clarify|date=January 2016}} of those persecuted or opposing. 
A concentration camp commander could as early as in 1933 inflict the "death penalty" for disobedience, i. e. order to murder a disobedient, without any legal ground whatsoever besides the will of [[Heinrich Himmler]], but also without meeting opposition. Himmler himself offered an honorable way out for members of the SS who were convicted of capital crimes-they were locked in a room with a revolver and one live round, then given several hours to use it. After their deaths any surviving family were given pensions. Bl. Bishop [[Clemens von Galen|Clemens of Münster]] correctly saw himself legally obliged to denounce to the criminal police those responsible for the [[Action T4]], i. e. the killing of the handicapped, for murder (then: killing with premeditation); likewise, no law even of the Nazis allowed [[extermination through work]], and [[genocide|genocidal]] [[mass murder]], as in the case of the [[Holocaust]].

Charles Lane (writer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'') claims the abolishment of capital punishment was a reaction not to its extensive use under the Third Reich, but to the execution of convicted Nazi war criminals by the International War Crimes Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/03/AR2005060301450.html source]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that "judges more committed to the Nazi Party were more likely to impose the death sentence on defendants belonging to organised political opposition groups, those accused of violent resistance and those with characteristics to which Nazism was intolerant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geerling|first=Wayne|last2=Magee|first2=Gary|last3=Mishra|first3=Vinod|last4=Smyth|first4=Russell|date=2017-03-01|title=Hitler's Judges: Ideological Commitment and the Death Penalty in Nazi Germany|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12497/abstract|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12497|issn=1468-0297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
After World War II, limited executions of common and war criminals were carried out on West German soil.  The last common criminal to be executed in the Western Zones under German authority was Richard Schuh (murder and robbery) on February 18, 1949; in West Berlin the last execution was of Berthold Wehmeyer (murder, rape and robbery) on May 12, 1949. Despite the newly founded Federal Republic's protests, the Western Allied powers continued for some time to inflict the death penalty in their separate jurisdiction. The last war criminals being executed on June 7, 1951 at [[Landsberg prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Frei, Adenauer's Germany and the Nazi Past: The Politics of Amnesty and Integration. Columbia University Press, 2002. p 173&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1990, some "criminal actions against the Allied Occupating Powers' interests" remained capital in West Berlin, being under Allied jurisdiction without complete force of the Basic Law.  However, no capital sentences under this authority were carried out.

[[East Germany]] abolished the death penalty in 1987. The last execution in [[East Germany]] is believed to have been the shooting of [[Werner Teske]], convicted for [[treason]], in 1981; the last execution of a civilian (after 1970, capital punishment was rare and almost exclusively for espionage) was [[Erwin Hagedorn]], for sexually motivated child murder. By then, East German courts had inflicted the death penalty in 227 cases. 166 were executed, of which 52 for assumedly political crimes (espionage, sabotage etc.), 64 for crimes under Hitler's rule and 44 for common criminality (mostly murder under aggravated circumstances). Most of these took place during the 1950s; three known executions took place in the 70s and two in the 80s. The guillotine (called the ''Fallschwertmaschine'', "falling sword machine") was used for the last time on former [[SS]] doctor [[Horst Fischer]] in 1966, after which it was replaced by an "[[execution by shooting|unexpected close shot in the back of the head]]" (''"unerwarteter Nahschuss in das Hinterhaupt"'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runde-ecke-leipzig.de/index.php?id=402&amp;L=1 Hinrichtungen in Leipzig], Bürgerkomitee Leipzig e.V&lt;/ref&gt; East Germany was notable for its secrecy about its executions, even when the death warrants had been issued in show trials; death certificates mostly stated instead "heart failure".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Capital punishment]] for murder was abolished in [[Malta]] in 1971. It continued to be part of the country's military code until it was fully abolished on 21 March 2000. Malta is a signatory of the [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] that commits it to abolition of the death penalty within its borders. Malta has also ratified protocol 13 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], that bans the death penalty in all circumstances.

Eighteen executions were carried out between 1876 and 1943. The last executions, on 5 July 1943, were of the brothers Karmnu and Guzeppi Zammit who were hanged for the murder of Spiru Grech. The last execution for a crime other than murder took place during [[World War II]], when [[Carmelo Borg Pisani]] was hanged for treason on 28 November 1942. Pisani was a Maltese-born man who had joined the Italian [[National Fascist Party]] and taken Italian citizenship in 1940. He returned to Malta on an espionage mission in anticipation of an [[Operation Herkules|Axis invasion]] of the island.

The last person condemned to death was Anthony Patignott, on 1 October 1963, for the killing of Manwel Baldacchino. The Governor General of Malta, [[Maurice Henry Dorman]], commuted Patignott's sentence to life imprisonment.

Public opinion in Malta is strongly opposed to the death penalty. The 2008 European Values Study (EVS) found that 70.3% of respondents in Malta said that the death penalty can never be justified, while only 4.5% said it can always be justified.&lt;ref&gt;http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FZA4783&amp;variable=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA4783_V252&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=variable&amp;top=yes&amp;language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjugated linoleic acid is both a [[trans fat|''trans'' fatty acid]] and a ''cis'' fatty acid. The ''cis'' bond causes a lower melting point and ostensibly also the observed beneficial health effects. Unlike other ''trans'' fatty acids, it may have beneficial effects on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milk.co.uk/page.aspx?intPageID=283|title=Page not found|author=|date=|website=milk.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CLA is [[conjugated system|conjugated]], and in the United States, ''trans'' linkages in a conjugated system are not counted as ''trans'' fats for the purposes of nutritional regulations and labeling.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} CLA and some ''trans'' isomers of [[oleic acid]] are produced by microorganisms in the [[rumen]]s of ruminants. Non-ruminants, including humans, produce certain isomers of CLA from ''trans'' isomers of oleic acid, such as [[vaccenic acid]], which is converted to CLA by [[desaturase|delta-9-desaturase]].&lt;ref name=Kuhnt2006&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kuhnt K, Kraft J, Moeckel P, Jahreis G| title=Trans-11-18 : 1 is effectively Delta9-desaturated compared with trans-12-18 : 1 in humans| journal= Br J Nutr|date=April 2006|volume=95|issue=4|pages=752–761|pmid=16571155| doi=10.1079/BJN20051680| last2=Kraft| last3=Moeckel| last4=Jahreis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Banni&gt;{{cite journal |author=Banni S, Angioni E, Murru E, Carta G, Melis M, Bauman D, Dong Y, Ip C |title=Vaccenic acid feeding increases tissue levels of conjugated linoleic acid and suppresses development of premalignant lesions in rat mammary gland |journal=Nutr Cancer |volume=41 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–7 |year=2001 |pmid=12094634 |doi=10.1080/01635581.2001.9680617 |last2=Angioni |last3=Murru |last4=Carta |last5=Melis |last6=Bauman |last7=Dong |last8=Ip }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may be a single unit comprising a battery, coil and filling saturated with e-juice in a single tube to be used and discarded after the battery or e-liquid is depleted.&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt; They may also be a reusable device with a battery and cartridge called a cartomizer.&lt;ref name=McRobbie2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsct.co.uk/usr/pub/e-cigarette_briefing.pdf|title=Electronic cigarettes|author=Hayden McRobbie|pages=1–16|publisher=National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartomizer cartridge can be separated from the battery so the battery can be charged and the empty cartomizer replaced when the e-juice runs out.&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt;

The battery section may contain an electronic airflow sensor triggered by drawing breath through the device.&lt;ref name=McRobbie2014/&gt; Other models use a power button that must be held during operation.&lt;ref name=McRobbie2014/&gt; An LED in the power button or on the end of the device may also show when the device is vaporizing.&lt;ref name=EcigGuide2012&gt;{{cite news|title=The skyrocketing popularity of e-cigarettes: A guide|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/232221/the-skyrocketing-popularity-of-e-cigarettes-a-guide|accessdate=21 November 2014|publisher=The Week|date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some batteries have a "passthrough" feature so they can be used even while they are charging.&lt;ref name=SpinfuelGlossaryP2/&gt;&lt;ref name=FarsalinosPolosa2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farsalinos|first1=K.

Second-generation e-cigarettes commonly use a tank or a "clearomizer".&lt;ref name=McRobbie2014/&gt; Clearomizer tanks are meant to be refilled with e-juice, while cartomizers are not.&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt; Because they're refillable and the battery is rechargeable, their cost of operation is lower.&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt; Hovever, they can also use cartomizers, which are pre-filled only.&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt;

Some cheaper battery sections use a microphone that detects the turbulence of the air passing through to activate the device when the user inhales. Other batteries like the eGo style can use an [[integrated circuit]], as well as a button for manual activation. The LED shows [[battery (electricity)|battery]] status. The power button can also switch off the battery so it is not activated accidentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyetech eCom|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2430142,00.asp|website=PCMag|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second generation e-cigarettes may have lower voltages, around 3.7 V.&lt;ref name=Alexander2015/&gt; However, adjustable-voltage devices can be set between 3&amp;nbsp;V and 6&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name=McBride2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Vaping Basics – VAPE GEAR|url=http://spinfuel.com/guide-to-vaping/|accessdate=28 September 2015|publisher=Spinfuel eMagazine|author=Tom McBride|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atomizer and tank ==
[[File:Smok Baby Alien vape Atomizer and tank.jpg|thumb|An e-cigarette atomizer with the coil ([[heating element]]) in view.]]
An atomizer comprises a small [[heating element]] that vaporizes e-liquid and a [[wicking]] material that draws liquid onto the coil.&lt;ref name=SpinfuelGlossaryP1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spinfuel.com/vapers-glossary/|title=Vaper Talk – The Vaper's Glossary |publisher=Spinfuel eMagazine|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a battery and e-liquid the atomizer is the main component of every personal vaporizer.&lt;ref name=McRobbie2014/&gt; A small length of [[resistance wire]] is coiled around the wicking material and connected to the integrated circuit, or in the case of mechanical devices, the atomizer is connected directly to the battery through either a 510, 808, or ego threaded connector.&lt;ref name=Castle2014&gt;{{cite news|title=E Cigarettes And Clearomizers|url=http://spinfuel.com/e-cigarettes-clearomizers/|accessdate=21 September 2015|publisher=Spinfuel eMagazine|author=John Castle|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 510 being the most common.&lt;ref name=Castle2014/&gt; When activated, the resistance wire coil heats up and vaporizes the liquid, which is then inhaled by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|country=EP|number=2614731|status=application|pubdate=17 July 2013|fdate=12 January 2012|inventor=Yonghai Li, Zhongli Xu|title=An atomizer for electronic cigarette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electrical resistance]] of the coil, the [[voltage]] output of the device, the [[airflow]] of the atomizer and the efficiency of the wick all affect the vapor coming from the atomizer.&lt;ref name=Martin2015&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joseph C.

Atomizer coils made of kanthal usually have  resistances that vary from 0.2Ω ([[ohm]]s) to 2.8Ω.&lt;ref name=Martin2015/&gt; Coils of lower ohms have increased vapor production but could risk fire and dangerous [[Battery (electricity)#Hazards|battery failures]] if the user is not knowledgeable enough about [[ohms law|electrical principles]] and how they relate to battery safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardingenergy.com/pdfs/5%20Lithium%20Ion.pdf |title=Harding Battery Handbook For |publisher=Harding Energy, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227093854/http://hardingenergy.com/pdfs/5%20Lithium%20Ion.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartomizers===
[[File:Carto-45mm.jpg|thumb|A 45mm length, extra-long cartomizer.]]

Cartomizers can be used on their own or in conjunction with a tank that allows more e-liquid capacity.&lt;ref name=SpinfuelGlossaryP1/&gt; The portmanteau word "cartotank" has been coined for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lgaurejen|date=17 February 2015 |url=https://lgaurejen.wordpress.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used in a tank, the cartomizer is inserted in a plastic, glass or metal tube and holes or slots have to be punched on the sides of the cartomizer so liquid can reach the coil.&lt;ref name=SpinfuelGlossaryP1/&gt;

===Clearomizers===

[[File:RDA Deck.JPG|thumb|161px|A view of the RDA deck showing the wicks and coils, juice is dripped into a hopper where the wicks rest as well as atop the coil assembly.]]
A rebuildable atomizer or an RBA is an atomizer that allows the user to assemble or "build" the wick and coil themselves instead of replacing them with [[wikt:off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] atomizer "heads".&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt; They are generally considered advanced devices.&lt;ref name=Wagner2013&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rebuildable Atomizer – An Introduction And Overview|url=http://spinfuel.com/the-rebuildable-atomizer-an-introduction-and-overview/|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=Spinfuel Magazine|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also allow the user to build atomizers at any desired electrical resistance.&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt;

These atomizers are divided into two main categories; rebuildable tank atomizers (RTAs) and rebuildable dripping atomizers (RDAs).&lt;ref name=3StepsRebuild&gt;{{cite web|title=3 steps to rebuilding atomizers|url=http://vapenewsmagazine.com/november-2013/3-steps-to-rebuilding-atomizers|website=Vapenews Magazine|publisher=Vapenews Magazine|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebuildable dripping atomizers (RDAs) are atomizers where the e-juice is dripped directly onto the coil and wick.&lt;ref name=Little2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Guide To Dripping e Liquid|url=http://spinfuel.com/guide-to-dripping/|author=Jason Little|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common nicotine strength of e-liquids used in RDA's is 3&amp;nbsp;mg and 6&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name=Little2015/&gt; Liquids used in RDA's tend to have more vegetable glycerin.&lt;ref name=Little2015/&gt; They typically consist only of an atomizer "building deck", commonly with three posts with holes drilled in them, which can accept one or more coils.&lt;ref name=Larson2014/&gt; The user needs to manually keep the atomizer wet by dripping liquid on the bare wick and coil assembly, hence their name.&lt;ref name=Little2015/&gt;

[[Kanthal (alloy)|Kanthal]] wire can be used in an RDA, RTA or RTDA, or the builder may opt for stainless steel, nickel, titanium, nichrome and other custom combination wires.&lt;ref name=Little2015/&gt;{{FV|date=May 2018}} Wattage and Bypass modes allow for any type of wire, not every type of wire can be used when the mod is set to temperature control.&lt;ref name=Little2015/&gt;{{FV|date=May 2018}}

=== Mechanical devices ===
{{anchor|Mechanical devices}}
Mechanical PVs or mechanical "mods", often called "mechs", are devices without integrated circuits, electronic battery protection, or voltage regulation.&lt;ref name=Benson2015/&gt; They are activated by a switch.&lt;ref name=Little2015/&gt; They rely on the natural voltage output of the battery and the metal that the mod is made of often is used as part of the circuit itself.&lt;ref name=Amann2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onvaping.com/battery-safety-and-ohms-law/|title=Battery Safety and Ohm's Law|publisher=onVaping|author=Dale Amann|date=10 February 2014|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mod" was originally used instead of "modification".&lt;ref name=Farsalinos2014/&gt; Users would modify existing hardware to get better performance, and as an alternative to the e-cigarettes that looked like traditional cigarettes.&lt;ref name=Couts2013/&gt; Users would also [[modding|modify]] other unrelated items like flashlights as battery compartments to power atomizers.&lt;ref name=Couts2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grothaus2014/&gt; The word mod is often used to describe most personal vaporizers.&lt;ref name=SpinfuelGlossaryP1/&gt;

Mechanical PVs have no power regulation and are unprotected.&lt;ref name=Little2015/&gt; Because of this ensuring that the battery does not over-discharge and that the resistance of the atomizer requires [[electric current]] within the safety limits of the battery is the responsibility of the user.&lt;ref name=Amann2014/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Cumulative incidence''' or '''incidence proportion''' is a measure of frequency, as in [[epidemiology]], where it is a measure of disease frequency during a period of time. Where the period of time considered is an entire lifetime, the incidence proportion is called '''lifetime risk'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |date=July 2004|volume=58|issue=7|pages=538–45 |title=A glossary for evidence based public health |vauthors=Rychetnik L, Hawe P, Waters E, Barratt A, Frommer M |pmid=15194712 |pmc=1732833 |doi=10.1136/jech.2003.011585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumulative incidence is defined as the probability that a particular event, such as occurrence of a particular disease, has occurred before a given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dodge |first=Y. |year=2003 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms |location= |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-920613-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is equivalent to the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], calculated using a period of time during which all of the individuals in the population are considered to be at risk for the outcome. It is sometimes also referred to as the incidence proportion.

Cumulative incidence is calculated by the number of new cases during a period divided by the number of subjects at risk in the population at the beginning of the study.

It may also be calculated by the [[incidence rate]] multiplied by duration:&lt;ref name="Bouyer2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bouyer | first1 = Jean  | last2 = Hémon | first2 = Denis | last3 = Cordier | first3 = Sylvaine | last4 = Derriennic | first4 = Francis | last5 = Stücker | first5 = Isabelle | last6 = Stengel | first6 = Bénédicte | last7 = Clavel | first7 = Jacqueline | title = Épidemiologie principes et méthodes quantitatives | publisher = Lavoisier | location = Paris | year =2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the fertilized [[ovum]] reaches the [[uterus]], the [[mucous membrane]] of the body of the uterus undergoes important changes and is then known as the [[decidua]]. The thickness and vascularity of the mucous membrane are greatly increased; its glands are elongated and open on its free surface by funnel-shaped [[orifices]], while their deeper portions are tortuous and dilated into irregular spaces. The interglandular tissue is also increased in quantity, and is crowded with large round, oval, or polygonal cells, termed '''decidual cells'''.  Their enlargement is due to glycogen and lipid accumulation in the cytoplasm allowing these cells to provide a rich source of nutrition for the developing embryo.

Experimentally, human endometrial stromal cells can be decidualized in culture by using analogs of [[Cyclic AMP|cAMP]] and [[progesterone]]. The cells will exhibit a decidualized phenotype and display upregulation of common [[decidualization]] markers such as [[prolactin]] and [[IGFBP1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gellersen|first=Birgit|last2=Brosens|first2=Ivo|last3=Brosens|first3=Jan|date=2007-11-01|title=Decidualization of the Human Endometrium: Mechanisms, Functions, and Clinical Perspectives|url=http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2007-991042|journal=Seminars in Reproductive Medicine|language=en|volume=25|issue=6|pages=445–453|doi=10.1055/s-2007-991042|issn=1526-8004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59546">An '''epigenetic clock''' is a type of a [[Biomarkers of aging|molecular age estimation method]] based on [[DNA methylation]] levels. Pre-eminent examples for epigenetic clocks are '''[[Steve Horvath|Horvath]]'s clock''',&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; which applies to all human tissues/cells, and '''Hannum's clock''',&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which applies to blood.

==History==
The strong effects of age on DNA methylation levels have been known since the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Berdyshev1967"/&gt; A vast literature describes sets of [[CpG site|CpGs]] whose DNA methylation levels correlate with age, e.g.&lt;ref name="Rakyan2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teschendorff2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell2012"/&gt; The first robust demonstration that DNA methylation levels in saliva could generate accurate age predictors was published by a [[UCLA]] team including [[Steve Horvath]] in 2011 (Bocklandt et al 2011).&lt;ref name="Bocklandt2011" /&gt; The labs of Trey Ideker and Kang Zhang at the [[University of California, San Diego]] published the Hannum epigenetic clock (Hannum 2013),&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which consisted of 71 markers that accurately estimate age based on blood methylation levels. 
The first multi-tissue epigenetic clock, Horvath's epigenetic clock, was developed by [[Steve Horvath]], a professor of [[human genetics]]  and of [[biostatistics]] at [[UCLA]] (Horvath 2013).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt; Horvath spent over 4 years collecting publicly available Illumina DNA methylation data and identifying suitable statistical methods.&lt;ref name="Biome2013"/&gt; The personal story behind the discovery was featured in Nature.&lt;ref name="Gibbs2014"/&gt; The age estimator was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. The major innovation of Horvath's epigenetic clock lies in its wide applicability: the same set of 353 CpGs and the same prediction algorithm is used irrespective of the DNA source within the organism, i.e. it does not require any adjustments or offsets.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; This property allows one to compare the ages of different areas of the human body using the same aging clock.

==Relationship to a cause of biological aging==
It is not yet known what exactly is measured by DNA methylation age. Horvath hypothesized that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system but details are unknown. The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christiansen2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"/&gt; strongly suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=DNA methylation-based measures of biological age: meta-analysis predicting time to death|url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/101020|journal=Aging|volume=8|pages=1844–1865|doi=10.18632/aging.101020|pmc=5076441|pmid=27690265|via=|doi-access=Free|vauthors=Chen B, Marioni R, Colicino E, Peters M, Ward-Caviness C, Tsai P, Roetker N, Just A, Demerath E, Guan W|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unlikely that the 353 clock CpGs are special or play a direct causal role in the aging process.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Rather, the epigenetic clock captures an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of the epigenome.

===Epigenetic clock theory of aging===
Horvath and Raj &lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"/&gt; proposed an epigenetic clock theory of aging with the following tenets:
* Biological aging results as an unintended consequence of both developmental programs and maintenance program, the molecular footprints of which give rise to DNA methylation age estimators. 
* The precise mechanisms linking the innate molecular processes (underlying DNAm age) to the decline in tissue function probably relate to both intracellular changes (leading to a loss of cellular identity) and subtle changes in cell composition, for example, fully functioning somatic stem cells. 
* At the molecular level, DNAm age is a proximal readout of a collection of innate aging processes that conspire with other, independent root causes of ageing to the detriment of tissue function.

==Motivation for biological clocks==
In general, biological aging clocks and [[biomarkers of aging]]  are expected to find many uses in biological research since age is a fundamental characteristic of most [[organisms]]. Accurate measures of biological age ('''biological aging clocks''') could be useful for
* testing the validity of various [[theories of biological aging]],
* diagnosing various age related [[disease]]s and for defining [[cancer]] subtypes,
* predicting/prognosticating  the onset of various diseases,
* serving as [[surrogate marker]]s for evaluating therapeutic interventions including  [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]  approaches,
* studying [[developmental biology]] and [[cell differentiation]],
* [[forensic]] applications, for example to estimate the age of a suspect based on blood left on a crime scene.
Overall, biological clocks are expected to be useful for studying what causes aging and what can be done against it.

==Properties of Horvath's clock==
The clock is defined as an age estimation method based on 353 [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] markers on the DNA. The 353 markers measure [[DNA methylation]] of [[CpG dinucleotide]]s. Estimated age ("predicted age" in mathematical usage), also referred to as DNA methylation age, has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s; second, it correlates with cell [[Subculture (biology)#Passage number|passage number]]; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues (which are used as human analogs for biological testing purposes). Organismal growth (and concomitant cell division) leads to a high ticking rate of the epigenetic clock that slows down to a constant ticking rate (linear dependence) after adulthood (age 20).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;
The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life even after adjusting for known risk factors &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt; suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging. Similarly, markers of physical and mental fitness are associated with the epigenetic clock (lower abilities associated with age acceleration).&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt;

Salient features of Horvath's epigenetic clock include its high accuracy and its applicability to a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types. Since it allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same subject, it can be used to identify tissues that show evidence of accelerated age due to disease.

===Statistical approach===
The basic approach is to form a weighted average of the 353 clock CpGs, which is then transformed to DNAm age using a calibration function. The calibration function reveals that the epigenetic clock has a high ticking rate until adulthood, after which it slows to a constant ticking rate. Using the training data sets, Horvath used a penalized regression model ([[Elastic net regularization]]) to regress a calibrated version of chronological age on 21,369 CpG probes that were present both on the Illumina 450K and 27K platform and had fewer than 10 missing values. DNAm age is defined as estimated ("predicted") age. The elastic net predictor automatically selected 353 CpGs. 193 of the 353 CpGs correlate positively with age while the remaining 160 CpGs correlate negatively with age. R software and a freely available web-based tool can be found  at the following webpage.&lt;ref name="DNAmAgeSoftware"/&gt;

===Accuracy===
The median error of estimated age is 3.6 years across a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types
.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;  The epigenetic clock performs well in heterogeneous tissues (for example, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cerebellar samples, occipital cortex, buccal epithelium, colon, adipose, kidney, liver, lung, saliva, uterine cervix, epidermis, muscle) as well as in individual cell types such as CD4 T cells, CD14 monocytes, glial cells, neurons, immortalized B cells, mesenchymal stromal cells.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; However, accuracy depends to some extent on the source of the DNA.

=== Comparison with other biological clocks ===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
The epigenetic clock leads to a chronological age prediction that has a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] of r=0.96 with chronological age (Figure 2 in &lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;). Thus the age correlation is close to its maximum possible correlation value of 1.  Other biological clocks are based on a) [[telomere]] length, b) [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels (also known as INK4a/ARF locus),&lt;ref name="Collado2007"/&gt; and c) [[microsatellite]] mutations.&lt;ref name="Forster2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Forster | first1 = P | last2 = Hohoff | first2 = C | last3 = Dunkelmann | first3 = B | last4 = Schürenkamp | first4 = M | last5 = Pfeiffer | first5 = H | last6 = Neuhuber | first6 = F | last7 = Brinkmann | first7 = B | year = 2015 | title = Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1803/20142898.long | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 282 | issue = | page = 20142898 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 | pmid=25694621 | pmc=4345458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between chronological age and [[telomere]] length is r=−0.51 in women and r=−0.55 in men.&lt;ref name="Nordfjall2010"/&gt; The correlation between chronological age and expression levels of [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] in T cells is r=0.56.&lt;ref name="Wang2012"/&gt; {{citation needed span|text=[[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels only relate to age in [[T cell]]s, a type of white blood cells.|date=December 2016}} {{citation needed span|text=The microsatellite clock measures not chronological age but age in terms of elapsed cell divisions within a tissue.|date=December 2016}}

==Applications of Horvath's clock==
By contrasting DNA methylation age (estimated age) with chronological age, one can define measures of age acceleration. Age acceleration can be defined as the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age. Alternatively, it can be defined as the residual that results from regressing DNAm age on chronological age. The latter measure is attractive because it does not correlate with chronological age.
A positive/negative value of epigenetic age acceleration suggests that the underlying tissue ages faster/slower than expected.

===Genetic studies of epigenetic age acceleration===
The broad sense heritability (defined via [[Falconer's formula]]) of age acceleration of blood from older subjects is around 40% but it appears to be much higher in newborns.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
Similarly, the age acceleration of brain tissue (prefrontal cortex) was found to be 41% in older subjects.&lt;ref name="Levine2015"/&gt;
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of epigenetic age acceleration in postmortem brain samples have identified
several [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] at a genomewide significance level.&lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lu2017"/&gt;
GWAS of age acceleration in blood have identified several genome-wide significant genetic loci including the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ([[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]]) locus
.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"&gt;Lu AT., &amp; Xue L., &amp; Chen BH., et al., Horvath S. (2018). [
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/29374233/
GWAS of epigenetic aging rates in blood reveals a critical role for TERT]. Nat Comm{{ doi|10.1038/s41467-017-02697-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic variants associated with longer leukocyte telomere length in TERT gene paradoxically confer higher epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"/&gt;

===Lifestyle factors===
In general, lifestyle factors have only weak effects on epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"&gt;Quach A., &amp; Levine ME., &amp; Tanaka T.,…., &amp; Horvath S. (2018). [
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5361673/
Epigenetic clock analysis of diet, exercise, education, and lifestyle factors.]. Aging (Albany NY){{ doi|
10.18632/aging.101168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, cross sectional studies of extrinsic epigenetic aging rates in blood confirm the conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of education, eating a high plant diet with lean meats, moderate alcohol consumption, physical activity and the risks associated with [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic syndrome]].

===Obesity and metabolic syndrome===
The epigenetic clock was used to study the relationship between high [[body mass index]] (BMI) and the DNA methylation ages of human blood, liver, muscle and adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2014obesity"/&gt; A significant correlation (r=0.42) between BMI and epigenetic age acceleration could be observed for the liver. A much larger sample size (n=4200 blood samples) revealed a weak but statistically significant correlation (r=0.09) between BMI and intrinsic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; The same large study found that various biomarkers of [[metabolic syndrome]] (glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein, [[Waist–hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratio]]) were associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; Conversely, high levels of the good cholesterol [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] were associated with a lower epigenetic aging rate of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt;

===Female breast tissue is older than expected===
DNAm age is higher than chronological age in female breast tissue that is adjacent to breast cancer tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Since normal tissue which is adjacent to other cancer types does not exhibit a similar age acceleration effect, this finding suggests that normal female breast tissue ages faster than other parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Similarly, normal breast tissue samples from women without cancer have been found to be substantially older than blood samples collected from the same women at the same time {{PMID|28364215}}.

===Cancer tissue===
Cancer tissues show both positive and negative age acceleration effects. For most tumor types, no significant relationship can be observed between age acceleration and tumor morphology (grade/stage).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt; On average, cancer tissues with mutated [[P53|TP53]] have a lower age acceleration than those without it.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Further, cancer tissues  with high age acceleration tend to have fewer somatic mutations than those with low age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;
Age acceleration is highly related to various genomic aberrations in cancer tissues. Somatic mutations in [[estrogen receptor]]s or [[progesterone receptor]]s are associated with accelerated DNAm age in breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Colorectal cancer samples with a [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] (V600E) mutation or promoter hypermethylation of the mismatch repair gene [[MLH1]] are associated with an increased age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Age acceleration in [[glioblastoma multiforme]] samples is highly significantly associated with certain mutations in [[H3F3A]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
One study suggests that the epigenetic age of blood tissue may be prognostic of lung cancer incidence.&lt;ref name="Levine2015lungcancer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = M  | date = 2015 | title = DNA methylation age of blood predicts future onset of lung cancer in the women's health initiative.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n9/full/100809.html | journal = Aging | volume = 7| issue = | pages =690–700| pmid= 26411804 | pmc=4600626 | doi=10.18632/aging.100809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)===
[[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome (DS)]] entails an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age. The clinical manifestations of accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues, but molecular evidence for this hypothesis has been sparse. According to the epigenetic clock, trisomy 21 significantly increases the age of blood and brain tissue (on average by 6.6 years).&lt;ref name="Horvath2015DownSyndrome"/&gt;

===Alzheimer's disease related neuropathology===
Epigenetic age acceleration of the human prefrontal cortex was found to be correlated with several neuropathological measurements that play a role in Alzheimer's disease &lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;  Further, it was found to be associated with a decline in global cognitive functioning, and memory functioning among individuals with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;
The epigenetic age of '''blood''' relates to cognitive functioning in the elderly.&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt; Overall, these results strongly suggest that the epigenetic clock lends itself for measuring the biological age of the brain.

===Cerebellum ages slowly===
It has been difficult to identify tissues that seem to evade aging due to the lack of biomarkers of tissue age that allow one to contrast compare the ages of different tissues. An application of epigenetic clock to 30 anatomic sites from six centenarians and younger subjects revealed that the [[cerebellum]] ages slowly: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; This finding might explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions. In younger subjects (e.g. younger than 70), brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; Several SNPs and genes have been identified that relate to the epigenetic age of the cerebellum &lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;

===Huntington's disease===
[[Huntington's disease]] has been found to increase the epigenetic aging rates of several human brain regions.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016HD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2016 | title = Huntington's disease accelerates epigenetic aging of human brain and disrupts DNA methylation levels

===Centenarians age slowly===
The offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in blood) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2015 | title = Decreased epigenetic age of PBMCs from Italian semi-supercentenarians and their offspring.| url =

===HIV infection===
Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ([[HIV]]) is associated with clinical symptoms of accelerated aging, as evidenced by increased incidence and diversity of age-related illnesses at relatively young ages. But it has been difficult to detect an accelerated aging effect on a molecular level. An epigenetic clock analysis of human DNA from HIV+ subjects and controls detected a significant age acceleration effect in brain (7.4 years) and blood (5.2 years) tissue due to HIV-1 infection.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015HIV"/&gt; These results are consistent with an independent study that also found an age advancement of 5 years in blood of HIV patients and a strong effect of the HLA locus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Andrew M.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Philipp A.|last3=Kreisberg|first3=Jason F.|last4=Licon|first4=Katherine|last5=Jepsen|first5=Kristen L.|last6=Khosroheidari|first6=Mahdieh|last7=Morsey|first7=Brenda M.|last8=Swindells|first8=Susan|last9=Shen|first9=Hui|date= 2016-04-21|title=Methylome-wide Analysis of Chronic HIV Infection Reveals Five-Year Increase in Biological Age and Epigenetic Targeting of HLA|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.03.019|issn=1097-4164|pmc=4995115|pmid=27105112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkinson's disease===
A large-scale study suggests that the blood of Parkinson's disease subjects exhibits (relatively weak) accelerated aging effects.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2015 | title = Increased epigenetic age and granulocyte counts in the blood of Parkinson's disease patients.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n12/full/100859.html| journal = Aging | volume=7| issue =| pages =  1130–42| doi = 10.18632/aging.100859| pmid= 26655927 | pmc=4712337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental disorder: syndrome X===
Children with a very rare disorder known as [[Brooke Greenberg|syndrome X]] maintain the façade of persistent toddler-like features while aging from birth to adulthood. Since the physical development of these children is dramatically delayed, these children appear to be a toddler or at best a preschooler. According to an epigenetic clock analysis, blood tissue from syndrome X cases is not younger than expected.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015syndromeX"/&gt;

===Menopause accelerates epigenetic aging===
The following results strongly suggest that the loss of female hormones resulting from menopause accelerates the epigenetic aging rate of blood and possibly that of other tissues.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; First, early [[menopause]] has been found to be associated with an increased epigenetic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Second, surgical menopause (due to bilateral
[[oophorectomy]]) is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood and saliva. Third, [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone therapy]], which mitigates hormonal loss, is associated with a negative age acceleration of buccal cells (but not of blood cells).&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Fourth, genetic markers that are associated with early menopause are also associated with increased epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt;

===Cellular senescence versus epigenetic aging===
A confounding aspect of biological aging is the nature and role of senescent cells. It is unclear whether the three major types of cellular senescence, namely replicative senescence, oncogene-induced senescence and DNA damage-induced senescence are descriptions of the same phenomenon instigated by different sources, or if each of these is distinct, and how they are associated with epigenetic aging.
Induction of replicative senescence (RS) and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) were found to be accompanied by epigenetic aging of primary cells but senescence induced by DNA damage was not, even though RS and OIS activate the cellular DNA damage response pathway.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowe | first1 =D | year = 2016 | title = Epigenetic clock analyses of cellular senescence and ageing. | url =

Consistent with this, telomerase-immortalised cells continued to age (according to the epigenetic clock) without having been treated with any senescence inducers or DNA-damaging agents, re-affirming the independence of the process of epigenetic ageing from telomeres, cellular senescence, and the DNA damage response pathway.
Although the uncoupling of senescence from cellular aging appears at first sight to be inconsistent with the fact that senescent cells contribute to the physical manifestation of organism ageing, as demonstrated by Baker et al., where removal of senescent cells slowed down aging.&lt;ref name="Baker2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 =DJ | year = 2011 | title = Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders. | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/full/nature10600.html
| journal = Nature | volume=479| issue =7372| pages = 232–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature10600| pmid= 22048312  | pmc=3468323}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the epigenetic clock analysis of senescence suggests that cellular senescence is a state that cells are forced into as a result of external pressures such as DNA damage, ectopic oncogene expression and exhaustive proliferation of cells to replenish those eliminated by external/environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt; These senescent cells, in sufficient numbers, will probably cause the deterioration of tissues, which is interpreted as organism ageing. However, at the cellular level, aging, as measured by the epigenetic clock, is distinct from senescence. It is an intrinsic mechanism that exists from the birth of the cell and continues. This implies that if cells are not shunted into senescence by the external pressures described above, they would still continue to age. This is consistent with the fact that mice with naturally long telomeres still age and eventually die even though their telomere lengths are far longer than the critical limit, and they age prematurely when their telomeres are forcibly shortened, due to replicative senescence. Therefore, cellular senescence is a route by which cells exit prematurely from the natural course of cellular aging.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt;

===Effect of sex and race/ethnicity===
Men age faster than women according to epigenetic age acceleration in blood, brain, saliva, and many other tissues.
&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = An epigenetic clock analysis of race/ethnicity, sex, and coronary heart disease.| journal = [[Genome Biol]]| volume =17  | issue = 1| year = 2016| pmid = 27511193  |pmc= 4980791|vauthors= Horvath S, Gurven M, Levine ME, Trumble BC, Kaplan H, Allayee H, Ritz BR, Chen B, Lu AT, Rickabaugh TM, Jamieson BD, Sun D, Li S, Chen W, Quintana-Murci L, Fagny M, Kobor MS, Tsao PS, Reiner AP, Edlefsen KL, Absher D, Assimes TL | doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1030-0| pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The epignetic clock method applies to all examined racial/ethnic groups in the sense that DNAm age is highly correlated with chronological age. But ethnicity can be associated with epigenetic age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt; For example, the blood of Hispanics and the [[Tsimané people|Tsimané]] ages more slowly than that of other populations which might explain the [[Hispanic paradox|Hispanic mortality paradox]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt;

===Rejuvenation effect due to stem cell transplantation in blood===
[[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], which transplants these cells from a young donor to an older recipient, rejuvenates the epigenetic age of blood to that of the donor {{PMID| 28550187}}. However, [[graft-versus-host disease]] is associated with increased DNA methyhlation age {{PMID| 28550187}}.

===Progeria===
Adult progeria also known as [[Werner syndrome]] is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Maierhofer2017Werner"/&gt;
Fibroblast samples from childen with Hutchinson-Gilford [[Progeria]] exhibit accelerated epigenetic aging effects according to the "skin &amp; blood" epigenetic clock but not according to the original pan tissue clock from Horvath.
&lt;ref name="Horvath2018HGP"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Epigenetic clock for skin and blood cells applied to Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome and ''ex vivo'' studies |journal=[[Aging (Albany NY)]] |volume=10 |issue=7 |year=2018 |pmid=30048243  |pmc=6075434|vauthors= Horvath S, Oshima J, Martin GM, Lu AT, Quach A, Cohen H, Felton S, Matsuyama M, Lowe D, Kabacik S, Wilson JG, Reiner AP, Maierhofer A, Flunkert J, Aviv A, Hou L, Baccarelli AA, Li Y, Stewart JD, Whitsel EA, Ferrucci L, Matsuyama S, Raj K |doi=10.18632/aging.101508 |doi-access=free |pages=1758–1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock==
Despite the fact that biomarkers of ageing based on DNA methylation data have enabled accurate age estimates for any tissue across the entire life course, the precise biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"&gt;Horvath, S., &amp; Raj, K. (2018). [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0004-3  DNA methylation-based biomarkers and the epigenetic clock theory of ageing]. Nature Reviews Genetics, {{doi|10.1038/s41576-018-0004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, epigenetic biomarkers may help to address long-standing questions in many fields, including the central question: why do we age?  The following explanations have been proposed in the literature.

===Possible explanation 1: Epigenomic maintenance system===
Horvath hypothesized that his clock arises from a methylation footprint left by an epigenomic maintenance system.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;

===Possible explanation 2: Unrepaired DNA damages===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Endogenous DNA damages occur frequently including about 50 double-strand DNA breaks per cell cycle&lt;ref name="pmid14566050"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vilenchik MM, Knudson AG |title=Endogenous DNA double-strand breaks: production, fidelity of repair, and induction of cancer |journal=Proc.

During repair of double-strand breaks many epigenetic alterations are introduced, and in a percentage of cases epigenetic alterations remain after repair is completed, including increased methylation of CpG island promoters.&lt;ref name="pmid17616978"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuozzo C, Porcellini A, Angrisano T, Morano A, Lee B, Di Pardo A, Messina S, Iuliano R, Fusco A, Santillo MR, Muller MT, Chiariotti L, Gottesman ME, Avvedimento EV |title=DNA damage, homology-directed repair, and DNA methylation |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e110 |year=2007 |pmid=17616978 |pmc=1913100 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030110 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18704159"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Hagan HM, Mohammad HP, Baylin SB |title=Double strand breaks can initiate gene silencing and SIRT1-dependent onset of DNA methylation in an exogenous promoter CpG island |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e1000155 |year=2008 |pmid=18704159 |pmc=2491723 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24137009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morano A, Angrisano T, Russo G, Landi R, Pezone A, Bartollino S, Zuchegna C, Babbio F, Bonapace IM, Allen B, Muller MT, Chiariotti L, Gottesman ME, Porcellini A, Avvedimento EV |title=Targeted DNA methylation by homology-directed repair in mammalian cells.

Accumulation of epigenetic alterations may parallel the accumulation of un-repaired DNA damages that are proposed to cause aging (see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]).

==Other age estimators based on DNA methylation levels==
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Several other age estimators have been described in the literature.

1) Weidner et al. (2014) describe an age estimator for DNA from blood that uses only three CpG sites of genes hardly affected by aging (cg25809905 in integrin, alpha 2b (ITGA2B); cg02228185 in aspartoacylase (ASPA) and cg17861230 in phosphodiesterase 4C, cAMP specific (PDE4C)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weidner | first1 = C. I. | last2 = Lin | first2 = Q. | last3 = Koch | first3 = C. M. | last4 = Eisele | first4 = L. | last5 = Beier | first5 = F. | last6 = Ziegler | first6 = P. | last7 = Wagner | first7 = W. | year = 2014 | title = Aging of blood can be tracked by DNA methylation changes at just three CpG sites | url = http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/2/R24 | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 2| page = R24 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r24 | pmid=24490752 | pmc=4053864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The age estimator by Weidener et al. (2014) applies only to blood. Even in blood this sparse estimator is far less accurate than Horvath's epigenetic clock (Horvath 2014) when applied to data generated by the Illumina 27K or 450K platforms.

&lt;/ref&gt; But the sparse estimator was developed for pyrosequencing data and is highly cost effective.

&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Hannum et al. (2013) &lt;ref name="Hannum2013"/&gt; report several age estimators: one for each tissue type. Each of these estimators requires covariate information (e.g. gender, body mass index, batch). The authors mention that each tissue led to a clear linear offset (intercept and slope). Therefore, the authors had to adjust the blood-based age estimator for each tissue type using a linear model. When the Hannum estimator is applied to other tissues, it leads to a high error (due to poor calibration) as can be seen from Figure 4A in Hannum et al. (2013). Hannum et al. adjusted their blood-based age estimator (by adjusting the slope and the intercept term) in order to apply it to other tissue types. Since this adjustment step removes differences between tissue, the blood-based estimator from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different tissues/organs. In contrast, a salient characteristic of the epigenetic clock  is that one does not have to carry out such a calibration step:&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; it always uses the same CpGs and the same coefficient values. Therefore, Horvath's epigenetic clock can be used to compare the ages of different tissues/cells/organs from the same individual. While the age estimators from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different normal tissues, they can be used to compare the age of a cancerous tissue with that of a corresponding normal (non-cancerous) tissue. Hannum et al. reported pronounced age acceleration effects in all cancers. In contrast, Horvath's epigenetic clock &lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R115/comments Horvath S (2013-11-04 11:00) Erratum in cancer tissues  Reader Comment]
&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that some cancer types (e.g. triple negative breast cancers or uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma) exhibit negative age acceleration, i.e. cancer tissue can be much younger than expected.
An important difference relates to additional covariates. Hannum's age estimators make use of covariates such as gender, body mass index, diabetes status, ethnicity, and batch. Since new data involve different batches, one cannot apply it directly to new data. However, the authors present coefficient values for their CpGs in Supplementary Tables which can be used to define an aggregate measure that tends to be strongly correlated with chronological age but may be poorly calibrated (i.e. lead to high errors).

3.) Giuliani et al. identify genomic regions whose DNA methylation level correlates with age in human teeth.

In a multicenter benchmarking study 18 research groups from three continents compared all promising methods for analyzing DNA methylation in the clinic and identified the most accurate methods, having concluded that epigenetic tests based on DNA methylation are a mature technology ready for broad clinical use.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Bock et al.

'''Flogsta''' is a neighbourhood in the west part of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] city of [[Uppsala]]. Most of its inhabitants are students attending [[Uppsala University]] or the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]].
==Location==
The neighbourhood is located approximately 2.8 kilometres (about 4 km by road) west of the Uppsala city centre. There are bus connections and bicycle tracks connecting Flogsta to different parts of the town.&lt;ref name=housing/&gt; To the Uppsala University main building, the University Hospital, the [[Uppsala_University#Ekonomikum|Ekonomikum]] and the Biomedical Centre, the distance is between 2.2 and 2.7 km, while the distance to [[Swedish_University_of_Agricultural_Sciences|SLU]] exceeds 6 km.&lt;ref name=housing&gt;[http://housingoffice.se/accommodation/exchange-students-master-students/flogsta/ Flogsta], [[Uppsala University]] Housing Office&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The suburb was known as "Flogstoghum" in the Early Middle Ages and was a part of the Church parish of Uppsala. However it was generally thought to be uninhabited until the late 16th century, when it became part of a 'Kronopark' or "Crown Lands", a semi-forested area owned directly by the Government and used for Government purposes. Until the 1840s, Flogsta was a small village and was not included within the City Limits of Uppsala. Indeed, until 1869, the city boundary of Uppsala to the West ended at Villavägen-Rackarbergsgatan, a mile west of the Engelska Parken. The city boundary was extended to Krongatan in 1871, to Ekeby in 1892 and to Flogsta in 1908. Large scale habitation and concrete building started only in the 1890s as accommodation for workers in various industries in Central Uppsala, and until the 1910s there were no municipal services in Flogsta. In the 1920s the first suburban houses came up in Flogsta as residences of white collar workers who worked in the City but wished to live close to the countryside. In the 1950s much of the suburb was earmarked for the [[Million Programme]] as student housing, and hence the suburb got its present characteristic as a densely populated "concrete block" student suburb only by the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=scream&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/flogsta-scream/ | title = The Flogsta Scream | publisher = [[Uppsala University]] | language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Flogsta scream==
Every evening at approximately 22:00, the "Flogsta scream" (''[[Elvavrålet|Flogstavrålet]]'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) may be heard, when students individually or collectively let out screams and howls from windows, balconies and roof tops.&lt;ref name=local&gt;"[http://www.thelocal.se/20130113/45582 Swedish students' howls echo across the world]", ''[[The Local]]'' of Sweden, 13 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Uppsala University]], the collective screaming acts as "a much needed safety valve" and "a cry of angst" for students stressed by the demands of university life.&lt;ref name=scream&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/flogsta-scream/ | title = The Flogsta Scream | publisher = [[Uppsala University]] | language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon has spread to other university towns and campuses in Sweden, such as [[Lund]], [[Linköping]] and  the Lappkärrsberget student residence area in [[Stockholm]] among others.&lt;ref name=local/&gt;

[[Shambhala (music festival)|Shambhala]] (Music Festival) has actually adopted this and it became the "Shambhala wave".

the attendees used to yell "Shambhala" and people would keep the "wave" going from one side of the festival to the other but it's devolved into just a normal "Woooooo" over the years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18896">'''HIV/AIDS infection in the Philippines''' might be low but growing. The current incidence of HIV/AIDS in the country remains under 0.1% of the total population in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unaids.org.ph/index.php?mod=page&amp;type=view&amp;mid=21&amp;rid=0&amp;sid=0&amp;tid=0&amp;pid=6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippines]] has one of the lowest rates of infection, yet has one of the fastest growing number of cases worldwide.&lt;ref name=UNICEFPhil&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and AIDS|url=http://www.unicef.org/philippines/hivaids.html|website=UNICEF Philippines|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Philippines is one of seven countries with growth in number of cases of over 25%, from 2001 to 2009.&lt;ref name=UNICEFPhil /&gt;

The first case of HIV infection in the Philippines was reported in January 1984. &lt;ref name=CebuNewsDec2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mayol|first1=Ador Vincent S.|title=Church steps up education drive, reminds public not to shun patients|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/76543/central-visayas-is-top-4-in-reported-hiv-cases|accessdate=22 December 2015|agency=Cebu Daily News|date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
Officially{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}, the Philippines is a low-HIV-prevalence country, with less than 0.1 percent of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. As of April 2015, the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] (DOH) AIDS Registry in the Philippines reported 24,936 cumulative cases.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In April 2015, 560 new cases were reported showing a 42% increase compared to the same period in the previous year{{year missing|date=December 2015}}. In the year 2014, a total of 6,011 cases of HIV were reported with 91% of the cases being asymptomatic at the time of reporting while 543 cases were diagnosed as AIDS.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://portal.doh.gov.ph/sites/default/files/NEC_HIV_Apr-AIDSreg2015.pdf|title = Philippine HIV/AIDS Registry Fact Sheet - April 2015|accessdate = November 6, 2015|publisher = Department of Health|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015119/http://portal.doh.gov.ph/sites/default/files/NEC_HIV_Apr-AIDSreg2015.pdf|archivedate = November 17, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2001 to 2015 the number of cases diagnosed per year increased 37 times, from 174 cases diagnosed in 2001 to 6,552 for the first 10 months on 2015.&lt;ref name=StarDec2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crisostomo|first1=Sheila|title=DOH urges public to join fight vs HIV|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/12/02/1528124/doh-urges-public-join-fight-vs-hiv|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2010 to 2015, 91% (22,726) of cases were men with a median age of 28 years, with over half (12,616) in the 25-34 age group.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  26% (6,529) of men were 20–24 years of age, an increase from 12% in 2005-2009.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Since the year 2000, the high-prevalence age group has changed from the 30-39 year old age group being the most affected from years 2000-2004, to the 25-34 age group from years 2005 to 2009, and to 20-29 age group from years 2010-2015.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The infection rate among men having sex with men has multiplied 10 times from 2010 to 2015.&lt;ref name=InqNov2015 /&gt; The Department of Health reported in November 2015, that the rate of prevalence has surpassed 5%, the UN's definition of concentrated epidemic, in eight cities [[Cebu]], [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[Puerto Princesa]], [[Davao City|Davao]], [[Quezon City]], [[Parañaque]] and [[Makati]], with Cebu reaching 14%.&lt;ref name=InqNov2015 /&gt;

Between 1984 and 1990, 62% (133 of 216) of cases were female. From 2010 to 2015, females only comprised 5% (1017) of the 20,512 reported cases.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

From January 2010 to April 2015, 82% (20,512) of all cases were reported. At the time of reporting, 93% of these cases were still asymptomatic.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

As of April 2015, 9,838 people living with HIV were undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy in 23 treatment hubs.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Overseas Filipino workers]] account for about 20 percent of all cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/277687/pinoyabroad/news/philhealth-over-2-000-pinoy-workers-abroad-infected-with-hiv|title = Philhealth: Over 2,000 Pinoy workers abroad infected with HIV|date = 10 January 2013|access-date = 10 October 2012|newspaper = GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Means of transmission ===
Of the 24,936 HIV-positive cases reported from 1984 to 2015, 93% (23,291) were infected through sexual contact of which 79% (18,023) was through homosexual and bisexual contact while heterosexual contact comprised the remaining 14% (3,273). 5% (1,096) of cases was caused by needle sharing among injecting drug users, 0.3% (73) through mother-to-child transmission, &lt;0.1% (20) through blood transfusion and needle prick injury &lt;0.1% (3). No data is available for 1.7% (375) of the cases.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Cumulative data shows 24% (5,268) were infected through heterosexual contact, 47% (11,023) through homosexual contact, and 30% (7,000) through bisexual contact. From 2007 there has been a shift in the predominant trend of sexual transmission from heterosexual contact (20%) to males having sex with other males (80%)&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

=== Geographical Distribution ===
From 1984 to 2015, the region with the most number of reported cases were [[Metro Manila]] with 11,081 (44%), Region 4A with 3,230 (13%) cases, [[Central Visayas]] with 2,260 (9%) cases, Region 3 with 2,025 (8%) cases and Region 11 with 1,460 (6%) cases. 3,734 (15%) of cases were distributed around the rest of the country while 1,146 (5%) had no data on the region.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

==At-risk groups==
Most-at-risk groups include [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), with 395 new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [[infections]] among within this group from January to February 2013 alone, 96% up from 2005’s 210 reported infections. A spokesperson of the National Epidemiology Center (NEC) of the Department of Health says that the sudden and steep increase in the number of new cases within the MSM community, particularly in the last three years (309 cases in 2006, and 342 in 2013), is "tremendously in excess of what (is) usually expected," allowing classification of the situation as an "[[epidemic]]". Of the cumulative total of 1,097 infected MSMs from 1984 to 2008, 49% were reported in the last three years (72% asymptomatic); 108 have died when reported, and slightly more MSMs were reportedly already with AIDS (30%).&lt;ref name="outrage"&gt;"It's Official: HIV and AIDS Now an Epidemic Among Pinoy MSMs," dela Cruz, Mikee, Outragemag.com, 9 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Among MSM's, ninety percent of the newly infected are single (up to 35% of past cases reported involved overseas Filipino workers or [[Overseas Filipino|OFW]]s and/or their spouse), with the most of the affected people now only 20 to 34 years old (from 45 to 49 years old in the past). The highest number of infections among MSMs is from [[Metro Manila]]. An HIV surveillance study conducted by Dr. [[Louie Mar Gangcuangco]] and colleagues from the [[University of the Philippines]]-[[Philippine General Hospital]] showed that out of 406 MSM tested for HIV from entertainment areas in Metro Manila, HIV prevalence using the rapid test was 11.8% (95% confidence interval: 8.7- 15.0).&lt;ref&gt;Gangcuangco LM, Tan ML, Berba RP. Prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection among men having sex with men in Metro Manila, Philippines. Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health. 2013 Sept; 44(5): 810-816. http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2013-44-5/10-5743-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gangcuangco LM, Sumalapao DE, Tan ML, Berba RP. (2010). Changing Risk Factors for HIV Infection among Filipino Men Having Sex with Men in Manila, Philippines. Poster presented at: XVIII International AIDS Conference; Vienna, Austria. {{cite web |url=http://www.iasociety.org/Abstracts/A200739361.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213252/http://www.iasociety.org/Abstracts/A200739361.aspx |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing infection rates were also noted in the cities of [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]], [[Cebu]], and [[Davao City|Davao]].&lt;ref name=outrage/&gt; 1 to 3 percent of MSM's were found to be HIV-positive by sentinel surveillance conducted in Cebu and Quezon cities in 2001.

Another at-risk group are [[injecting drug users]] (IDUs), 1 percent of whom were found to be HIV-positive in Cebu City in 2005. A high rate of needle sharing among IDUs in some areas (77 percent in Cebu City) is of concern. [[Sex workers]], because of their infrequent condom use, high rates of sexually transmitted infections ([[sexually transmitted disease|STI]]s), and other factors, are also considered to be at risk. In 2002, just 6 percent of sex workers interviewed said they used condoms in the last week. As of 2005, however, HIV prevalence among sex workers in Cebu City was relatively low, at 0.2 percent.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

The threats and effects that AIDS/HIV brings to the population is a severe cause for concern. However, the prevalence of virus within the Philippine population remains low despite an increase in the number of cases. In fact, the Philippines qualifies as one of the few countries where the growth of AIDS/HIV cases has approximately increased to 25% from in a span of a couple of years from 2001-2009.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNICEF Philippines - HIV/ AIDS - Issue|url = http://www.unicef.org/philippines/8905_9238.html#.Vj16E7crLIU|website = www.unicef.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in the number of cases can be best categorized by specific groups in the population. First, the age group that is most affected are 15–24 years old. Young professionals engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse is the main cause for the contraction and it accounts for one third of the AIDS/HIV-infected population. Furthermore, the infection within this age group is more prevalent with homosexual relationships .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The regional population that is greatly affected by AID/HIV is in Cebu. The prevalence rate is at 7.7% which is greater than the major cities of Manila at 6.7% and Quezon City at 6.6%. Recent data show that the surge is not caused by transmission through sexual intercourse but through an increase of people injecting drugs. It is not the injectable drugs but the sharing of needles, which opens the risk of transmission of fluids, greatly exposing the risk of contracting the virus .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cebu City highest in HIV prevalence|url = http://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2015/06/08/Cebu-City-highest-in-HIV-prevalence.html|website = cnn|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National risk profile==
Several factors put the Philippines in danger of a broader HIV/AIDS epidemic. They include increasing population mobility within and outside of the Philippine islands; adverse to publicly discussing issues of a sexual nature; rising levels of sex work, casual sex, unsafe sex, and injecting drug use.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

There is also high STI prevalence and poor health-seeking behaviors among at-risk groups; gender inequality; weak integration of HIV/AIDS responses in local government activities; shortcomings in prevention campaigns; inadequate social and behavioral research and monitoring; and the persistence of stigma and discrimination, which results in the relative invisibility of [[PLWHA]]. Lack of knowledge about HIV among the Filipino population is troubling. Approximately two-thirds of young women lack comprehensive knowledge on HIV transmission, and 90 percent of the population of reproductive age believe you can contract HIV by sharing a meal with someone.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

The Philippines has high tuberculosis (TB) incidence, with 131 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005, according to the World Health Organization. HIV infects 0.1 percent of adults with TB. Although HIV-TB co-infection is low, the high incidence of TB indicates that co-infections could complicate treatment and care for both diseases in the future.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/ane/philippines_profile.pdf "Health Profile: Philippines"]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (March 2008). Accessed August 25, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Wary of Thailand’s growing epidemic in the late 1980s, the Philippines was quick to recognize its own sociocultural risks and vulnerabilities to HIV/AIDS.{{according to whom|date=December 2015}} Early responses included the 1992 creation of the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC), the country’s highest HIV/AIDS policymaking body. Members of the Council represent 17 governmental agencies, including local governments and the two houses of the legislature; seven nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); and an association of PLWHA.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

The passing of the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act in 1998 was also a landmark in the country’s fight against HIV/AIDS.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} However, the Philippines is faced with the challenge of stimulating government leadership action in a low-HIV-prevalence country to advocate for a stronger and sustainable response to AIDS when faced with other competing priorities. One strategy has been to prevent STIs in general, which are highly prevalent in the country.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

The PNAC developed the Philippines’ AIDS Medium Term Plan: 2005–2010 (AMTP IV). The AMTP IV serves as a national road map toward universal access to prevention, treatment, care, and support, outlining country-specific targets, opportunities, and obstacles along the way, as well as culturally appropriate strategies to address them. In 2006, the country established a national monitoring and evaluation system, which was tested in nine sites and is being expanded. Antiretroviral treatment is available free of charge, but only 10 percent of HIV-infected women and men were receiving it as of 2006, according to UNAIDS.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt; This lack of distribution can be attributed to the focus of health spending towards disease specific programs instead of spending on public health which is more comprehensive and addresses multiple diseases. By spending on public health in general, the country would be able to strengthen the health system by creating effective health infrastructures that could carry out vertical programs without creating brain drain or hindering the economic development of the country. Without passable local infrastructure, health improvements would not be possible as distribution of medical care and medicines would be very limited; incidence and prevalence reports may not be accurate, and progress of health initiatives could not be tracked.&lt;ref name=Garrett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographer [[Niccolo Cosme]] launched the Red Whistle campaign in 2011, inspired by red [[disaster preparedness]] whistles, to raise awareness and understanding of HIV/AIDs in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/343221/blowin-whistle-aids |title=Blowing the whistle on AIDS |last=Barawid |first=Rachel |date=1 December 2011 |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
The Philippines uses [[antiretroviral treatment]] (ART) to treat people with HIV/AIDS. This treatment involves using different kinds of drugs such as [[zidovudine]], [[lamivudine]], and [[nevirapine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HIV Treatment in The Philippines HIV, AIDS Treatment Cost|url = http://hivtestkit.ph/hiv-treatment-in-the-philippines/|website = HIV Test Kit Philippines - HIV Testing at Home. 99.98% Accuracy with 100% Privacy.|accessdate = 2015-11-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method that is being used is lab examination, which will help monitor the patient’s ART or [[antiretroviral]] drug level. Since treatment for HIV/AIDS is based on a case to case level, this will determine how the patient will be treated.

"The antiretroviral drug does not kill the virus that causes the disease. It’s simply a way to help fight infection. This way, the patient prolongs his/her life even with the disease. With this being said, patients have to go undergo lab examinations depending on their respective cases and receive this treatment throughout their existence. It is a form of therapy that they would have to undergo."{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}

"The government will handle most of the costs in association with the disease. The initial treatment will costs the government P7,920 a year. As of April 20th, 2015, the Department of Health (DOH) mentioned that they plan to buy P180 million worth of ARV or antiretroviral drugs to be used in ART."{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = DOH to buy P180M worth of HIV drugs|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/686535/doh-to-buy-p180m-worth-of-hiv-drugs|website = newsinfo.inquirer.net|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legislation==
The Philippines passed a legislation on HIV/AIDS during the first decade of Filipino infections. However, the bill's scope was minimal due to the lack of knowledge regarding the virus in the Philippines at the time. In 2016, lawmakers from the House of Representatives passed the ''New HIV bill'', while the Senate's version is in political limbo, as conservative senators, notably [[Tito Sotto]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Joel Villanueva]], and [[Win Gatchalian]] have vowed to block the bill in its current form. The bills filed are the most comprehensive in more than 20 years.

Since reports of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) began to emerge in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, the HIV epidemic has frequently been linked to [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and other [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) by epidemiologists and medical professionals. The first official report on the virus was published by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) on June 5, 1981 and detailed the cases of five young gay men who were hospitalised with serious infections.&lt;ref&gt;CDC (1981, 5th June) 'Pheumocystis Pneumonia - Los Angeles', MMWR, Vol. 30.                        No. 21. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/june_5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, The New York Times reported that 41 homosexuals had been diagnosed with [[Kaposi’s Sarcoma]], and eight had died less than 24 months after the diagnosis was made.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times (1981, 3rd July) "Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals" https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html?&amp;pagewanted=2&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, the condition was referred to in the medical community as ([[Gay-related immune deficiency]] (GRID), "gay cancer," and "gay compromise syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, G.A, et al (1982) 'Attempted immune stimulation in the "gay compromise syndrome"'. BMJ, 1982 October 16; 285(6348): 1082.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until July 1982 that the term [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) was suggested to replace GRID,&lt;ref&gt;Grmek, M.D. (1990) 'History of AIDS: Emergence and origin of a modern pandemic', New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and even then it was not until September that the CDC first used the AIDS acronym in an official report.&lt;ref&gt;MMWR Weekly (1982) 'Current Trends Update on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) – United States', September 24, 31(37); 507-508, 513-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now well understood that HIV does not only affect the [[gay community]] but can also infect anybody, regardless of sex, ethnicity, or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 AIDS epidemic update |publisher=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011837/http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, HIV still severely affects MSM across the globe.  MSM are only a small percentage of the U.S. population, but they are consistently the population group most affected by the HIV/AIDS virus and are the largest proportion of American citizens with an AIDS diagnosis who have died.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"&gt;Center for Disease Control. “HIV among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)” (2010). Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 2 to 20% of MSM are infected with HIV, depending on the region they live in.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"&gt;Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005.

{{Main|Men who have sex with men}}
Men who have sex with men (abbreviated as '''MSM''', also known as '''males who have sex with males''') are [[male|male person]]s who engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, regardless of how they personally identify themselves. Many MSM choose not to (or cannot for other reasons) identify as [[homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men |publisher=UNAIDS |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320001221/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the label excludes men who identify as gay or bisexual, but who have never had sex with another man, including many gay teenagers.

The terms MSM and women who have sex with women (WSW) have been used in medical scholarship since at least 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Rebecca M. and Ilan H. Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and "WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt; But, the term has been attributed to Glick ''et al.'', because their usage in a 1994 study solidified the concept in medical terminology.&lt;ref name="Young Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J.

Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and “WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 3% and as high as 16% of men have had sex at least once with a man. Their estimate includes victims of sexual abuse in addition to men who regularly or voluntarily have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| url = http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/Between_men_full_version.pdf
| title = Between Men – HIV/STI prevention for men who have sex with men
| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 6-20% of men worldwide have sex with other men at some point during their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"&gt;“Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005. UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates about the U.S. population of MSM vary. The Center for Disease Control estimates that men who have sex with men represent about 2% of the American population.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; A 2005 study estimates that among U.S. men aged 15 to 44, an estimated 6% of have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male partner in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Of these men, 71% are White, 15.9% are Hispanic, and 8.9% are black. The percentage of men who were MSM varied by state, with the lowest percentage in South Dakota (3.3%) and the highest in the District of Columbia (13.2%).  However, the same study found that 57% of men who have sex with men identify as bisexual or straight.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, S., Fallon, S., Friedman, S., Thompson, D., Gates, G., Liberti, T., &amp; Malow, R.

==HIV infection rates==

The HIV virus affects the human [[immune system]] and, if left untreated can eventually lead to [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS).&lt;ref name="pmid11396444"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sepkowitz KA |title=AIDS—the first 20 years |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=344 |issue=23 |pages=1764–1772 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11396444 |url= http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/344/23/1764 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200106073442306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weiss RA |title=How does HIV cause AIDS? |journal=Science |volume=260 |issue=5112 |pages=1273–1279 |date=May 1993 |pmid=8493571 |doi=10.1126/science.8493571|bibcode=1993Sci...260.1273W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cecil | first = Russell | title = Textbook of Medicine | publisher = Saunders | location = Philadelphia | year = 1988 | isbn = 978-0-7216-1848-7 |pages =1523, 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC reported  that in 2009 that male-to-male sex (MSM)  accounted for 61% of all new HIV infections in the U.S. and that those who had a history of recreational [[drug injection]] accounted for an additional 3% of new infections. Among the approximately 784,701 people living with an HIV diagnosis, 396,810 (51%) were MSM. About 48% of MSM living with an HIV diagnosis were white, 30% were black, and 19% were Hispanic or Latino. Although the majority of MSM are white,  non-whites accounted for 54% of new infections HIV related MSM infections in 2008.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt;

In 2010  the CDC reported that MSM represented approximately 4 percent of the male population in the United States but male-to-male sex accounted for 78 percent  of new HIV infections among men and 63 percent of all new infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECEMBER 2012 2 HIV Infections by Route  of Transmission|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/hiv-infections-2007-2010.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men overall accounted for 76% of all adults and adolescents living with HIV infection at the end of 2010 in the United States, and 80% (38,000) of the estimated 47,500 new HIV infections.  69% of men  living with HIV were gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.  39% (14,700) of new HIV infections in US men were in blacks, 35% (13,200) were in whites, and 22% (8,500) were in Hispanics/Latinos.  The rate of estimated new HIV infections among black men (per 100,000) was 103.6—six and a half times that of white men (15.8) and more than twice the rate among Hispanic/Latino men (45.5) as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Men in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/men/index.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC (2015) reported  that gay and bisexual men accounted for 82% (26,375 out of 1,242,000 adults and adolescents) of HIV diagnoses among males and 67% of all diagnoses in the United States, while six percent (2,392) of HIV diagnoses were attributed to injection drug use (IDU) and another 3% (1,202) to male-to-male sexual contact plus IDU.  Heterosexual contact accounted for 24% (9,339) of all HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV in the United States: At A Glance|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all gay and bisexual men with HIV infection classified as AIDS in the United States in 2015, African Americans accounted for the highest number (3,928; 39%), followed by whites (3,096; 31%) and Hispanics/Latinos (2,430; 24%). At the end of 2014, 508,676 gay and bisexual men were living with diagnosed HIV infection (53% of everyone living with diagnosed HIV in the US). Of gay and bisexual men living with diagnosed HIV, 157,758 (31%) were African American, 212,558 (42%) were white, and 109,857 (22%) were Hispanic/Latino. From 2005 to 2014 diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men increased 22% but has increased less than 1% between 2010 and 2014. HIV diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 increased 87% between 2005 and 2014, but with diagnoses declining 2% between 2010 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among African American Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/bmsm.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2010 study estimated that for every 100,000 MSM, 692 will be diagnosed with HIV. This makes MSM 60 times more likely to contract the virus than other men and 54 times more likely than women.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, D.W., C Johnson, A Lansky, J Prejean, R Stein, P Denning, Z Gaul, H Weinstock, J Su, &amp; N Crepaz.

Since its height in 1993-1994 the death rate due to HIV  has fallen more than 9 other leading causes of death, yet as of 2013 HIV continues to be one of the 10  leading causes of death among persons 25-44, especially among men, African Americans and in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortality Slide Series|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/slidesets/cdc-hiv-epa5-mortality-slides-2013.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also as regards HIV relation to mortality, a study  in the [[United Kingdom]]   reported that in 2008 the overall mortality rate among the HIV-diagnosed  population aged 15–59 years remained more than five times higher than that in the general population. However, as the study acknowledges  data  on  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  on  mortality among  gay and bisexual men as well as  among other populations, is very limited, and  methods to use  this are  problematic.&lt;ref name="wiley.com"&gt;Wiley Online Library: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12045/pdf Ten-year mortality trends among persons diagnosed with HIV infection in England and Wales in the era of antiretroviral therapy: AIDS remains a silent killer - Simmons - 2013 - HIV Medicine - Wiley Online Library], accessdate: April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
A 2007 study analyzing two large population surveys found that "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women."&lt;ref name=MedicalNews&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/82330.php Sexual Behavior Does Not Explain Varying HIV Rates Among Gay And Straight Men]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodreau SM, Golden MR |title=Biological and demographic causes of high HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevalence in men who have sex with men |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=458–462 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17855487 |pmc=2598698 |doi=10.1136/sti.2007.025627}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2006 study found that men who reported 4 or more male sexual partners were at increased risk of HIV infection. Study participants who reported amphetamine or heavy alcohol use before sex were more likely to have HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"&gt;BA Koblin. “Risk factors for HIV infection among men who have sex with men” (2006) AIDS, 20. 731-739.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kaiser Family Foundation study indicated that fewer Americans view HIV as a top health priority today compared to ten years ago. In 1996, 25% of Americans viewed HIV as an “urgent problem” to their community but in 2009, only 17% listed it as “urgent.” The percentage of 18- to 29-year-olds that were personally concerned about contracting the virus dropped from 28% in 1995 to 17% in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation. (2009) “2009 Survey of Americans on HIV/AIDS: summary of findings on the domestic epidemic.”&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 6 major U.S. cities found that only one in 4 teenage men who have sex with men believed they were personally at risk for contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref&gt;MacKellar DA, Valleroy LA, Secura GM, et al. (2007) Perceptions of lifetime risk and actual risk for acquiring HIV among young men who have sex with men. AIDS Behav:263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unprotected anal intercourse===

The HIV virus is more easily transmitted through unprotected [[anal intercourse]] than through unprotected [[vaginal intercourse]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.avert.org/men-sex-men.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and men who report unprotected receptive anal intercourse are at increased risk of contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"/&gt; Generally, the receptive partner is at greater risk of contracting the HIV virus because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body through semen exchange. The insertive partner is also at risk because STIs can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa22.htm Center for Disease Control; "Can I get HIV from anal sex?"]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study of HIV positive men found men who had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past year were put at risk for contracting the virus. The study found that men who reported engaging in UAI had increased from 30% in 1996 to 42% in 2000. Almost half of all men who participated in UAI in 1996-1997 said that they had not known the HIV status of their partner &lt;ref&gt;Dodds, J.P., D.E. Mercey, J.V. Parry &amp; A.M. Johnson. (2004) Increasing risk behaviour and high levels of undiagnosed HIV infection in a community sample of homosexual men. Sex Transm Infect; 80:236-240&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that risk factors for HIV infection are anal intercourse with a man in the past 12 months, having unstable housing, and having inhaled [[alkyl nitrites]] (“poppers”).&lt;ref&gt;Mimiaga, M., Reisner, S., Cranston, K., Isenberg, D., Bright, D., Daffin, G., Bland, S., &amp; Driscoll, M. (2009). Sexual mixing patterns and partner characteristics of black msm in Massachusetts at increased risk for HIV infection and transmission. Journal of Urban Health, 86(4), 602-623.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study on the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM found that majority protected their partners during sexual activity, but a sizeable number of men continue to engage in sexual behaviors that place themselves and others at risk for HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;Crepaz, Nicole, Marks, Gary; Liau, Adrian; Mullins, Mary M; Aupont, Latrina W; Marshall, Khiya J; Jacobs, Elizabeth D; Wolitski, Richard J; (2009) “Prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM in the United States: a meta-analysis”, AIDS, 80, 23:1617-1629&lt;/ref&gt;

Although HIV transmission rates fell throughout the 1990s, they hit a plateau at the end of the decade. The increasing rates of sexually transmitted diseases in major cities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom led to reports in the gay and mainstream media of [[condom fatigue]] and "AIDS optimism" as causes of the new "laxness" in safe sex practices.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"&gt;Adam, Barry D., Winston Husbands, James Murray, and John Maxwell. (2005): AIDS optimism, condom fatigue, or self-esteem? Explaining unsafe sex among gay and bisexual men, Journal of Sex Research, 42:3, 238-248&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by research on the tendency of couples (heterosexual or homosexual) to use [[condoms]] less over time.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, P., Miller, L., &amp; Rothspan, S. (1999). The paradox of trust for male couples. Personal Relationships, 6, 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bochow, M. (1998). The importance of contextualizing research. In M. Wright, B. R. S. Rosser, &amp; O. de Zwart (Eds.), New international direc- tions in HIV prevention for gay and bisexualmen. New York: Harrington Park Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cusick, L., &amp; Rhodes, T. (2000). Sustaining sexual safety in relationships. Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality, 2(4), 473-487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diaz, R., &amp; Ayala, G. (1999). Love, passion and rebellion. Culture, Health &amp;Sexuality, 1(3),277-293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hays, R., Kegeles, S., &amp; Coates, T. (1997). Unprotected sex and HIV risk- taking among young gay men within boyfriend relationships. AIDS Educationand Prevention, 9(4), 314-329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Middelthon, A. L. (2001). Interpretations of condom use and nonuse among young Norwegian gay men. Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 15(1), 58-83.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2010 study found that gay and bisexual men choose to have unprotected sex for a variety of reasons and cannot be generalized. [[Erectile dysfunction]], mental health problems and [[Mood disorder|depression]], lack of communication or intimacy, and a [[subculture]] of unprotected sex were all listed as reasons why men had sex without condoms voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"/&gt;

==Prevention==
In the late 1980s the first direct advocacy groups for people with HIV/AIDS were created. Notably, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ([[ACT UP]]) formed at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]] in New York in the wake of the antiretroviral drug [[Zidovudine|AZT]] to petition better access to drugs as well as cheaper prices, public education about AIDS and the prohibition of AIDS-related discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1988, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published a paper in 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating the spread of the HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. The UN is trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring the anonymity of the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize [[sexual education]] as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"/&gt;

Studies have shown that although there is a large market for vaginal microbicides in developing nations, rectal microbicides are stigmatized and less researched. No microbicide has yet been proven to effectively protect against the risks of unprotected anal intercourses, but advocates believe greater funding for research is needed since condom usage rates are so low. However, stigma and homophobia would potentially be barriers to individuals buying the product. The authors mention this is especially a concern in Caribbean countries where HIV prevalence is high but homosexuality is still illegal and highly stigmatized (See [[HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean]].) &lt;ref&gt;

===Access to testing===
UNAIDS has observed “sero-selection” (choosing a partner based on their HIV status) becoming increasingly prevalent in partner choice and transmission in the United States.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"/&gt; A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; Many HIV-infected individuals do not seek treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% do not seek treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, a significant portion of individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Janssen, M.D., I. M. Onorato, M.D., R. O. Valdiserri, M.D., T. M. Durham, M.S., W. P. Nichols, M.P.A., E. M. Seiler, M.P.A., H. W. Jaffe, M.D. “Advancing HIV Prevention: New Strategies for a Changing Epidemic -- United States, 2003” (2003) The Body Pro: HIV Resource for Health Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, OraQuick, the first rapid HIV home-testing kit, went on sale for $40. The test is nearly 100% accurate when it predicts HIV-negative results for HIV-negative individuals. However, for HIV-positive individuals that are not yet producing the antibodies detected by the test, it produces a false negative 93% of the time. Although the manufacturer, OraSure Technologies, is not advertising the test for use for selection of partners,  experts have suggested that it may prevent unprotected sexual contact with partners that lie about or are unaware of their HIV status.&lt;ref name="Donald G. 2012"&gt;McNeil Jr., Donald G. “Another Use for Rapid Home H.I.V. Test: Screening Sexual Partners.” The New York Times. October 5th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study examined how the OraQuick test would identify the behavior of 27 self-identified gay men who frequently had unprotected sex with acquaintances. The researchers gave each participant 16 tests to use over the course of three months. 101 potential partners were tested, and 10 were positive. None of the participants had sex with someone who tested positive.  23 other potential partners refused testing and left the encounter. 2 men admitted they were HIV-positive. Most participants said they would continue using home tests after the study ended to test potential partners on their own. The researchers considered home testing to be an effective prevention method for high-risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo-Dieguez, Alex, Timothy Frasca, Ivan Balan, Mobolaji Ibitoye, and Curtis Dolezal. “Use of a Rapid HIV Home Test Prevents HIV Exposure in a High Risk Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men.” AIDS and Behavior. Volume 16, Number 7 (2012), 1753-1760.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the test’s $40 cost is considered a major deterrent to commonplace partner testing.

'''[[Italy]]''' is known for its generally very good [[health]] system, considering the fact that it has the world's [[List of countries by life expectancy|6th highest life expectancy]] in 2015 (according to [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository: Life expectancy – Data by country |publisher=World Health Statistics 2015, World Health Organization, WHO |url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688?lang=en |location=Geneva, Switzerland |format=CSV |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-12-20 |quote=the technical health information is based on data accurate with respect to the year indicated (2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt;), low [[infant mortality]], relatively healthy [[Italian cuisine|cuisine and diet]], and [[Healthcare in Italy|healthcare system]] that is ranked 2nd according to World Health Organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html|title=The World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems|work=photius.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which has the third best medical performance worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/world_health_performance_ranks.html|title=Health Performance Rank By Country. Health system attainment and performance in all Member States, ranked by eight measures, estimates for 1997 from the World Health Organization|work=photius.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with any developed country, Italy has adequate and sufficient water and food distribution, and levels of nutrition and sanitation are high.

==Water and Food==
Italy has a good and sufficient water supply, yet, especially due to droughts, common in the summer (notably in [[Southern Italy]]), water shortages can frequently occur.&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/hms/ehiexes_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303051309/http://www.euro.who.int/document/hms/ehiexes_e.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italians consume a very high amount of mineral water, the highest compared to equivalent neighbours: in 1992, the average person in Italy drank 116 litres, compared to 105 in [[Belgium]], 93 in [[Germany]] and 80 in [[France]]. According to studies, 18 million people in Italy annually are confronted with at least one slight water shortage, and 18% of Italian families have been recorded as having irregular distribution patterns.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt; Some water distribution is also uneven, and can be explained by economic factors; for example, people in [[Lombardy]], Italy's richest region, drink nine times more bottled water than [[Campania]], one of the country's poorest.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt;

A problem which often presents itself regarding drinking water is water pollution and the presence of harmful purifying chemicals and/or herbicides, which can cause several health problems.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt; According to a decree issued by the state, the maximum presence of herbicides or similar materials in Italy drinking water is 0.5 μg per litre.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt;

Italy's nutritious and generally healthy [[Italian cuisine|cuisine]] ensures that Italians are well-nourished and eat good food. The relatively recent addition of several drugs to meats has meant that controls have increased from 4,000 in 1988 to 56,831 in 1991.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt;

==Radiation==
Being a relatively warm and sunny country, Italians are often exposed to direct radiation from the sun (ultraviolet radiation), which, if not protected from sun cream or block, can create carcinogenic skin diseases, such as [[skin cancer]]. Despite this, the greatest risk from exposure to radiation is found indoors.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt;

==Life expectancy and mortality==
Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in the world. Italy's high average varies greatly by regions. In the more affluent north, the life expectancy at birth in 1990 for a man was lower than in Italy's south (73.3 compared to 74.2). For a woman, the average is higher in the north than in the south (80.6 compared to 79.8).&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt; Central Italy has the highest average, with 74.7 for men and 81.0 for women.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt; 

In 2003, the average national life expectancy at birth for a woman was 78~84, and for a man 71~77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/ita/en/|title=WHO - Italy|work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, this average had increased to 77.26 for men, and 83.33 for women.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy also has a very low rate of infant mortality, that of 5.51 out of 1000 people, the 185th lowest in the world.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; From 1970 to 1989, the death rate went down dramatically, from 11 and 10.3 for men and women, to 8.3 and 6.7.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt;

In 2015 [[Liguria]] had the highest cancer mortality of any region in Europe, at 377 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccination==
The Italian vaccination system is complex because services and decisions are delivered by 21 separate regional authorities creates many variations. There is a National committee on immunizations that updates the national recommended immunization schedule, with input from the ministry of health representatives, regional health authorities, national institute of health, and other scientific societies.&lt;ref name="ministerodellasalute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministero Della Salute|url=http://www.salute.gov.it|publisher=Italian Ministry of Health|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regions may add more scheduled vaccinations, but cannot exempt citizens from nationally mandated or recommended ones.&lt;ref name="ministerodellasalute" /&gt; A nationwide plan for eliminating measles and rubella began in 2001.&lt;ref name="ministerodellasalute" /&gt; 

Childhood vaccinations included in national schedules are free for all Italian children and foreign children who live in the country.&lt;ref name="ministerodellasalute" /&gt; Estimated coverage for the required three doses of HBV-Hib-IPV vaccines is at least 95% of 2 year olds.  Influenza is the only nationally necessary vaccine for adults, and is administered by general practitioners.&lt;ref name="ministerodellasalute" /&gt;  Italy has a national vaccine injury compensation program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Mary| name-list-format = vanc |title=U.S. Media Blackout: Italian Courts Rule Vaccines Cause Autism.|website=Global Research|publisher=Centre for Research on Globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; One evaluation of vaccine coverage in 2010, which covered the 2008 birth cohort, showed a slight decline in immunization insurance coverage rates of diphtheria, hepatitis B, polio, and tetanus after those specific vaccinations had been made mandatory.&lt;ref name="eurosurveillance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haverkate, D’Ancona, Giambi, Johansen, Lopalco, Cozza, and Appelgren|title=Mandatory And Recommended Vaccination In The EU, Iceland And Norway: Results Of The Venice 2010 Survey On The Ways Of Implementing National Vaccination Programmes.|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20183|website=Eurosurveillance|access-date=10 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, vaccination levels continued to pass the Italian government's goal of 95% outreach.&lt;ref name="eurosurveillance" /&gt; 

Aiming to integrate immunization strategies across the country and equitize access to disease prevention, the [[Ministry of Health (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Health]] issued the National Immunization Prevention Plan (Piano Nazionale Prevenzione Vaccinale) in 2012 which proposed an institutional "lifecourse" approach to vaccination.&lt;ref name="bonanni"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonanni P, Ferro A, Guerra R, Iannazzo S, Odone A, Pompa MG, Rizzuto E, Signorelli C | title = Vaccine coverage in Italy and assessment of the 2012-2014 National Immunization Prevention Plan | journal = Epidemiologia E Prevenzione | volume = 39 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = 146–58 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 26499433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HPV]] vaccine coverage increased, and [[pneumococcal vaccine]] and meningococcal C vaccines had a positive public reception. However, both infant vaccine coverage rates and influenza immunization in the elderly have been decreasing.&lt;ref name="bonanni" /&gt; A 2015 government plan in Italy aimed to boost vaccination rates and introduce a series of new vaccines, and triggered protests among public health professionals.&lt;ref name="margottini"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Margottini|first1=Laura| name-list-format = vanc |title=New Vaccination Strategy Stirs Controversy in Italy.|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/12/new-vaccination-strategy-stirs-controversy-italy|website=Science Insider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially in response to the statistic that less than 86% of Italian children receive the measles shot, the National Vaccination Plan for 2016–18 (PNPV) increased vaccination requirements.&lt;ref name="margottini" /&gt; [[Varicella]] shots would be required for newborns.&lt;ref name="margottini" /&gt; Under this plan, government spending on vaccines would double to €620 million annually, and children could be barred from attending school without proving vaccination.&lt;ref name="margottini" /&gt; Although these implementations would make Italy a European frontrunner in vaccination, some experts questioned the need for several of the vaccines, and some physicians worried about the potential punishment they may face if they do not comply with the proposed regulations.&lt;ref name="margottini" /&gt;

There were 5,000 cases of measles in 2017, up from 870 in 2016, 29% of all those in the European Union.  The law compelling children to have 10 vaccinations in order to enrol at state schools came into effect in March 2018 but in August 2018 the [[Five Star Movement]] pushed legislation through the [[Italian Senate]] abolishing it. It has not yet passed the [[Chamber of Deputies]] but parents do not now have to provide schools with a doctor’s note to show their children have been vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Italy Senate overturns mandatory vaccination law |url=https://www.ft.com/content/afd472be-996c-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d?emailId=5b6873a4a1ccf60004083fa6 |accessdate=17 September 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking==
{{See|Smoking in Italy}}

[[Smoking]] in Italy has decreased greatly in the past decades for men, yet women have had a less definitive pattern. From a country where in 1966 a 68.5% average of the male population smoked, this had gone down to a ~37% average in 1991. For women, it increased from ~15% for women in 1966, to ~16.5%, notably in the centre, where it has gone up from 15% to 20.1%.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3203">In response to the [[Millennium Development Goals]]' focus on maternal and child health, the Philippines began the National Demographic and Health Survey in 1968 to assess the effectiveness of public health programs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR294/FR294.pdf|title=Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers to healthcare ==
Poor communities suffer a higher [[burden of disease]] due to inequities in access to services and health status. Since financing for [[local government units]] often vary and the benefits package for insurance plans may be unfavorable, some communities face difficulties accessing public health services. Shifting the responsibility of healthcare from the federal government to the local governments has increased local authority and has made communities susceptible to lack of access to basic services.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azfar|first=Omar|last2=Gurgur|first2=Tugrul|date=2008-07-01|title=Does corruption affect health outcomes in the Philippines?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-006-0031-y|journal=Economics of Governance|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=197–244|doi=10.1007/s10101-006-0031-y|issn=1435-6104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most healthcare payments are made out of pocket, especially when receiving care from privately owned institutions. Barangay health stations serve as primary public health facilities and are staffed by doctors, nurses, midwives, and barangay health volunteers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lakshminarayanan|first=Rama|date=May 2003|title=Decentralisation and its implications for reproductive health: the Philippines experience|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|volume=11|issue=21|pages=96–107|issn=0968-8080|pmid=12800707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no requirement in the Philippines for causes of death to be medically determined prior to registration of a death, so national statistics as to causes of death in the Philippines cannot be accurately substantiated. In the provinces, especially in places more remote from registries, births and deaths are often not recorded unless some family need arises, such as entry into college. When there is no legal process needed to pass on inheritance, the recording of deaths is viewed as unnecessary by the family.

Qatari citizens are covered by a national health insurance scheme, while expatriates must either receive health insurance from their employers, or in the case of the self-employed, purchase insurance.&lt;ref name="imtj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imtj.com/news/?entryid82=429611|title=QATAR: Compulsory health insurance leaves window for treatment abroad|publisher=International Medical Travel Journal|date=21 October 2013|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar's healthcare spending is among the highest in the [[Middle East]], with $4.7 billion being invested in healthcare in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-s-2015-healthcare-expenditure-worth-5-2bn-599419.html#.VbFeOflViko|title=Qatar's 2015 healthcare expenditure worth $5.2bn|publisher=Arabian Business|date=13 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a $2.1 bllion increase from 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-is-mideast-s-biggest-healthcare-spender-467863.html|title=Qatar is MidEast’s biggest healthcare spender|publisher=Arabian Business|author=Shane McGinley|date=30 July 2012|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premier healthcare provider in the country is the [[Hamad Medical Corporation]], established by the government as a non-profit healthcare provider, which runs a network of hospitals, an ambulance services, and a home healthcare service, all of which are accredited by the [[Joint Commission]].

==Development==
Development in healthcare was expedited in the mid-1900s after the country saw considerable monetary returns from the oil industry re-allocated into the expansion of the healthcare system. Currently, health coverage is nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sillitoe|first=Paul|title=Sustainable Development: An Appraisal from the Gulf Region|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vR4fAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=102|year=2014|isbn=978-1782383710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar has made developing a world class public health system one of its key goals through its [[Qatar National Vision 2030|National Vision 2030]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar National Vision 2030|url=http://www.gsdp.gov.qa/portal/page/portal/gsdp_en/qatar_national_vision|publisher=Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113150935/http://www.gsdp.gov.qa/portal/page/portal/gsdp_en/qatar_national_vision|archivedate=2012-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the country announced its plans to introduce a [[universal health care]] system.&lt;ref name="fentonft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/987e283c-e53e-11e1-b758-00144feab49a.html#axzz3erAnyvt7|title=Qatar rolls out universal healthcare plan|publisher=Financial Times|author=Jennifer Fenton|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universal health care program has 5 stages, to be fully implemented by 2015.&lt;ref name="imtj"/&gt; In the '' 2014 GCC Healthcare Report'' released by Alpen International, Qatar's healthcare sector was ranked as the fastest growing in the GCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/talks-underway-to-establish-filipino-hospital-in-qatar/|title=Talks underway to establish Filipino hospital in Qatar|publisher=Doha News|author=Lesley Walker|date=15 October 2015|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Council of Health, which oversees the health sector, announced the "Qatar Health Facilities Master Plan" (QHFMP) program in 2014. As part of the program, as many as 48 healthcare infrastructure projects are set to be developed in Qatar by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/qatar/178/details/398802/48-healthcare-projects-are-in-the-pipeline|title=48 healthcare projects are in the pipeline|publisher=Gulf Times|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to foster competition between state and private health providers. A Qatar Medical Research Council has been established.  The Sidra Medical and Research Center, planned to open in 2017 is to translate research into practical treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medical School at [[Qatar University]] is to open in 2015.  The [[Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar]] has been training clinicians since 2002.  About 10% of the healthcare workforce are Qataris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seha==
The government has established the National Health Insurance Company which manages and operates Seha, the national health insurance scheme. From July 2013 it has covered Qatari females aged 12 and above for gynaecology, obstetrics, maternity and related women’s health conditions. From 30 April 2014, it provides comprehensive insurance coverage to Qatari nationals for basic health care needs, which includes almost all medical, dental and optical treatment except cosmetic surgery, alternative medicine and over-the-counter drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Health Insurance Company (NHIC) manages and operates the social health insurance scheme in the State of Qatar.

==Infrastructure==
In 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 2.2% of the country's GDP; the highest in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-is-mideast-s-biggest-healthcare-spender-467863.html|title=Qatar is MidEast’s biggest healthcare spender|publisher=Arabian Business|author=Shane McGinley|date=30 July 2012|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, there were 23.12 physicians and 61.81 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health report|url=http://www.who.int/countries/qat/en|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy at birth was 82.08 years in 2014, or 83.27 years for males and 77.95 years for females, rendering it the highest life expectancy in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life expectancy in the Middle East|url=http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/life-expectancy-middle-east |publisher=World Life Expectancy|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar has a low infant mortality rate of 7 in 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=asc |publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, there were a total of 25 beds per 10,000 people, and 27.6 doctors and 73.8 nurses per 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianzworldwidecare.com/healthcare-in-qatar|title=Healthcare in Qatar|publisher=Allianz|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the number of beds decreased to 12 per 10,000 people, whereas the number of doctors increased to 28 per 10,000 people. While the country has one of the lowest proportions of hospital beds in the region, the availability of physicians is the highest in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/report-qatars-healthcare-sector-fastest-growing-region/|title=Report: Qatar’s healthcare sector the fastest growing in the region|publisher=Doha News|date=25 April 2014|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitals===

[[File:Al Wakrah - hospital under construction.jpg|thumb|230px|A hospital being constructed in [[Al Wakrah]].]]

==Administration==
The [[Supreme Council of Health (Qatar)|Supreme Council of Health]] (SCH), created in 2005, is responsible for regulating Qatar's healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sch.gov.qa/about-sch/vision-n-mission|title=Vision &amp; Mission|publisher=Supreme Council of Health|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the council published the first patients' right charter in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/362186/sch-launches-first-patients-rights-charter|title=SCH launches first patients’ rights charter|publisher=The Peninsula|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before oil was discovered, healthcare consisted of traditional medicine: barbers performed circumcisions and other minor procedures, and herbalists dispensed natural remedies.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/72.htm|title=Health in Qatar|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 July 2015}} {{loc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cauterization]] was a prominent practice in folk medicine. Before embarking on a pearl diving trip, a sailor would often be cauterized to prevent ear problems from developing. The practice was also used to cure a number of illnesses. Abdulaziz bin Ahmed Al Thani, a state official during the 1930s and member of the ruling family of Qatar, was noted for his curing of illnesses by using cauterization. [[Cupping therapy]] was also a prominent feature of folk medicine. It was commonly used in conjunction with [[Herbalism|herbal therapy]], a form of treatment which utilized traditional herbs in Islamic medicine. [[Aloe ferox|Bitter aloe]] was the most prized herb. Other natural remedies used by Qataris include [[incense]], [[thyme]] and [[saffron]]. [[Locust]]s were also venerated for their purported healing abilities in local nomadic culture and were considered a delicacy because of their nutritious properties, leading to their additional use as livestock feed. Of all the forms of folk medicine, herbal therapy was the most popular. Traditional practices were seldom documented, instead being passed down through oral methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5339/avi.2014.1 |issue= | url=http://www.qscience.com/doi/full/10.5339/avi.2014.1#_i8||title=Folk medicine and integrative healing in West Asia: Analysis of historical and modern practice and perceptions|year=2014|authors=Tammi Moe, Fahad Ahmed Al Obaidly, Reem Al Khoder &amp; Doreen Schmid |journal=Avicenna|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, emir [[Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani|Abdullah bin Jassim]] opted to establish the country's first hospital in order to provide treatment for his son, [[Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani|Hamad bin Abdullah]]. Prior to this, Qatari residents had to travel abroad in order to receive treatment for more severe illnesses, most typically going to the American Mission hospitals in [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], or [[Bahrain]], or to [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"/&gt; Because of Abdullah bin Jassim's lack of resources, he sought help from the British political resident in Qatar. The representative rejected his proposal, and he turned to the American Mission, who agreed to help fund and construct a hospital. The hospital opened in 1947 with a 12-bed capacity and was staffed by a single doctor from the American Mission who was rotated on a recurrent basis. By 1948, it was visited by approximately 75 out-patients per day. The American Mission ceased sending staff members to the hospital in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and as a result, the government assumed full responsibility for its operation.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/cures-for-qataris-the-first-hospital-in-doha/|title=Cures for Qataris: The first hospital in Doha|publisher=Origins of Doha|author=Ruth Hatfield|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Rumailah Hospital, the first government hospital in the country, was founded in 1957.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"/&gt; Plans for its establishment were drawn up in the early 1950s and the patent for its design was awarded by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] to two British architects in 1952.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"/&gt;

The development of social services, including health care, accelerated after the accession in 1972 of [[Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani|Khalifa bin Hamad]], who dramatically altered the allocation of oil revenues. This included transferring the ruler's 25 percent of oil revenues to the state budget. However, the health budget soon suffered because of the downturns in oil revenues. In 1986, for example, there were cuts of 10 percent in clinic staff.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4239">'''Healthcare in Saint Helena''' is provided by the Health Directorate on the British island of [[Saint Helena]] which has a staff of about 250.

==Facilities==

The directorate manages a small general hospital with 54 beds, a dispensary, a  complex for care of the elderly,  centres for the acute and chronically mentally infirm and the mentally and physically handicapped. There are several outpatient clinics, a pharmacy and laboratory, and dental care. There are six rural health clinics which are visited regularly by the doctors, dentist and community nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Useful info|url=http://sthelenatourism.com/the-island/useful-info/|website=St Helena Tourism|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resident staff include a senior medical officer, three medical officers and a dentist with annual visits by an optometrist and ophthalmic surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare|url=http://www.investinsthelena.com/about-st-helena/infrastructure/healthcare/|website=Enterprise St Helena|publisher=Enterprise St Helena|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2006 the service had a portable x-ray machine, a Siemens ultrasound and a retinal camera. About 20 patients a year are referred, usually to Cape Town, for scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nielsen|first1=Lasse Christian|title=St. Helena Cost-effective Delivery of Specialist Medical Services to the St. Helena Population - Review of Options - Draft Recommendations|url=http://www.heart-resources.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cost-delivery-of-specialist-medical-services.pdf|website=Heart Resources|publisher=DFID Health Resource Centre|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If necessary, serious or complex cases are transferred to [[South Africa]] or the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Directorate|url=http://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/health-and-social-welfare/|website=St Helena Government|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges==
Charges are payable for treatment.  Costs for primary care for the local population, and emergency treatment for UK residents are  modest, and rise to a maximum of £183.95 (2016 scale) for surgery.  For visitors and non residents they are much more substantial, with a maximum of £2880.20 (2014 scale) for surgery.  Comprehensive medical insurance is compulsory for visitors and non-residents.

==Expenditure==
The British Government’s [[Department for International Development]] provides support and advice to the St Helena government and produced a  report on  ''Cost-effective Delivery of Specialist Medical Services to the St. Helena Population'' in 2006. The report showed that expenditure on health had risen from £1,154,675 in 1993/4 to £2,050,830 in 2000/1, but was still less than 50% of the level spent on health care in the UK.  Between 2000 and 2006 cancer was the most costly diagnosis in terms of referral to services off the island (45% of total cost) followed by cardiology (13%), spinal (10%), urology (8%) and orthopaedic diagnoses (8%). These 5 diagnoses accounted for 84% of the total referral cost. 

The total referral cost increased by a factor of 4 between 2004 and 2005.  106 referrals were expected in 2006 where the average for earlier years was about 35.  Between 2000 and 2004 the average cost of a referral was £4,000 but in 2005 it was over £12,000. The average age of patients referred also increased from 35 to 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nielsen|first1=Lasse Christian|title=St. Helena Cost-effective Delivery of Specialist Medical Services to the St. Helena Population - Review of Options - Draft Recommendations|url=http://www.heart-resources.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cost-delivery-of-specialist-medical-services.pdf|website=Heart Resources|publisher=DFID Health Resource Centre|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Life expectancy is 3-3.5 years less than the United Kingdom. The Infant Mortality Rate has been reduced from  44.7 per thousand live births in 1981 to 3.9 in 2000/1.

Income inequality on the island is modest. The highest salary is 4.6 times that of the lowest paid person in full-time employment.

This legend is the subject of the [[noh]] drama ''Sanjo Kokaji''.]]
{{nihongo|'''Inari Ōkami'''|稲荷大神|| also '''Oinari'''}} is the [[Japan]]ese ''[[kami]]'' of [[Red fox|foxes]], of [[Fertility (soil)|fertility]], [[rice]], [[tea]] and [[sake]], of [[agriculture]] and [[industry]], of general prosperity and worldly success, and one of the principal kami of [[Shinto]]. In earlier Japan, Inari was also the patron of [[swordsmith]]s and [[merchant]]s.  Represented as [[male]], [[female]], or [[Androgyny|androgynous]], Inari is sometimes seen as a collective of three or five individual ''kami''. Inari appears to have been worshipped since the founding of a shrine at Inari Mountain in 711 AD, although some scholars believe that worship started in the late 5th century.

By the 16th century Inari had become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors, and worship of Inari spread across Japan in the [[Edo period]]. Inari is a popular figure in both [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs in Japan.  More than one-third (32,000) of the Shinto shrines in Japan are dedicated to Inari.  Modern corporations, such as cosmetic company [[Shiseido]], continue to revere Inari as a patron kami, with shrines atop their corporate headquarters.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reader | first = Ian | title = Simple Guides: Shinto | publisher = Kuperard | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-85733-433-7 | pages=20, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inari's foxes, or ''[[kitsune]]'', are pure white and act as their messengers.

==Depiction==
[[File:A man confronted with an apparition of the Fox goddess.jpg|thumb|left|Inari appears to a warrior.  This portrayal of Inari shows the influence of [[Dakiniten]] concepts from [[Buddhism]].]]
Inari has been depicted both as male and as female.  The most popular representations of Inari, according to scholar Karen Ann Smyers, are a young female food goddess, an old man carrying rice, and an androgynous [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref name="Smyers8"&gt;Smyers, Karen Ann. The Fox and the Jewel: Shared and Private Meanings in Contemporary Japanese Inari Worship. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1999. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  No one view is correct; the preferred gender of depiction varies according to regional traditions and individual beliefs.&lt;ref name="Smyers8"/&gt;  Because of their close association with ''kitsune'', Inari is often believed to be a fox; though this belief is widespread, both Shinto and Buddhist priests discourage it.&lt;ref name="Smyers8"/&gt;  Inari also appears in the form of a snake or dragon, and one [[Folklore|folktale]] has Inari appear to a wicked man in the shape of a monstrous [[spider]] as a way of teaching him a lesson.

Inari is sometimes identified with other mythological figures.  Some scholars suggest that Inari is the figure known in classical [[Japanese mythology]] as [[Ukanomitama]] or the ''[[Kojiki]]'s'' [[Uke Mochi|Ōgetsu-Hime]]; others suggest Inari is the same figure as [[Toyouke-Ōmikami|Toyouke]].  Some take Inari to be identical to any grain ''kami''.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 7, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ash"&gt;Ashkenazy, Michael.  ''Handbook of Japanese Mythology''.  Santa Barbara, California:  ABC-Clio, 2003. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Inari's female aspect is often identified or conflated with [[Dakiniten]], a [[Buddhist]] [[deity]] who is a Japanese transformation of the [[India]]n ''[[dakini]]'',&lt;ref name="Smyers8283"&gt;Smyers 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[Benzaiten]] of the [[Seven Lucky Gods]].&lt;ref name="Oinari"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/oinari.shtml |title=Oinari |accessdate=2007-02-17 |work=A to Z Photo Dictionary of Japanese Buddhist &amp; Shinto Deities |last=Schumacher |first=Mark |date=September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dakiniten is portrayed as a female or androgynous bodhisattva riding a flying white fox.&lt;ref name="Smyers8283"/&gt;  Inari's association with Buddhism may have begun in the 8th century, when [[Shingon]] Buddhist monk and founder, [[Kūkai]], took over administration of the temple of [[Tō-ji|Tōji]], and chose Inari as a protector of the temple.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;  Thus, Inari is still closely associated with Shingon Buddhism to this day.

Inari is often venerated as a collective of three deities (''Inari sanza''); since the [[Kamakura period]], this number has sometimes increased to five ''kami'' (''Inari goza'').  However, the identification of these ''kami'' has varied over time.  According to records of [[Fushimi Inari]], the oldest and perhaps most prominent Inari shrine, these ''kami'' have included [[Izanagi]], [[Izanami]], [[Ninigi]], and [[Wakumusubi]], in addition to the food deities previously mentioned. The five ''kami'' today identified with Inari at Fushimi Inari are Ukanomitama, [[Sarutahiko]], Omiyanome, Tanaka, and Shi.  However, at [[Takekoma Inari]], the second-oldest Inari shrine in Japan, the three enshrined deities are Ukanomitama, Ukemochi, and Wakumusubi.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 151–155&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Nijūni shaki]], the three ''kami'' are Ōmiyame no mikoto (water,) Ukanomitama no mikoto (grain,) and Sarutahiko no mikami (land.)

The fox and the wish-fulfilling jewel are prominent symbols of Inari.  Other common elements in depictions of Inari, and sometimes of their ''kitsune'', include a sickle, a sheaf or sack of rice, and a sword. Another belonging was their whip—although they were hardly known to use it, it was a powerful weapon that was used to burn people's crops of rice.

==History==
[[File:Vulpes vulpes laying in snow.jpg|thumb|right|The Hokkaido red fox]]
[[File:Kobayashi Izanami and Izanagi.jpg|thumb|left|180px|{{nihongo|''Searching the Seas with the [[Amenonuhoko|Tenkei]]''|天瓊を以て滄海を探るの図|Tenkei o motte sōkai o saguru no zu}}. Painting by Kobayashi Eitaku, 1880–90 (MFA, Boston). Izanagi to the right, Izanami to the left.]]

The origin of Inari worship is not entirely clear. The first recorded use of the present-day ''[[kanji]]'' (''characters'') of Inari's name, which mean "carrying rice", (literally "rice load") was in the ''[[Ruijū Kokushi]]'' in 892 AD. Other sets of ''kanji'' with the same phonetic readings, most of which contained a reference to rice, were in use earlier, and most scholars agree that the name ''Inari'' is derived from {{nihongo|''ine-nari'' (''growing rice'')|稲成り}}.&lt;ref name="Smyers15"&gt;Smyers 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The worship of Inari is known to have existed as of 711 AD, the official founding date of the shrine at Inari Mountain in [[Fushimi, Kyoto]].  Scholars such as Kazuo Higo believe worship was conducted for centuries before that date; they suggest that the [[Hata tribe|Hata clan]] began the formal worship of Inari as an agriculture ''kami'' in the late fifth century.&lt;ref name="Higo"&gt;Higo, Kazuo.  "Inari Shinkō no Hajime".  ''Inari Shinkō'' (ed. Hiroji Naoe).  Tokyo: Yūzankaku Shuppan, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Inari does not appear in classical [[Japanese mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 16&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Heian period]], Inari worship began to spread.  In 823 AD, after [[Emperor Saga]] presented the [[Tō-ji]] temple to [[Kūkai]], the founder of the [[Shingon]] Buddhist sect, the latter designated Inari as its resident protector ''kami''.&lt;ref name="Higo"/&gt;  In 827, the court granted Inari the lower fifth rank, which further increased the deity's popularity in the capital.  Inari's rank was subsequently increased, and by 942, [[Emperor Suzaku]] granted Inari the top rank in thanks for overcoming rebellions.  At this time, the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha]] shrine was among the twenty-two shrines chosen by the court to receive imperial patronage, a high honor.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;  The second Inari shrine, Takekoma Inari, was established in the late ninth century.

Inari's popularity continued to grow.  The Fushimi shrine, already a popular pilgrimage site, gained wide renown when it became an imperial pilgrimage site in 1072.  By 1338, the shrine's festival was said to rival the [[Gion Matsuri|Gion Festival]] in splendor.&lt;ref name="Smyers18"&gt;Smyers 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1468, during the [[Ōnin War]], the entire Fushimi shrine complex was burned.  Rebuilding took about thirty years; the new building was consecrated in 1499.  While the old complex had enshrined three ''kami'' in separate buildings, the new one enshrined five ''kami'' in a single building.  The new shrine also included a Buddhist temple building for the first time, and the hereditary priesthood was expanded to include the [[Kada clan]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inuyama inari 1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of a ''[[kitsune]]'' adorned with a red votive bib in a shrine at [[Inuyama]] Castle.  Many castles in Japan contain Inari shrines.]]
During the [[Edo period]], Inari worship spread across Japan; it became especially prominent in [[Edo]].&lt;ref name="Smyers20"&gt;Smyers 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Smyers attributes this spread to the movement of ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords).  Inari had by the sixteenth century become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors—for this reason, many castle compounds in Japan contain Inari shrines—and the ''daimyōs'' took their belief in their protector ''kami'' with them when they relocated to a new domain.&lt;ref name="Smyers20"/&gt;  Inari's divine role continued to expand; on the coast, they became a protector of fishermen; in Edo, they were invoked to prevent fires.  They became the patron of actors and of prostitutes, since their shrines were often found near the pleasure quarters where these individuals lived.  They began to be worshipped as the ''Desire-Fulfilling Inari'', a deity of luck and prosperity; a common saying in [[Osaka]] was ''Byō Kōbō, yoku Inari'' (''For sickness [pray to] [[Kōbō Daishi|Kōbō]], for desires [pray to] Inari'').&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ono, Yasuhiro, ed.  ''Nihon Shūkyō Jiten''.  Tokyo: Kobundo, 1985. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Inari also began to be petitioned for good health; they are credited with curing such diverse afflictions as coughs, toothaches, broken bones, and syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 94, 137–138, 160&lt;/ref&gt;  Women prayed to Inari to grant them children.

After a government decree mandated the separation of Buddhist and Shinto beliefs, many Inari shrines underwent changes.  At Fushimi Inari, for instance, structures that were obviously Buddhist were torn down.  Among the populace, however, the blended form of worship continued.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Buddhist temples, such as [[Toyokawa Inari]], maintained Inari worship by arguing that they had always been devoted to a Buddhist deity (often Dakiniten), which the common folk had mistaken as Inari.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tokugawa period]], when money replaced rice as the measure of wealth in Japan, Inari's role as a ''kami'' of worldly prosperity was expanded to include all aspects of finance, business, and industry.  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, followers of Inari at the [[Ginza]] mint struck coins meant for offerings to Inari, which featured pictures of two foxes and a jewel or the characters for ''long life'' and ''good luck''.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shrines and offerings==
{{main|Inari shrine}}
Inari is a popular deity with shrines and temples located throughout most of [[Japan]].  According to a 1985 survey by the National Association of Shinto Shrines, 32,000 shrines—more than one-third of Shinto shrines in Japan—are dedicated to Inari.&lt;ref&gt;Okada, Shōji.  "Reii-jin to Sūkei-kō".  ''Nihon Shūkyō Jiten'' (1985). 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;  This number includes only Shinto shrines with full-time resident priests; if small roadside or field shrines, shrines kept in a home or corporate office, smaller shrines without full-time resident priests, and Buddhist temples were included, the number would increase by at least an order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Gorai, Shigeru. ''Inari Shinkō no Kenkyū.'' Okayama: Sanyō Shimbunsha, 1985. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrance to an Inari shrine is usually marked by one or more [[vermilion]] [[torii]] and some statues of ''kitsune'', which are often adorned with red ''yodarekake'' (''votive bibs'') by worshippers out of respect.  This red color has come to be identified with Inari, because of the prevalence of its use among Inari shrines and their torii.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 60, 177&lt;/ref&gt;  The main shrine is the [[Fushimi Inari]] Shrine in [[Fushimi, Kyoto|Fushimi]], [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]], Japan, where the paths up the shrine hill are marked in this fashion.  The ''kitsune'' statues are at times taken for a form of Inari, and they typically come in pairs, representing a male and a female.&lt;ref name="Smyers93"&gt;Smyers 93&lt;/ref&gt;  These fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw—most often a jewel and a key, but a sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are all common.  Almost all Inari shrines, no matter how small, will feature at least a pair of these statues, usually flanking or on the altar or in front of the main sanctuary.&lt;ref name="Smyers93"/&gt;  The statues are rarely realistic; they are typically stylized, portraying a seated animal with its tail in the air looking forward.  Despite these common characteristics, the statues are highly individual in nature; no two are quite the same.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 93, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Lafcadio. ''Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan''. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8130 Project Gutenberg e-text edition], 2005. 152–153. Retrieved on February 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offerings of [[rice]], [[sake]], and other food are given at the shrine to appease and please these ''kitsune'' messengers, who are then expected to plead with Inari on the worshipper's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 154&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sushi#Inarizushi|Inari-zushi]], a Japanese sushi roll of packaged fried tofu, is another popular offering.  Fried tofu is believed to be a favorite food of Japanese foxes, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Priests do not normally offer these foods to the deity, but it is common for shops that line the approach to an Inari shrine to sell fried tofu for devotees to offer.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Fox statues are often offered to Inari shrines by worshippers, and on occasion a stuffed and mounted fox is presented to a temple.  At one time, some temples were home to live foxes that were venerated, but this is not current practice.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
Inari's traditional festival day was the first horse day (the sixth day) of the second month (''nigatsu no hatsuuma'') of the [[lunisolar calendar]].&lt;ref name="Smyers18"/&gt;

In some parts of [[Kyūshū]], a festival or praying period begins five days before the full moon in November; occasionally it is extended to a full week.  This is accompanied by bringing offerings of rice products to a shrine to Inari each day and receiving ''[[o-mamori]]'' (''[[amulet|protection charms]]''). &lt;!-- Commented out as citation can't be found: The festival is particularly popular{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} in the countryside near [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].--&gt;

Institutionalization of children with disabilities is the placement of children, who have been abandoned or whose parents cannot support them, into a facility which can be similar to an [[orphanage]]. This often occurs in countries where alternative methods of care are not available.&lt;ref name="Ceausescu's Legacy: Family Struggles and Institutionalization of Children in Romania"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Lynn|title=Ceausescu's Legacy: Family Struggles and Institutionalization of Children in Romania|journal=Journal of Family History|page=171|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of an institution can be ambiguous; the "Report of the Ad Hoc Expert Group on the Transition from Institutional to Community-based Care"&lt;ref name=" Ad Hoc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=3992&amp;langId=en |title=Report of the Ad Hoc Expert Group on the Transition from Institutional to Community-based Care |website=Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities |publisher=European Commission |access-date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  defines an institution based on the following guidelines:

==Soviet ideology of institutionalization==
In 1917, the [[Russian Revolution]] resulted in Soviet ideology that centered around the idea of creating a society free of anomalies{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. As such, children born with disabilities were considered "defective," and the "policy on "defectology" was developed through resolutions passed by the Council of Ministers of the USSR." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korkunov|first=Vladimir V.|author2=Alexander S. Nigayev |author3=Lynne D. Reynolds |author4=Janet W. Lerner |title=Special education in Russia: History, reality, and prospects.|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|date=March–April 1998|volume=31|issue=2|pages=186–192|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=81517d5d-ec14-40ea-8b1e-e8bdbe4ce5cb%40sessionmgr12&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=16&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=f5h&amp;AN=363857|accessdate=20 October 2013|doi=10.1177/002221949803100209}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to law, parents had to send their children to institutions, as familial care was viewed as inadequate for the upbringing of children with special needs; the state found it necessary to correct such disabilities, and the provision of necessary treatment was promised. Such policies were influenced by [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s Institute of Defectology, which was based on the idea that all children should be corrected to have normal functioning. If they were unable to participate and meet the requirements of "normal" standards when attending school, they were considered to be "uneducable" and were subject to a life of institutionalization, isolated  and segregated from the public. Schools did not have the flexibility to adjust to their needs. The establishment of social segregation was widely accepted, and a distinct separation between individuals with disabilities and the rest of society was part of everyday life in Russia. Early isolation of these individuals was not specific to the early years, as it continued unto adult life due to laws that grouped citizens with disabilities into one area of employment, further alienating them from society.&lt;ref name="Implementing the Right to Community Integration for Children with Disabilities in Russia: A Human Rights Framework for International Action"/&gt;

==Effects of institutionalization on children==
The 1998 report "''Findings and Recommendations of a UNICEF Sponsored Fact-finding Mission to the Russian Federation''" found instances of children left neglected and constricted with restraints, as well as cases of stereotypies, such as self-inflicted physical harm and rocking in Russian institutions.&lt;ref name="Desperate"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.disabilityworld.org/01-03_02/children/russia.shtml |title=The Desperate Situation of Children with Disabilities in Russian Institutions |last=Koloskov |first=Sergey |website=Disability World |publisher=Disability World |access-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also observed was the confinement of children to a bed-ridden state for hours and days and the segregation of older children into separate institutional classrooms, where they were subject to inadequate education. The report attributed such conditions to lack of necessary resources and overworked staff, who are unable to provide the necessary care to all children.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/1329_1215436717_id-85586.htm |title=Findings and Recommendations of a UNICEF Sponsored Fact-finding Mission to the Russian Federation 20th October through 6th November 1998 |date=November 1998 |website=Children in Russia's Institutions: Human Rights and Opportunities for Reform |publisher=Mental Disability Rights International |access-date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research related to institutional care has been conducted in various European countries and found that these types of environments lead to a plethora of negative consequences. The following are common effects:
* [[Developmental delay]] is prevalent due to the absence of physical stimulation and presence of daily neglect, as is motor skill delay, inadequate brain development, impairment in social and cognitive skills, and speech impediments. [[Attachment disorder]]s are also common, which lead to harmful self-inflicting actions. [[Enuresis]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[eating disorder]]s, as well as difficulty in forming healthy relationships have also been reported.&lt;ref name="Deinstitutionalisation"/&gt;{{rp|page=121}}&lt;ref name="Institutional "&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://p-ced.com/reference/Family_Matters_summary.pdf |title=A Study of Institutional Childcare in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union |website=Family Matters |publisher=Every Child |access-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* Delay in [[physical development]] occurs for a variety of reasons. Malnutrition, lack of immunization, improper feeding, and depression resulting from lack of emotional attention all contribute to physical [[growth delay]]s among children. Widespread infectious disease and problems with vision, hearing, low height and weight, along with [[microcephaly]] have been reported. While children may have correctable birth defects, surgery or necessary treatment is rarely provided.&lt;ref name="Institutional " /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laurie|title=Initial assessment of growth, development, and the effects of institutionalization in internationally adopted children|journal=pediatric annals|date=April 2000|pages=224–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Institutional abuse]] is widespread, leading to further physical and emotional damage. [[Sexual abuse]] also occurs, but the actual frequency is unknown.&lt;ref name="Deinstitutionalisation"/&gt;{{rp|page=121}}&lt;ref name="Institutional " /&gt;

==Current situation==
In 1993, the Russian constitution incorporated articles that included protection for children. The implementation of these articles were to be secured through various regulations, as well as the Federal Law on Basic Guarantees of the Rights of the Child, which was initiated on July 21, 1998 and incorporates the principles outlined in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref name="Russian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/russia.php |title=Children's Rights: Russian Federation |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these laws, services in Russia for children with disabilities reflect the attitudes established during the Soviet Era, as parents report that they are still encouraged to leave their children to institutional care. Recently, more families have ignored this advice and opt to care for their children even though some have had to follow the initial advice at a later time due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="Implementing the Right to Community Integration for Children with Disabilities in Russia: A Human Rights Framework for International Action"/&gt; Mothers also report facing general hostility from society when opting to take care of their children instead placing them in a government facility, and stigmas concerning disability are still prevalent in Russian society.&lt;ref name="'What the Future Will Bring I Do Not Know': Mothering Children with Disabilities in Russia and the Politics of Exclusion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iarskaia-Smirnova|first=Elena|title="What the Future Will Bring I Do Not Know": Mothering Children with Disabilities in Russia and the Politics of Exclusion|journal=A Journal of Women Studies|year=1999|volume=20|issue=2|jstor=3347014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government provisions===
When newborns to four-year-olds are abandoned by their parents for various reasons, they are taken to Baby Houses, which are under the regulation of the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health]]. Those that are four years of age are then evaluated to determine what institution they should be assigned. Institutions regulated by the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science]] house those deemed educable, and other children, determined to be uneducable, go to institutions which are supervised by the Ministry of Labor and Social Development. As adults, those categorized as uneducable transfer to an adult institution, where some facilities leave individuals to live in a bed-ridden state.&lt;ref name="Implementing the Right to Community Integration for Children with Disabilities in Russia: A Human Rights Framework for International Action"/&gt;

===Special education===
According to the [[Library of Congress]], about 1.6 million children in Russia need access to special education. Despite legal rulings that allow children to attend school and mandate that specialized education be available, most do not receive a public education. Advances, however, have been made to provide rehabilitation services according to disability.&lt;ref name="Russian" /&gt; Eight schools exist that serve individuals with the following disabilities: severe retardation, various ranges of blindness and deafness, as well as severe motor problems.&lt;ref name="Special education in Russia: Historical aspects"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malofeev|first=Nikolai|title=Special education in Russia: Historical aspects|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|year=1998|volume=31|issue=2|pages=181–185|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=9383aafc-7bf3-420e-8ca8-c0792d9936a4%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=f5h&amp;AN=363855|accessdate=20 October 2013|doi=10.1177/002221949803100208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Library of Congress]] reports that "In 2006, Russia had 1,373 boarding schools for 170,000 children with speech, hearing, and language pathology, vision impairment, mental retardation, skeletal diseases, and tuberculosis; and 1,946 day schools for 236,000 disabled students."&lt;ref name="Russian" /&gt; Primarily, though, children are placed into institutions at an early age. Since 1993, the Ministry of Education made a recommendation regarding the creation of the availability of classes for children with learning disabilities, but this sort of social change is still in progress.&lt;ref name="Special education in Russia: Historical aspects"/&gt;

==Initiatives==

===International proposed plans===
Several international bodies have created principles that uphold the rights of children with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Deinstitutionalisation"/&gt;{{rp|page=121}} In 2008, [[World Health Organization]]’s Better Health, Better Lives Initiative states that its goal is to: 
“[E]nsure that all children and young 
people with intellectual disabilities are fully 
participating members of society, living with 
their families, integrated in the community 
and receiving health care and support proportional to their needs."
The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] has created the following articles outlining the rights of children with disabilities, which also protect against institutionalization.  
*        equality and non-discrimination (art. 5);
*	 right to life (art. 10);
*	 equal recognition before the law (art.12);
*	 right to liberty and security (art. 14);
*	 freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (art. 15);
*	 freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse (art.16);
*	 respect for physical and mental integrity (art. 17);
*	 right to live independently and be included in the community (art. 19);
*	 respect for privacy (art. 22); and
*	 respect for home and the family (art. 23).&lt;ref name="Rights"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.europe.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Children_under_3__webversion.pdf |title=The Rights of Vulnerable Children Under the Age of Three: Ending their placement in institutional care |website=Europe Regional Office |publisher=United Nations: Human Rights-Office of the High Commissioner |access-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Concern related to the violation of the CRPD's articles led to a United Nations General Day of Discussion, which further led to the UN guidelines on the Alternative Care of children in 2009. Paragraph 22 states: "While recognizing that residential care facilities and family-based care complement each 
other in meeting the needs of children, where large residential care facilities (institutions) 
remain, alternatives should be developed in the context of an overall deinstitutionalization 
strategy, with precise goals and objectives, which will allow for their progressive elimination." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children|url=http://www.europe.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Children_under_3__webversion.pdf|work=General Assembly|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In order to adhere to the guidelines and end the practice of institutionalization, the Europe Regional Office branch of the United Nations Human Rights created a set of suggested solutions in their report "The Rights of Vulnerable Children Under the Age of Three: Ending their placement in institutional care". 
These solutions include:
*Resources for families, such as community support, education, healthcare, and appropriate levels of preventative, supportive, or rehabilitative service according to need.&lt;ref name="Rights" /&gt;  
*Economic aid to help with additional costs associated with providing adequate care for children with disabilities. This aid can be in the form of grants, social pensions, or any other form of financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Rights" /&gt; 
*Appropriate care options if families are unwilling to keep the child. Such facilities must provide support, education, and integrated services. In circumstances where parents are willing but unable to take care of the child, there should be the opportunity for children to have as much interaction with their parents as possible.&lt;ref name="Rights" /&gt;

===Russian government===
The United States [[Library of Congress]] reports that "[u]ntil 1979, disabled children were not legally recognized in the Soviet Union because disability was defined as an inability to perform professional functions due to a sickness or trauma."&lt;ref name="Russian" /&gt; As a result, no benefits were given to persons with disabilities. On December 14, 1979, children under the age of sixteen were able to obtain health benefits if they had a certain disease, as outlined by the Ministry of Health Care Regulation No. 1265.&lt;ref name="Russian" /&gt;  The ratification of the 1993 Russian Constitution initiated advancements in human rights for all by outlining guidelines that guarantee all individuals freedoms. While institutionalization is still widespread, when children are to be assessed according to their abilities, the parents are ensured certain guarantees. Parents must be informed of the evaluation and they must agree with the determined institution before the child is relocated. The adequate placement of children into proper institutions may not be accurate, as necessary resources are sometimes unavailable.&lt;ref name="Russian" /&gt;

===United States adoption===
In  a 2005 study of 105 "Postinstitutionalized Children of Intercountry Adoption" more than half of them adopted in the United States were from China and Russia. The children from Eastern Europe initially "exhibited 1 month of delayed growth for every 5 months they had spent institutionalized. They also demonstrated delayed fine motor (82%), gross motor (70%), language (59%), and social–emotional (53%) skills. &lt;ref name="A Few New Children: Postinstitutionalized Children of Intercountry Adoption"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meese|first=Ruth|title=A Few New Children: Postinstitutionalized Children of Intercountry Adoption|journal=The Journal of Special Education|date=September 2005|volume=39|issue=3|page=162|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=08e633b5-8989-4cfc-832b-9aa076194a0b%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=107| accessdate=5 November 2013| doi=10.1177/00224669050390030301}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In post-adoption analysis, the study found that 60.4% of adopting parents reported "no continuing medical or developmental difficulties for their children." While this study reported findings collected from 105 children, its authors stated that much more information must be gathered to assess the changes adoption makes in the development and growth of children who have been institutionalized previously.&lt;ref name="A Few New Children: Postinstitutionalized Children of Intercountry Adoption"/&gt;

'''Jean Maria Arrigo''' is an American [[social psychologist]] and [[oral historian]].

Arrigo was a member of a 2005 [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) task force evaluating the role of psychologists in U.S. intelligence and military interrogations of [[detainees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2007/8/20/apa_interrogation_task_force_member_dr APA Interrogation Task Force Member Dr. Jean Maria Arrigo Exposes Group's Ties to Military]. ’’Democracy Now!’’. 20 Aug 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
She became known for exposing conflicts of interest of most of the others on the nominally independent task force, who were allied in advance with advocates of harsh interrogation methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethicalpsychology.org/about/arrigo.php Jean Maria Arrigo] at Coalition for an Ethical Psychology site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Ackerman.

Hayashi was born in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and spent the years from 1931-1945 with her family in [[Shanghai]]. She returned to Nagasaki in March 1945 and enrolled in Nagasaki Girls' High School, where she was mobilized in the [[Mitsubishi]] Munitions Factory. She was working at the factory when the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb blast]] destroyed Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. Hayashi was seriously ill for two months, and suffered afterwards from fragile health. She later studied nursing in a special course the Welfare Faculty for Women attached to [[Nagasaki Medical School]], but left before graduation. She started to write in 1962.

In 1967, her story "Procession on a Cloudy Day" (''Kumoribi no kōshin'') was published in Bungei Shuto. She first drew wide attention in 1975 with an autobiographical story about the bombing, "Ritual of Death" (''Matsuri no ba''), which received that year's [[Akutagawa Prize]]. "Two Grave Markers" (''Futari No Bohyō''), also based on her experiences in the bombing, was published that same year. Her works in the 1970s also include a collection of twelve short stories titled ''Gyaman bi-doro'' (Cut glass, blown glass), containing "The Empty Can" (''Aki kan'') and "Yellow Sand" (''Kousa''), both first published in 1978.

In 1980, Hayashi published her first full-length novel, ''Naki ga gotoki'' (As if nothing had happened), with a semi-autobiographical lead character. The Nagasaki theme continued through the 1980s with her collections ''Sangai no ie'' (Home in the three worlds), which won the [[Kawabata Prize]], and ''Michi'' (The Path). Her work ''Yasurakani ima wa nemuri tamae'' won the 1990 [[Tanizaki Prize]].

Hayashi lived near [[Washington, D.C.]], from 1985 to 1988.

Mandated by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) standard 24 CFR Part 1330 (a) (4),  '''Lead-Safe Work Practices''' provide those performing remodeling tasks in homes built before 1978 with guidelines on procedures they should be using to prevent creating a [[lead]] hazard.

[[Lead poisoning]] remains a major environmental health concern, and while we most often associate the disease with childhood, high levels of lead exposure are linked to serious adult health conditions, such as high blood pressure and dementia.

Workers who remodel or renovate older homes where the likelihood of [[lead paint]] is high are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure. Their work creates contaminated dust which they then inhale. They can also put their families at risk by bringing contaminated dust home on their work clothes.

The [[National Safety Council]] emphasizes that everyone should be aware of the potential presence of lead paint in homes built prior to 1978, and notes that…”such awareness is particularly important for those engaged in the building trades, as well as [[DIY|do-it-yourselfers]], to learn how to perform their work in a lead-safe manner.”

Effective April 22, 2010, under its Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule, the EPA mandates that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in pre-1978 homes, child care facilities, and schools be certified by the EPA and that they use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices. Individuals can become certified renovators by taking an approved training course.

Anyone performing RRP projects in pre-1978 homes and child-occupied facilities, must learn how to use lead-safe work practices and follow these three simple procedures:

*Contain the work area.
*Minimize dust.
*Clean up thoroughly.

'''Masonic Medical Research Laboratory''' is a research organization founded by the [[Grand Lodge of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://romesentinel.com/health/every-heartbeat-counts-celebration-raises-85-000/QBqnjw!41SKu4oRv6gnnh8mJdWYw/ "Every Heartbeat Counts celebration raises $85,000"]. ''Rome Sentinel'', Oct 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The LABORATORY studies experimental cardiology with an emphasis on cardiac arrhythmias, [[ischemic heart disease]] and [[sudden cardiac death]].

== History ==

The MMRL was established in 1958, sponsored by the [[Grand Lodge of New York]], for the purpose of general research in cardiology.&lt;ref name="Tabbert2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Tabbert|title=American Freemasons: Three Centuries of Building Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNO3AAAAIAAJ|date=15 June 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-8292-7|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the MMRL was engaged in research into cardiac [[electrophysiology]], blood substitutes, vision, muscular dystrophy, [[hypertension]] and geriatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New International Year Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaQYAAAAIAAJ|year=1956|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution has been administered by Directors of Research since its inception, Dr. Murray Steele, Dr. Gordon K. Moe &lt;ref&gt;[http://romesentinel.com/health/cardiac-researcher-lectures-in-china/QBqneE!tYVfzwzyZ7i8vw7lNonInA/ "Cardiac researcher lectures in China"]. ''Rome Sentinel'', Jun 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nature&gt;Misha Angrist, Subhashini Chandrasekharan, Christopher Heaney and Robert Cook-Deegan. [http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v12/n1s/full/gim2010145a.html "Impact of gene patents and licensing practices on access to genetic testing for long QT syndrome"]. ''Genetics in Medicine'' (2010) 12, S111–S154; doi:10.1097/GIM.0b013e3181d68293&lt;/ref&gt;.

MMRL established the Cardiac Research Institute, a scientific and medical research center focused on developing strategies to combat heart disease, including new heart medications and  diagnostic procedures for the management of [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s.  Its researchers have studied the mechanisms underlying sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmia syndromes and have evaluated approaches to therapy. The institute also houses a genetic screening center for families afflicted with [[sudden death syndrome]]s.

IN 2009, the MMRL initiated a stem cell research program.

In 2013 the institute's staff consisted of about 40 researchers and administrators and its budget was about $4.5 million. It received financial support from the Grand Lodges of New York, Florida, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Delaware; and a, derived from individual donations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://madisoncountycourier.com/?p=59252 "Every Heartbeat Counts Celebration a Success"]. ''Madison County Courier''.&lt;/ref&gt; It also received corporate grants, research grants from the [[National Institutes of Health]], as well as partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

==Current research programs ==

* Cardiac Electrophysiology – This program uses experimental models to examine the root cause of cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) and to develop treatments for heart disease. 
* Molecular Genetics – Using [[Whole genome sequencing|genetic sequencing]] techniques, scientists at the MMRL are studying [[inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes]], including sudden cardiac death syndromes such as the [[Long QT syndrome]], [[Short QT syndrome]], [[Brugada syndrome]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/784893 "Brugada syndrome delved into in the New York Times"]. ''Medscape'', Michael O'Riordan February 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inborn Genetic Diseases: Advances in Research and Treatment: 2011 Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxH1rm9c6IQC&amp;pg=PA1|date=9 January 2012|publisher=ScholarlyEditions|isbn=978-1-4649-2829-1|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Early Repolarization syndrome. 
* Molecular Biology – Genes suspected of causing [[genetic mutation]]s are cloned and the mutation is inserted into a [[heterologous]] [[expression system]] so that the functional effect of the mutation can be evaluated, to further determine whether the genetic variant is the true cause of the disease. 
* Stem Cell Research – This program is focused on generating [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] to be used in testing the safety and efficacy of new drugs, and also for the creation of human models of heart disease to improve understanding of arrhythmic syndromes and to custom design treatments and cures. 
* Organ and Tissue Bioengineering – This is a long term program studying the use of a combination of pluripotent stem cells and [[decellularization|decellularized]] donor hearts to created human hearts for transplantation without the problem of [[Transplant rejection|rejection]].

== Past scientific research results ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In 1960 researchers at MMRL developed a mathematical model for use in the study of [[atrial fibrillation]].  In 1966 they demonstrated dual pathways in the [[AV node]] and showed the basis for AV nodal [[tachycardia]].

In 1973 Institute researchers showed that [[oscillatory]] afterpotentials (delayed afterdepolarizations) was the basis for arrhythmias associated with [[digitalis]] [[toxicity]]. Over the next several years later they explored modulated [[parasystole]] and reflection as mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias.

In the 1980s research staff worked to clarify the differences between [[epicardium]] and [[endocardium]], and found that the presence of an [[action potential]] notch in epicardium, but not endocardium, is responsible for inscription of the electrocardiographic J wave.  They found differences in the response of epicardium and endocardium to a variety of drugs and [[neurotransmitters]].

The MMRL developed a blood substitute which was patented in 1990.

In the 1990s MMRL researchers discovered the [[Microfold cell|M cell]], confirming that the heart is made of several different cell types.&lt;!--, and leading to improvements in the design and effectiveness of the [[Automatic External Defibrillator]], [[Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator]] and [[Pacemaker]]. (commenting out until an independent source says this--&gt; In 1998 they uncovered the cellular basis for the various waves that appear on an [[electrocardiogram]] including the J, T and U waves.

Between 1996 and 1998 MMRL published the first gene, SCN5A, to be linked to [[idiopathic ventricular fibrillation]] (IVF).  The MMRL named this the Brugada syndrome in 1996, after Josep and Pedro Brugada, who first described this as a new clinical entity in 1992, and in 1999 proposed use of [[quinidine]] and [[isoproterenol]] for its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/10/science/out-of-the-blue-a-lightning-bolt-to-the-heart.html?_r=0 "Out of the Blue, a Lightning Bolt to the Heart"]. ''International New York Times'', By SANDEEP JAUHAR, FEB. 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the MMRL research team uncovered evidence linking [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] to a congenital heart defect, the Long QT syndrome (LQTS) published in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]]. That year they also found experimental evidence, confirmed by later research,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} that some forms of early repolarization could result in the development of life-threatening arrhythmias.

During the next few years MMRL discovered several genes that when mutated give rise to the Long QT, Short QT, Brugada and Early Repolarization syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imjournal.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/news.detail/item/317 "Brain Sodium Channels in Heart Linked to Sudden Cardiac Death"]. ''Integrative Medicine'', July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They later demonstrated that, [[ranolazine]] (Ranexa), a drug approved for ischemic heart disease, was capable of suppressing both [[atrial]] and ventricular arrhythmias.

In 2007 MMRL researchers studied atrial-selective [[sodium channel]] block as a strategy to manage atrial fibrillation.  They later demonstrated that the combination of ranolazine (Ranexa) and [[dronedarone]] (Multaq) could prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, which led to Phase 2 [[clinical trials]].

In 2010 MMRL described “J Wave Syndromes” a subset of inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes characterized by accentuated J waves, including the Brugada and Early Repolarization syndromes. Soon after, the research team identified Wenxin Keli, a herbal Chinese medicine, as an atrial selective sodium channel blocker capable of suppressing atrial fibrillation in experimental models. In 2012  they also identified Wenxin Keli and [[Milrinone]] as potential pharmacological therapies for the Brugada syndrome.

=== Education and training ===

The MMRL offers a [[Postdoctoral]] Fellowship Program as well as a Predoctoral Research Training Program which is administered in affiliation with [[SUNY Upstate Medical University]] at Syracuse, New York.  Its ten-week Summer Fellowship Program, initiated in 1960, provides hands-on experience in research to students in the life sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timestelegram.com/news/20160801/masonic-fellowship-program-offers-real-world-experience "Masonic fellowship program offers real-world experience"]. ''Times Telegram'', Aug. 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  NNRL also operates Mentoring Programs with [[BOCES]], tours and shadowing programs to provide information to high school students about careers in science and research.

'''Medical debt''' refers to debt incurred by individuals due to [[health care costs]] and related expenses.

Medical debt is different from other forms of debt, because it is usually incurred accidentally or faultlessly. People do not plan to fall ill or hurt themselves, and health care remedies are often unavoidable; medical debt is often treated with more sympathy than other kinds of debt resulting in advice that people ought not try to convert it to [[credit card debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/health/25patient.html?_r=1 |title= When Medical Bills Outpace Your Means, Seize Control Swiftly |work= [[The New York Times]] |first= Lesley |last= Alderman |date= June 5, 2009 |access-date= June 22, 2009}}

==United States==
[[File:Medical debt in USA. National Health Interview Survey.gif|thumb|Percentages of persons in families with selected financial burdens of medical care: United States, January–June 2011. From [[National Health Interview Survey]].]]
Medical debt is an especially notable  phenomenon in the [[United States]]. In less developed nations those on low income in need of treatment will often avail themselves of what ever help they can from either the state or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] without going into debt, and in most developed countries public coverage of healthcare costs are comprehensive.  But in the USA, even when the patient has insurance coverage, including coverage under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010, considerable medical costs remain the patient's responsibility. Consequently, medical debt has been found by a 2009 study to be the primary cause of personal [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name = "CBS"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/05/earlyshow/health/main5064981.shtml |title= Medical Debt Huge Bankruptcy Culprit—Study: It's Behind Six-In-Ten Personal Filings |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= June 5, 2009 |access-date= June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Himmelstein |first1= David U. |last2= Thorne |first2= Deborah |last3= Warren |first3= Elizabeth |last4= Woolhandler |first4= Steffie |title= Medical Bankruptcy in the United States, 2007: Results of a National Study |doi= 10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.04.012 |journal= The American Journal of Medicine |volume= 122 |issue= 8 |pages= 741–746 |date= August 2009 |pmid=  19501347 |pmc=  |issn= 0002-9343 |oclc= 1480156}} See [http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2809%2900404-5/fulltext full text].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 survey had found about 70 million Americans either have difficulty paying for medical treatment or have medical debt.&lt;ref name = "reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN1932186920080820 |title= Consumers Face Rising Medical debt: Survey |publisher= [[Reuters]] |first= Susan |last= Heavey |date= August 20, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies have found people are most likely to accumulate large medical debts when they do not have [[health insurance]] to cover the costs of necessary [[medication]]s, treatments, or procedures—in 2009 about 50 million Americans had no health coverage.&lt;ref name = "CBS"/&gt;   However, about 60% of those found to have medical debt were insured.&lt;ref name = "reuters"/&gt;
Health insurance plans rarely cover any and all health-related expenses; for insured people, the gap between insurance coverage and the affordability of health care manifests as medical debt. As with any type of debt, medical debt can lead to an array of personal and financial problems—including having to go without food and heat plus a reluctance to seek further medical treatment.&lt;ref name = "reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Debt and Foregone Medical Care |journal= Journal of Health and Social Behavior |first1= Lucie |last1= Kalousova |first2= Sarah A. |last2= Burgard |date= June 2013 &lt;!-- |access-date= May 17, 2013--&gt; |pmid= 23620501 |doi= 10.1177/0022146513483772 |volume= 54 |issue= 2 |pages= 204–20 |issn= 2150-6000 |oclc= 38543580}} &lt;/ref&gt;
Aggressive debt collecting has been highlighted as an aggravating factor.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |title= Medical Debt and Aggressive Debt Restitution Practices: Predatory Billing Among the Urban Poor |journal= Journal of General Internal Medicine |first1= Thomas P. |last1= O'Teele |first2= Jose J. |last2= Arbelaes |first3= Robert S. |last3= Lawrence |author4= Baltimore Community Health Consortium |volume= 19 |issue= 7 |pages= 772–778 |date= July 2004 |issn= 1525-1497 |doi= 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30099.x &lt;!--|access-date= June 22, 2009--&gt; |pmid= 15209592 |pmc= 1492479 |oclc= 41390549}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study has found about 63% of adults with medical debt avoided further medical treatment, compared with only 19% of adults who had no such debt.&lt;ref name = "workingAge"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/20/16 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20051127091905/http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/20/16 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= November 27, 2005 |title= Working-Age Americans Bear Brunt of Medical Debt

According to a study conducted in 2012 by [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] that among indebted households 62% cited out-of-pocket medical expenses as a contribution to their debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.demos.org/discredited-how-employment-credit-checks-keep-qualified-workers-out-job |title= How Employment Credit Checks Keep Qualified Workers Out of a Job |access-date= October 3, 2013 |publisher= Demos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical debt in bankruptcy==

Medical debt is considered as a non-priority unsecured debt in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In other words, medical debts are paid only after assets are applied to the debt of creditors who hold priority debt, and thus medical debts are often discharged in their entirety at the conclusion of the bankruptcy process. If the bankrupt estate has sufficient assets such that a part of the medical debt is repaid through bankruptcy, any remaining outstanding medical debt that is included in the bankruptcy case will be discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Chapter 7 Bankruptcy|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/chapter_7_bankruptcy.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Health and Welfare''' ('''MOHW'''; {{zh|c=衛生福利部|p=Wèishēng Fúlì Bù|poj=Ōe-seng Hok-lī Pō͘}}) is the [[Executive Yuan]] ministry responsible for the administration of the public health system, social welfare, affordable and [[universal health care]], hospitals, pharmaceutical, immunization programs, disease prevention, supervision and coordination of local health agencies in the Republic of China [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mohw.gov.tw/EN/Ministry/DM2_P.aspx?f_list_no=476&amp;fod_list_no=0&amp;doc_no=263&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Headquarters of Department of Health, Executive Yuan 20101004.jpg|thumb|Former Ministry of Health and Welfare building in [[Taipei]] (until 2014).]]

The ministry was originally established on 17 March 1971 as the '''Department of Health''' ('''DOH'''; {{zh|c=衛生署|p=Wèishēng Shǔ|poj=Ōe-seng Sú}}). The department was upgraded to '''Ministry of Health and Welfare''' on 23 July 2013 with the addition from the agencies in the [[Ministry of the Interior (Republic of China)|Ministry of the Interior]] responsible for social welfare following restructuring of the Executive Yuan.

The original building of the MOHW was located at [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong District]], [[Taipei]] when it was still named the Department of Health and being renamed Ministry of Health and Welfare. The [[Executive Yuan]] approved the construction for the new building of the then Department of Health in 2007 at [[Nangang District, Taipei|Nangang District]], Taipei. After years of planning and construction, the building was finally completed in May 2014. On 18 June 2014, the opening ceremony of the new MOHW building was attended by President [[Ma Ying-jeou]], legislators, and representatives from various government agencies and related organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mohw.gov.tw/EN/Ministry/DM1_P.aspx?f_list_no=378&amp;fod_list_no=4999&amp;doc_no=45291&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohalla Clinics''' are [[Primary Health Centre (India)|primary health centres]] in the state of [[New Delhi]] in [[India]], that offer a basic package of essential [[Health care|health services]] including medicines, diagnostics, and consultation free of cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Dinesh C|date=2016-12-10|title=Delhi looks to expand community clinic initiative|url=http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32513-2/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=388|issue=10062|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32513-2|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohalla in [[Hindi]] means neighborhood or community.

According to the [[World Health Organization]] data for the year 2015, more than 65% of the population in India paid for health from their own pockets. [[The Hindu]], meanwhile reported in 2017 that only 17% of people in the country have [[Health insurance in India|health insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.GHEDOOPSCHESHA2011?lang=en|title=Out-of-pocket expenditure as percentage of current health expenditure |website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/only-17-have-health-insurance-cover/article6713952.ece|title=Only 17% have health insurance cover|last=Mehra|first=Puja|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with one of the largest [[Out-of-pocket expense|out-of-pocket]] health expenditures and least coverage of health insurance in the world, the free health services offered by Mohalla Clinics helps to reduce the financial burden on [[Poverty|low-income]] households by saving travel costs and lost wages.

In December 2017, India's renowned [[cardiac surgeon]] and founder of [[Narayana Health]], [[Devi Shetty| Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty]], visited a mohalla clinic in Todapur, Delhi. He was amazed by the healthcare facilities provided to the general public by the Delhi Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/pti-news/2017/dec/19/cardiac-surgeon-devi-shetty-visits-mohalla-clinic-in-todapur-1731903.html|title=Cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty visits Mohalla Clinic in Todapur|work=New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Delhi Chief Minister [[Arvind Kejriwal]], in the capacity as chair of [[The Elders (organization)|The Elders]], an international non-governmental organisation of independent global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, and former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]] commended Mohalla Clinic project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kofi-annan-lauds-aap-s-mohalla-clinics-project-suggests-reforms/story-UMTbFhQ1KY9tyaExxHS3kK.html|title=Kofi Annan lauds AAP’s Mohalla Clinics project, suggests reforms|work=HindustanTimes|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The praise for the mohalla clinic project also came from the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] at the Prince Mahidol Award Conference at Bangkok, Thailand after a presentation by Delhi health minister [[Satyendra Kumar Jain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-kofi-annan-former-norway-pm-praises-aap-govt-s-mohalla-clinics/story-PErXELux8KNYtyT7wLQ4uM.html|title=After Kofi Annan, another world leader praises AAP govt’s mohalla clinics|work=HindustanTimes|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Straits Times]], an English-language daily broadsheet newspaper based in [[Singapore]] finds Mohalla Clinics to be high-tech where results of most of the tests are known within two minutes and are uploaded onto an IT cloud for access by patients and their doctors on their smartphones and the clinic's tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/sick-throng-indian-capitals-new-high-tech-clinics|title=Sick throng Indian capital's new, high-tech clinics|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in a report published by [[The Washington Post]], it suggests "It may well be time for America to build mohalla clinics in its cities". The report also features Swasthya Slate, a $600 medical device for instant diagnosis developed by Kanav Kahol, a biomedical engineer and researcher at [[Arizona State University]]’s department of biomedical informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/03/11/what-new-delhis-free-clinics-can-teach-america-about-fixing-its-broken-health-care-system/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.925a8dbe8b9c|title=What New Delhi’s free clinics can teach America about fixing its broken health care system|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5516">The '''Physician Quality Reporting System''' (PQRS), formerly known as the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI), is a health care quality improvement incentive program initiated by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) in the [[United States]] in 2006.  It is an example of a [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|"pay for performance"]] program which rewards providers financially for reporting healthcare quality data to CMS.

==Background==
PQRS developed from several pieces of Congressional legislation. In 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act (TRHCA) included a provision for a 1.5% incentive payment to eligible providers who successfully submitted quality data to CMS.  This provision included a cap on payments.  The 2007 Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act extended the program through 2008 and 2009.  It also removed the TRHCA payment cap. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act made PQRS permanent in 2008 and increased the incentive payment to 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anumula|first1=N.|last2=Sanelli|first2=P.C.|title=Physician Quality Reporting System|journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology|volume=32|issue=11|pages=2000|date=2011-11-17|doi=10.3174/ajnr.A2912|pmid=22095966|url=http://www.ajnr.org/content/32/11/2000.full|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially only an incentive program, in 2010 the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) introduced penalties for providers who do not submit qualifying PQRS data. Penalties increase annually according to a schedule and begin two years after the reporting period.&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beck|first1=Melinda|title=Medicare-Provider Penalties, Incentives Detailed in Report|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-provider-penalties-incentives-detailed-in-report-1430089439|accessdate=2015-08-04|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calendar year 2014 was the last year for a PQRS incentive. There is no incentive payment for 2015 PQRS reporting. Beyond 2015, there is potential to obtain an incentive under the Physician Value Based Payment Modifier (VM) program.

==Definition and implementation==

===Measure definition===
In 2015 CMS identified 254 quality measures for which providers may choose to submit data.  The measures map to U.S. [[National Quality Standard]] (NQS) health care quality domains:&lt;ref name=cms&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS): Implementation Guide|url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/Downloads/2015_PQRS_ImplementationGuide.pdf|website=CMS.gov|publisher=CMS|accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communication and Care Coordination
* [[Population health | Community/Population Health]]
* Effective Clinical Care
* Efficiency and Cost Reduction
* [[Patient Safety]]
* Person and Caregiver-Centered Experiences and Outcomes

The requirements for eligibility become more complex over time.  For example, in 2013 providers had to submit data on one out of the total possible measures to comply with PQRS; in 2015, they have to submit data on nine of the measures.&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;

===Eligible providers===
Because PQRS is a Medicare-based incentive program, only providers who care for patients with Medicare insurance must participate in PQRS.  As of 2015, CMS included the following health care practitioners under eligible providers:&lt;ref name=cms /&gt;

* Medicare providers (Physicians (Doctors of [[Doctor of Medicine | Medicine]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|Osteopathic Medicine]]), [[Podiatrist|Podiatry]], [[Optometry]], Oral Surgery, [[Dental degree|Dentistry]], and [[Chiropractor|Chiropractic]])
* Practitioners ([[Physician Assistant]], [[Nurse Practitioner]], [[Clinical Nurse Specialist]], [[Nurse anesthetist | Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist]] and Anesthesiologist Assistant, [[Midwifery | Certified Nurse Midwife]], [[Social Work | Clinical Social Worker]], [[Clinical pathology| Clinical Psychologist]], [[Dietitian | Registered Dietitian]], Nutrition Professional, [[Audiologist]])
* Therapists ([[Physical Therapist]], [[Occupational Therapist]], [[Speech-language pathology | Qualified Speech-Language Therapist]])

Eligible providers may elect to participate in PQRS as an individual provider or as a group practice.&lt;ref name=cms /&gt;

===Reporting process===
CMS allows providers to submit PQRS data through several electronic methods, including claims-based reporting, registry-based reporting from a qualified registry, direct submission from an [[electronic health record]] or other IT system vendor, and Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) web interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surgeon’s Guide to Understanding the Physician Quality Reporting System|url=https://www.facs.org/~/media/files/advocacy/pqrs/pqrsresources.ashx|website=www.facs.org|publisher=American College of Surgeons|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
CMS reported that out of 1.25 million eligible providers, 460,000 (almost 40%) did not submit PQRS data in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available (as of 2015). Those providers will lose 1.5% in total reimbursements for CMS patients over the next year, while the 642,000 providers who met PQRS criteria will receive a 0.5% increase in CMS reimbursements.  CMS also reported that overall participation grew from 15% in 2007.&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;

A '''picture archiving and communication system''' ('''PACS''') is a [[medical imaging]] technology which provides economical storage and convenient access to images from multiple modalities (source machine types).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Choplin R | year = 1992 | title = Picture archiving and communication systems: an overview | url = | journal = Radiographics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 127–129 | doi=10.1148/radiographics.12.1.1734458}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital image|Electronic images]] and reports are transmitted digitally via PACS; this eliminates the need to manually file, retrieve, or transport film jackets, the folders used to store and protect [[X-ray]] film. The universal format for PACS image storage and transfer is [[DICOM|DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)]]. Non-image data, such as [[image scanner|scanned]] documents, may be incorporated using consumer industry standard formats like [[Portable Document Format|PDF (Portable Document Format)]], once encapsulated in DICOM. A PACS consists of four major components: The imaging modalities such as X-ray plain film (PF), [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), a secured [[computer network|network]] for the transmission of patient information, [[workstation]]s for interpreting and reviewing images, and archives for the [[computer data storage|storage]] and retrieval of images and reports. Combined with available and emerging [[World Wide Web|web]] technology, PACS has the ability to deliver timely and efficient access to images, interpretations, and related data. PACS reduces the physical and time barriers associated with traditional [[photographic film|film-based]] image retrieval, distribution, and display.

==Types of images==
Most PACSs handle images from various medical imaging instruments, including [[ultrasonography|ultrasound (US)]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance (MR)]], [[Nuclear Medicine]] imaging, [[positron emission tomography|positron emission tomography (PET)]], [[computed tomography|computed tomography (CT)]], [[endoscopy|endoscopy (ES)]], [[mammography|mammograms (MG)]], [[digital radiography|digital radiography (DR)]], [[phosphor plate radiography]], [[Histopathology]], ophthalmology, etc.  Additional types of image formats are always being added.  Clinical areas beyond radiology; cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, and even the laboratory are creating medical images that can be incorporated into PACS.  (see [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine#Application areas|DICOM Application areas]]).

==Uses==
PACS has four main uses:
*Hard copy replacement: PACS replaces [[Hard copy|hard-copy]] based means of managing medical images, such as film archives. With the decreasing price of digital storage, PACSs provide a growing cost and space advantage over film archives in addition to the instant access to prior images at the same institution. Digital copies are referred to as Soft-copy.
* Remote access: It expands on the possibilities of conventional systems by providing capabilities of off-site viewing and reporting ([[distance education]], [[telediagnosis]]). It enables practitioners in different physical locations to access the same information simultaneously for [[teleradiology]].
* Electronic image integration platform: PACS provides the electronic platform for radiology images interfacing with other medical automation systems such as [[Hospital Information System]] (HIS), [[Electronic Medical Record]] (EMR), [[Medical practice management software|Practice Management Software]], and [[Radiology Information System]] (RIS).
* Radiology Workflow Management: PACS is used by radiology personnel to manage the workflow of patient exams.

PACS is offered by virtually all the major medical imaging equipment manufacturers, medical IT companies and many independent software companies. Basic PACS software can be found free on the Internet.

==Architecture==
[[Image:workflow diagram.png|thumb|alt=PACS workflow diagram.|PACS workflow diagram]]
The architecture is the physical implementation of required functionality, or what one sees from the outside. There are different views, depending on the user. A radiologist typically sees a viewing station, a technologist a QA workstation, while a PACS administrator might spend most of their time in the climate-controlled computer room. The composite view is rather different for the various vendors.&lt;ref name="Oosterwijk, Herman 2004"&gt;Oosterwijk, Herman. PACS Fundamentals. Aubrey: OTech Inc, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-9718867-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically a PACS consists of a multitude of devices. The first step in typical PACS systems is the modality. Modalities are typically computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Depending on the facility's workflow most modalities send to a quality assurance (QA) workstation or sometimes called a PACS gateway. The QA workstation is a checkpoint to make sure patient demographics are correct as well as other important attributes of a study. If the study information is correct the images are passed to the archive for storage. The  central storage device (archive) stores images and in some cases reports, measurements and other information that resides with the images. The next step in the PACS workflow is the reading workstations. The reading workstation is where the radiologist reviews the patient's study and formulates their diagnosis. Normally tied to the reading workstation is a reporting package that assists the radiologist with dictating the final report. Reporting software is optional and there are various ways in which doctors prefer to dictate their report.  Ancillary to the workflow mentioned, there is normally CD/DVD authoring software used to burn patient studies for distribution to patients or referring physicians. The diagram above shows a typical workflow in most imaging centers and hospitals.  Note that this section does not cover integration to a Radiology Information System, Hospital Information System and other such front-end system that relates to the PACS workflow.

More and more PACS include web-based interfaces to utilize the internet or a [[Wide Area Network]] as their means of communication, usually via [[VPN]] (Virtual Private Network) or [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] (Secure Sockets Layer). The clients side software may use [[ActiveX]], [[JavaScript]] and/or a [[Java Applet]]. More robust PACS clients are full applications which can utilize the full resources of the computer they are executing on and are unaffected by the frequent unattended [[Web Browser]] and Java updates. As the need for distribution of images and reports becomes more widespread there is a push for PACS systems to support DICOM part 18 of the DICOM standard.  Web Access to DICOM Objects (WADO) creates the necessary standard to expose images and reports over the web through truly portable medium.  Without stepping outside the focus of the PACS architecture, WADO becomes the solution to cross platform capability and can increase the distribution of images and reports to referring physicians and patients.

PACS image backup is a critical, but sometimes overlooked, part of the PACS Architecture (see below). [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] requires that backup copies of patient images be made in case of image loss from the PACS. There are several methods of backing up the images, but they typically involve automatically sending copies of the images to a separate computer for storage, preferably off-site.

==Querying (C-FIND) and Image (Instance) Retrieval (C-MOVE and C-GET)==
The communication with the PACS server is done through DICOM messages that are similar to DICOM image "headers", but with different attributes. A query (C-FIND) is performed as follows:

*The client establishes the network connection to the PACS server.
*The client prepares a C-FIND request message which is a list of DICOM attributes.
*The client fills in the C-FIND request message with the keys that should be matched. E.g. to query for a patient ID, the patient ID attribute is filled with the patient's ID.
*The client creates empty (zero length) attributes for all the attributes it wishes to receive from the server. E.g. if the client wishes to receive an ID that it can use to receive images (see image retrieval) it should include a zero-length SOPInstanceUID (0008,0018) attribute in the C-FIND request messages.
*The C-FIND request message is sent to the server.
*The server sends back to the client a list of C-FIND response messages, each of which is also a list of DICOM attributes, populated with values for each match.
*The client extracts the attributes that are of interest from the response messages objects.

Images (and other composite instances like Presentation States and Structured Reports) are then retrieved from a PACS server through either a C-MOVE or C-GET request, using the DICOM network protocol. Retrieval can be performed at the Study, Series or Image (instance) level. The C-MOVE request specifies where the retrieved instances should be sent (using separate C-STORE messages on one or more separate connections) with an identifier known as the destination Application Entity Title (AE Title). For a C-MOVE to work, the server must be configured with mapping of the AE Title to a TCP/IP address and port, and as a consequence the server must know in advance all the AE Titles that it will ever be requested to send images to. A C-GET, on the other hand, performs the C-STORE operations on the same connection as the request, and hence does not require that the "server" know the "client" TCP/IP address and port, and hence also works more easily through firewalls and with network address translation, environments in which the incoming TCP C-STORE connections required for C-MOVE may not get through. The difference between C-MOVE and C-GET is somewhat analogous to the difference between active and passive FTP. C-MOVE is most commonly used within enterprises and facilities, whereas C-GET is more practical between enterprises.

In addition to the traditional DICOM network services, particularly for cross-enterprise use, DICOM (and IHE) define other retrieval mechanisms, including WADO, WADO-WS and most recently WADO-RS.

==Image archival and backup==
[[File:PACS-Server and Archive.jpg|thumb|PACS-Server with 35-terabyte RAID Archive and high speed fiber optic switch]]
Digital medical images are typically stored locally on a PACS for retrieval. It is important (and required in the United States by the Security Rule's Administrative Safeguards section of [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]]) that facilities have a means of recovering images in the event of an error or disaster.
While each facility is different, the goal in image back-up is to make it automatic and as easy to administer as possible. The hope is that the copies won't be needed; however, [[disaster recovery]] and [[business continuity]] planning dictates that plans should include maintaining copies of data even when an entire site is temporarily or permanently lost. 

Ideally, copies of images should maintained in several locations, including off-site to provide disaster recovery capabilities.  In general, PACS data is no different than other business critical data and should be protected with multiple copies at multiple locations.  As PACS data can be considered protected health information (PHI), regulations may apply, most notably [[HIPAA]] and HIPAA Hi-Tech requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/HITECH-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html : HIPAA HITECH Rule on HHS]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Images may be stored both locally and remotely on off-line media such as disk, tape or optical media. The use of storage systems, using modern data protection technologies has become increasingly common, particularly for larger organizations with greater capacity and performance requirements. Storage systems may be configured and attached to the PACS server in various ways, either as [[Direct-Attached Storage]] (DAS), [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS), or via a [[Storage Area Network]] (SAN).  However the storage is attached, enterprise storage systems commonly utilize [[RAID]] and other technologies to provide high availability and fault tolerance to protect against failures.  In the event that it is necessary to reconstruct a PACS partially or completely, some means of rapidly transferring data back to the PACS is required, preferably while the PACS continues to operate.

Modern data storage replication technologies may be applied to PACS information, including the creation of local copies via point-in-time copy for locally protected copies, along with complete copies of data on separate repositories including disk and tape based systems.  Remote copies of data should be created, either by physically moving tapes off-site, or copying data to remote storage systems.  Whenever HIPAA protected data is moved, it should be encrypted, which includes sending via physical tape or replication technologies over wide area networks (WAN) to a secondary location.  

Other options for creating copies of PACS data include removable media (hard drives, DVDs or other media that can hold many patients' images) that is physically transferred off-site.  HIPAA  HITECH mandates encryption of stored data in many instances or other security mechanisms to avoid penalties for failure to comply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hhs-cracks-down-provider-pay-100000-hipaa-penalties-over-lost-laptops HealthcareITnews: HHS cracks down: provider to pay $100,000 in HIPAA penalties over lost laptops. July 17, 2008, Diana Manos, Senior Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The back-up infrastructure may also be capable of supporting the migration of images to a new PACS. Due to the high volume of images that need to be archived many rad centers are migrating their systems to a [[Medical imaging#Medical Imaging in the Cloud|Cloud-based PACS]].

==Integration==
[[Image:CT viewer Chest Keosys.JPG|right|thumb|A chest image displayed via a PACS]]
A full PACS should provide a single point of access for images and their associated data. That is, it should support all digital modalities, in all departments, throughout the enterprise.

However, until PACS penetration is complete, individual islands of digital imaging not yet connected to a central PACS may exist. These may take the form of a localized, modality-specific network of modalities, workstations and storage (a so-called "mini-PACS"), or may consist of a small cluster of modalities directly connected to reading workstations without long term storage or management. Such systems are also often not connected to the departmental information system. Historically, Ultrasound, Nuclear Medicine and Cardiology Cath Labs are often departments that adopt such an approach.

More recently, Full Field [[digital mammography]] (FFDM) has taken a similar approach, largely because of the large image size, highly specialized reading workflow and display requirements, and intervention by regulators. The rapid deployment of FFDM in the US following the [[Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial|DMIST]] study has led to the integration of [[Digital Mammography and PACS]] becoming more commonplace.

All PACS, whether they span the entire enterprise or are localized within a department, should also interface with existing hospital information systems: [[Hospital information system]] (HIS) and [[Radiology Information System]] (RIS).
There are several data flowing into PACS as inputs for next procedures and back to HIS as results corresponding inputs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''In:''' Patient Identification and Orders for examination. These data are sent from HIS to RIS via integration interface, in most of hospital, via HL7 protocol. Patient ID and Orders will be sent to Modality (CT,MR,etc) via DICOM protocol (Worklist). Images will be created after images scanning and then forwarded to PACS Server. Diagnosis Report is created based on the images retrieved for presenting from PACS Server by physician/radiologist and then saved to RIS System.&lt;br&gt;
'''Out:''' Diagnosis Report and Images created accordingly. Diagnosis Report is sent back to HIS via HL7 usually and Images are sent back to HIS via DICOM usually if there is a DICOM Viewer integrated with HIS in hospitals (In most of cases, Clinical Physician gets reminder of Diagnosis Report coming and then queries images from PACS Server).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Interfacing between multiple systems provides a more consistent and more reliable dataset:
*Less risk of entering an incorrect patient ID for a study – modalities that support DICOM worklists can retrieve identifying patient information (patient name, patient number, accession number) for upcoming cases and present that to the technologist, preventing data entry errors during acquisition. Once the acquisition is complete, the PACS can compare the embedded image data with a list of scheduled studies from RIS, and can flag a warning if the image data does not match a scheduled study.
*Data saved in the PACS can be tagged with unique patient identifiers (such as a [[social security number]] or NHS number) obtained from HIS. Providing a robust method of merging datasets from multiple hospitals, even where the different centers use different ID systems internally.

An interface can also improve workflow patterns:

*When a study has been reported by a [[radiologist]] the PACS can mark it as read. This avoids needless double-reading. The report can be attached to the images and be viewable via a single interface.
*Improved use of [[computer data storage|online storage]] and [[nearline storage]] in the image archive. The PACS can obtain lists of appointments and admissions in advance, allowing images to be pre-fetched from [[off-line storage]] or near-line storage onto online disk storage.

Recognition of the importance of integration has led a number of suppliers to develop fully integrated RIS/PACS. These may offer a number of advanced features:

*Dictation of reports can be integrated into a single system. Integrated speech-to-text voice recognition software may be used to create and upload a report to the patient's chart within minutes of the patient's scan, or the reporting physician may dictate their findings into a phone system or voice recorder. That recording may be automatically sent to a transcript writer's workstation for typing, but it can also be made available for access by physicians, avoiding typing delays for urgent results, or retained in case of typing error.
*Provides a single tool for quality control and audit purposes. Rejected images can be tagged, allowing later analysis (as may be required under radiation protection legislation). Workloads and turn-around time can be reported automatically for management purposes.

==Acceptance testing==
The PACS installation process is complicated requiring time, resources, planning, and testing. Installation is not complete until the [[acceptance test]] is passed. Acceptance testing of a new installation is a vital step to assure user compliance, functionality, and especially clinical safety. Take for example the [[Therac-25]], a radiation [[medical device]] involved in accidents in which patients were given massive overdoses of [[radiation]], due to unverified [[software]] control.&lt;ref&gt;http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=841385&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance test determines whether the PACS is ready for clinical use and marks the [[warranty]] timeline while serving as a payment milestone. The test process varies in time requirements depending on facility size but contract condition of 30-day time limit is not unusual. It requires detailed planning and development of testing criteria prior to writing the contract. It is a joint process requiring defined test protocols and benchmarks.

Testing uncovers deficiencies. A study determined that the most frequently cited deficiencies were the most costly components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3046717 | pmid=15924273 | doi=10.1007/s10278-005-5164-y | volume=18 | title=Department of Defense picture archiving and communication system acceptance testing: results and identification of problem components | year=2005 | journal=J Digit Imaging | pages=203–8 |vauthors=Allison SA, Sweet CF, Beall DP, Lewis TE, Monroe T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failures ranked from most-to-least common are: [[Workstation]]; HIS/RIS/ACS broker interfaces; RIS; [[Computer Monitors]]; Web-based image distribution system; Modality interfaces; Archive devices; Maintenance; Training; Network; DICOM; Teleradiology; Security; Film [[digitizer]].

==History==
One of the first basic PACS was created in 1972 by Dr Richard J. Steckel.{{sfn|Huang|2004|p=6}}

The principles of PACS were first discussed at meetings of radiologists in 1982. Various people are credited with the coinage of the term ''PACS''. Cardiovascular radiologist Dr Andre Duerinckx reported in 1983 that he had first used the term in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duerinckx AJ, Pisa EJ | year = 1982 | title = Filmless Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in Diagnostic Radiology | url = | journal = Proc SPIE | volume = 318 | issue = | pages = 9–18 }} Reprinted in IEEE Computer Society Proceedings of PACS'82, order No 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Samuel Dwyer, though, credits Dr Judith M. Prewitt for introducing the term.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Dwyer III. A personalized view of the history of PACS in the USA. In: ''Proceedings of the SPIE'', "Medical Imaging 2000: PACS Design and Evaluation: Engineering and Clinical Issues", edited by G. James Blaine and Eliot L. Siegel. 2000;3980:2-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Harold Glass, a medical physicist working in London in the early 1990s secured UK Government funding and managed the project over many years which transformed Hammersmith Hospital in London as the first filmless hospital in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bryan S, Weatherburn GC, Watkins JR, Buxton MJ|title=The benefits of hospital-wide picture archiving and communication systems: a survey of clinical users of radiology services|journal=Br J Radiol|volume=72|issue=857|pages=469–78|year=1999|pmid=10505012|doi=10.1259/bjr.72.857.10505012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Glass died a few months after the project came live but is credited with being one of the pioneers of PACS.

The first large-scale PACS installation was in 1982 at the University of Kansas, Kansas City.&lt;ref name="Oosterwijk, Herman 2004"/&gt;  This first installation became more of a teaching experience of what not to do rather than what to do in a PACS installation.

==Regulatory concerns==
In the US PACS are classified as Medical Devices, and hence if for sale are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|USFDA]]. In general they are subject to Class 2 controls and hence require a [[510(k)]], though individual PACS components may be subject to less stringent general controls.&lt;ref name=fdapacsguidance&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7746">The '''point biserial correlation coefficient''' (''r&lt;sub&gt;pb&lt;/sub&gt;'') is a [[correlation coefficient]] used when one variable (e.g. ''Y'') is [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; ''Y'' can either be "naturally" dichotomous, like whether a coin lands heads or tails, or an artificially dichotomized variable. In most situations it is not advisable to dichotomize variables artificially&lt;!--{{Citation needed}} begin--&gt;{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}&lt;!--{{Citation needed}} end--&gt;. When a new variable is artificially dichotomized the new dichotomous variable may be conceptualized as having an underlying continuity. If this is the case, a [[biserial correlation]] would be the more appropriate calculation.

The point-biserial correlation is mathematically equivalent to the Pearson (product moment) [[correlation]], that is, if we have one continuously measured variable ''X'' and a dichotomous variable ''Y'', ''r&lt;sub&gt;XY&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;pb&lt;/sub&gt;''. This can be shown by assigning two distinct numerical values to the dichotomous variable.

==Calculation==

To calculate ''r&lt;sub&gt;pb&lt;/sub&gt;'', assume that the dichotomous variable ''Y'' has the two values 0 and 1. If we divide the data set into two groups, group 1 which received the value "1" on ''Y'' and group 2 which received the value "0" on ''Y'', then the point-biserial correlation coefficient is calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
r_{pb} = \frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_n} \sqrt{ \frac{n_1 n_0}{n^2}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the standard deviation used when data are available for every member of the population:
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_n = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; being the mean value on the continuous variable ''X'' for all data points in group 1, and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the mean value on the continuous variable ''X'' for all data points in group 2.  Further, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of data points in group 1, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of data points in group 2 and ''n'' is the total sample size.  This formula is a computational formula that has been derived from the formula for ''r&lt;sub&gt;XY&lt;/sub&gt;'' in order to reduce steps in the calculation; it is easier to compute than ''r&lt;sub&gt;XY&lt;/sub&gt;''.

There is an equivalent formula that uses ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{pb} = \frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_{n-1}} \sqrt{ \frac{n_1 n_0}{n(n-1)}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation used when data are available only for a sample of the population:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{n-1} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The version of the formula using ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; is useful if one is calculating point-biserial correlation coefficients in a programming language or other development environment where there is a function available for calculating ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but no function available for calculating ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Glass and Hopkins' book ''Statistical Methods in Education and Psychology'', (3rd Edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a correct version of point biserial formula.

Also the square of the point biserial correlation coefficient can be written:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ (M_1 - M_0)^2} {\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2} \left( \frac{n_1 n_0}{n} \right)\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

We can test the null hypothesis that the correlation is zero in the population.  A little algebra shows that the usual formula for assessing the significance of a correlation coefficient, when applied to ''r&lt;sub&gt;pb&lt;/sub&gt;'', is the same as the formula for an unpaired [[Student's t-test|''t''-test]] and so

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{pb} \sqrt{ \frac{n_1+n_0-2}{1-r_{pb}^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
follows [[Student's t-distribution]] with (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - 2) degrees of freedom when the null hypothesis is true.

One disadvantage of the point biserial coefficient is that the further the distribution of ''Y'' is from 50/50, the more constrained will be the range of values which the coefficient can take.  If ''X'' can be assumed to be normally distributed, a better descriptive index is given by the biserial coefficient

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{b} = \frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_n} \frac{n_1 n_0}{n^2 u},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' is the ordinate of the [[normal distribution]] with zero mean and unit variance at the point which divides the distribution into proportions ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'' and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''.  This is not easy to calculate, and the biserial coefficient is not widely used in practice.

A specific case of biserial correlation occurs where ''X'' is the sum of a number of dichotomous variables of which ''Y'' is one.  An example of this is where ''X''  is a person's total score on a test composed of ''n'' dichotomously scored items.  A statistic of interest (which is a discrimination index) is the correlation between responses to a given item and the corresponding total test scores.  There are three computations in wide use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Linacre |first=John |title=
The Expected Value of a Point-Biserial (or Similar) Correlation |journal=Rasch Measurement Transactions |volume=22 |year=2008 |issue=1 |page=1154 |url=http://www.rasch.org/rmt/rmt221e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; all called the ''point-biserial correlation'': (i) the Pearson correlation between item scores and total test scores including the item scores, (ii) the Pearson correlation between item scores and total test scores excluding the item scores, and (iii) a correlation adjusted for the bias caused by the inclusion of item scores in the test scores. Correlation (iii) is

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{upb}=\frac{M_1-M_0-1}{\sqrt{\frac{n^2s_n^2}{n_1n_0}-2(M_1-M_0)+1}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A slightly different version of the point biserial coefficient is the rank biserial which occurs where the variable ''X'' consists of ranks while ''Y'' is dichotomous.  We could calculate the coefficient in the same way as where ''X'' is continuous but it would have the same disadvantage that the range of values it can take on becomes more constrained as the distribution of ''Y'' becomes more unequal.  To get round this, we note that the coefficient will have its largest value where the smallest ranks are all opposite the 0s and the largest ranks are opposite the 1s.  Its smallest value occurs where the reverse is the case.  These values are respectively plus and minus (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/2.  We can therefore use the reciprocal of this value to rescale the difference between the observed mean ranks on to the interval from plus one to minus one.  The result is

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{rb} = 2\frac{M_1 - M_0}{n_1+n_0},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are respectively the means of the ranks corresponding to the 1 and 0 scores of the dichotomous variable. This formula, which simplifies the calculation from the counting of agreements and inversions, is due to Gene V Glass (1966).

It is possible to use this to test the null hypothesis of zero correlation in the population from which the sample was drawn.  If ''r&lt;sub&gt;rb&lt;/sub&gt;'' is calculated as above then the smaller of

:&lt;math&gt;
(1+r_{rb})\frac{n_1n_0}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
(1-r_{rb})\frac{n_1n_0}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

is distributed as [[Mann–Whitney U]] with sample sizes ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; when the null hypothesis is true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="574">In the various fields of healthcare, a '''population study''' is a study of a group of individuals taken from the general [[population]] who share a common characteristic, such as age, [[sex]], or health condition. This group may be studied for different reasons, such as their response to a drug or risk of getting a disease.

'''Richmond Park''', in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], was created by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in the 17th century&lt;ref name= Pastscape&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=397979|mname=Richmond Park|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Deer park (England)|deer park]].  The largest of London's Royal Parks, it is of national and international importance for wildlife conservation.  The park is a [[national nature reserves in England|national nature reserve]], a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] and a [[Special Area of Conservation]] and is included, at Grade I, on [[Historic England]]'s [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England]].  Its landscapes have inspired many famous artists and it has been a location for several films and TV series.

Richmond Park includes many buildings of architectural or historic interest. The [[Listed building|Grade I-listed]] [[White Lodge]] was [[List of British royal residences#Current royal residences|formerly a royal residence]] and is now home to the [[Royal Ballet School]]. The park's boundary walls and ten other buildings are listed at Grade II, including [[Pembroke Lodge]], the home of 19th-century British Prime Minister Lord [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|John Russell]] and his grandson, the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].

Historically the preserve of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]], the park is now open for all to use and includes a golf course and other facilities for sport and recreation. It played an important role in both world wars and in the 1948 and 2012 Olympics.

==Overview==

===Size===
Richmond Park is the largest of London's Royal Parks.&lt;ref name="TRP"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks| title=Our parks | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-largest park in London (after the 10,000 acre [[Lee Valley Park]], whose area extends beyond the [[M25 motorway|M25]] into [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Essex]]) and is Britain's second-largest urban walled park after [[Sutton Park]],&lt;ref name= "Hansard"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Hansard|Department of the Official Report (Hansard)]], [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[Westminster]] |url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020207/text/20207w18.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 7 Feb 2002 (pt 18) |publisher=[[UK Parliament]] |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birmingham]]. Measuring 3.69 square miles (955 [[hectare]]s or 2,360 [[acre]]s),&lt;ref name= "Hansard"/&gt; it is comparable in size to [[Paris]]'s [[Bois de Vincennes]] (995 ha or 2,458 ac) and [[Bois de Boulogne]] (846 ha or 2,090 ac).&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Jarrassé, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', Parigramme 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is almost half the size of [[Casa de Campo]] ([[Madrid]]) (1750 ha or 4324.34 ac)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Instituto Geográfico Nacional (Spain)]]|title=Visor cartográfico Iberpix|url=http://www2.ign.es/iberpix/visoriberpix/visorign.html|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around three times the size of [[Central Park]] in New York (341 ha or 843 ac).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– Central Park|url=http://www.centralpark.com/guide/faq.html|website=CentralPark.com|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status===
Of national and international importance for wildlife conservation, most of Richmond Park (856 hectares) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;activelayer=sssiIndex&amp;query=HYPERLINK%3D%271002388%27|publisher= [[Natural England]]|title= Map of Richmond Park SSSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "SSSI"/&gt; a National Nature Reserve (NNR)&lt;ref name=NNR&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greater-londons-national-nature-reserves/londons-national-nature-reserves |title= London National Nature Reserves |publisher= [[Natural England]]|date= 2 August 2014|accessdate= 31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Special Area of Conservation (SAC).&lt;ref name="JNCC"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/protectedsites/sacselection/sac.asp?EUcode=UK0030246 | title=Richmond Park | publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]] | accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Management Plan 16-29 "&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/41767/richmond-park-management-plan.pdf | title=Strategic Framework | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Richmond Park Management Plan | date=January 2008 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Site of Special Scientific Interest in London, it was designated as an SSSI in 1992,&lt;ref name="SSSI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002388.pdf | title=Richmond Park | publisher=[[Natural England]] | work=Citation | date=1992 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; excluding the area of the golf course, Pembroke Lodge Gardens and the Gate Gardens.&lt;ref name="Management Plan 16-29"/&gt; In its citation, [[Natural England]] said: "Richmond Park has been managed as a royal deer park since the seventeenth century, producing a range of habitats of value to wildlife. In particular, Richmond Park is of importance for its diverse deadwood beetle fauna associated with the ancient trees found throughout the parkland. In addition the park supports the most extensive area of dry acid grassland in Greater London."&lt;ref name="SSSI"/&gt;

The park was designated as an SAC in April 2005 on account of its having "a large number of ancient trees with decaying timber. It is at the heart of the south London centre of distribution for stag beetle ''Lucanus cervus'', and is a site of national importance for the conservation of the fauna of invertebrates associated with the decaying timber of ancient trees".&lt;ref name="SAC selection"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/protectedsites/sacselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0030246 | title=Richmond Park | publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]] | work=SAC selection | date=2005 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 1987 the park has also been included, at Grade I, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England, being described in [[Historic England]]'s listing as "A royal deer park with pre C15 origins, imparked by Charles I and improved by subsequent monarchs. A public open space since the mid C19".&lt;ref name="Listed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000828|title=Richmond Park|publisher=[[Historic England]]|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===
Richmond Park is located in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is close to [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[Ham, London|Ham]], [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[Roehampton]] and [[East Sheen]].&lt;ref name= "Hansard"/&gt;

==Organisation==

===Governance===
The [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]] manages Richmond Park and the other [[Royal Parks of London]] under powers set out in the [[Crown Lands Act 1851]], which transferred management of the parks from the monarch to the government.  Day-to-day management of the Royal Parks has been delegated to [[The Royal Parks]], an executive agency of the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS). The Royal Parks' Board sets the strategic direction for the agency. Appointments to the Board are made by the [[Mayor of London]].&lt;ref name="Royal Parks Board"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=252 | title=Royal Parks Board | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|The Friends of Richmond Park]] and the Friends of [[Bushy Park]] co-chair the Richmond and Bushy Parks Forum, comprising 38 local groups of local stakeholder organisations.&lt;ref name="Forum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/pdf/news/171_Richmond_and_Bushy_Parks_Forum_Letter_re_TRP_Board_composition_final_191011.pdf | title=Letter to Sir Edward Lister, Deputy Mayor of London, re Royal Parks Board | publisher=Richmond and Bushy Parks Forum | date=19 October 2011 | accessdate=22 October 2012 |author1=Ron Crompton  |author2=Pieter Morpurgo |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum was formed in September 2010 to consider proposals to bring Richmond Park and Bushy Park&amp;nbsp;– and London's other royal parks&amp;nbsp;– under the control of the Mayor of London through a new Royal Parks Board&lt;ref name="Forum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Transfer to Mayor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7700.aspx | title=Responsibility for London's Royal Parks to pass to London's Mayor | publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] | date= 8 February 2011|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to make a joint response. Although welcoming the principles of the new governance arrangements, the forum (in 2011) and the Friends of Richmond Park (in 2012) have expressed concerns about the composition of the new board.&lt;ref name="Forum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.frp.org.uk/news/171-new-board-for-royal-parks | title=New Board for Royal Parks | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | date=October 2011 | accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New board"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.frp.org.uk/news/186-royal-parks-board-appointed | title=Royal Parks Board appointed | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | date=July 2012 | accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access===
Richmond Park is the most visited royal park outside central London, with 4.4 million visits in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/422397/number-of-visitors-in-royal-parks-uk/ |title=Number of visitors to Royal Parks in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2014, by park (in millions) |website=Statista |access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is enclosed by a high wall with several gates. The gates either allow pedestrian and bicycle access only, or allow bicycle, pedestrian and other vehicle access. The gates for motor vehicle access are open only during daylight hours, and the speed limit is 20&amp;nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]]. The gates for pedestrians and cyclists are open 24 hours a day apart from during the deer cull in February and November when the park is closed in the evenings. Apart from taxis, no [[commercial vehicles]] are allowed unless they are being used to transact business with residents of the park.&lt;ref name="opsi.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/19971639.htm The Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

From March to October, a free bus service runs on Wednesdays, stopping at the main car parks and the gate at Isabella Plantation nearest Peg's Pond.&lt;ref name="Bus"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/richmond-park-attractions/isabella-plantation/visitor-information#seasonal_bus | title=Seasonal Bus Service | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Richmond Park Visitor Information | accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gates open to motor traffic are: Sheen Gate, Richmond Gate, Ham Gate, Kingston Gate, Roehampton Gate and (for access to [[Richmond Park Golf Course]] only) Chohole Gate.&lt;ref name="Map"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/41642/richmondpark_english_map.pdf | title=Richmond Park map | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=1 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154201/https://www.royalparks.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/41642/richmondpark_english_map.pdf | archivedate=2 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Management Plan 10"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/41767/richmond-park-management-plan.pdf | title=Getting to the Park | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Richmond Park Management Plan | date=January 2008 | accessdate=2 February 2015 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is pedestrian and bicycle access to the park 24 hours a day except during the [[Culling#Wildlife|deer cull]] in February and November when the pedestrian gates are closed between 8:00 pm and 7:30 am.&lt;ref name="Opening times"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/visitor-information/opening-times-and-getting-here | title=Opening times and getting here | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Visitor information | accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beverley Brook Walk runs through the park between Roehampton Gate and Robin Hood Gate. The [[Capital Ring]] walking route passes through the park from Robin Hood Gate to Petersham Gate. The [[Thames Path|Thames Cycle Route]] runs across the park from Ham Gate to Roehampton Gate (also known as [http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-4 Sustrans NCN Route 4] – the speed limit on this route through the centre of the park, where it is off the main road, is 10&amp;nbsp;mph). [[London Cycle Network]] route no. 3 goes through the park.&lt;ref name="Management Plan 16-29"/&gt;

The park has designated [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]]s and [[cycle path]]s.  These are shown on maps&lt;ref name="Map"/&gt; and noticeboards displayed near the main entrances, along with other regulations that govern use of the park. The bridleways are special in that they are for horses (and their riders) only and not open to cyclists like normal bridleways. Cycling is allowed only on main roads, the Thames Cycle Route through the centre of the park (10&amp;nbsp;mph), and on the Tamsin Trail (the shared-use pedestrian–cycle path that runs close to the park's perimeter).&lt;ref name="Cycling"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/visitor-information/park-regulations-and-policies/cycling-in-the-royal-parks | title=Cycling in the Royal Parks | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Park Regulations and Policies | accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the park is a national nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading to the death of wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/pets/9321953/Watch-out-Fenton-Richmond-Park-deers-take-on-dogs.html|title=Watch out Fenton!

===Law enforcement===
A [[robbery|mugging]] at gunpoint in 1854 reputedly led to the establishment of a park police force.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter Brown, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate [[Royal Parks Constabulary]] but that has now been subsumed into the [[Royal Parks Operational Command Unit]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.royalparks.org.uk/park-management/policing-in-the-royal-parks |title=Policing in the Royal Parks|publisher= [[The Royal Parks]]|accessdate= 6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mounted police]] have been replaced by a patrol team in a [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.&lt;ref name="Bad news"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/1314-bad-news-on-policing | title=Bad news on policing | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]]  | work=News | date=2015 | accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012 it was reported that police have been given the power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences.&lt;ref&gt;"Park to bring in bad behaviour penalties", ''[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]]'', p. 7, 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/9935558.Fine_for_man_who_allowed_dogs_to_chase_ducks_in_Richmond_Park/| title= Fine for man who allowed dogs to chase ducks in Richmond Park|author=Amy Dyduch|work= [[Richmond and Twickenham Times]]|date=19 September 2012|accessdate= 19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time.&lt;ref name="Dog licence"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.royalparks.org.uk/park-management/licences-and-permits/professional-dog-walking-licences/about-the-professional-dog-walking-licence|title=About the Professional Dog Walking Licence | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37&amp;nbsp;mph in the park.&lt;ref name="Cycling fine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/archive/2013/09/18/10682089.Teen_fined_for_cycling_at_37mph_in_Richmond_Park/|title=Speeding fine for teenager doing 37mph on bicycle|author=Clare Buchanan|work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]]|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=16 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103810/http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/archive/2013/09/18/10682089.Teen_fined_for_cycling_at_37mph_in_Richmond_Park/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015 a [[cycling club]] member was fined for speeding at 41&amp;nbsp;mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club, which uses the park for training.&lt;ref name="Pettitt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/speeding-cyclist-who-clocked-40mph-in-richmond-park-faces-expulsion-from-top-london-cycling-club-10099781.html?origin=internalSearch | title=Speeding cyclist who reached 40mph in Richmond Park faces expulsion from top club | work=[[Evening Standard]] | date=12 March 2015 | accessdate=12 March 2015 |author1=Josh Pettitt  |author2=Matt Watts |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.&lt;ref name="Mushrooms–2015"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/11749836.Mushroom_tamperer_gets_conditional_discharge_after_Richmond_Park_picking/?ref=mr | title=Mushroom tamperer gets conditional discharge after Richmond Park picking | work=Richmond Guardian |date=27 January 2015 | accessdate=13 February 2015 | author=Laura Proto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mushrooms - 2014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/11653028.Mushroom_thief_fined_after_picking_in_Richmond_Park/?ref=mr | title=Mushroom thief fined after picking in Richmond Park | work=Richmond Guardian | date=9 December 2014 | accessdate=13 February 2015 | author=Laura Proto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport and recreation===
''Cycling'': Cycles are available for hire near Roehampton Gate and, at peak times, near Pembroke Lodge.&lt;ref name="Sport"/&gt; The Tamsin Trail (shared between pedestrians and cyclists) provides a circuit of the park and is almost entirely car-free.&lt;ref name="Tamsin Trail"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/tamsin-trail-richmond-park | title=Tamsin Trail, Richmond Park | publisher=[[Sustrans]] | accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fishing'' is allowed, by paid permit, on Pen Ponds from mid-June to mid-March.&lt;ref name="Sport"/&gt;

''Golf'' is played at Richmond Park Golf Course, accessed from Chohole Gate.

''Horse riding'': Horses from several local stables are ridden in the park.&lt;ref name="Sport"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/richmond-park-attractions/sports-and-leisure | title=Sports and Leisure | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rugby'': A section of the grassland to the north of the Roehampton Gate is maintained and laid out during the winter months for rugby; there are three pitches. At weekends, this area is hired extensively to [[Rosslyn Park F.C.|Rosslyn Park Rugby Football Club]]. The club buses visiting teams to and from the park pitches from its nearby clubhouse and changing rooms.&lt;ref name="Sport"/&gt;

''Running'': The Tamsin Trail is a {{convert|7.2|mi|km|1|abbr=out}} trail around the park which is popular with runners. Members of Barnes Runners complete at least one circumnavigation of it on the first and third Sunday of every month. The Richmond Park [[Parkrun]], a 5&amp;nbsp;km organised run, takes place every Saturday at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am&lt;ref name="parkrun"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parkrun.org.uk/richmond/ | title=Richmond parkrun&amp;nbsp;– Weekly Free 5km Timed Run | publisher=Richmond [[parkrun]] | accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a starting point close to Bishop's Gate.&lt;ref name="Parkrun course"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parkrun.org.uk/richmond/course/ | title=The Course | publisher=Richmond [[parkrun]] | accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Friends of Richmond Park''' (FRP) was founded in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the [[speed limit]] in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 miles an hour and there were concerns that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 2-3"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, plans by the then [[Greater London Council]] to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn.&lt;ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 9"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles an hour in the summer of 2004.&lt;ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 33"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Friends successfully campaigned for the withdrawal of plans for open air screenings of films in the park.&lt;ref name="Auto6L-10"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/richmondnews/9190284.Richmond_Park_cinema_plans_withdrawn/ |title= Richmond Park cinema plans withdrawn|work= Richmond Guardian|author=Paul Teed|date= 11 August 2011|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto6L-11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/158-friends-oppose-park-screenings|title=Friends oppose Park screenings |publisher= [[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] website|date= 19 July 2011|accessdate= 28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Friends contributed towards the cost of a new Jubilee Pond, and launched a public appeal for a Ponds and Streams Conservation Programme in which the Friends, the Richmond Park Wildlife Group and [[Healthy Planet]] have been working with staff from The Royal Parks to restore some of the streams and ponds in the park.&lt;ref name="Auto6L-13"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/05/new_jubilee_pond_in_richmond_park_to_be_created.html|title=New Jubilee Pond in Richmond Park to be Created|publisher=[[St Margarets, London|St Margarets]] Community website|date=11 May 2012|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto6L-14"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/richmondnews/9699149.Jubilee_pond_to_open_in_Richmond_Park/ |title=Jubilee pond to open in Richmond Park|author= Christine Fleming|work=Richmond Guardian|date= 10 May 2012|accessdate= 5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="More Ponds"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/225-work-starts-on-more-ponds | title=Work starts on more ponds | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2012 | accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friends run a visitor centre near Pembroke Lodge, organise a programme of walks&lt;ref name="Auto6L-7"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/Campus/Environment/Projects-and-Initiatives/Walking-Works/|title=Walking Works Campaign|publisher=[[University of Roehampton]]|year= 2012|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and education activities for young people, and produce a quarterly newsletter. The Friends have published two books, ''A Guide to Richmond Park'' and ''Family Trails in Richmond Park''; profits from the books' sales contribute towards the Friends' conservation work.&lt;ref name="Auto6L-8"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/news/article/10356/new_guide_book_to_richmond_park |title=New guide book to Richmond Park|publisher=[[London Borough of Wandsworth]]|date= 28 March 2011|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto6L-9"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.frp.org.uk/pdf/news/170_SurreyComet_review_Sept_2011.pdf|title=Trails give us thrill of discovery|work= [[Surrey Comet]] |author=June Sampson|date= 2 September 2011|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Stuart origins===
In 1625 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] brought his court to [[Richmond Palace]] to escape an outbreak of plague in London&lt;ref name="Landscape History"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/about-richmond-park/landscape-history | title=Richmond Park: Landscape History | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and turned the area on the hill above Richmond into a park for the hunting of red and fallow deer.&lt;ref name="Landscape History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.org.uk/richmond-park|title= About Richmond Park|publisher= [[The Friends of Richmond Park]]|accessdate= 5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally referred to as the king's "New Park"&lt;ref name= Eyre&gt;{{cite book | title=ref MPE 1/426 | publisher=[[The National Archives (UK)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from the existing park in Richmond, which is now known as [[Old Deer Park]]. In 1637 he appointed [[Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland]] as keeper of the new park for life, with a fee of 12 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|(old) pence]] a day, pasture for four horses, and the use of the brushwood&lt;ref name="Calendar 1644"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924091770309#page/n289/mode/2up|title=Calendar of State Papers, Domestic series, of the reign of Charles I, 1644, preserved in Her Majesty's Public Record Office | publisher=[[HMSO]] | author=William Douglas Hamilton (editor) | year=1888 | location=London | page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– later holders of that office were known as [[List of keepers and rangers of Richmond Park|"Ranger"]]. Charles's decision, also in 1637, to [[enclosure|enclose]] the land&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;An [[Ordnance Survey]] map, published in 1949 and now held at [[The National Archives (UK)]], shows contemporary features in Richmond Park alongside the place names and field boundaries that existed prior to the [[Enclosure#Parliamentary enclosure and open fields|1637 Enclosure Act]].&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1864821 |title=Richmond Park: field boundaries before Enclosure Act 1637|work= ZOS 5/5  |date=1949 |publisher=[[The National Archives (UK)]] |access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not popular with the local residents, but he did allow pedestrians the right of way.&lt;ref name="Malden"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43018#n95 | title=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3 | publisher=British History Online | work=[[Victoria County History]] | year=1911 | accessdate=3 December 2012 | author=[[Henry Elliot Malden|H E Malden]] | pages=533–546}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day the walls remain, although they have been partially rebuilt and reinforced. Following [[Charles I of England#Execution|Charles I's execution]], custodianship of the park passed to the [[Corporation of the City of London]]. It was returned to the restored monarch, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], on his return to London in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;McDowall, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgian alterations===
In 1719, [[Caroline of Ansbach]] and her husband, the future [[George II of Great Britain]], bought Richmond Lodge as a country residence. This building had first been built as a hunting lodge for [[James I of England|James I]] in 1619 and had also been occupied by [[William III of Great Britain|William III]].&lt;ref name="Groom 26–40"&gt;{{cite book | publisher=Merrell Publishers | title=Kew Palace: The Official Illustrated History | date=2006 | author=[[Susanne Groom]] and Lee Prosser | ISBN= 978-1858943237| pages=26–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in a map of 1734, Richmond Park and Richmond Gardens then formed a single unit – the latter was merged with [[Kew Gardens]] by George III in the early 1800s.&lt;ref name="RCT Rocque"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/702999/plan-of-the-house-gardens-park-hermitage-of-their-majesties-at-richmond | title=Plan of the House, Gardens, Park &amp; Hermitage of their Majesties, at Richmond  1734 | publisher=[[Royal Collection Trust]] | accessdate=21 July 2016 | author=[[John Rocque]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1736 the Queen's Ride was cut through existing woodland to create a grand avenue through the park&lt;ref name="FRP Guide97"&gt;{{cite book | title=''"Buildings" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Michael Davison  |publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=97|ISBN=978-0-9567469-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bog Gate or Queen's Gate was opened as a private entrance for Caroline to enter the park on her journeys between White Lodge and Richmond Lodge. The same map shows Pen Ponds, a lake divided in two by a [[causeway]], dug in 1746 and initially referred to as the Canals, which is now a good place to see water birds.&lt;ref name= "Landscape History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter Brown, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond Lodge fell out of use on Caroline's death in 1737 but was brought back into use by her grandson [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] as his summer residence from 1764 to 1772, when he switched his summer residence to [[Kew Palace]] and had Richmond Lodge demolished.&lt;ref name="Groom 72–81"&gt;{{cite book | publisher=Merrell Publishers | title=Kew Palace: The Official Illustrated History | date=2006 | author=Susanne Groom and Lee Prosser | ISBN= 978-1858943237 | pages=72-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, Caroline's daughter [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Princess Amelia]] became ranger of Richmond Park after the death of [[Robert Walpole]]. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing a few close friends and those with special permits to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy|author= Kenneth J. Panton |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press, Inc]]|ISBN= 0-8108-5779-0|year=2011}} p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court.&lt;ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 38"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.&lt;ref name="Milestone"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/59-a-park-milestone-celebrated | title=A Park Milestone Celebrated | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | date=2008 | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/john_lewis_brief_open.pdf|title=John Lewis' re-establishment of pedestrian access to Richmond Park|author= Max Lankester, [[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | publisher= [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]|date= September 2009|accessdate = 15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
Full right of public access to the park was confirmed by [[Act of Parliament]] in 1872.&lt;ref name="FRP Guide88"&gt;{{cite book | title=''"History" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]]  | author=Max Lankester|year=2011 | page=88|ISBN= 978-0-9567469-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people were no longer given the right to remove firewood; this is still the case and helps in preserving the park.&lt;ref name= "Landscape History"/&gt;

Between 1833 and 1842 the Petersham Lodge estate, and then part of [[Sudbrook Park, Petersham|Sudbrook Park]], were incorporated into Richmond Park. Terrace Walk was created from Richmond Gate to Pembroke Lodge.&lt;ref name = "Cloake 190"&gt;Cloake, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The Russell School was built near Petersham Gate in 1851.&lt;ref name="FRP Guide89"&gt;{{cite book | title=''"History" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Max Lankester| publisher=[[Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=89|ISBN= 978-0-9567469-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1855 and 1861, new drainage improvements were constructed, including drinking points for deer.&lt;ref name = "Cloake 196"&gt;Cloake, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867 and 1876 fallow deer from the park were sent to New Zealand to help build up stocks – the first fallow deer introduced to that country&lt;ref name="Ungulates"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Bio14Tuat02-t1-body-d3.html | title=Introduced ungulates in New Zealand&amp;nbsp;– (D) Fallow deer | publisher=[[Victoria University of Wellington]] | work=Tuatara | volume= 14|issue =2|date=July 1966 | accessdate=5 August 2013 |author1=A H C Christie  |author2=J R H Andrews  |lastauthoramp=yes | pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter Brown, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; In or around 1870, the [[Inns of Court Regiment#History|Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers]] were using an area near Bog Gate as a drill ground.&lt;ref name = "Cloake 196"/&gt; [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], Italian general and politician, visited Lord [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|John Russell]] at Pembroke Lodge in 1864,&lt;ref name= "Cloake 192"/&gt; as did the Shah of [[Persia]], [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] in 1873. He was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe.&lt;ref name= "Cloake 192"&gt;Cloake, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===
[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] developed the park as a public amenity by opening up almost all the previously fenced woods and making public those gates that were previously private.&lt;ref name="McDowall 90"&gt;McDowall, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; From 1915 level areas of the park were marked out for football and cricket pitches.&lt;ref name="McDowall 90"/&gt; A golf course was developed on the former "Great Paddock" of Richmond Park, an area used for feeding deer for the royal hunt. The tree belt in this part of the park was supplemented by additional planting in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;McDowall, pp. 121–126&lt;/ref&gt; The golf course was opened in 1923 by Edward, Prince of Wales&lt;ref&gt;Baxter Brown, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; (who was to become [[King Edward VIII]] and, after his [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]], Duke of Windsor). The future king had been born in the park, at White Lodge, in 1894.&lt;ref name="PFJ 36"&gt;{{cite book | title=Richmond Park: Portrait of a Royal Playground | author=Pamela Fletcher Jones | publisher= [[The History Press|Phillimore &amp; Co Ltd]] |year=1972 | page=36|ISBN= 0850334977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park played an important role during World War I and was used for [[cavalry]] training.&lt;ref name="Pollard and Wood"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/pdf/frp/21c_Richmond_Park_and_the_First_World_War_-_Summer_2014.pdf| title=Richmond Park and the First World War | publisher=[[Friends of Richmond Park]] | work=Friend of Richmond Park Newsletter|date=17 November 2014 | accessdate=19 October 2016|author1=Mary Pollard  |author2=Robert Wood |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 1915 English inventor Harry Grindell Matthews demonstrated, in a secret test on Pen Ponds, how [[selenium]] cells would work in a  remotely controlled prototype weapon for use against German [[Zeppelins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harrygrindellmatthews.com/earlywireless.asp | title=Remote Controlled Boat | publisher=Jonathan Foster | work=The Death Ray: The Secret Life of Harry Grindell Matthews | date=2008 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Jonathan Foster | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122053357/http://harrygrindellmatthews.com/earlywireless.asp | archivedate=22 January 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on this story several years later, in April 1924, ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|The Daily Chronicle]]'' reported that the test had been carried out in the presence of [[Lord Balfour]], [[Lord Fisher]] and a staff of experts.

===1925–present===
[[Faisal I of Iraq]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] politician [[Salim Ali Salam]] were photographed visiting the park in 1925.

The [[Petersham Hole]] was a sink hole caused by subsidence of a sewer which forced the total closure of the [[A307 road]] in Petersham in 1979–80. As the hole and subsequent repair work had forced a total closure of this main road between Richmond and Kingston, traffic was diverted through the park and the Richmond, Ham, and Kingston gates remained open throughout the day and night.  The park road was widened at Ham Cross near Ham Gate to accommodate temporary traffic lights. About 10 deer a month were killed by traffic while the diversion was in operation.&lt;ref name="Pollard and Crompton 11-12"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, pp.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] the men's and the women's [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics|cycling road races]] went through the park.&lt;ref name="Men's race"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180178/London-2012-Olympics-Team-GB-denied-gold-cyclists-miss-medals--estimated-million-people-line-streets-cheer-on.html | title=Thrills, spills and broken dreams: Dramatic road race gets the Games off to a flier| work=[[Daily Mail]] | location= London |date=28 July 2012 | accessdate=23 October 2012 | author=Chris Parsons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women's race"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/29/olympic-road-race-womens-cycling-live | title=Olympic road race: women's cycling&amp;nbsp;– as it happened | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=29 July 2012 | accessdate=15 November 2012 | author=[[Barry Glendenning]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gates===
====Six original gates====
[[File:Richmond gates of Richmond Park (March 2010) 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Richmond Gate, designed by [[Sir John Soane]]]]
When the park was enclosed in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by [[Sir John Soane]]&lt;ref name="Soane"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/131-gate-design-credited-to-soane | title=Gate design credited to Soane | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | work=News | accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EH Richmond Gate"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1263361|desc=Richmond Gate Lodge, Screen Walls, Gate Piers and Gates|accessdate= 19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were widened in 1896.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of [[Coombe, Kingston upon Thames|Coombe]], with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901.&lt;ref name= "McDowall71-78"&gt;McDowall, pp. 71–78&lt;/ref&gt; The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The [[chinoiserie]] lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt;

Robin Hood Gate takes its name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn (demolished in 2001) and is close to what is called&lt;ref name="Robin Hood Roundabout"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/675837 | title=A3 Robin Hood Roundabout | publisher=[[Geograph]] | accessdate=8 October 2012 | author=Nigel Cox}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Robin Hood roundabout on the [[A3 road|A3]]. Widened in 1907,&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; it has been closed to motorised vehicles since a 2003 traffic reduction trial.&lt;ref name="Aylward"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3051399.stm |title=Park blocks scenic rat run |author=Juliet Ayward |date=10 June 2003 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alterations commenced in March 2013 to make the gates more suitable for pedestrian use and return some of the hard surface to parkland.&lt;ref name="March 2013 diaries"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/244-march-park-diaries | title=The Park in March | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | work=March Park diaries | date=March 2013 | accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other gates====

Chohole Gate served the farm that stood within the park on the site of the present Kings Farm Plantation. It is first mentioned in 1680.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; The gate now provides access to Richmond Park Golf Course. Kingston Gate dates from about 1750. The existing gates date from 1898.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt;

Public access via Bog Gate or Queen's Gate (built in 1736), 24 hours a day, was granted in 1894 and the present "cradle" gate installed.&lt;ref name="McDowall 70"&gt;McDowall, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The gate connects the park with [[East Sheen Common]].

Petersham Gate served the Russell School, replacing the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further up the hill was probably a tradesman's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; Bishop's Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; Kitchen Garden Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, is probably a nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public.&lt;ref name="McDowall 70"/&gt; Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt; was constructed during World War I for access to the newly built South Africa Military Hospital.&lt;ref name="Hearsum WWI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hearsumcollection.org.uk/the-collection-and-the-friends-of-richmond-park/item/the-first-world-war-and-richmond-park | title=The First World War and Richmond Park | publisher=The Hearsum Collection | work=The Collection | date=2014 | accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloake, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate.&lt;ref name= McDowall71-78/&gt;

The Freebord or "deer leap" is a strip of land 5 metres (16'6") wide, running around most of the perimeter of the park. Owned by the Crown, it allows access to the outside of the boundary wall for inspection and repairs. Householders whose property backs on to the park can use this land by paying an annual fee.&lt;ref name="Management Plan 11"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/41767/richmond-park-management-plan.pdf | title=Public Access | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Richmond Park Management Plan | date=January 2008 | accessdate=2 February 2015 | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Holly Lodge====
[[File:Holly Lodge.jpg|thumb|Holly Lodge]]
In 1735, a new lodge, Cooper's Lodge, was built on the site of Hill Farm.&lt;ref name="FRP Guide96"&gt;{{cite book | title=''"Buildings" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Michael Davison|publisher=[[Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=96|ISBN=978-0-9567469-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later known as Lucas's Lodge and  as Bog Lodge.&lt;ref name ="FRP Guide96"/&gt; Bog Lodge was renamed Holly Lodge in 1993&lt;ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 22"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and now contains a visitors' centre (bookings only), the park's administrative headquarters and a base for the Metropolitan Police's Royal Parks Operational Command Unit.

Holly Lodge also includes the '''Holly Lodge Centre''', an organisation which provides an opportunity for people of all ages and abilities to enjoy and learn from a series of hands-on experiences, focusing particularly on the environment and in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] history and heritage of Richmond Park. The Centre, which is [[wheelchair-accessible]] throughout,&lt;ref name="Facilities"/&gt; was opened in 1994.&lt;ref name="Famous"/&gt; It was founded by Mike Fitt {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[OBE]]}},&lt;ref name="Famous"/&gt; who was then The Royal Parks' Superintendent of Richmond Park and later became Deputy Chief Executive of London's Royal Parks. A registered charity,&lt;ref name="Charity"/&gt; the Holly Lodge Centre received the [[Queen's Award for Voluntary Service]] in 2005.

[[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] has been Holly Lodge Centre's Royal Patron since 2007.&lt;ref name="Holly Lodge People"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehollylodgecentre.org.uk/index.php/about-holly-lodge/people-management | title=People and management | publisher=Holly Lodge Centre | work=About us | accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 she opened the Centre's Victorian-themed pharmacy, ''Mr Palmer's Chymist''. This includes the original interior, artefacts and dispensing records dating from 1865, from a [[Pharmacy|chemist's shop]] in [[Mortlake]], and is used for educational activities. The Centre also includes a replica Victorian schoolroom, and a [[kitchen garden]] planted with varieties of vegetables used in Victorian times and [[herbs]] cultivated for their medicinal properties.&lt;ref name="Facilities "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehollylodgecentre.org.uk/index.php/about-holly-lodge/facilities-available | title=Facilities available | publisher=Holly Lodge Centre | work=About us | accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pembroke Lodge====

[[File:Pembroke Lodge 10233-5.jpg|thumb| [[Pembroke Lodge]]]]
[[Pembroke Lodge]] and some associated houses stand in their own garden within the park. In 1847 Pembroke Lodge became the home of the then [[Prime Minister]], [[Lord John Russell]]&lt;!--overlink, seems reasonable given length of article--&gt; and was later the childhood home of his grandson, [[Bertrand Russell]]. It is now a popular restaurant with views across the Thames Valley.

====Thatched House Lodge====
{{Main article|Thatched House Lodge}}
[[File:Thatched House Lodge.jpg|thumb|[[Thatched House Lodge]]]]
Thatched House Lodge was the London home of U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] during the Second World War. Since 1963 it has been the residence of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. The residence was originally built as two houses in 1673 for two Richmond Park Keepers, as Aldridge Lodge. Enlarged in 1727, the two houses were joined and renamed Thatched House Lodge in 1771 by Sir John Soane. The gardens include an 18th-century two-room [[Thatching|thatched]] summer house which gave the main house its name.

====White Lodge====
[[File:White Lodge.jpg|right|thumb|[[White Lodge, Richmond Park|White Lodge]]]]
{{Main article|White Lodge}}
Built as a hunting lodge for [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] by the architect [[Roger Morris (1695–1749)|Roger Morris]], White Lodge was completed in 1730. Its many famous residents have included members of the Royal Family. The future Edward VIII was born at White Lodge in 1894&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43018 |title=Parishes: Richmond (anciently Sheen) |author=[[Henry Elliot Malden|H E Malden]] (editor) |publisher=[[Institute of Historical Research]] |year=1911 |work=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother [[George VI of Great Britain|Prince Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI)]], and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother)]], lived there in the 1920s. The [[Royal Ballet School]] (formerly Sadler's Wells Ballet) has been based since 1955&lt;ref name= "Cloake 201"/&gt; at [[White Lodge]] where younger ballet students continue to be trained.

====Bishop's Gate Lodge====

Bishops Gate Lodge [sic] takes its name from a gamekeeper who was on the staff in the first half of the 19th century. A reference dated 1854 said that the keeper had had access to the lodge for the past fifty years. The lodge does not appear, though, on the 1813 plan of the park, but appears on the plans of 1850, and its layout seems to have changed little from that time. It forms part of a view over the park, and beyond, that is much favoured by amateur painters.&lt;ref name= Rabbitts/&gt;

====Other buildings====
Oak Lodge, near Sidmouth Wood, was built in about 1852 as a home for the park [[bailiff]], who was responsible for repair and maintenance in the park.&lt;ref name="FRP Guide101"&gt;{{cite book | title=''"Buildings" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | author=Michael Davison | authorlink=Buildings | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978 09567469 0 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by The Royal Parks as its base for a similar function today.&lt;ref name="FRP Guide101"/&gt;

There are also gate lodges at Chohole Gate, Kingston Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate&lt;ref name="Roehampton Gate"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/676527 | title=Richmond Park: Roehampton Gate and Lodge | publisher=[[Geograph]] | accessdate=8 October 2012 | author=Nigel Cox}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Sheen Gate, which also has a [[bungalow]] (Sheen Gate Bungalow).&lt;ref name ="Living in the Royal Parks"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/park-management/licences-and-permits/living-in-the-royal-parks | title=Living in the Parks | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladderstile Cottage, at Ladderstile Gate, was built in the 1780s.&lt;ref name = "McDowall 73"&gt;McDowall, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

A map by John Eyre, "Plan of His Majesty's New Park", shows a summerhouse near Richmond Gate.&lt;ref name= Eyre/&gt;

Several buildings already existed within the park when it was created. One of these was a manor house at Petersham which was renamed Petersham Lodge. During the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period it became accommodation for one of the park's deputy keepers, [[Lodowick Carlell]] (or Carlile), who was also a renowned playwright in his day,&lt;ref&gt;McDowall, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, [[Joan Carlile]], one of the very first women to practise painting professionally.&lt;ref name="Toynbee and Isham"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor= 871403 | title=Joan Carlile (1606?–1679): An Identification | series=Documents concerning artistic associates of Santa Maria della Scala | authors=Margaret Toynbee and [[Gyles Isham]] | work= [[The Burlington Magazine]]|volume= 96|number= 618 |date= September 1954 | doi=10.2307/871403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth, [[Countess of Dysart]], and her husband [[Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet|Sir Lionel Tollemache]], took over Petersham Lodge when they became joint keepers of Richmond Park. After Tollemache's death the Lodge and its surrounding land were leased in 1686 to [[Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester]], whose sister [[Anne Hyde|Anne]] was married to the new king, [[James II]]. It became a private park and was subsequently landscaped. By 1692 Rochester had demolished the Lodge and replaced it with a splendid new mansion in his "New Park". In 1732, a new Petersham Lodge was built to replace it after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Cloake, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; This Petersham Lodge was demolished in 1835.&lt;ref name = "Cloake 190"/&gt;

Professor [[Sir Richard Owen]], the first Director of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], lived at Sheen Cottage until his death in 1892.&lt;ref name="Victorian scientist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/452137.Remembering_Victorian_scientist/ | title=Remembering Victorian scientist | work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]] | author=James Adlam|date=22 January 2004 | accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cottage was destroyed by enemy action in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;McDowall, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the cottage can be seen in patches and irregularities in the wall 220 metres from Sheen Gate.&lt;ref name = "McDowall 73"/&gt;

A [[bandstand]], similar to one in [[Kensington Gardens]],  was erected near Richmond Gate in 1931. In 1975, after many years of disuse, it was moved to [[Regent's Park]].&lt;ref name="Photographs86"&gt;{{cite book | title=Richmond in Old Photographs | publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing | editor=[[John Cloake]]  |author=Compiled by members of the [[Richmond, London#Societies|Richmond Local History Society]] | page= 86 |year = 1990| isbn=0-86299-855-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====King Henry's Mound====
[[File:Panorama of King Henry's Mound.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of King Henry's Mound]]

King Henry's Mound, which may have been a [[Neolithic]] burial barrow,&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{cite journal | title='Sheene Chase' and 'King Henry VIII's Mound': two incorrect myths concerning Richmond Park | author=[[John Cloake]] | journal=[[Richmond, London#Societies|Richmond History: The Journal of Richmond History Society]]  | year=2014 | volume=35|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Bridget Cherry]] |author2=[[Nickolaus Pevsner]] |title=The Buildings of England - London 2 - South|date=1983|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England| isbn= 0140710477|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the highest point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge. At various times the mound's name has been connected with Henry VIII or with his father Henry VII.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt; But there is no evidence to support the legend that Henry VIII stood on the mound to watch for a sign from St Paul's that [[Anne Boleyn]] had been executed at the [[Tower of London|Tower]] and that he was then free to marry [[Jane Seymour]].&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

To the west of King Henry's Mound is a [[panorama]] of the [[Thames Valley]].&lt;ref name="Viewpoints"/&gt; St Paul's Cathedral, over 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) to the east, can be seen through the naked eye or via a [[telescope]] that has been installed on the Mound.

In 2005 the then Mayor of London, [[Ken Livingstone]], sought to overturn this protection and reduce it to "half a dome". In 2009 his successor, [[Boris Johnson]], promised to reinstate the wider view, though also approving a development at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] which, when completed, will obscure its right-hand corner.&lt;ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 12"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; New gates − "The Way" − which can be viewed through the King Henry's Mound telescope, were installed in 2012 on the edge of Sidmouth Wood to mark the 300th anniversary of St Paul's Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/richmondnews/9748305.Tercentenary_gates_unveiled_at_Richmond_Park/ | title= Tercentenary gates unveiled at Richmond Park | work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]] | date=7 June 2012 | accessdate=3 October 2012 | author=Christine Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, it was reported that [[Manhattan Loft Gardens]], a 42-storey 135m-tall apartment building under construction in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], an area of London not covered by these planning restrictions, had "destroyed" the view from the park as it can now be seen behind the framed view of the cathedral's dome.  The developers said that “Despite going through the correct planning processes in a public and transparent manner, at no point was the subject of visual impact to St Paul’s ever raised" by the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] or the [[Greater London Authority]] and that they were looking into the issues raised by the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/st-paul-s-admirers-take-dim-view-of-tower-hk8vr7ld2|title=St Paul’s admirers take dim view of tower|author= Ben Webster|date=5 December 2016|work=[[The Times]]|access-date=5 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the Friends of Richmond Park reported that their campaigning on the issue had resulted in the Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]], instructing London planners to consult the [[Greater London Authority]] on planning requests for high-rise buildings which, if built, could affect the visibility of St Paul’s from established viewpoints. His instruction has now been incorporated into planning procedures across Greater London.&lt;ref name="Planning"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/1474-st-pauls-view-safeguarded |title=St Paul's view safeguarded |publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] |publication-date=November 2017 |access-date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plantings and memorials===
[[File:Isabella Plantation - geograph.org.uk - 587462.jpg|thumb|left|[[Azaleas]] flowering in [[Isabella Plantation]] in springtime]]

The park's open slopes and woods are based on lowland [[acid soils]]. The grassland is mostly managed by grazing. The park contains numerous woods and copses, some created with donations from members of the public.

Between 1819 and 1835, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]], Deputy Ranger, established several new plantations and enclosures, including Sidmouth Wood and the ornamental [[Isabella Plantation]], both of which are fenced to keep the deer out.&lt;ref name= "Landscape History"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cloake 196"/&gt; After World War II the existing woodland at Isabella Plantation was transformed into a woodland garden, and is organically run, resulting in a rich flora and fauna. Opened to the public in 1953,&lt;ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 32"&gt;Pollard and Crompton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  it is now a major visitor attraction in its own right.  It is best known for the flowering, in April and May, of its [[evergreen]] [[azaleas]] and [[camellias]], which have been planted next to its ponds and streams. There are also many rare and unusual trees and shrubs.&lt;ref name="TRP Isabella"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/richmond-park-attractions/isabella-plantation | title=Isabella Plantation | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Richmond Park | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jubilee Plantation, created to commemorate the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], was established in 1887.&lt;ref name="Rabbitts"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSdmBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP72&amp;lpg=PP72&amp;dq=Richmond+Park+jubilee+Plantation,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1hC4EA5SEF&amp;sig=GqvNUgtusITyPTfZ2PKETbTBi54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jgfQVKKJCdDnapSgguAP&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Richmond%20Park%20jubilee%20Plantation%2C&amp;f=false | title=Richmond Park: From medieval pasture to Royal park | publisher=[[Alan Sutton|Amberley Publishing]] | author=Paul A Rabbits | year=2014 | location=[[Stroud, Gloucestershire]] | isbn=978-1445618562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charles' Spinney was planted out in 1951&lt;ref&gt;McDowall, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; with trees protected from the deer by fences, to preserve a natural habitat. The bluebell glade is managed to encourage native British bluebells. Teck Plantation, established in 1905,&lt;ref name= "McDowall 122"&gt;McDowall, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; commemorates the Duke and Duchess of Teck, who lived at White Lodge. Their daughter Mary married [[George V]].&lt;ref name="McDowall 70"/&gt; Tercentenary Plantation, in 1937,&lt;ref name= "McDowall 122"/&gt; marked the 300th anniversary of the enclosure of the park. Victory Plantation was established in 1946&lt;ref name= "McDowall 122"/&gt; to mark the end of the Second World War. Queen Mother's Copse, a small triangular enclosure on the woodland hill halfway between Robin Hood Gate and Ham Gate, was established in 1980&lt;ref name= "McDowall 122"/&gt; to commemorate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

The park lost over 1000 mature trees during the [[Great Storm of 1987]] and the [[Burns' Day storm]] of 1990. The subsequent replanting included a new plantation, Two Storms Wood, a short distance into the park from Sheen Gate. Some extremely old trees can also be seen inside this enclosure.&lt;ref name="Listed"/&gt;

Bone Copse, which was named in 2005, was started by the Bone family in 1988 by purchasing and planting a tree from the park authorities in memory of Bessie Bone who died in that year. Trees have been added annually, and in 1994 her husband Frederick Bone also died. The annual planting has been continued by their children.

====James Thomson and Poet's Corner====
[[File:Ian Dury-Memorial Bench.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian Dury]] [[memorial bench]]]]
A bench known as "Poet's seat" is located at the north end of Pembroke Lodge Gardens, in a spot called Poet's Corner. Sculpted by Richard Farrington,&lt;ref name="Farrington"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richardfarrington.com/seats_richmond.htm | title=Richmond&amp;nbsp;– Poet's Seat | publisher=Richard Farrington: Sculptor | accessdate=28 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042022/http://www.richardfarrington.com/seats_richmond.htm | archivedate=4 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was based on an idea by Jane Fowles. The seat is inscribed with lines by the poet  [[James Thomson (poet, born 1700)|James Thomson]], who was living in Richmond at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Monuments"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/press-and-media/factsheets-on-the-royal-parks/monuments/monuments-in-richmond-park | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511191959/http://www.royalparks.org.uk/press/factsheets-on-the-royal-parks/monuments/monuments-in-richmond-park |archivedate=11 May 2012 | title=Monuments in Richmond Park | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wooden memorial plaque with an [[ode]] to Thomson by the writer and historian [[John Heneage Jesse]] was formerly located near Pembroke Lodge stables, where it was installed in 1851. The plaque was replaced by the [[Selborne Society]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="Monuments"/&gt;

In 2014 Poet's Corner was re-sited to the other side of the main path and the ode, on a re-gilded board, was installed in a completely new oak frame. The new Poet's Corner, funded by the Friends of Richmond Park and the Visitor Centre at Pembroke Lodge, and by a donation in memory of Wendy Vachell, also includes three curved benches made from reclaimed [[teak]]. The benches are inscribed with a couplet by the Welsh poet [[W. H. Davies]], "A poor life this, if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare".&lt;ref name="New Poet's Corner"&gt;{{cite journal | title=New Poet's Corner | journal=Friends of Richmond Park newsletter |date=Autumn 2014  | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Henry's Mound is inscribed with a few lines from  [[The Seasons (Thomson)|Thomson's poem "The Seasons"]].&lt;ref name="Monuments"/&gt;

Poet's Corner is linked to King Henry's Mound by The John Beer Laburnum Arch, named after one of Pembroke Lodge Gardens' former charge-hands. The arch has a display of yellow [[laburnum]] flowers in May.&lt;ref name="FRP Guide73"&gt;{{cite book | title=''"Gardens" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Jo Scrivener|publisher=[[Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=73|ISBN=978-0-9567469-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ian Dury====

In 2002 a "musical bench", designed by Mil Stricevic,&lt;ref name="Stricevic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.milstricevic.net/pages/reasons.html | title=Reasons to be Cheerful | publisher=Mil Stricevic | work=Sonic vista bench | accessdate=2 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203020714/http://www.milstricevic.net/pages/reasons.html | archivedate=3 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was placed in a favoured viewing spot of rock singer and lyricist [[Ian Dury]] (1942–2000) near Poet's Corner. On the back of the bench are the words "[[Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3|Reasons to be cheerful]]", the title of one of Dury's songs.&lt;ref name="Monuments"/&gt; The [[solar power]]ed seat was intended to allow visitors to plug in and listen to eight of his songs as well as an interview, but was subjected to repeated [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/the-blockheads-star-ian-durys-musical-203992 | title=The Blockheads star Ian Dury's musical memorial repeatedly vandalised in London's Richmond Park | work=[[Daily Mirror]] | location= London|date=26 February 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the bench was refurbished and the [[MP3 players]] and solar panels were replaced with metal plates on which a [[QR code]] can be scanned via a [[smartphone]].  Visitors can access nine [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads]] songs and hear Dury's ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' interview with [[Sue Lawley]], first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 15 December 1996.&lt;ref name="Dury bench"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iandury.co.uk/memorial-bench/ |title=The ‘Reasons to Be Cheerful’ Sonic Vista Bench |access-date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is an important refuge for other wildlife, including [[woodpecker]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[snake]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, [[stag beetle]]s and many other [[insect]]s plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of [[fungi]]. It is particularly notable for its rare beetles.&lt;ref name=NNR/&gt;

Richmond Park supports a large population of what are believed to be [[rose-ringed parakeet|ring-necked (or rose-ringed) parakeets]]. These bred from birds that escaped or were freed from captivity.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/parakeets-cause-problems-for-british-wildlife-2165449.html | title=Parakeets cause problems for British wildlife | work=[[The Independent]] | date=20 December 2010 | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Michael McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ponds and streams===
[[File:Pen Ponds, Richmond Park - geograph.org.uk - 17621.jpg|thumb|left|This is the southern of the two Pen Ponds]]
[[File:Stream in Isabella Plantation - geograph.org.uk - 1273691.jpg|thumb|A stream flows through the [[Isabella Plantation]]]]
There are about 30 ponds in the park. Some&amp;nbsp;– including Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond&amp;nbsp;– have been created to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear [[carp]] for food)&lt;ref name="FRP Guide16"&gt;{{cite book | title=''"Ecology" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Nigel Reeve|publisher=[[Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=16|ISBN=978-0-9567469-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; date from 1746.&lt;ref name="Landscape History"/&gt; They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to [[Beverley Brook]]. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas of water in the park.&lt;ref name="Davison"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/pdf/frp/401_Water_in_the_Park_.pdf | title=Water in the Park | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]]  | accessdate=7 February 2015 | author=Michael Davison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beverley Brook rises at Cuddington Recreation Park in [[Worcester Park]]&lt;ref name=inwood&gt;{{cite book | title=Historic London: An Explorer's Companion | author= Stephen Inwood | publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-230-70598-7 | page=382 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and enters the park (where it is followed by the Tamsin Trail and Beverley Walk) at Robin Hood Gate, creating a water feature used by deer, smaller animals and water grasses and some [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].  Its name is derived from the former presence in the river of the [[European beaver]] (''Castor fiber''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Place-names of Greater London | author=John Field | publisher=[[Batsford]] | year=1980 | isbn=0-7134-2538-5 | pages=30,166}}&lt;/ref&gt; a species extinct in Britain since the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castorologia: Or The History and Traditions of the Canadian Beaver |author= Horace T.

Most of the streams in the park drain into Beverley Brook but a spring above Dann's Pond flows to join [[Sudbrook (stream)|Sudbrook]] (from "South brook") on the park boundary. Sudbrook flows through a small valley known as Ham Dip and has been dammed and enlarged in two places to form Ham Dip Pond and Ham Gate Pond, first mapped in 1861 and 1754 respectively. These were created for the watering of deer.&lt;ref&gt;McDowall, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; Both ponds underwent restoration work including de-silting, which was completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/225-work-starts-on-more-ponds |year=2012 |title=Work starts on more ponds |publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]]  |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudbrook drains the western [[escarpment]] of the hill that, to the east, forms part of the catchment of Beverley Brook and, to the south, the [[Hogsmill River]]. Sudbrook is joined by the [[Latchmere Stream]] just beyond Ham Gate Pond. Sudbrook then flows into [[Sudbrook Park]], Petersham. Another stream rises north of Sidmouth Wood and goes through Conduit Wood towards the park boundary near Bog Gate.&lt;ref name="Davison"/&gt;

A separate water system for Isabella Plantation was developed in the 1950s. Water from the upper Pen Pond is pumped to Still Pond, Thomson's Pond and Peg's Pond.&lt;ref name="Davison"/&gt;

The park's newest pond is Attenborough Pond, opened by and named after the broadcaster and naturalist [[Sir David Attenborough]] in July 2014.&lt;ref name="New pond"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A new pond for the park | author=Michael Davison| journal=Friends of Richmond Park newsletter |date=Autumn 2014  | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created as part of the park's [[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Ponds and Streams Conservation Programme]].&lt;ref name="Attenborough"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/richmond-park-news/sir-david-opens-attenborough-pond-in-richmond-park-and-launches-conservation-appeal-for-beverley-brook | title=Sir David opens Attenborough Pond in Richmond Park and launches conservation appeal for Beverley Brook | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Richmond Park News | date=16 July 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richmond 2005 05 1ab.jpg|thumb|Park at [[Schloss Richmond|Richmond Castle, Brunswick]]]]

===Richmond Park, Brunswick, Germany===
The "[[Schloss Richmond#Park|Richmond Park]]" in Germany is named after the park in Britain and was created in 1768 in Brunswick for [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain|Princess Augusta]], sister of George III.  She was married to the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duke of Brunswick]] and was feeling homesick, so an English-style park was designed by [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] and a palace built for her, both with the name "Richmond".&lt;ref name="Brunswick"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.braunschweig.de/leben/im_gruenen/gruenanlagen/Rich_Ken.html | title=Schloß Richmond-Park / Kennelgebiet | publisher=Braunschweig | accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Bessin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Der Regent als Architekt. Schloß Richmond und die Lustschloßbauten Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttels zwischen 1680 und 1780 als Paradigma fürstlicher Selbstdarstellung. |publisher=[[Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht]]|location=[[Göttingen]] |year=2001 |ISBN= 3-525-47904-2  | author=Peter Bessin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the palace including the entire estate was purchased by [[Braunschweig|the City of Braunschweig]]. One condition for the purchase was that no structural changes ever be made and the park not be built on. The palace, which was rebuilt after the Second World War and reconstructed in 1987 to the historic original design, is now used for public events.&lt;ref name="Peter Bessin"/&gt; The nearly four-hectare park has been open to the public since 1964.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1806">'''Sanger Brown''' (1852–1928) was an [[United States|American]] physician. He was born in [[Bloomfield, Ontario|Bloomfield]] ([[Ontario]]), [[Canada]], graduated in 1880 at the [[New York University School of Medicine|Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] ([[New York City]]), was assistant physician at the [[Bloomingdale Asylum for the Insane]] ([[White Plains, New York|White Plains, N. Y.]]) in 1882–1885, and acting medical superintendent there in 1886. In 1890 he was appointed [[professor]] of [[neurology]] in the [[Post-Graduate Medical School]] of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], and in 1901–1906 was associate professor of medicine and clinical medicine at the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in the same city. In his experiments with [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer|E. A. Schäfer]] at [[University College London|University College]], [[University of London|London]], in 1886–1887, he was the first to demonstrate conclusively that in monkeys the centre of vision is located in the [[occipital lobe]]. In 1908 he joined the United States Army Medical Reserve Corps with rank of first lieutenant.

Known for Sanger-Brown cerebellar [[ataxia]]. He described it in 1892, it is one of the unusual types collected by Pierre Marie in 1893. It is accompanied by numerous ophthalmic abnormalities and pathologic changes in several tracts of the spinal cord.

The '''Saudi Commission for Health Specialties''' ('''SCHS'''; {{lang-ar|'''الهيئة السعودية للتخصصات الصحية'''}}) is a Saudi Arabian [[professional body]] that regulates [[health care]]-related practices and accreditation at all levels in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The SCHS was established on 2 June 1992 by Royal Order M/2 to set standards for health practice. Its headquarters is in [[Riyadh]] and it has several branch offices across the Kingdom.

SCHS has supported and approved more than 35 training programs.

In many higher medical centers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties is regarded as a "dys-regulatory" organisation that in many aspects severely hampers the provision of dedicated health care to the Saudi population by implementing a notoriously abusive financial system for healthcare providers and yet, poor quality standards and nepotism.

Sautéed mushrooms is a common dish prepared by the sautéing of sliced or whole [[edible mushrooms]].&lt;ref name="Julia Child1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crocker 2007"/&gt; Butter is typically used when sautéing the dish,&lt;ref name="Julia Child1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hudgens 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Housekeeping 2001"/&gt; and margarine and cooking oils such as olive oil and canola oil are also used.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruhlman&amp;Ruhlman 2011"/&gt; [[Clarified butter]] can be used, as can a mixture of oil and butter.&lt;ref name="Gisslen&amp;Griffin 2006"/&gt; The dish is typically cooked for over a high heat until the mushrooms are browned, with the oil or butter being very hot in a pan before the mushrooms are added.&lt;ref name="Julia Child1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruhlman&amp;Ruhlman 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gisslen&amp;Griffin 2006"/&gt; Overcooking may create an inferior dish by the causing the mushrooms to lose moisture and becoming shriveled.&lt;ref name="Gisslen&amp;Griffin 2006"/&gt;

During the cooking process, the dish can be [[Deglazing (cooking)|deglazed]] with the use of wine,&lt;ref name="Ruhlman&amp;Ruhlman 2011"/&gt; and wine can be used as an ingredient in and of itself without deglazing.&lt;ref name="Lampe Beisch 2012"/&gt; The dish can be flavored with lemon juice, various herbs and seasonings, salt and pepper.&lt;ref name="Julia Child1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruhlman&amp;Ruhlman 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gisslen&amp;Griffin 2006"/&gt; Additional ingredients such as minced green onions and shallots can also be used.&lt;ref name="Julia Child1"/&gt; The dish is vegetarian, and may have a meat-like texture.&lt;ref name="New Woman 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forest Vesanto Melina 2012"/&gt;

==Uses==
Sautéed mushrooms is sometimes served as a [[side dish]], and is also used as an ingredient in the preparation of dishes and foods such as [[beef bourguignon]], [[coq au vin]], ''poulet en cocotte'',&lt;ref name="Julia Child1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruhlman&amp;Ruhlman 2011"/&gt; ''Poulet Saute Chasseur'',&lt;ref name="Peterson 2012"/&gt; soups and stews, sauces, and [[duxelles]], a [[paste (food)|paste]] prepared by sautéing mushrooms, onions, shallots, and herbs in butter.&lt;ref name="Ruhlman&amp;Ruhlman 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gisslen&amp;Griffin 2006"/&gt; Sautéed mushrooms is also used as a topping for cooked [[steak]]s and [[toast]],&lt;ref name="Lampe Beisch 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beard 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Good Maine Food 2010"/&gt; as a side dish meant to specifically accompany steaks,&lt;ref name="Tramonto Goodbody Fink 2010"/&gt; and as a [[garnish (food)|garnish]].&lt;ref name="Ruhlman&amp;Ruhlman 2011"/&gt; The dish can serve to add significant flavor to various dishes, in part per the [[glutamic acid]] present in the cells of edible mushrooms&lt;ref name="Hudgens 2011"/&gt; (see also: [[glutamate flavoring]]).

The '''sequential probability ratio test''' (SPRT) is a specific [[Sequential analysis|sequential hypothesis test]], developed by [[Abraham Wald]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later proven to be optimal by Wald and [[Jacob Wolfowitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wald|first=A.|last2=Wolfowitz|first2=J.|date=1948|title=Optimum Character of the Sequential Probability Ratio Test|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2235638|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=326–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Neyman–Pearson lemma|Neyman and Pearson's 1933 result]] inspired Wald to reformulate it as a sequential analysis problem. The Neyman-Pearson lemma, by contrast, offers a [[rule of thumb]] for when all the data is collected (and its likelihood ratio known).

While originally developed for use in [[quality control]] studies in the realm of manufacturing, SPRT has been formulated for use in the computerized testing of human examinees as a termination criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Richard L.

==Theory==
As in classical [[hypothesis testing]], SPRT starts with a pair of hypotheses, say &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; for the [[null hypothesis]] and [[alternative hypothesis]] respectively. They must be specified as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;H_0: p=p_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_1: p=p_1&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to calculate the cumulative sum of the log-[[likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio]], &lt;math&gt;\log \Lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, as new data arrive: with &lt;math&gt;S_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then, for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;=1,2,...,

:&lt;math&gt;S_i=S_{i-1}+ \log \Lambda_i &lt;/math&gt;

The [[stopping rule]] is a simple thresholding scheme:

* &lt;math&gt;a &lt; S_i &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;: continue monitoring (''critical inequality'')
* &lt;math&gt;S_i \geq b&lt;/math&gt;: Accept &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S_i \leq a&lt;/math&gt;: Accept &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;0&lt;b&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;) depend on the desired [[type I and type II errors]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. They may be chosen as follows:

&lt;math&gt;a \approx \log \frac{ \beta }{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \approx \log \frac{1-\beta}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; must be decided beforehand in order to set the thresholds appropriately. The numerical value will depend on the application. The reason for using  approximation signs is that, in the discrete case, the signal may cross the threshold between samples. Thus, depending on the penalty of making an error and the [[sampling frequency]], one might set the thresholds more aggressively. Of course, the exact bounds may be used in the continuous case.

==Example==
A textbook example is [[parameter estimation]] of a [[probability distribution function]]. Let us consider the [[exponential distribution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x)= \theta^{-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}}, \qquad x,\theta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The hypotheses are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} H_0: \theta=\theta_0 \\ H_1: \theta=\theta_1\end{cases} \qquad \theta_1&gt;\theta_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the log-likelihood function (LLF) for one sample is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\log \Lambda(x)&amp;= \log \left ( \frac{\theta_1^{-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta_1}}}{\theta_0^{-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta_0}}} \right) \\
&amp;= \log \left ( \frac{\theta_0}{\theta_1} e^{\frac{x}{\theta_0} - \frac{x}{\theta_1}} \right) \\
&amp;= \log \left ( \frac{\theta_0}{\theta_1} \right) + \log \left (e^{\frac{x}{\theta_0} - \frac{x}{\theta_1}} \right) \\
&amp;= -\log \left ( \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0} \right ) + \left (\frac{x}{\theta_0} - \frac{x}{\theta_1} \right ) \\
&amp;= -\log \left ( \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0} \right ) + \left ( \frac{\theta_1-\theta_0}{\theta_0 \theta_1}\right ) x 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The cumulative sum of the LLFs for all {{mvar|x}} is

:&lt;math&gt;S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n \log \Lambda(x_i)= - n \log \left ( \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0} \right ) + \left (\frac{\theta_1-\theta_0}{\theta_0 \theta_1} \right)\sum_{i=1}^n x_i &lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, the stopping rule is:

:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;- n \log \left ( \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0} \right ) + \left (\frac{\theta_1-\theta_0}{\theta_0 \theta_1} \right ) \sum_{i=1}^n x_i &lt;b&lt;/math&gt;

After re-arranging we finally find

:&lt;math&gt;a+n \log \left ( \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0} \right ) &lt; \left ( \frac{\theta_1-\theta_0}{\theta_0 \theta_1} \right ) \sum_{i=1}^n x_i &lt; b+n \log \left ( \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

The thresholds are simply two [[parallel lines]] with [[slope]] &lt;math&gt;\log ( \theta_1/\theta_0 )&lt;/math&gt;. Sampling should stop when the sum of the samples makes an excursion outside the ''continue-sampling region''.

==Applications==

===Manufacturing===
The test is done on the proportion metric, and tests that a variable ''p'' is equal to one of two desired points, ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The region between these two points is known as the ''indifference region'' (IR).  For example, suppose you are performing a quality control study on a factory lot of widgets.  Management would like the lot to have 3% or less defective widgets, but 1% or less is the ideal lot that would pass with flying colors.  In this example, ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.03'' and the region between them is the IR because management considers these lots to be marginal and is OK with them being classified either way.  Widgets would be sampled one at a time from the lot (sequential analysis) until the test determines, within an acceptable error level, that the lot is ideal or should be rejected.

===Testing of human examinees===
The SPRT is currently the predominant method of classifying examinees in a variable-length [[computerized classification test]] (CCT){{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.  The two parameters are ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are specified by determining a cutscore (threshold) for examinees on the proportion correct metric, and selecting a point above and below that cutscore.  For instance, suppose the cutscore is set at 70% for a test.  We could select ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.65'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.75'' .  The test then evaluates the likelihood that an examinee's true score on that metric is equal to one of those two points.  If the examinee is determined to be at 75%, they pass, and they fail if they are determined to be at 65%.

These points are not specified completely arbitrarily.  A cutscore should always be set with a legally defensible method, such as a [[Standard-setting study#Item-centered studies|modified Angoff procedure]].  Again, the indifference region represents the region of scores that the test designer is OK with going either way (pass or fail).  The upper parameter ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is conceptually the highest level that the test designer is willing to accept for a Fail (because everyone below it has a good chance of failing), and the lower parameter ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the lowest level that the test designer is willing to accept for a pass (because everyone above it has a decent chance of passing).  While this definition may seem to be a relatively small burden, consider the [[high-stakes testing|high-stakes case of a licensing test]] for medical doctors: at just what point should we consider somebody to be at one of these two levels?

While the SPRT was first applied to testing in the days of [[classical test theory]], as is applied in the previous paragraph, Reckase (1983) suggested that [[item response theory]] be used to determine the ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameters.  The cutscore and indifference region are defined on the latent ability (theta) metric, and translated onto the proportion metric for computation.  Research on CCT since then has applied this methodology for several reasons:

#Large item banks tend to be calibrated with IRT
#This allows more accurate specification of the parameters
#By using the item response function for each item, the parameters are easily allowed to vary between items.

===Detection of anomalous medical outcomes===
[[David Spiegelhalter|Spiegelhalter]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/7.full.pdf Risk-adjusted sequential probability ratio tests: application to Bristol, Shipman and adult cardiac surgery Spiegelhalter, D. et al ''Int J Qual Health Care'' vol 15 7-13 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that SPRT can be used to monitor the performance of doctors, surgeons and other medical practitioners in such a way as to give early warning of potentially anomalous results. In their 2003 paper, they showed how it could have helped identify [[Harold Shipman]] as a murderer well before he was actually identified.

==Extensions==

===MaxSPRT===
More recently, in 2011, an extension of the SPRT method called Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MaxSPRT) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/07474946.2011.539924 | volume=30 | title=A Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test for Drug and Vaccine Safety Surveillance | journal=Sequential Analysis | pages=58–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced.  The salient feature of MaxSPRT is the allowance of a composite, one-sided alternative hypothesis, and the introduction of an upper stopping boundary.  The method has been used in several medical research studies &lt;ref&gt;2nd to last paragraph of section 1: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07474946.2011.539924 A Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test for Drug and Vaccine Safety Surveillance Kulldorff, M. et al ''Sequential Analysis: Design Methods and Applications'' vol 30, issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18588">'''Sex after pregnancy''' is often delayed for several weeks or months, and may be difficult and painful for women. Injury to the [[perineum]] or surgical cuts ([[episiotomy]]) to the [[vagina]] during [[childbirth]] can cause [[sexual dysfunction]]. Sexual activity other than [[sexual intercourse]] is possible sooner, but some women experience a prolonged loss of sexual desire after giving birth, which may be associated with [[postnatal depression]]. Common issues that may last more than a year after birth are greater desire by the man than the woman, and a worsening of the woman's body image.&lt;ref name=pastore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pastore|first=L|author2=Owens A |author3=Raymond C |year=2007|title=Postpartum sexuality concerns among first-time parents from one U.S. academic hospital|journal=J Sex Med|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell/International Society for Sexual Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=115–23|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118496050/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00379.x|pmid=17087807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olsson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsson|first=Ann|author2=Martina Lundqvist |author3=Elisabeth Faxelid |author4=Eva Nissen |year=2005|title=Women's thoughts about sexual life after childbirth: focus group discussions with women after childbirth|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell/Nordic College of Caring Science|volume=19|issue=4|pages=381–7|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118652876/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6712.2005.00357.x|pmid=16324063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fatal [[air embolism]], when air enters the bloodstream, can occur due to sex shortly after childbirth before the [[placenta]]l bed has healed, particularly if the woman's knees are pressed against her chest, but this is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batman|first=PA|author2=Thomlinson J |author3=Moore VC |author4=Sykes R |year=1998|title=Death due to air embolism during sexual intercourse in the puerperium|journal=Postgrad Med J|volume=74|issue=876|pages=612–3|doi=10.1136/pgmj.74.876.612|pmid=10211360|pmc=2361003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/06/science/deaths-linked-to-sex-after-childbirth.html|title=Deaths Linked to Sex After Childbirth|last=Gilbert|first=Susan|date=6 October 1998|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; More common complications of having sex early after pregnancy are tears to incisions and infection of the uterus.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Reduced libido==

Dissatisfaction with the sexual relationship a year after childbirth is associated with a lack of sex early in pregnancy as well as older ages of women, but not with factors relating to pregnancy or birth.&lt;ref name=vanbrummen/&gt;

==Treatment==

A '''Sex education curriculum''' is a [[sex education]] program encompassing the methods, materials, and assessments exercised to inform individuals of the issues relating to [[human sexuality]], including human [[sexual anatomy]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[sexual intercourse]], [[reproductive health]], emotional relations, [[reproductive rights]] and responsibilities, [[abstinence]], [[birth control]], and other aspects of [[human sexual behavior]]. Common [[sex education]] curricula include an abstinence-only approach, as well as a comprehensive approach, implemented in academia via the [[Internet]], peer education, visual media, games, health care organizations, and school instruction.

==European Union==

===Purpose===
The purpose of [[sexuality education]] curriculum in [[Europe]] is to facilitate [[adolescents]] to gain knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual behavior, thus preventing them from [[sexually transmitted infections]], including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]], teenage or unwanted pregnancies, and from domestic and [[sexual violence]], contributing to a greater society.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt; While European educators and policy makers recognize the benefits of sexuality education as being essential in the realm of [[sexual health]], the content and approach of the curriculum have undergone significant changes over time and differ among each European country.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"/&gt; Influenced by [[politics]], as well as social and religious movements, European educators and policy makers recognize the struggle to find common criteria of sexuality education curriculum.

===Common Sex Education Curricula===
Researchers identify the most common delivery of [[sexuality education]] curriculum as being through a [[biology]], relationship, and ideological focus.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} In this form of curriculum, practiced through a moral and informative approach by a teacher’s instruction, attention is directed towards the reproductive and physical aspects of [[sexuality education]] rather than the emotional and social aspects. While this approach is identified as the most common form of [[sexuality education]] in [[Europe]], [[Europe]] is not limited to this practice. With a total of twenty seven countries within the [[European Union]], a wide variety of practices are implemented in an attempt to address and/or ignore [[sexuality education]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} European policy makers and educators recognize the need for an implementation of an ideal curriculum for European countries to adopt, while distinguishing the political, social, and religious movements that hinder this action.

===The Safe Project===
The Safe Project was introduced by a coalition of European health organizations including the IPPF European Network, [[WHO]] Regional Office for Europe, and [[Lund University]], in 2004 in response to European policy makers and educators speaking out about the political, social, and religious struggles encountered when implementing [[sexuality education]] curriculum in [[Europe]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} The SAFE project conducted extensive research, implemented advocacy, engaged the youth, and created a greater recognition among public health organizations of the sexual rights of European youth as well as the creation of a model curriculum, providing an outline of the ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum to be practiced within the [[European Union]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} This model of [[sexuality education]] curriculum was charted in a ninety eight page product entitled ''The Reference Guide to Sexuality Education in Europe'', selling thousands of copies to public health organizations and journals, as well as various books within academia.

===The Model Sex Education Curricula===
The ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum within the [[European Union]], as proposed by the SAFE Project, is one that would be provided for varying ages of students, from the primary to the secondary level.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} A multi-dimensional staff including public health professionals, school instructors with knowledge in the sciences, and [[non-governmental organizations]], would be responsible for providing instruction in an interactive approach.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Educators recognize the benefits of health organizations and agencies not only as offering a more emotional and social approach to [[sexuality education]], but also expertise in recognizing issues among youth such as indications of [[sexual abuse]], [[sexually transmitted diseases]], and [[pregnancy]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Similarly, [[non-government organizations]](NGOs) provide students as well as the public with private counseling, sexuality seminars, public health campaigns, as well as peer-led informational groups, in which they are able to step outside of a strictly lecture and informational curriculum in [[sexuality education]] and accommodate the personal needs of European youth.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} While the ideal curriculum would be altered to accommodate the needs of its audience, its goal is to inform students on the topic of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], raising awareness and therefore allowing students to make healthier decisions in regards to sexuality and relationship activity as well as European youth distinguishing their sexual rights.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Younger audiences within the primary setting would be instructed by their classroom teacher in areas of [[puberty]], sexual development, and [[bullying]] while secondary audiences would be instructed by a multi-dimensional staff in the topical areas of [[racism]], [[homophobia]], [[sexual violence]], [[abstinence]], [[safe sex]], [[sexually transmitted diseases]], [[pregnancy]] and [[contraceptives]], as well as the biological, emotional, and social effects of sexuality.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

===Complications===
Several complications are associated with the implementation of an ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum including the area and diversity of each European country, variances in political and religious views, and a lack of sustainability. 
The area in which a country is located can affect religious and political beliefs, as well as resources and access to [[health education]], similarly the idea of diversity and the exposure to information and resources as well.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}
[[Politics]] and [[religion]] are two controversial topics that both have strong oppositions to [[sexuality education]]. With strong oppositions and public protests, political and religious affiliated organizations voice their negative opinions of a [[sexuality education]] curriculum that informs youth of sexual resources and options concerning [[contraception]] and [[abortion]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} With [[sexuality education]] not being mandatory in all twenty seven countries of the [[European Union]] and the controversial opposition of political and religious organizations, policy makers are unable to make an ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum concrete. 
A lack of sustainability within [[sexuality education]] curriculum is also an issue addressed by European policy makers and educators. Upon a country acknowledging the benefits, as well as a need for [[sexuality education]], they implement the ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum in which they see positive results in the decline of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] as well as teenage and unplanned pregnancies.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Upon government officials recognizing the positive results of the curriculum, the program is eliminated due to the significant improvements and the mindset that the problem is fixed and therefore the curriculum is no longer needed. With governmental cuts in [[sexuality education]] programs as well as the funding provided for those programs, policy makers and educators face great difficulty in the implementation of a continent-wide curriculum.

===Corrupted Children===

A child's mindset is shaped in numerous ways whether it is from their:
*parents
*environment
*experiences
As they grow, sex education will become a topic in their life that they will be curious about. Depending on how they are raised, they will have many questions or no questions at all. This article explains sexual innocence and how children flourish as adults.

Article ''[http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1751-9020.2011.00436.x?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=onlinelibrary.wiley.com&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED Sexuality Education in the United States:Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide]'' states that:
 
"Sexuality education debates and policy routinely posit young people as categorically less
able, less intelligent, and less responsible than their adult counterparts. In the United
States, young people’s relationships are often denigrated as no more than puppy love,
their sexual desires simply signs of raging hormones, and their sexual behaviors transgressions
to control. Within this adultist framework, young people are at their best when
sexually innocent. At their most vulnerable, they are on the verge of succumbing to sexual
danger; and, at their most corrupting, they are the source of significant risks to others."

====Australia====
The [[Victorian Government]] (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981.[https://archive.org/stream/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation#page/n0/mode/1up] The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable [[Norman Lacy]] MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979-1982.

A ''Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education'' was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame [[Margaret Blackwood]]; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The Council had three major functions:
# 1. to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations'Education in schools;
# 2. to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# 3. to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the ''Special Services Division'' of the ''Education Department of Victoria'' and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of ''Health and Human Relations Education''.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as Government policy.

====Canada====

A [http://sex-edu.ca/catalogue/ catalog of Canadian sex education films], ranging from 1953 to 2012, was recently compiled by researchers at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sex-edu.ca/|title = Ideology and Inequality in Canadian Sex Education Films|date = 2013|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = McLean|first = Shauna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sidestream smoke''' is [[smoke]] which goes into the air directly from a burning [[cigarette]], [[cigar]], or [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]].&lt;ref name="Sidestream Smoke"&gt;[gage.he.net/~cheforg/uploads/.../grat_updates_6-9_sidestream.pdf,"Sidestream Smoke."&lt;/ref&gt; Sidestream smoke is the main component (around 85%) of [[second-hand smoke]] (SHS), also known as [[Environmental Tobacco Smoke]] (ETS) or [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |title=Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace |journal=Current Intelligence Bulletin |volume=54 |issue= |pages= |date=June 1991 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/91108_54.html#Reports }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical constituents of sidestream smoke are different from those of directly inhaled ("mainstream") smoke. Sidestream smoke has been classified as a Class A [[carcinogen]] by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].

==Contents==
Like mainstream smoke, sidestream tobacco smoke is made up of many components including [[carbon monoxide]], [[tar]], [[nicotine]], [[ammonia]], [[benzene]], [[cadmium]] and [[4-aminobiphenyl]].&lt;ref name=Swan07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swan GE, Lessov-Schlaggar CN |title=The effects of tobacco smoke and nicotine on cognition and the brain |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=259–73 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17690985 |doi=10.1007/s11065-007-9035-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernert10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernert JT, Pirkle JL, Xia Y, Jain RB, Ashley DL, Sampson EJ |title=Urine concentrations of a tobacco-specific nitrosamine carcinogen in the U.S. population from secondhand smoke exposure |journal=Cancer Epidemiol.

Children's Environmental Health Centers, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  http://www.epa.gov/ncerqa/childrenscenters/smoke.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other compounds found in sidestream smoke are: [[vinylchloride]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]], [[acrolein]], [[acetaldehyde]], [[formaldehyde]], [[catechol]], [[cresol]], [[hydroquinone]], [[lead]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]], [[nitric oxide]], [[phenol]], [[styrene]], [[toluene]], and [[butane]].  Exposure to sidestream smoke yields higher concentrations of these compounds as well as increased concentrations of [[carboxyhemoglobin]], nicotine, and [[cotinine]] in the blood. When comparing sidestream and mainstream condensate, sidestream has 2–6 times more condensate per gram than mainstream smoke.&lt;ref name=Swan07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernert10/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncerqa/&gt; Due to the incomplete combustion process responsible for the creation of sidestream smoke, there may be exposure to higher concentrations of carcinogens than are typically inhaled directly.

==Risks==
There are over 250 toxins and carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The risks of developing [[lung cancer]], [[brain tumor]]s, and acute myeloid [[leukemia]] and the incidence of [[heart disease]] and [[benign]] [[respiratory diseases]] increase with the inhalation of sidestream smoke.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;[Johnston, Lorraine (2001). ''Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment &amp; Options'' O'Reilly, Sebastopol, CA. {{ISBN|0-596-50002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the chance of developing [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]] also increases with the inhalation of sidestream smoke.

Evidence has shown that sidestream smoke may be more harmful, per gram, than mainstream smoke.&lt;ref name=Schick05&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schick | first=S |author2=Glantz S  |title=Philip Morris toxicological experiments with fresh sidestream smoke: more toxic than mainstream smoke |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=396–404 |date =December 2005 | pmid =16319363 |doi=10.1136/tc.2005.011288 | pmc=1748121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sidesmoke is inhaled in far lesser amounts than in people who smoke tobacco.

The relative risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] is 1.2–1.3 with exposure to sidestream smoke due the cyanide present in the smoke.  There is also evidence that sidestream smoke causes negative effects in children, both behaviorally and cognitively.  One study found that higher levels of cotinine in children were correlated with a decreased ability to perform in reading and math.&lt;ref name=Swan07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Background and environmental exposures to cyanide in the United States." Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Page 2–8. http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp8-c2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors such as age, gender and different occupations put a person at risk for [[bladder cancer]] - smoking is the only other known risk.  [[4-aminobiphenyl]] (4-ABP) is an integral component in tobacco smoke, as well as a risk factor for bladder cancer.  Sidestream smoke puts individuals at an increased risk of bladder cancer because the 4-ABP concentrations are over ten times that of mainstream smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Hemelrijck MJ, Michaud DS, Connolly GN, Kabir Z |title=Secondhand smoking, 4-aminobiphenyl, and bladder cancer: two meta-analyses |journal=Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=1312–20 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19336562 |doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-0613 |url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19336562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Health consequences of tobacco use among women." Women and Smoking.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pg. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social effects==
A non-smoker who is inhaling sidestream or second-hand smoke has a 30% greater risk of getting lung cancer at some point in their lives.&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite book |author=American Cancer Society |title=Lung Cancer: What You Need to Know—Now |publisher=American Cancer Society/Health Promotions |location=Atlanta GA |year=2007 |isbn=0-944235-69-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to second hand or sidestream smoke has been associated with people who have not smoked before.

The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates sidestream smoke causes approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths and 62,000 deaths from heart disease in non-smokers every year in the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Jimmie H. |title=Environmental Tobacco Smoke: An Analysis of State and Local Policies To Reduce Exposure |year=2004 |id=U916087 |url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/6697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
A child's exposure to contaminants in the air can have detrimental health effects including heightened risk of respiratory tract infections, increased likelihood of childhood [[asthma]],  behavioural problems and reduced [[neurocognitive]] abilities.  Exposure to mainstream and sidestream smoke in childhood poses an increased risk of [[coughing]], [[wheezing]], and [[mucus]] production.  Studies on rats have shown that those who were exposed to sidestream smoke while in utero and following the period directly after, had differences in airway sensitivity in comparison to those that had been exposed to sidestream smoke only while in utero or only following the period after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang L, Pinkerton KE |title=Air pollutant effects on fetal and early postnatal development |journal=Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=144–54 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17963272 |doi=10.1002/bdrc.20097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Health consequences of tobacco use among women." Women and Smoking.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pg 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mbulo L |title=Changes in Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Among Youth in Nebraska, 2002–2006 |journal=Prev Chronic Dis |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=A84 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18558034 |pmc=2483572 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2008/Jul/07_0090.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test tubes==
A reduction in [[glutathione]] levels was observed following exposure to sidestream smoke in vitro.  Glutathione is an [[antioxidant]] which resides in the lung after development.  Exposure to sidestream smoke for as little as twenty minutes can lead to an increase in contaminant particles within human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC).  Cells exposed to sidestream smoke experienced [[oxidative stress]], which further allowed for [[DNA damage]] as well as [[cell transformation]] and an uncontrolled [[cell proliferation]].  Such DNA [[mutation]]s and uncontrolled cell division resulting from exposure to sidestream smoke may result in cancerous [[tumours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faux SP, Tai T, Thorne D, Xu Y, Breheny D, Gaca M |title=The role of oxidative stress in the biological responses of lung epithelial cells to cigarette smoke |journal=Biomarkers |volume=14 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=90–6 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19604067 |doi=10.1080/13547500902965047 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13547500902965047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp8-c2.pdf |chapter=2.1 Background and environmental exposures to cyanide in the United States |title=Toxicological Profile for Cyanide |publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |date=July 2006 |pages=4 (in PDF) |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=72&amp;tid=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicological experiments==
During the 1980s the [[Philip Morris Tobacco Company]] carried out research on sidestream smoke at the Institut für Biologische Forschung, although this was not voluntarily published.  This study found that sidestream smoke is nearly four times more toxic than mainstream smoke per metric gramme.  They also found that sidestream condensate was nearly three times more toxic than mainstream smoke as well as 2–6 times more tumourigenic per gram than mainstream condensate when applied to the skin of a mouse; results also showed that sidestream smoke hinders an animal's ability to reach a weight that is considered normal.  The research team concluded that the only way to protect oneself from sidestream smoke was to be in smoke-free public places and workspaces.&lt;ref name=Schick05/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">The '''surgical sieve''' is a thought process in [[medicine]]. It is a typical example of how to organise a structured examination answer for [[medical students]] and [[physician]]s when they are challenged with a question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.bmj.com/back_issues/0602/education/ed6.html sBMJ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a way of constructing answers to questions from [[patients]] and their relatives in a logical manner, and structuring articles and reference texts in medicine. Some textbooks put emphasis on using the surgical sieve as a basic structure of [[diagnosis]] and management of illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Oral diagnosis - the clinician's guide, W. Birnbaum, S. M. Dunne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Aird's Companion in Surgical Studies (3rd edn). K. Burnand, A. Young, J. Lucas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surgical Talk: Revision In Surgery, A. Goldberg, G. Stansby&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medicine and Surgery: a concise textbook, G. Kendall, K.Y. Shiu, S. L. Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingmedicine.com Thinking Medicine: Structure Your Knowledge for Success in Medical Exams, C. Koppel, A. Naparus]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Although there are several versions around the world with slight variations, the surgical sieve usually consist of the following types of process in the human body in any particular order:

* [[Congenital]]
* Acquired
** [[Vascular disease|Vascular]]
** [[Infection|Infective]]
** [[Physical trauma|Trauma]]tic
** [[Autoimmune disease|Autoimmune]]
** [[Metabolism|Metabolic]]
** [[Inflammation|Inflammatory]]
** [[Neurological]]
** [[Neoplasm|Neoplastic]]
** [[Degenerative disease|Degenerative]]
** [[Environmental disease|Environmental]]
** [[Idiopathic|Unknown]]
A more extensive, and perhaps more concise mechanism of employing the surgical sieve is using the mnemonic MEDIC HAT PINE:
* Metabolic (conditions relating to metabolism, biochemistry, and the like)
* Endocrinological (conditions relating to the various secretory systems within the body)
* Degenerative (conditions relating to age-related destruction of tissue, or stress-related destruction of tissue)
* Inflammatory/Infective (conditions that primarily present in a way that involves the profane activation of the immune system)
* Congenital (conditions present at birth)
* Haematological (conditions relating to the blood system, in one way or another)
* Autoimmune (conditions relating to the inappropriate activation of the immune system, in one of many ways)
* Traumatic (conditions relating to a physical response between two or more objects)
* Psychological/Neurological (conditions relating to the nervous system, in one way or another – whether that be the CNS or the PNS)
* Idiopathic/iatrogenic (conditions without a known cause, or without a known cause outside of medical intervention)
* Neoplastic (conditions relating to cancers)
* Environmental (conditions relating to exposures, and dose-response relationships thereof)

== Examples ==
What are the causes of an acute [[Mental confusion|confusional state]] in a patient?
# Treatment induced: [[polypharmacy]], sedatives, analgesics, steroids, drug withdrawal
# Vascular: [[stroke]], [[Transient ischemic attack|TIA]], [[vascular dementia]]
# Inflammatory: infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome
# Traumatic: head injury, [[Intracranial hemorrhage]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]
# Autoimmune: thyroid disease
# Metabolic: [[electrolyte imbalance]], [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]], [[hypoglycaemia]], [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone|SIADH]]
# Infective: [[sepsis]], local infection
# Neoplastic: [[brain tumour]], [[carcinomatosis]]
# Degenerative: [[Alzheimer's Disease]], [[dementia]]

What are the causes of [[splenomegaly]]?
# Idiopathic: [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]]
# Vascular: [[portal vein obstruction]], [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]], [[haemoglobinopathies]] ([[Sickle-cell disease]], [[thalassemia]])
# Infective: [[AIDS]], [[mononucleosis]], [[septicaemia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[brucellosis]], [[malaria]], [[infective endocarditis]]
# Traumatic: [[haematoma]], [[wikt:rupture|rupture]]
# Autoimmune: [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]]
# Metabolic: [[Gaucher's disease]], [[mucopolysaccharidoses]], [[amyloidosis]], [[Tangier disease]]
# Inflammatory: [[sarcoidosis]]
# Neoplastic: [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]], [[metastases]], [[myeloproliferative disorder]]s

== Pathologic Basis Of Disease ==
Robbins ''Pathologic Basis Of Disease&lt;ref&gt;Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, R. S. Cotran, V. Kumar, T. Collins&lt;/ref&gt;'' is an internationally used reference textbook in [[pathology]]. Its chapters under the heading 'General Pathology' can be considered to be a version of the surgical sieve:

3. Acute and chronic ''inflammation''&lt;br /&gt;
4. Tissue Repair&lt;br /&gt;
5. ''Hemodynamic'' Disorders&lt;br /&gt;
6. ''Genetic'' Disorders&lt;br /&gt;
7. Diseases of ''Immunity''&lt;br /&gt;
8. ''Neoplasia''&lt;br /&gt;
9. ''Infectious Diseases''&lt;br /&gt;
10. ''Environmental and Nutritional'' Pathology

==In popular culture==
The surgical sieve is frequently used by [[Gregory House]], who is a physician in the TV series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox.com/house/ FOX Broadcasting Company: House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523030504/http://www.fox.com/house/ |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to diagnose the rare diseases that his patients are suffering from. In some episodes various forms of the surgical sieve are scribbled on to House's whiteboard while his team struggle to diagnose difficult cases. In the episode [[Paternity (House)|'Paternity']] the mnemonic 'MIDNIT' is used to run through the sieve (metabolic, inflammation, degenerative, neoplastic, infection, trauma).

{{nihongo|'''Yae Ibuka'''|井深八重|Ibuka Yae}} ( October 23, 1897 –  May 15, 1989) was a Japanese nurse who worked with patients suffering from leprosy. She was diagnosed as having leprosy, and hospitalized at [[Koyama Fukusei Hospital]] in 1919. It proved a misdiagnosis three years later, but she was deeply impressed by Drouart de Lézey, the director of the hospital, and was determined to work as a nurse with leprosy patients. In 1961, she was awarded the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]].

==The pronunciation of Koyama Fukusei Hospital==
*"Kohyama Fukusei Hospital" or  "K&amp;#333;yama Fukusei Hospital". Koyama Fukusei Hospital is described in the reference&lt;ref&gt;120 years of Koyama Fukusei Hospital(2009), Koyama Fukusei Hospital.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Koyama Fukusei Hospital]]

==Life==
On 23 October 1897 she was born in Taipei, Formosa (now [[Taiwan]]) as a daughter of a congressman, Hikosaburo Ibuka. She graduated from Doshisha Women's College(now University), and she was teaching English at [[Nagasaki]], when she developed a skin change, which was diagnosed as a sign of leprosy. She was hospitalized at Koyama Fukusei Hospital without knowing the diagnosis. The diagnosis was shocking to her. Since her disease did not progress, she sought the diagnosis of Prof. [[Keizo Dohi]] of [[Tokyo University]] in 1922. Leprosy was denied. Observing the director of the hospital, she was determined to work for leprosy patients and became a nurse. In 1923, she became the only one qualified nurse at the hospital. She had remained the chief nurse at the hospital until 6 April 1978, when she became the honorary chief nurse. Her dedication to leprosy patients was highly appreciated. She became the first president of Japan Catholic Nurses' Association. She died on 15 May 1989, one day before the 100th year anniversary of the Koyama Fukusei Hospital. On May 16, she was given a special award by Princess Takamatsu (Kikuko) of Japan.

==Honors==
*In 1959, she was given the [[Order of St. Sylvester]] by [[Pope John XXIII]].
*In 1961, she was given the Florence Nightingale Medal.
*In 1977, she was given the Asahi Social Welfare Award.

==Relatives==
*[[Masaru Ibuka]] of [[Sony]] was her remote relative.
